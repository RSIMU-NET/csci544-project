This situation poses dangers to law enforcement officers, visitors, and employees and damages fragile natural resources. Rising illegal activity on these federal lands results from the Border Patrol's strategy to deter illegal entry by concentrating resources in populated areas--thus shifting illegal traffic to more remote federal lands, where Border Patrol has placed fewer resources. Although the problem is less acute along the Canadian border, land management agency officials in Washington are concerned that as the Border Patrol increases resources in populated areas, more illegal traffic will shift to remote federal lands. Officials from the five land management agencies believe their resource levels have not kept pace with increases in illegal border activities on their lands. Agencies have sought more federal funds to address these problems and have received varying levels of law enforcement staffing and resource increases. According to Office of Management and Budget representatives, agency funding is mission-driven. Thus, land management agencies' proposals for certain border projects have not been included in the administration's fiscal year 2005 budget because they were considered to be more in keeping with the border security mission of the Border Patrol. At the national level, interagency coordination of strategic plans and activities among Border Patrol and land management agencies is minimal regarding the Mexican and Canadian borders. Thus, limited funds may not be used most efficiently, and the impact of one agency's actions on another agency may not be considered. As of May 2004, the Border Patrol had not issued detailed plans to ensure that interagency coordination occurs, nor had it coordinated with land management officials regarding funding for infrastructure and technology improvements. Some coordination had occurred at the field level, as officials from the various agencies had begun meeting to improve operations and to share threat assessments in Arizona."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Enhancing the security of the nation\u2019s borders with Mexico and Canada  has emerged as a significant policy issue.

Comprehensive data on drug  seizures are not readily available, in part because law enforcement officers  from multiple agencies, including land management agencies and the  Border Patrol, make seizures on federal lands. Nevertheless, information  we obtained regarding drug seizures indicates a significant level of illegal  activity.

Employees  and visitors have been run off the road by smugglers traveling at high  speeds. Certain federal lands can no longer be used safely by the public or  federal employees, according to a 2002 report on the impacts of  undocumented aliens crossing federal lands in Arizona, due to the  significance of smuggling illegal aliens and controlled substances in the  United States.

In the Tucson sector, the  number of deaths associated with illegal crossings has been increasing  annually since fiscal year 1999, when 29 such deaths were recorded. The  majority of these immigrants succumbed to dehydration and heat  exposure in remote stretches of Arizona\u2019s western desert, often during the  harsh summer months.", "Illegal border activity on federal lands not only threatens people, but  endangered species and the land, itself. Illegal aliens and smugglers have  created hundreds of new trails and roads while crossing borderlands (see  figs. 3 and 4), and in doing so have destroyed cactus and other sensitive  vegetation that can take decades to recover, including habitat for  endangered species, according to a report on the impacts of  undocumented aliens crossing federal lands. These roads and trails  disturb wildlife, cause soil compaction and erosion, and can impact stream  bank stability. According to the report, vehicles abandoned by smugglers  are routinely found on federal lands and are not only expensive to remove,  but towing them from remote areas can result in additional resource  damage (see fig. 5). Tons of trash and human waste are left behind each  year, affecting wildlife, vegetation, and water quality. According to the  Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, located along Arizona\u2019s Mexican border, illegal  border crossers left behind close to 4,500 abandoned vehicles in fiscal year  2002 and an estimated 4 million pounds of trash each year as they crossed  over the lands (see fig. 6). According to the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation  Police Department, it removed over 7,000 such vehicles in 2003.

Land management law enforcement  officials told us that responding to increasing levels of illegal drug  smuggling and border crossings into Arizona have diverted their staff from  more traditional law enforcement activities, such as routine patrols, traffic  control, and wildlife enforcement activities.", "Finally, illegal border activity is affecting federal lands beyond those  immediately along the border and creating law enforcement challenges  there. For example, a Bureau of Land Management property we visited in  Arizona, Ironwood Forest National Monument, sits more than 60 miles  north of the Mexican border, adjacent to the northeast boundary of the  Tohono O\u2019odham Indian Reservation, yet Bureau officials told us it shares  many of the border-related problems of federal lands right on the border.  (See fig. 2.) Bureau officials told us that as a result of one officer being  nearly run over by illegal aliens in vehicles, as well as other assaults on  officers, the Bureau requires that officers travel in patrol teams (two  vehicles) to help ensure their safety. The monument\u2019s vulnerable  ecosystem, with over 600 animal and plant species\u2014some of them  endangered\u2014has been damaged by illegal border traffic. According to  Bureau officials, smugglers and other illegal aliens in route from Mexico  have established more than 50 illegal roads through the monument that  damage plants. In addition, the illegal aliens and smugglers have  abandoned about 600 vehicles each year and leave behind waste that  creates biohazards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Attribute Increased Illegal Activity on Federal Lands in Arizona to Border Patrol\u2019s Strategy", "paragraphs": ["According to land management agency and Border Patrol officials, the  increased drug trafficking and illegal immigration on federal lands in  Arizona, and the challenges they present for law enforcement, are a  consequence of the Border Patrol\u2019s increased enforcement efforts to deter  illegal entry along other parts of the Arizona border. In fiscal year 1995, the  Border Patrol began increasing the number of agents and resources it  deployed to its Tucson sector in Arizona. From fiscal years 1993 to 2004,  the number of Border Patrol agents grew more than sixfold\u2014from about  280 to about 1,770 agents\u2014in keeping with its strategy of prevention  through deterrence. In addition to deploying more agents, the Border  Patrol installed fencing, lighting, and remote video surveillance system  sites to deter and detect illegal entry. The Border Patrol focused these  resources primarily in more populated areas with a history of illegal  traffic\u2014first in the area around the Nogales, Arizona, port of entry, and  later, in the areas surrounding the Douglas and Naco, Arizona, ports of  entry, in response to increased illegal alien apprehensions (see fig. 2). The  strategy has resulted in a reduction in illegal alien apprehensions in these  areas but, according to the Border Patrol, the Tucson sector continues to  experience the highest levels of illegal cross border activity of any sector  in the country. In 2003, agents in the Tucson sector apprehended about  366,000 illegal aliens attempting to cross the Arizona border.", "Land management agency and Border Patrol officials told us that as a  result of increased enforcement efforts in these areas, much of the illegal  traffic has shifted to federal lands, where Border Patrol resources are  fewer. Although the intent of the Border Patrol strategy is to eventually  deploy enough resources to deter illegal entry along the entire state  border, resources have yet to be concentrated on federal borderlands,  which comprise the majority of Arizona\u2019s border with Mexico. For  example, the strategy calls for installing barriers and fencing, where  appropriate, to deter illegal entry. Although the Border Patrol has installed  fencing along other sections of the state\u2019s border, the border along federal  lands remains virtually wide open or marked by barbed wire fencing that  is easily and frequently broken, as seen in figure 7. Furthermore, there are  fewer law enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents to patrol these  areas compared with other more populated parts of the border.  Consequently, according to land management agency and Border Patrol  officials, many undocumented aliens and smugglers who seek to enter the  country illegally and evade detection have found remote, less-patrolled  and unrestricted federal lands increasingly attractive. These officials are  also concerned that would-be terrorists could enter this country  undetected through federal lands.", "This is not the first time the implementation of the Border Patrol\u2019s strategy  has shifted illegal activity to other locations. Part of the strategy has been  to shift illegal traffic to areas that are more remote and more difficult to  cross. In 1999, we reported that implementing the strategy and deploying  resources in traditionally high entry points like San Diego, California, and  El Paso, Texas, had several anticipated interim effects, including shifting  illegal alien apprehensions to other border locations. In 2001, we  reported that in implementing its strategy in other locations along the  Mexican border, the Border Patrol found many aliens risked injury and  death by trying to cross mountains, deserts, and rivers in attempting to  illegally enter the United States. At that time, officials told us that as traffic  shifted, they did not anticipate the sizable number that attempted to enter  through these harsh environments. We further reported that when the  Border Patrol\u2019s Tucson sector began increasing enforcement in Nogales,  Arizona, it anticipated illegal alien traffic would shift to Douglas, Arizona,  but at the time the sector did not have enough agents to simultaneously  build up its agent resources in both Nogales and Douglas. During our visit  to the sector in August 2003, Border Patrol officials told us that these areas  remain challenging with respect to deterring illegal entry.", "According to land management agency officials, they were unprepared for  the increased illegal border activity on their lands. They said the Border  Patrol did not coordinate with them when it began implementing its  strategy in Arizona. For example, the Border Patrol did not share its  deployment plans nor alert land management agencies that these  increased enforcement efforts in populated areas might have the effect of  shifting illegal activity onto federal lands. Border Patrol officials in the  Tucson sector told us they were surprised when their border strategy  resulted in so much illegal activity shifting to these federal lands; rather,  they had expected the remoteness and harsh conditions found across  much of these areas would deter illegal crossings. Border Patrol officials  told us that despite the \u201cgravity\u201d of problems on these federal lands, these  lands have not been the sector\u2019s priority. In keeping with its strategy, the  Border Patrol\u2019s priority has been to first focus on more populated areas  where there is more illegal traffic so that they can reduce the impacts of  illegal border activity on area residents.", "Border Patrol officials say they are taking steps to address some of the  effects of their strategy in Arizona. During the spring and summer of 2003,  the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona spearheaded a joint effort by state;  local; tribal; and federal agencies, including the Border Patrol and land  management agencies; to reduce the number of immigrants who die each  summer crossing the Arizona desert and cut crimes associated with  smuggling. As part of this effort, the Tucson sector temporarily moved  some of its agents and equipment to areas on or near several federal  borderland locations in the western desert region of Arizona\u2014Organ Pipe  Cactus National Monument, Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, and  the Tohono O\u2019odham Indian Reservation. In March 2004, as part of another  joint effort to control illegal immigration and reduce migrant deaths, the  Border Patrol announced plans to deploy 260 additional Border Patrol  agents to the Tucson sector, including temporarily assigning 60 agents  from other sectors for the summer months. According to a Border Patrol  official, some of these agents\u201460 on temporary assignment and 75 on  permanent assignment\u2014will be deployed to Arizona\u2019s western desert,  where the vast majority of land is federally owned or managed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Washington, Federal Lands Have Been Less Affected by Border Patrol Strategy, but Officials Are Concerned that Illegal Activity Will Increase", "paragraphs": ["Overall, evidence suggests federal lands on the Canadian border have not  been affected by the Border Patrol\u2019s strategy to the extent they have in  Arizona, where the Border Patrol has deployed much higher  concentrations of resources. For example, the level of illegal border  crossings in Washington pales in comparison to those in Arizona, based on  statewide illegal apprehension data, which the Border Patrol uses as one  measure of illegal activity. In 2003, the two Border Patrol sectors  responsible for Washington apprehended about 2,300 illegal aliens,  compared with about 422,000 illegal aliens apprehended in two Arizona   sectors. Likewise, according to a drug threat assessment of Washington  public lands in 2003, although there is smuggling of contraband across the  Canadian border through public lands in Washington, the level of activity  has resulted in very little impact to the environment. The Congressional  Research Service reported in 2003 that \u201cthe southern border has seen  more illegal activity over the years\u201d than the Canadian border.

In  Washington, this translates to an increase in the number of Border Patrol  agents stationed in two sectors by 155 agents over fiscal years 2002 and  2003. In addition, the Border Patrol installed additional ground sensors  and a remote video surveillance system covering 43 miles. Following a  similar strategy employed along the Mexican border, the additional agents  and technology improvements have generally been deployed to the more  populated areas near the ports of entry\u2014not on remote federal lands. In  addition, since September 11, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has  shored up enforcement efforts at ports of entry by increasing the number  of inspectors and deploying more technology. According to a Department  of the Interior official stationed on the Canadian border, increased staffing  and improvements in technology both at and near Canadian border ports  of entry appear to have forced smuggling activities to more remote  locations, such as the properties managed by Interior.", "Land management officials in Washington with whom we spoke expressed  concern that as enforcement efforts increase in populated areas along the  Canadian border, illegal activity\u2014particularly drug smuggling\u2014will  continue to shift onto the more remote federal lands. According to the  Interior official mentioned above, although only certain locations have  experienced an increase in smuggling activity, it is only a matter of time  before other Interior lands are affected, too. A Border Patrol official in  Washington explained that as a result of concentrating resources around  one port of entry, drug smugglers are searching for locations with the least  resistance and moving their activities onto nearby federal lands. National  Park Service and Forest Service law enforcement officials in Washington  were concerned that if enforcement resources continue to be deployed  both at and near ports of entry, remote locations\u2014like federal lands\u2014will  continue to see an increase in illegal activity.", "Park Service officials in Washington consider drug smuggling across the  Canadian border through federal lands to be a problem that shows little  sign of slowing. Law enforcement officers there are especially concerned  with the smuggling of high-quality marijuana grown in British Columbia  into the United States from Canada (see fig. 9). In addition, since the  September 11 terrorist attacks, the Congress and others have been  particularly concerned about the potential for terrorists to enter the  United States across the vast, largely unpatrolled, stretches of the  Canadian border. As the Congressional Research Service recently  reported, the southern border has seen more illegal activities over the  years, but there has been growing concern over the insufficient number of  personnel assigned to the Canadian border, the increasing level of illegal  activity that takes place there, and the potential for terrorists to sneak into  the United States across the Canadian border. In Washington, land  management law enforcement officers also voiced concerns that would-be  terrorists might enter the country through their federal lands. According to  the Washington public lands drug threat assessment, the potential threat  to national security is a grave concern because these borderlands serve as  smuggling routes for contraband, including drugs, weapons, and  currency.", "Land management agency and Border Patrol officials point out that a  limited law enforcement presence along the Canadian border has made it  difficult to assess the scope of crimes, notably drug smuggling, that occurs  on the border and on federal lands. The vast mountain ranges, waterways,  and often inaccessible terrain that cover much of the Canadian border  only adds to the difficulties quantifying the extent of the problem. In 2000,  the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported that the  Border Patrol could not accurately quantify how many illegal aliens and  drug smugglers it fails to apprehend because it lacked the resources to  monitor the Canadian border. Even with 1,000 Border Patrol agents along  the 4,000-mile Canadian border, the Border Patrol\u2019s presence is relatively  sparse compared with the Mexican border, where 9,700 agents patrol 1,900  miles."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Land Management Agencies Say Law Enforcement Resources for Borderlands Have Not Kept Pace with Illegal Activity", "paragraphs": ["Land management agencies have received varying levels of law  enforcement staffing and resource increases to address the effects of  illegal border-related activity. Officials from all five land management  agencies we reviewed said that staffing and resource levels have not kept  pace with the increases in illegal border activities affecting their lands and  have been insufficient to address the full impact of these activities. We did  not independently assess their proposals or the adequacy of the funds they  received. However, we discussed these proposals with representatives of  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\u2014the executive branch office  that helps prepare the federal budget. While they declined to comment on  specific budget decisions, they explained that the administration\u2019s budget  is a result of a deliberative process between agencies and OMB, during  which agencies decide how to prioritize limited resources.", "Between September 2001 and September 2003, regarding four of the five  land management agencies we reviewed, excluding Bureau of Indian  Affairs, officials estimated that their combined law enforcement staffing  levels declined by about 2 percent\u2014from an estimated 2,526 full-time  officers to 2,472 full-time officers nationwide. This included officers  stationed in the interior of the country as well as border locations. While  these four agencies collectively experienced a decline of 54 officers at the  national level, law enforcement staffing levels along the Mexican border  increased by about 25 officers, from an estimated 76 to 101 full-time  officers. Law enforcement staffing along the Canadian border increased by  about 6 officers, from an estimated 92 to 98 full-time officers for the four  agencies, combined. Thus, as of September 2003, these land management  agencies had about 200 law enforcement officers on the Mexican and  Canadian borders, combined. Bureau of Indian Affairs officials told us that  about 50 law enforcement officers were stationed on tribal lands  bordering Mexico in September 2001 compared to about 47 officers in  September 2003. Regarding officers stationed on tribal lands bordering  Canada, Bureau officials estimated 250 and 277 law enforcement officers,  respectively, over the same time period.", "Regarding the National Park Service, in 2000, the International Association  of Chiefs of Police (IACP) conducted a study that focused on the  responsibilities, capabilities, and requirements of the Park Service\u2019s law  enforcement officers and found the law enforcement function to be  understaffed and under-resourced. Its review of 35 national parks found  \u201cintolerable\u201d officer safety conditions and a diminishing capacity to  protect visitors and natural resources. As such, the study recommended  \u201can aggressive program of staff augmentation and resource leveraging  initiatives,\u201d including the addition of 615 full-time law enforcement  officers nationwide\u2014roughly the equivalent to the number of Park Service  officers who do not work year round. According to the study, replacing  these seasonal officers with full-time officers would almost triple the Park  Service\u2019s law enforcement capacity supplied by seasonal officers.", "Other assessments have focused on specific National Park Service  borderland properties. For example, in 2002, at the request of the House  Committee on Appropriations, the Park Service\u2014one of four land  management agencies that provided cost estimates\u2014estimated it would  need about $844,000 for law enforcement and safety and about $268,000  for maintenance and resource management to mitigate and prevent  environmental damage for 1 year caused by illegal immigrants crossing  through Park Service properties in southeast Arizona and to restore safe  public use and management of these lands. This estimate addressed the  needs of four Park Service properties affected by illegal border activity in  southeast Arizona, including one directly on the border. In another border  area of Arizona, a multiagency review board found that \u201cUnderstaffing of   has compromised employee and visitor safety,  and reduced the capability of the park to protect natural and cultural  resources.\u201d Along the Canadian border, the Park Service found in 2003  that one of its parks was staffed at about half of the level needed. Its needs  assessment, which included such elements as visitation patterns and  trends, criminal activity, and current staffing, concluded that the park  needed about 8 additional officers.", "In fiscal years 2003 and 2004, combined, the Park Service received an  increase of about $2.4 million for law enforcement and resource  protection at specific border parks along the Mexican and Canadian  borders. These funds were to support the total equivalent of 25 additional  full-time positions to be allocated among six parks along the Mexican  border and about 8 additional officers for one park along the Canadian  border. The administration\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget includes $1.5 million  to support 18 additional full-time law enforcement positions for six  Mexican border area parks and two Canadian border area parks.", "In 2000, in response to concerns over the noticeable deterioration of  natural resources from increased illegal border traffic at Organ Pipe  Cactus National Monument in Arizona, the National Park Service regional  office responsible for the park conducted a review of border-related  protection issues and concluded that increased staffing and a vehicle  barrier were needed. However, this project was not included in the Park  Service\u2019s official 5-year construction plan at that time. In 2002, before  action on the barrier was taken, a Park Service officer was shot and killed  in the line of duty in Organ Pipe. According to a Park Service official, the  agency subsequently raised the issue of funding for the vehicle barrier, and  a congressional conference report provided $7 million in fiscal year 2003  for the first phase of the project. The administration\u2019s fiscal year 2004  budget requested another $4.4 million for this project, which the Park  Service subsequently received. In its fiscal year 2004 budget justification,  the Park Service said it needed 32 miles of vehicle barrier to eliminate  illegal vehicle entry from Mexico, thereby improving the safety and  welfare of employees and visitors and allowing for the recovery of much  of the disturbed acreage. The administration\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget  request includes the final $6.6 million needed to complete this $18 million  construction project.", "Regarding the Fish and Wildlife Service, IACP also conducted a  nationwide study of 27 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System  (within the Fish and Wildlife Service) in 2000, and concluded that that an  increase in law enforcement officers, particularly full-time officers, was  justified. Only about 10 percent of the National Wildlife Refuge System\u2019s  602 officers were full-time, resulting in a workforce equivalent to 244 full- time officers. The report considered this level of staffing to be \u201cmodest\u201d at  a time when officer demands, including drug trafficking and illegal alien  activity, were increasing. In a study focusing on southeast Arizona, the  Fish and Wildlife Service estimated in 2002 that it would need about $1.8  million for law enforcement and safety expenditures and about $1.5  million for maintenance and resource management costs to mitigate and  prevent environmental damage for 1 year caused by illegal immigrants  crossing through three properties along the border in southeast Arizona  and to restore safe public use and management of these lands.", "The administration\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget request for the Fish and  Wildlife Service includes a request for an additional $3 million for the  National Wildlife Refuge System\u2019s law enforcement budget\u2014$900,000 of  which is identified for borderlands. However, according to an agency  official, this is half the amount the National Wildlife Refuge System said it  needed for border law enforcement. If approved, the official said these  funds will be used to hire five refuge officers for the Mexican border (four  to be deployed in Arizona) and two to support operations on the Gulf  Coast.", "National Wildlife Refuge System officials told us that they developed a  proposal to construct a vehicle barrier along the Mexican border of its  Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, immediately to the west of Organ  Pipe Cactus National Monument. Based on the experience of how the  Border Patrol\u2019s strategy resulted in a shift in illegal traffic in Arizona, the  Fish and Wildlife Service anticipates that once Organ Pipe\u2019s barrier is in  place, much of the park\u2019s illegal border traffic will be diverted to the  adjacent Cabeza Prieta refuge. Thus, to protect its own resources, the Fish  and Wildlife Service wants to extend the park\u2019s barrier onto its refuge and  has said it needs $2 million in fiscal year 2005 for planning and design\u2014the  first of three project phases. The Fish and Wildlife Service estimates the  project\u2019s total cost will be between $15 million and $26 million. The  administration\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget request does not include funds for  this project.", "In 2002, the Bureau of Land Management, at the request of the House  Committee on Appropriations, estimated it would need about $2.3 million  for law enforcement and safety expenditures and about $1.5 million for  maintenance and resource management costs to mitigate and prevent  environmental damage for 1 year caused by illegal immigrants crossing  through four properties along the border or affected by illegal border  activity in southeast Arizona and to restore safe public use and  management of these lands. As a result of these estimates, the House  Appropriations Committee provided $2 million in fiscal years 2003 and  2004, combined, to restore these lands. After further congressional action  and a rescission, the Bureau received about $1.5 million for these 2 years,  combined. According to the Bureau, it has used the funds primarily to  remove tons of trash and abandoned vehicles; to repair damaged fences,  gates, roads and washes resulting from illegal aliens and smugglers  crossing federal lands; and to increase security for crews working in  remote areas and to provide emergency care for those found in distress.", "In fiscal year 2004, the Bureau of Land Management also received $2  million to increase protection on its lands within 100 miles of the borders.  The Bureau is using the $2 million for, among other things, five additional  law enforcement officers\u2014four on the Mexican and one on the Canadian  border\u2014and to support those officers with vehicles, gear, and interagency  dispatch technology to better track the location of all officers in border  areas. According to an agency budget official, the Bureau has not received  the $1.5 million it proposed after the September 11 terrorist attacks for  increasing patrols on other remote public lands or other funding proposals  to upgrade and replace firearms and radios, and procure satellite  telephones and special equipment that would aid all officers, including  those along the borders. Agency officials told us that, as a result, they  continue to repair equipment that should be replaced. The administration\u2019s  fiscal year 2005 budget does not include any funding for the Bureau\u2019s  borderlands.", "Regarding law enforcement on tribal lands, the IACP held a summit in  2001 on improving safety and issued numerous recommendations that  included increasing funding for tribal law enforcement. That same year,  the National Institute of Justice issued a report citing existing research  that suggested tribes have relatively fewer officers compared to non- Indian communities, but that this comparison may underestimate needs  because the violent crime rate for tribal lands is about two and half times  the rate for the nation.", "Regarding tribal lands, the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation Police Department  estimated it spent about $3.4 million in fiscal year 2003 on activities  directly related to illegal border activity on its land. This included  processing drug smuggling cases, towing stolen vehicle abandoned by  smugglers, investigating deaths and homicides, and conducting autopsies.  According to Tohono O\u2019odham officials, the Nation wants to recoup these  costs, either through direct funding to the Nation, or through responsible  law enforcement agencies. The administration\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget  includes $1.4 million specifically for law enforcement for the Tohono  O\u2019odham Nation. According to Bureau of Indian Affairs officials, this  amount will not cover the annual cost of addressing the Nation\u2019s border- related problems. The officials also noted that the St. Regis Band of  Mohawk Indians of New York, located on the Canadian border, has  serious, longstanding illegal activity that is border-related. The St. Regis  Band of Mohawk Indians has said it needs $600,000 for its tribal police  department, but the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget does not  include such funding.", "The Forest Service estimated in 2002 that it would need about $2.6 million  for law enforcement and safety expenditures and more than $12 million  for maintenance and resource management costs to mitigate and prevent  environmental damage for 1 year caused by illegal immigrants crossing  through a national forest in southeast Arizona and to restore safe public  use and management of this property. Officials said they developed  funding proposals for, among other things, a border security coordinator,  on-site DHS liaisons for the Canadian and Mexican borders, and an image- based remote sensing system to be placed along national forest border  locations. However, the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget for the  Department of Agriculture does not include such funding.", "OMB representatives said that some of the funding land management  agencies have proposed has not been consistent with their missions. OMB  representatives explained that when considering agency requests for  funding, they focus on each agency\u2019s mission and how requests relate to  mission. OMB staff indicated that they view the construction of vehicle  barriers along federal properties to be primarily in keeping with the  Border Patrol\u2019s border security mission and generally not land  management agencies\u2019 mission. The administration\u2019s budgets for fiscal  years 2004 and 2005 requested funds for the National Park Service to  complete a vehicle barrier initially funded in fiscal year 2003 as specified  in the conference report to the Department of the Interior appropriations  act for 2003. However, the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget did not  request funds for the Fish and Wildlife Service to begin constructing a  similar vehicle barrier on its neighboring property. From the land  management agency officials\u2019 perspective, the distinction between border  security and resource protection is not always clear. In the case of  barriers, both the Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service consider  vehicle barriers for their Arizona properties necessary to carry out their  mission of protecting resources and people\u2014not to perform a border  security mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Border Strategies and Activities Are Not Well-Coordinated, but Efforts to Improve Are Underway", "paragraphs": ["Although enhancing the coordination of law enforcement activities along  the Mexican and Canadian borders is a goal of DHS at the department  level and of the Border Patrol, at the agency level, broad strategic  coordination and information sharing has been minimal.

According to Border Patrol officials, they plan to eventually add a  component to their strategic plan, which focuses on coordinating its  activities with land management agencies on federal borderlands.  However, as of May 2004, the Border Patrol strategic plan and  implementation plan were not yet issued.", "Federal land management agencies have stated the need for, and  importance of, enhancing the coordination of law enforcement activities  with DHS generally and Border Patrol in particular. For example, Interior\u2019s  May 2003 draft International Border Coordination Strategy emphasizes  that that coordination with DHS is vital, and states, \u201cDOI\u2019s [Department of  the Interior\u2019s] strategy of protecting the integrity of its borderlands  involves close cooperation with the Department of Homeland  Security\u2026.Overall, it is DOI\u2019s intention to work closely with all relevant  and affected parties in the formulation and implementation of a realistic,  responsive, and effective strategy that responds to the challenges  presented by illegal activities on its borderlands.\u201d", "In addition, an Agriculture Inspector General\u2019s report, dated January 2003,  emphasized cooperative efforts and concluded, \u201c\u2026the Forest Service  should coordinate with DHS to play a more active role in improving  security on the Nation\u2019s borders. Until DHS is fully staffed and operational,  the Forest Service needs to actively participate with U.S. Customs and the  U.S. Border Patrol in developing a cohesive, multiagency strategy for  securing U.S. borders. Such a strategy would make the most efficient use  of available Forest Service resources.\u201d Generally, Forest Service  headquarters and field officials agreed that a multiagency strategic  approach is vital to improving border security. However, DHS, Interior and  Agriculture officials told us that as of March 2004, agencies had not yet  coordinated their strategies or developed a broad interagency approach at  the national level to combat illegal activities along federal borderlands.", "Our review found several areas where coordination and information  sharing among Border Patrol and the land management agencies was  minimal at both the Mexican and Canadian borders. For example, in the  area of intelligence sharing, the Border Patrol did not coordinate with land  management agencies on some matters of concern to the agencies. For  example, while the Border Patrol has developed threat assessments in  2003 for areas along the Mexican and Canadian borders, many of which  include vast areas of federal lands, Border Patrol officials told us that they  have not shared these documents with the relevant land management  agencies, nor worked with them in developing these assessments. None of  the land management agency officials we interviewed during our audit site  visits to Arizona and Washington were aware of the existence of Border  Patrol\u2019s threat assessments, which included detailed assessments of their  respective lands. All these land management officials told us that they  would have liked to participate in the development of the threat  assessments of their lands so that they could be better informed of  intelligence related to incidents taking place on their lands and reports of  potential threats. Additionally, they believed that they had particular  knowledge of the terrain, infrastructure, and reports of illegal activities on  their own lands that might be relevant to the Border Patrol\u2019s threat  assessments. In addition, federal land management officials said that their  agencies\u2019 incident reports might have been useful to the Border Patrol in  preparing the various threat assessments.", "Moreover, Border Patrol officials responsible for the threat assessments  told us that they did not consult with any land management agencies in  developing the assessments and that they did not know of any Border  Patrol sector officials who had asked neighboring land management  agencies for input. Most of the threat assessments for sectors along the  Canadian and Mexican borders do not list land management law  enforcement agencies under their listing of law enforcement agencies in  their respective geographic areas. As one land management official  pointed out, in his opinion, this oversight is an indication that the Border  Patrol does not coordinate its activities with law enforcement agencies  and does not see them as full partners in federal law enforcement efforts.  When we asked about this omission, Border Patrol headquarters officials  told us that future iterations of the threat assessments will be more  inclusive of other federal law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction in  the areas of interest, including land management agencies. They added  that the land management agencies have valuable insights about  protecting border areas, and the Border Patrol would be willing to  coordinate with them in the future.", "In the area of funding, land management agencies did not coordinate the  funding, planning, and construction of an infrastructure project\u2014namely,  a vehicle barrier\u2014that could help protect neighboring federal properties.  National Park Service officials said that they were aware that constructing  a vehicle barrier along Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument would shift  more illegal traffic to their neighbors\u2014the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s  Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge to its west and the Tohono  O\u2019odham Indian Reservation to its east\u2014but did not inform these parties  of their plans to construct the barrier until after their plans were  underway. Similarly, the Park Service did not inform Forest Service  officials at the Coronado National Forest about Park Service plans to  construct a vehicle barrier at the Coronado National Memorial and that, as  result, illegal traffic would likely shift to the Coronado National Forest  (see fig. 10).", "According to Department of the Interior officials, the Park Service did not  adequately coordinate with officials from the parks\u2019 neighboring federal  lands, and the idea of developing a coordinated funding proposal for a  barrier that would extend onto neighboring federal lands was never  considered. In March 2004, in order to protect the Nation from increasing  border crime, the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation passed a resolution to support  the construction of a vehicle barrier extending from the adjacent Organ  Pipe property across the Nation\u2019s border with Mexico. Thus, as one land  management agency official pointed out, agencies are in effect proposing  one long barrier in a piecemeal manner. The official noted that all these  neighboring properties need protection, and the boundaries separating  them are arbitrary.", "OMB staff told us that they encourage agencies to coordinate funding  proposals with each other when programs or activities are closely related  to help ensure the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars. Although such  coordination is not mandated, they said they look favorably on such  efforts during the budget formulation process and would expect agencies  to coordinate interrelated projects along the borders in future budget  proposals.", "In the area of staffing, Border Patrol and land management agency officials  told us that they have never coordinated their deployment plans to explore  the possibility of staffing efficiencies. In Arizona, there has been very little  coordination or planning between the Border Patrol and land management  agencies, even as border agencies\u2019 staffing levels have increased in recent  years.

Agency officials involved in this effort told us that a congressional inquiry  regarding the Border Patrol\u2019s inability to access and effectively patrol  certain federal lands in Arizona was the primary impetus for these  interagency meetings. Department of the Interior officials told us they also  plan to hold meetings with land management agency and Border Patrol  officials at various Canadian border locations in the future. In addition, the  Border Patrol officials told us that they have sponsored meetings with  border tribal police departments in 2002 and 2003 to strengthen the law  enforcement partnerships on tribal lands adjacent to the Mexican and  Canadian borders.", "As a result of these interagency meetings, the Border Patrol and land  management agencies are working towards increasing Border Patrol\u2019s  access to environmentally sensitive federal lands and began a 1 year pilot  project in November 2003. The Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge,  which is located along the Arizona border and has critical habitat areas  but no designated wilderness areas, has struggled for several years to  combat illegal activities across its land, according to the refuge manager.  The Border Patrol is using all terrain vehicles and horse patrols as  alternative methods to patrol the refuge in environmentally sensitive areas.  After 1 year, this pilot project will be evaluated to see if it should be  continued or expanded. According to a refuge official, while the Border  Patrol has always had some presence on the refuge, the number of Border  Patrol agents on the land has increased since the pilot project began.", "To address issues regarding access to federally protected areas, such as  wilderness areas, the Interior Deputy Assistant Secretary for Law  Enforcement and Security, in February 2004, asked the department\u2019s  Solicitor to review various legal issues on a national scale regarding the  Border Patrol\u2019s access to federal lands. Currently, land managers use  applicable environmental regulations and statutes to determine access and  their interpretations can vary. Border Patrol officials told us the lack of  consistent determinations of their access to federally protected lands has  been frustrating. According to the Deputy Assistant Secretary, he has  asked for the Solicitor\u2019s guidance and legal opinion to assist Interior land  managers in developing a consistent, departmentwide approach when  responding to Border Patrol requests for increased access to protected  federal lands.", "In commenting on our draft report, Interior officials told us that the  Solicitor\u2019s Office had issued a letter to CBP\u2019s Office of the Chief Counsel in  May 2004 that addressed, in part, one of the legal issues raised by the  Deputy Assistant Secretary.  The letter outlined Border Patrol\u2019s statutory  authority to manage interdiction and related cross-border traffic issues on  federal lands in Arizona on a 60-foot strip along the international border  between the United States and Mexico.  However, Interior officials told us  that other issues involving Border Patrol access on federally protected  lands, such as wilderness areas and federal lands along the Canadian  border, are being handled on a case-by-case basis. A representative from  the Solicitor\u2019s Office explained that since the laws and regulations were  not the same for every federally protected land, determinations about the  extent of Border Patrol access to those federal lands can vary, and a  \u201ccommon legal blueprint\u201d is not possible.  For example, the representative  told us they were drafting three individual memorandums of  understanding between CBP and Interior regarding Border Patrol access  for three separate federal lands in Arizona.", "Interior and the Border Patrol have each designated border coordinators  to support interagency coordination efforts.

To help resolve land  management officials\u2019 environmental resource protection-related  concerns, Interior and Border Patrol coordinators have facilitated  meetings in the field with land management and Border Patrol officials in  Arizona. Forest Service officials have attended Interior and Border Patrol\u2019s  coordination meetings at the headquarters level, but have limited staff  available to participate in meetings, especially at the field level. Forest  Service officials told us that they believe these meetings are important,  and by not participating in them, they may be unaware of plans affecting  their lands.", "In addition, DHS officials, with the assistance of Interior officials, have  drafted a declaration of principles to guide interagency efforts to enhance  border security and control and prevent environmental degradation and  lessen the threat of danger on land managed by Interior caused by illegal  cross-border traffic. As stated in the December 2003 draft, DHS and  Interior will work together on legislative initiatives, regulations, and  funding initiatives to support mutual goals. An Interior official said the  declaration is intended to provide the national guidelines and that  probably officials in the field would develop more detailed and site- specific guidelines to direct interagency efforts in the field.

In order to allow the horses  in a wilderness area, the Border Patrol fed the horses a special diet to  ensure that the horses\u2019 manure would not introduce nonindigenous plant  species.

According to Border Patrol officials, as a result of these  agents camping out on tribal land during the summer months, the Nation  saw a 60-perecent decline in illegal activity and a 40-percent reduction in  medical cases referred to the Nation\u2019s hospital. This enforcement  approach proved less intrusive than the Border Patrol\u2019s more traditional  enforcement efforts.", "Despite these examples of coordination, land management agency officials  also told us about instances where coordination efforts could be improved  at the field level. For instance, one land management official told us that  significant officer and visitor safety concerns were raised when the Border  Patrol did not alert federal land management officials of an impending  special enforcement operation the Border Patrol executed on their land.  The special enforcement operation included armed and camouflaged  Border Patrol agents conducting clandestine surveillance operations on a  federal land without alerting the land management agency. After hearing  reports of suspicious activity, the land management law enforcement  officers approached the Border Patrol agents, fortunately without  incident. The land management agency official told us that both land  management agency employees and visitors could have potentially been at  risk because of this lapse in communication.", "Law enforcement officer and visitor safety concerns were also elevated  when land management officials were not notified of a Border Patrol  temporary checkpoint set up a short distance from a federal land near a  heavily used smuggling trail. As a result, illegal traffic was diverted into  other parts of the federal land, thus increasing potential encounters with  unsuspecting law enforcement officers. A land management official from  another agency told us that the Border Patrol did not coordinate when  planning the deployment of infrastructure such as towers for remote video  surveillance cameras on another federal land. The same official said that  they may have been able to help expedite the necessary environmental  requirements required to place these infrastructure on or near federally  protected lands."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the enormous law enforcement challenges along the borders, the  increased awareness about the threat of terrorists entering the country,  and the need to maximize the effectiveness of limited government  resources, it is critical that the Border Patrol and land management  agencies closely coordinate their efforts to ensure that appropriate  strategies and best use of limited resources are developed to respond to  increased illegal border activity\u2014in populated areas as well as rugged  wilderness. Sharing information regarding threats, daily operations,  funding plans for infrastructure and technology enhancements, and short-  and long-term deployment plans, are all essential to maximizing efficiency  and keeping all affected parties apprised of important information  affecting them. Officials from all the agencies we reviewed agree that  coordinating with each other is essential in carrying out their  responsibilities and that they each bear some responsibility in ensuring  this takes place.", "The Border Patrol does not currently have the resources to control the  borders in their entirety, nor do land management agencies have the  resources to always enforce applicable laws or fully protect employees,  visitors, and natural resources. In addition, no single department has  responsibility for setting federal priorities for all lands located along the  borders\u2014for example, deciding whether concentrating on reducing illegal  immigration in the most populated areas of the border or protecting  resources on federal lands is the more immediate need. It is too soon to  know whether the development of the Border Patrol\u2019s strategic plans at  the national level, or a pilot project at the field level, will mean more  effective law enforcement for all parties, but these appear to be steps in  the right direction. However, without a coordinated, interagency approach  along the Mexican and Canadian borders that takes into account a broader  federal perspective, individual federal agencies will continue to consider  and fund only their own priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that federal law enforcement resources are being  effectively focused on the areas of greatest need along the Mexican and  Canadian borders, we recommend that the Secretaries of Homeland  Security, the Interior, and Agriculture require their respective law  enforcement components to consult with each other when developing  their strategic plans and accompanying implementation plans and to  ensure these plans establish, at a minimum, goals regarding the following:    Coordinating the development and sharing the results of threat  assessments and other risk assessments of border areas encompassing  federal lands.", "Coordinating the development of plans for infrastructure and technology  improvements to be placed on or near federal lands.", "Coordinating and sharing information about changes in the number and  uses of law enforcement personnel on or near federal lands and the  potential consequences for all the agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretaries of  Agriculture, Homeland Security, and the Interior, as well as the Attorney  General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.", "The Chief of the U.S. Forest Service responded for Agriculture and  concurred with our findings and recommendations.  The Forest Service  said that as border initiatives take place at or near federal lands, it looked  forward to more dialogue with the Department of Homeland Security.  The  Forest Service\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II.", "DHS agreed with our overall observations and recommendations and said  that it was taking steps to address issues raised in this report.  To improve  coordination between CBP and land management agencies, CBP stated  that it was holding ongoing meetings to discuss how to share threat  assessments, strategies and infrastructure plans, and changes in the  number and uses of law enforcement personnel on or near federal lands.    Further, officials from CBP and the land management agencies were  meeting to develop memorandums of understanding regarding specific  federally protected lands in Arizona to establish agencies\u2019 law  enforcement access and define roles and responsibilities.", "While we are encouraged by CBP\u2019s ongoing and planned actions in some  areas, these actions are not fully responsive to our recommendations.  We  are recommending that the agencies\u2019 strategic plans and accompanying  implementation plans establish, at a minimum, goals regarding the sharing  of threat assessments, coordination of plans for infrastructure and  technology improvements on or near federal lands, and sharing of  information about changes in the number and uses of law enforcement  personnel on or near federal lands.  While we acknowledge CBP\u2019s efforts  to coordinate operations along the Mexican border in Arizona should have  significant benefits, we continue to believe that specific goals in their  strategic plans need to be established to institutionalize this interagency  coordination and to help ensure that coordination is not episodic or  limited to one border area.  DHS\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix  III.", "The Department of the Interior said that, in general, it agreed with the  findings and recommendations in the report.  It noted that since our audit  work was completed, the Solicitor\u2019s Office has taken some steps to  address land managers\u2019 concerns about how to respond to the Border  Patrol\u2019s requests for access to federally protected areas, such as  wilderness areas.  The Solicitor\u2019s Office has determined that a \u201ccommon  legal blueprint\u201d to guide land managers\u2019 response to requests for Border  Patrol access to protected lands is not often possible; rather they have  begun working with staff from CBP\u2019s Office of the Chief Counsel to  address these issues on a case by case basis. Interior officials also  provided technical comments on the report, which we incorporated as  appropriate. Interior\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix IV.", "The Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, said that overall it  found our report to be accurate.  Justice also commented on the Federal  Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) responsibilities related to several criminal  violations occurring on or near the border areas.  The FBI\u2019s jurisdiction  includes violations occurring on federal reservations and tribal lands, as  well as assaults on federal law enforcement officers, and drug and alien  smuggling violations. Accordingly, Justice suggested that any strategic  planning on the part of the Border Patrol or land management agencies  include affected FBI field and headquarters offices so that FBI staff can be  prepared for any shift in illegal activities in their area of jurisdiction.   Although the FBI\u2019s role and responsibilities regarding border security was  outside the scope of this report, we would support the inclusion of the FBI  in strategic planning activities among federal agencies in border areas.", "We received oral comments from representatives of OMB's Resource  Management Office and Office of General Counsel on May 26, 2004.

Our report  discusses the roles and responsibilities of the Border Patrol, and the  considerable law enforcement challenges faced by land management  agencies in protecting resources and people from illegal border traffic.   Because these agencies share law enforcement responsibilities along the  borders, it is important that agencies coordinate their efforts to ensure the  best use of federal resources.

In August and September 2003, we visited various federal  lands in Arizona along the Mexican border and in Washington along the  Canadian border because these areas had experienced the highest levels  of illegal activities for each border. When visiting these federal lands,  which included national parks and monuments, national forests, tribal  lands, and wildlife refuges, we interviewed federal land management field  and law enforcement officials and reviewed agency documents. We also  toured these lands where we observed, among other things, environmental  damage and a lack of barriers or fencing along international borders.  During our field visits, we interviewed Border Patrol sector officials  responsible for federal lands, and in Arizona, we interviewed the U.S.  Attorney regarding his involvement in efforts to coordinate federal and  other agencies with interests along the border. Additionally, we  interviewed headquarters officials and analyzed agency documents from  Interior\u2019s Office of Law Enforcement and Security, as well as the  individual bureaus\u2014Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land  Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. We  also interviewed officials and analyzed documents from the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service Office of Law Enforcement and Investigations  and Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Border Patrol.  As a measure of  illegal activity, we cite Border Patrol data on the number of illegal aliens  agents apprehended, which were compiled from a system used to process,  detain, and remove the aliens.  To assess the reliability of these data, we  interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data and  determined that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report.", "To determine the additional resources land management agencies received  to address border-related challenges, we interviewed headquarters budget  officials and analyzed budget-related documents. We did not  independently assess their proposals or the adequacy of the funds they  received. We interviewed representatives from the Office of Management  and Budget to obtain their views on various budget issues. Regarding the  land management agencies\u2019 staffing data, each agency provided estimates  on the number of law enforcement staff on-board nationwide and the  number stationed on federal borderlands for September 2001 and  September 2003; estimates were used because precise data for these  timeframes were not always available. To assess the reliability of these  estimates, we interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data  and, where available, reviewed existing reports about the data. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for this report. We  reviewed reports regarding land management law enforcement staffing  that were prepared by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector  General, the Department of Justice\u2019s National Institute of Justice and  Bureau of Justice Statistics, and the International Association of Chiefs of  Police. We reviewed these reports\u2019 findings as well as their methodologies  and found that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report.", "To determine the extent that Border Patrol and federal land management  agencies coordinated their law enforcement efforts along the Mexican and  Canadian borders, we conducted site visits to Arizona and Washington to  interview field officials from land management agencies and the Border  Patrol. We interviewed headquarters officials and reviewed documents  from the land management agencies and Border Patrol, including the  Border Patrol Special Coordination Center. Furthermore, we reviewed  these agencies\u2019 documents regarding their strategies, threat assessments,  deployment plans, interagency agreements, and procedures and policies as  they relate to law enforcement programs, and specifically border-related  activities.", "In order to assess ongoing interagency coordination efforts, we attended  several meetings between land management agencies and Border Patrol  from September 2003 through March 2004, and interviewed staff from  DHS\u2019s Border and Transportation Security Directorate.

The U.S. Geological Survey data were developed by using  maps with a scale of 1:2,000,000 and included federal lands as of July 2001.  The Geospatial Service and Technology Center data were reported as of  July 2003 and estimated to be accurate to plus or minus 3 percentage  points. Since these data were used for background purposes, they were  not verified.", "In this report, we did not include some of the land management agencies\u2019  significant law enforcement activities because we determined they were  not within the scope of this review. For example, we did not include the  Bureau of Reclamation or the National Park Service\u2019s U.S. Park Police  within the Department of the Interior because they do not have significant  amounts of property that lie on or near the Mexican or Canadian borders.  Furthermore, the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s law enforcement programs  for inspection activities at the ports of entry, in part, to monitor wildlife  imports and exports, were determined to be outside the scope of this  review. Although we include some data on federal land management  agencies and their law enforcement programs nationwide, our review  focused primarily on the law enforcement programs and activities near the  Mexican and Canadian land border areas, excluding the Alaska-Canada  border.
