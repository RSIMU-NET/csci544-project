Although Customs is preparing to devote significantly more resources to CSI and C-TPAT as it expands the programs, it has not taken adequate steps to incorporate factors necessary for the programs' long-term success and accountability. These factors include human capital planning, development of performance measures, and strategic planning. GAO found the following: (1) although CSI seeks to staff Customs officials at more than 30 overseas ports and C-TPAT expects to hire more than 150 additional staff, Customs has not devised systematic human capital plans to meet longterm staffing needs for both programs; (2) while Customs has created some performance measures to quantify operational activities and efforts, it has not developed measures to establish accountability and measure program achievement; and (3) in its efforts to rapidly implement the programs and enroll participants, Customs focused on short-term planning.

Because of its frontline  responsibilities for inspection at U.S. ports of entry, the U.S. Customs  Service assumed the lead role in improving ocean container security and  reducing the vulnerabilities associated with the overseas supply chain.  By  January 2002, Customs had initiated the Container Security Initiative (CSI)  and Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) to enhance  the security of the global supply chain and deter international acts of  terrorism, as well as facilitate the smooth passage of commerce across U.S.  borders.

To learn about  Customs\u2019 early experiences with CSI, we visited Canada, the Netherlands,  and France, the countries where CSI was first implemented, to meet with  the U.S. Customs attach\u00e9s responsible for managing the implementation in  the ports of Vancouver, Rotterdam, and Le Havre, respectively. We also met  with members of the CSI team deployed at these three ports.

With the rise of the \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery system, which allows  companies to reduce their inventories, as well as the efficiencies of the  maritime transportation system, the U.S. and world economies have  become increasingly reliant on the cargo container to transport their  goods.  In fact, approximately 90 percent of the world\u2019s trade moves by  cargo container.  Although these containers arrive from various ports  throughout the world, about 49 percent of U.S.-bound containers arrive  from the top 10 international ports listed in table 1.", "In 2002, roughly 7 million containers entered U.S. seaports.  About 87  percent of these ocean containers entered 10 U.S. seaports, as shown in  table 2.  More than half\u2014approximately 58 percent\u2014of ocean container  arrivals are concentrated in three of the largest U.S. ports: Los Angeles,  Long Beach, and New York-New Jersey.", "According to research initiated by the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s  Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe), cargo security is  affected by the number of individual companies contracted to facilitate the  handling and movement of cargo through its supply chain.  To move a  container from production facilities overseas to distribution points in the  United States, an importer faces various choices regarding the logistical  process such as routes and the selection of freight forwarders.  For  example, importers can own and operate key aspects of the overseas  supply chain process, such as warehousing and trucking operations.   Conversely, importers can contract with logistical service providers, such  as freight consolidators and nonvessel operating common carriers.  In  addition, importers must choose which modes of transportation to use,  such as rail, truck or barge, to move containers from the manufacturer\u2019s  warehouse to the seaport of lading. According to this Volpe study,  importers who own and operate the entire supply chain route from start to  finish suffer the least amount of security breaches because they have  greater control over their supply chains.  Figure 1 depicts basic  characteristics of the overseas portion of the supply chain and some areas  of vulnerability to terrorists intent on placing a WMD in a container.", "A report prepared by the National Defense University\u2019s Center for  Technology and National Security Policy states that an ocean container  itself is ideally suited to deliver a WMD. The likelihood that a terrorist will  use a container to deliver a WMD depends on the type of WMD and the  likelihood an ocean container would be used as the means of delivery.   These researchers believe that it is feasible for a terrorist group to make a  radiological \u201cdirty bomb\u201d which uses standard explosives to disperse  radiological material, and that the ocean container would provide an ideal  mode of transportation.  On the other hand, these researchers have  concluded, a terrorist attack using a nuclear WMD has a much lower  feasibility because it is deemed less probable that terrorists have the  resources and technical ability to build or obtain a workable nuclear  weapon at this time and the nuclear WMD might be too valuable an asset to  relinquish control by shipping it in a container.  But some experts agree  that the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear WMD by ocean  containers merits attention because the consequences would be much  more severe than those of other types of WMDs. While there have been no  known incidents of containers being used to transport WMDs, criminals  have exploited containers for other illegal purposes, such as smuggling  weapons, people, and illicit substances. Such activities demonstrate the  vulnerability of the freight transportation industry and suggest  opportunities for further exploitation of containers by criminals, including  terrorist groups.", "Various experts have estimated that the cost to the U.S. economy of port  closures due to the discovery or detonation of WMDs could be significant.   For example, in May 2002, the Brookings Institution estimated that costs  associated with U.S. port closures resulting from a detonated WMD could  amount to $1 trillion.  Estimating the cost of discovering an undetonated  WMD at a U.S. seaport, Booz, Allen and Hamilton reported in October 2002  that a 12-day closure would cost approximately $58 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Customs Programs Developed to Address Container Security", "paragraphs": ["Customs developed CSI to detect and deter acts of container-related  terrorism at the earliest point feasible along the supply chain, and it  developed C-TPAT to address concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities.

With  the placement of officials overseas, Customs expects that the added value  of real-time information sharing will improve Customs\u2019 ability to target  high-risk containers.  For example, using the Automated Targeting System,  U.S. Customs officials may identify unfamiliar consignees that have been  flagged as high risk but are later determined not to be high risk based on  the host customs\u2019 knowledge and experiences.  Customs\u2019 presence  overseas is intended to help ensure that containers identified as high risk  are inspected prior to arrival in the United States.  In addition, Customs  officials hope that the collocation of its officials with foreign customs  officials will result in relationships that enhance cooperation and  intelligence sharing.", "Customs officials believe that CSI should facilitate the flow of trade to the  United States and could reduce the processing time for certain shipments,  because the screening at CSI ports will in most cases take place during  \u201cdown time\u201d while containers wait at the port terminal prior to being  loaded onto vessels.  In addition, CSI eliminates the necessity of inspecting  containers for security purposes, absent additional information affecting  their risk analyses, when they reach the United States.

Initially, Customs expected  that its account managers, who had experience working with the trade  community, could promote the program and help companies develop  action plans.

Customs also expected that account managers  would help companies develop action plans in response to Customs  assessments of supply chain security practices. However, C-TPAT officials  later realized that account managers lacked the skill set necessary to  provide more than basic program information to companies.  In response,  Customs took action to hire supply chain specialists to provide the  requisite skill set needed to implement various C-TPAT program elements  and limited the role of account managers to promoting the program.

C-TPAT  intends to hire and train more than 150 supply chain specialists within the  next few years to review company security profiles for weaknesses,  identify solutions, and maintain company relations to ensure that voluntary  improvements are made.

Customs officials stated that they did not experience  significant difficulties in finding qualified staff to fill its short-term human  capital needs from among the pool of existing Customs employees, such as  inspectors from the Office of Field Operations.  However, Customs  anticipates creating 2- to 3-year permanent assignments to replace its  current 120-day temporary duty assignments, which could strain existing  resources.  In spite of the potential challenges Customs could face, CSI  officials said that they had not documented a human capital plan and would  instead, in the near term, rely exclusively upon other Customs offices such  as the Office of Field Operations to use their own standards to screen and  make final selections of CSI staff for placement at CSI ports overseas.", "Customs faces a daunting task as it prepares for its future human capital  needs at key CSI ports overseas, including strategic ports in countries  where it may be difficult to attract U.S. personnel.  Specifically, Customs\u2019  port status planning document projects the deployments of CSI teams in  fiscal year 2004 to seven countries  (Brazil, China, Greece, Sri Lanka,  Thailand, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates) for which the Department  of State requires pay compensation to U.S. government officials for  hardships they may encounter while working in these locations.   As an  example of how challenging it can be to place staff overseas, we found that  the Department of State, whose staff routinely serves overseas, had  difficulty filling positions in hardship posts and that, as a consequence, the  affected embassies were hampered in their ability to effectively carry out  U.S. foreign policy objectives. The difficulties faced by the Department of  State demonstrate that staffing posts abroad with appropriately skilled  personnel is a challenge even for agencies with a long history of recruiting  and placing staff overseas. Without a human capital plan that includes  recruiting and training strategies, Customs may be unable to identify and  develop the human resources necessary to handle the staffing for the  expanded number of CSI ports.", "As with CSI, Customs plans to expand C-TPAT by hiring over 150 additional  staff that will help implement new program elements such as validations  and actions plans.   The duties of these new staff, or supply chain  specialists, are to identify, recommend, and negotiate with member  companies to undertake corrective actions to improve supply chain  security, as well as to guide companies through the C-TPAT process.   Customs officials said that they expect to hire 40 supply chain specialists in  fiscal year 2003 and the remaining number after that.  However, although  Customs acknowledged the importance of human capital planning for C- TPAT, Customs officials indicated that they have been unable to devote  resources to developing a human capital plan that outlines how C-TPAT  will increase its staff 15-fold and implement new program elements that  will require training.", "A human capital plan that emphasizes recruitment, retention, and training  is particularly important given the unique operating environments and  personnel requirements of the two programs.  According to Customs  officials, the professional and personal relationships that CSI team  members and C-TPAT supply chain specialists build with their clients over  time will be critical to the long-term success of both programs.  For  example, Customs has indicated that a key benefit of CSI is the ability of  Customs officials to work with their foreign counterparts to obtain  sensitive information that enhances its targeting of high-risk containers at  the foreign ports.  If Customs fails to establish these good working  relationships, the added value of targeting from foreign ports is called into  question.  Similarly, Customs officials indicated that C-TPAT\u2019s success at  improving supply chain security will depend, in large part, on supply chain  specialists\u2019 ability to persuade companies to voluntarily adopt C-TPAT  recommendations. Given the reliance of CSI and C-TPAT staff on  relationships and persuasion rather than authority, a human capital plan  that regularly places personnel with language skills and the ability to work  effectively in these environments will maximize the programs\u2019  performance.

To better articulate a  results-orientation, organizations create a set of performance goals and  measures that addresses important dimensions of program performance.  Using intermediate goals and measures, such as outputs or intermediate  outcomes, would allow Customs to measure progress toward enhancing  the security of U.S.-bound ocean container trade, the primary goal of these  programs. As other programs are proposed to address homeland security  needs, DHS and the Congress must have access to credible performance  information that allows them to make resource allocation decisions across  programs and hold managers accountable.", "Customs officials had developed some measures for CSI and C-TPAT that  simply quantify program results like operational activities and efforts.  For  example, Customs tracks the number of CSI teams operating in foreign  ports and the number of countries that have signed up to participate in CSI,  as well as the number of CSI inspections.  Similarly, for C-TPAT, Customs  tracks results like the number of companies from different industrial  sectors that participate in the program and the percentage value of cargo  imported by C-TPAT companies.  These measures have served as useful  indicators of operational results.", "However, Customs had not developed measures to help assess how CSI\u2019s  presence overseas helps improve targeting of high-risk containers beyond  Customs\u2019 existing capabilities.  As previously discussed, Customs officials  stated that the most important benefit derives from the collocation of U.S.  and foreign customs officials, which provides them with additional  information that should enhance Customs\u2019 targeting abilities.   However,  Customs does not analyze statistics to ascertain the nature and extent of  the contributions made by foreign customs administrations in determining  whether a particular container should be targeted or inspected.  Customs  officials told us that they had not had the opportunity to prepare  performance measures that will help evaluate CSI\u2019s outcomes.  In the  absence of performance indicators that provide a measure of the program\u2019s  success, the benefits of placing personnel overseas are unclear.", "On the other hand, Customs developed a performance measure to indicate  whether C-TPAT has resulted in improved security practices, using the  results of trade compliance audits as a proxy.  This indicator uses select  data elements derived from trade compliance audits, such as whether the  container seals indicated possible tampering and whether the manifest  contained data discrepancies (e.g., whether cargo weight significantly  changed between export and arrival).  While this is a useful first step, its  effectiveness is limited by the fact that it compares two different  populations, contrasting the behavior of C-TPAT members with that of non- C-TPAT members.  A more reliable measure of program impact would  compare companies\u2019 trade compliance before and after they enroll in C- TPAT.   As of May 2003, Customs had not developed any other indicators to  ascertain whether C-TPAT has had an impact on the members\u2019 supply chain  security practices. Recent efforts to validate the C-TPAT security profiles  provide Customs with an opportunity to establish baseline data to later  determine whether members\u2019 security practices improve over time.  The  validations also provide Customs an opportunity to authenticate the  information contained in security profiles and determine whether the  company merits a continued reduction in its risk score."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customs Planning Efforts Do Not Reflect Strategic Approach", "paragraphs": ["Customs does not have a strategic plan that describes how it intends to  achieve CSI and C-TPAT goals and objectives and that makes full  accountability possible.

Strategic planning  helps organizations manage their programs more effectively by requiring  that they clearly establish mission goals and objectives and, after assessing  their environment and involving stakeholders, describe how program  activities serve program goals.  In addition, strategic plans can provide a  basis for communication and mutual understanding between stakeholders  and contribute to program accountability.", "Although Customs has taken some steps that demonstrate operational  planning for CSI implementation in key ports throughout the world, its  efforts do not reflect a strategic approach to planning.  While Customs  intends to continue deploying CSI teams to the 20 top ports and to 20 to 25  strategic ports, it has not prepared strategic plans that show how it will  accomplish this enormous task.  Whereas Customs told us that it intends to  develop strategic plans, so far, the only available record regarding its  expansion plans is a table outlining when Customs expects to deploy CSI  teams to foreign ports for fiscal years 2003 and 2004.", "Without the benefit of strategic planning, Customs quickly rolled out CSI in  France but failed to involve primary stakeholders in making key decisions.   Although Customs officials pointed to their collaboration with the French  government as a model of cooperation in setting up this port, a lack of  communication between the partner countries caused French customs  officials to impose unnecessary demands on private industry shipping out  of Le Havre to provide the CSI team with complete manifest information  needed for effective targeting.  Customs had failed to inform the French  that it was implementing the 24-Hour Rule, which essentially negated the  need for the French effort.  When we met with French government officials,  they expressed frustration that they had not been kept informed.  Poor  communication, as evidenced by this experience, can lead to a lack of  cooperation between the two partners and make attainment of CSI goals  more difficult.  Good communication is essential for a program like CSI,  which relies on the exchange of information between the U.S. and foreign  customs administrations to improve the targeting of high-risk containers.", "Customs\u2019 experience in rolling out C-TPAT similarly demonstrates a lack of  strategic planning. This is particularly true with regard to Custom's  communicating how it plans to implement critical C-TPAT program  elements\u2014validations, action plans, and annual assessments\u2014designed to  verify that companies have security measures in place and follow through  with recommended changes. Customs does not have a planning document  that describes the operational objectives for each element, how those  objectives support C-TPAT's overall goals, and how they intend to meet  those objectives.

Furthermore, Customs does not have strategic planning documents that  establish measurable objectives, detailed implementation strategies,  resource needs, and project time frames for CSI and C-TPAT.  The effective  implementation of CSI and C-TPAT programs depends, in part, on rigorous  strategic planning.  Without strategic plans, Customs may discover that CSI  cannot place CSI teams in strategic ports in a timely fashion, or that they  place the teams but do not achieve any improvement in security.

Customs agreed with our findings that human capital planning is  needed, and Customs indicated that it is developing a comprehensive  training plan for Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism   (C-TPAT).  However, while training is an important aspect of human  capital planning, our report shows that human capital plans should also  systematically address other long-term staffing needs, such as  recruitment and retention for the more than 150 supply chain  specialists Customs plans to hire. 2. Customs commented that it is making progress in developing further  performance measures that are based on trade compliance data.  As our  report states, to ensure that C-TPAT performance indicators are  reliable, the measures should compare trade compliance data for  companies before and after they enroll in the program.  Customs also  indicated that it intends to review the results of the validation process  in order to develop possible baselines for measurements.  These efforts  are responsive to the recommendation in our report. 3. Customs noted that more accurate budget data are available.  Between  the fall 2002 and June 2003, we requested clarification and updated  budget information for our report. Our report presents the budget data  that Customs provided us. Furthermore, we did not use the fall 2002  container data in our report; our report presents the number of ocean  containers inspected under the Container Security Initative (CSI)  program through May 2003, which was provided by Customs officials in  June 2003.  4. Customs raised several concerns about our characterization of the  expected role of account managers in C-TPAT.  Customs indicated that   \u201cat no time was it certain or probable that account managers would  become involved beyond the communication function.\u201d  This statement  contradicts previous statements by Customs officials and an early C- TPAT program document that account managers would be involved in  developing action plans.  Therefore, we maintain that Customs account  managers were initially expected to help companies develop action  plans. 5. Regarding Customs\u2019 assertion that U.S. Customs inspectors must be  able to observe inspections at CSI ports, we do not question the need  for Customs inspectors to make such observations.  However, our  analysis of the bilateral arrangements show that the arrangements do  not specify that U.S. Customs must be able to inspect containers or  observe inspections.  In addition, our analysis of Customs\u2019 documents  and our discussions with Customs officials reveal that bilateral  arrangements with foreign governments are not legally binding  documents.  We will not revise the sentence that states \u201cOfficials from  the three foreign customs administrations visited told us that, so far,  the CSI requests for inspections had not been a burden and that they  had often invited the CSI teams to observe inspections\u201d because this is  what foreign customs officials told us.  However, we will revise the  report to clarify that the ability of the U.S. Customs officials to observe  and verify inspections is a central tenet of the CSI concept and,  according to U.S. Customs officials, all partner Customs  administrations accept this tenet. 6. Customs stated that company participants are not rejected from the  program and are instead engaged by C-TPAT to increase the security of  the international supply chain.  This statement is consistent with  information in our report.  Customs also noted that it withholds  benefits when this action is warranted by adverse information or  identified security weaknesses and that it can reduce benefits, for less  serious reasons, to encourage a company to rectify a security gap or  problem. We revised the report to clarify these two points.  We also  added a footnote to capture Customs\u2019 comments that C-TPAT  participants are not exempt from Customs trade compliance and  enforcement activities.   We further revised the report to clarify that  Customs can remove a company from C-TPAT membership if it  determines that the company has not made a serious commitment or  has intentionally misled Customs.  To date, Customs reported that it has  not removed a company from C-TPAT membership.   7. Customs noted the evolution of the supply chain specialist position.", "This is consistent with our report. 8. We believe that our portrayal of the relationship between the 24-Hour  Rule and CSI is accurate.  Our report states that the 24-Hour Rule was  implemented to ensure that Customs would obtain complete and timely  manifest data.  This is based on specific evidence found in our  examination of the 24-Hour Rule, as published in the Federal Register.    The 24-Hour Rule, as found in the Federal Register, specifically states,  under the heading Necessity for Advance Presentation of Vessel Cargo  Manifest to Customs, that \u201cCSI is already operational in Canada and the  Netherlands\u2026.Given this explosive growth, it is critical that the  information necessary to implement CSI fully be provided to Customs  in the near term.  For this reason, Customs proposed this rulemaking  on August 8, 2002.\u201d  9. Customs noted that the development of action plans and assessment of  security improvements are part of the validation process.  In earlier  interviews with Customs officials, we were told that supply chain  specialists would focus on validating the company security profiles,  because Customs needed to validate the large number of security  profiles that they had received.  We revised the report to eliminate the  statement that other program elements would be a lower priority and  clarified that supply chain specialists would focus on validations and  action plans.  We also added that supply chain security specialists  would help facilitate the annual assessments.  10. We have deleted the second paragraph.    11. Customs noted that the statement in our report that Customs does not  track the contributions made by foreign customs administrations in  determining whether a particular container should be targeted or  inspected is inaccurate.  We revised the report to reflect that Customs  does not analyze statistics to ascertain the nature and extent of the  contributions made by foreign customs administrations in determining  whether a particular container should be targeted or inspected. 12. We disagree with Customs\u2019 assertion that our report implied that U.S.", "Customs imposed unnecessary demands on private industry.  To the  contrary, our report states that French Customs imposed demands on  private industry that proved unnecessary.  However, our central point  still stands.  French Customs officials told us that they updated their  manifest system in anticipation of the implementation of CSI in the port  of Le Havre, but without knowledge of the imminent implementation of  the 24-Hour Rule.  In our interviews with French Customs officials, they  expressed dissatisfaction with the confusion surrounding the  implementation of the 24-Hour Rule.  That benefits derived from  French Customs\u2019 efforts to update the manifest system is beside our  point that good communication is vital between CSI partners."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Patricia Cazares-Chao, Richard  Boudreau, Hector Wong, Victoria Lin, Jill Johnson, and Reid Lowe made  key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional  responsibilities and to help improve the performance and accountability of the  federal government for the American people.
