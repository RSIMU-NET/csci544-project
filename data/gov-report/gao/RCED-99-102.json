The southern Selkirk Mountains are located in northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, and southeastern British Columbia. As recently as the 1950s, this population consisted of approximately 100 animals. However, by the early 1980s, it had dwindled to about 30. In 1983, the southern Selkirk Mountains population of woodland caribou was granted emergency protection under the Endangered Species Act. A final ruling of endangered status was published in February 1984. In 1985, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency primarily responsible for carrying out the act for land species, approved the first recovery plan for the southern Selkirk Mountains woodland caribou. Since then, federal and state agencies in the United States and ministries in British Columbia have participated in a cooperative program to recover the caribou.

Details on these reports are provided in appendix I of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Historically, as figure 2 shows, woodland caribou were distributed throughout much of Canada and portions of the northern tier of the United States. There are two varieties, or ecotypes, of woodland caribou\u2014mountain and northern. The two ecotypes are not genetically distinct and differ only in the use they make of their habitat and in their behavior. Currently, the only mountain caribou that regularly inhabit the contiguous United States is the population of the southern Selkirk Mountains. The range of these caribou is restricted to a relatively small area in southeastern British Columbia and extreme northeastern Washington and northern Idaho.", "While records suggest that caribou in this area were plentiful in the 19th century, the population had declined to about 100 animals by the 1950s. By the early 1980s, the population had further declined to about 30, and the woodland caribou had become one of the most critically endangered mammals in the United States.", "In 1971, U.S. and Canadian resource management agencies signed a cooperative agreement to investigate and monitor the caribou. The agencies included the Forest Service, the Washington Department of Game, the Idaho Fish and Game Commission, the British Columbia Fish and Wildlife Branch, the British Columbia Forest Service, and the University of Idaho. The agreement resulted in the formation of the International Mountain Caribou Steering Committee and the International Mountain Caribou Technical Committee. The steering committee was established to approve study plans and funding and to help set direction for caribou recovery efforts and for the technical committee. The technical committee was tasked with coordinating caribou management and research studies and serving as a clearinghouse for information that promotes management activities designed to reverse the decline of the caribou population. The cooperative agreement produced a series of population and habitat studies in the 1970s and 1980s. Both committees are still active and are key participants in current caribou recovery efforts.", "In 1977, the Idaho Fish and Game Commission designated the caribou as an endangered species in the state. The Washington Game Commission designated the caribou as endangered in 1982. In February 1984, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) listed the southern Selkirk population of woodland caribou as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).", "Under ESA, once a species is identified as threatened or endangered the responsible agency (in the case of the caribou, FWS) must generally develop and implement a recovery plan. A recovery plan details the specific tasks that are considered necessary to recover a species. The plan can identify (but not obligate) other parties, such as federal, state and private entities, as cooperating agencies. Implementing a recovery plan is contingent upon appropriations, priorities, and other budgetary constraints affecting the participants. A recovery plan may also be modified to reflect changes in the status of a species, the completion of recovery tasks, and new findings that reflect the latest available scientific information.", "In 1982, the International Mountain Caribou Technical Committee began preparing a management plan for the woodland caribou. FWS adopted a revised version of this document as the official recovery plan for the caribou in 1985. The recovery plan identified the following as cooperating agencies in the caribou recovery effort: FWS; the Fish and Wildlife Branch of the British Columbia Ministry of Environment (currently, the Wildlife Branch of the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks); the British Columbia Forest Service (part of the Ministry of Forests); the Forest Service (Colville and Idaho Panhandle National Forests); the Idaho Department of Fish and Game; the Washington Department of Game (currently the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife); and the University of Idaho.", "In 1991, FWS appointed its own caribou recovery team to advise the agency on caribou recovery efforts. The recovery team completed a revised recovery plan in 1994. The revised plan identified all of the previously identified entities as cooperators in the new plan, as well as Washington State University and the Idaho Department of Lands. While these agencies agreed to cooperate in carrying out the recovery plans, the resources to implement the plans are controlled by congressional appropriations and the agencies\u2019 budgets and priorities.", "FWS\u2019 recovery plans for the southern Selkirk woodland caribou identified a variety of management and research actions necessary for the species\u2019 recovery. These included collecting information on and managing caribou habitat, determining caribou population characteristics, maintaining the population through various efforts to reduce caribou mortality, and informing and involving the public and agency personnel about caribou and caribou management. The 1985 recovery plan also called for assessing the feasibility of augmenting the existing population by introducing caribou transplanted from other herds. The consensus of the biological community at the time was that augmentation was the only available method that could reasonably be expected to achieve the population\u2019s recovery.", "As figure 3 shows, a recovery zone that includes the general area used by the caribou has been delineated. It covers about 2,200 square miles and includes national forest, state, private, and Canadian lands.

Federal expenditures are estimated at about $4 million and include primarily those of FWS and the Forest Service and, to a much lesser extent, those of the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Idaho and Washington reported expenditures of about $240,000 and $419,000, respectively. Finally, British Columbia\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks reported estimated expenditures of about $31,000. As figure 4 shows, most of the caribou recovery expenditures came from the U.S. government. However, it should be noted that the estimated expenditures for British Columbia include only the salary expenses of staff who participated in augmentation activities and costs related to a study of cougar predation on caribou.

The largest category of FWS\u2019 expenditures, about $1.6 million, was the federal share of the ESA Section 6 grants provided to Idaho and Washington for recovery activities. States that have active programs for the conservation of species protected under ESA and cooperative agreements with FWS may receive Section 6 grants to fund their recovery efforts. The grants provided to Idaho and Washington specify a federal cost share of 90 percent and a state share of 10 percent. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife performed the recovery work using the grants primarily to fund activities related to augmenting the existing southern Selkirk population, including monitoring the distribution, movement, and survival of the transplanted caribou. Other recovery activities funded by these grants include developing a census technique for counting the caribou and performing the census, conducted annually since 1991.", "In addition to Section 6 grants, Idaho received grants administered by FWS under the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, commonly referred to as the Pittman-Robertson Act. This act provides federal aid to states for the management and restoration of wildlife. The estimated federal funding for caribou under these grants, which specify a federal cost share of 75 percent and a state share of 25 percent, totaled about $47,000. The work performed under these grants included research on caribou ecology and assistance in developing caribou management plans.", "FWS also spent about $924,000 for research on woodland caribou. Specifically, the National Ecology Research Center conducted a series of research projects over a 9-year period that focused primarily on the caribou\u2019s early winter habitat and diet but also included research on such topics as caribou genetics and late winter caribou foraging ecology.Additional information on this research is provided in appendix I, which contains a summary of reports that were based, in whole or in part, on this research.", "Finally, FWS\u2019 remaining expenditures, approximately $600,000, included general recovery funding and funding for law enforcement efforts. General recovery funding covers the salary, travel, and office expenses of FWS staff working on caribou recovery. For example, under this category, FWS funded the preparation of a revised recovery plan and of an augmentation plan, staff salaries associated with participation in augmentation efforts, and the costs of organizing and participating in caribou recovery team meetings.", "We used estimated expenditure information in this report for a number of reasons. Specifically, FWS does not generally maintain complete records of its ESA expenditures on a species-by-species basis. Instead, FWS maintains its expenditure records by ESA funding categories, such as listing, recovery, consultation, and law enforcement. Accordingly, FWS\u2019 expenditure information is based on the best available data but includes some estimated expenditures, and some data are missing. For example, for the period from 1984 through 1988, FWS\u2019 expenditure estimate is primarily limited to research and Section 6 grants. (FWS officials noted that records on additional expenditures were not required until the passage of the 1988 amendments to ESA). Therefore, the expenditure estimate for these years is conservative. In other years, the best available information on caribou-related expenditures, according to FWS, was a combined total that included some funding categories that are not specifically related to recovery efforts. However, FWS officials believe the reported expenditure information presents a reasonably accurate estimate of its expenditures on woodland caribou recovery efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forest Service\u2019s Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service estimated that it spent about $781,000 on caribou recovery efforts from 1984 through 1998. The largest identifiable expenditure the Forest Service reported, totaling about $60,000, was for surveying and analyzing caribou habitat. However, some of this habitat work also related to the grizzly bear. Other Forest Service funds were spent for augmentation activities, mapping caribou habitat, monitoring the caribou population, purchasing radio collars for an investigation of cougar predation on caribou, funding graduate student research on caribou, and costs associated with attending caribou recovery team and technical committee meetings. The Forest Service\u2019s expenditure estimate also includes the indirect costs of implementing caribou-related tasks and of implementing threatened and endangered species program activities that benefited both the caribou and other species. Indirect costs include such items as the staff time spent designing timber sales to prevent adverse effects on caribou, considering the effects of other proposed land management activities on caribou, developing land and resource management plans to conserve caribou and their habitat, and coordinating with states or other agencies on caribou habitat management.", "Like FWS, the Forest Service does not generally maintain complete expenditure records on a species-by-species basis.

Accordingly, the estimates for this period are conservative. According to the Forest Service, for 1989 through 1997, its expenditure estimates are more complete and include indirect costs as detailed in the preceding paragraph. For fiscal year 1998, the estimate includes only those expenditures that could be attributed directly to caribou recovery efforts by the Idaho Panhandle and Colville National Forests.

The Ministry estimated these expenditures to be about $31,000. The augmentation-related expenditures (about $26,500) represent the salaries of staff who participated in planning and conducting the transplant operations, including preparing the plans and assisting in locating and capturing the caribou for transplant. The remaining expenditures were for the purchase of radio collars and associated costs for the study of cougar predation on caribou. The Ministry characterized its estimated expenditures as conservative because they do not cover such costs as the salaries and travel expenses for staff from the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks and the Ministry of Forests who attended recovery team, steering committee, or technical committee meetings. The estimate also does not include the salaries of staff from the ministries who were involved in planning timber harvests so as to protect caribou habitat. According to the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks, since the ministries do not keep records of such expenditures on a species-by-species basis, no information on these expenditures was available. The Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks also noted that British Columbia would likely have incurred the costs for planning timber harvests even if there were no U.S. caribou recovery program, since British Columbia, including the Ministry of Forests and private industry, is taking actions to protect the habitat of the southern Selkirk caribou on its own behalf."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recovery Program Has Achieved Modest Gains", "paragraphs": ["FWS\u2019 recovery plans for the southern Selkirk Mountains caribou called for taking a variety of actions to assist the declining population. One of the most significant has been the transplanting of over 100 caribou from other parts of British Columbia to the southern Selkirk Mountains area. Most recovery program officials we spoke to believe that this action is probably responsible for the continued existence of a caribou population in the southern Selkirk Mountains. However, because many transplanted and some resident caribou have died, the net effect of the augmentation effort has been a relatively small increase in the overall population, from about 30 animals when the recovery effort started in 1984 to about 48 animals today. FWS noted that the mortality among the southern Selkirk transplants is in line with long-term recovery objectives established by the Canadian Wildlife Service for caribou in other areas. Furthermore, FWS believes that the information gained from the augmentation effort is essential in sustaining the recovery and is consistent with \u201cadaptive management.\u201dThe current population consists of both transplanted and resident caribou and moves freely across the borders of Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia.", "Although the recovery program has not succeeded in establishing two new self-sustaining herds in the United States as planned, it has mapped caribou habitat in the recovery zone, developed habitat management guidelines, and completed research on certain aspects of caribou ecology. Furthermore, according to recovery program officials, restrictions on land use due specifically to the caribou have been relatively minor. Other restrictions, such as road closures on Forest Service lands to protect old-growth timber reserves, watersheds, and grizzly bear, would remain even if there were no recovery plan for the caribou."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Results of Augmentation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["FWS\u2019 initial caribou recovery plan, approved in April 1985, called for an assessment of the use of augmentation as a possible method of increasing the southern Selkirk caribou population. At the time, the existing population occupied the international border area of extreme northeastern Washington, northern Idaho, and southeastern British Columbia. Later that year, the Forest Service issued a decision notice that called for augmenting the existing population in accordance with an augmentation plan that had been prepared by representatives of the cooperating agencies. The augmentation plan identified potential caribou capture locations in British Columbia and evaluated potential release sites in Idaho and Washington. Ball Creek in northern Idaho was selected as the release site because of such factors as the condition and availability of suitable habitat for a new caribou herd. In March 1987, 24 caribou were transplanted from British Columbia to Ball Creek. A nearly identical operation provided 24 additional caribou the following year. Caribou were not available for transplant in 1989, but 12 more caribou were transplanted to Ball Creek in March 1990. All transplanted animals were fitted with radio collars and have been monitored extensively to determine their distribution and movement, as well as their reproduction, mortality (including the causes when possible), and survival rates. Through these transplants, a second caribou herd was established in the southern Selkirk Mountains, although it has decreased in size over time and is therefore not currently self-sustaining.", "In March 1994, FWS issued a revised recovery plan. The revised plan called for, among other things, establishing a third self-sustaining herd of caribou, this time in Washington. Additional transplants were needed in Washington to reduce the risk of losing caribou to a catastrophic event such as a large fire, and to improve the distribution of caribou, increase the size of the population, and further enhance the probability of recovery. After a second augmentation plan was completed and approved, in April 1996, 19 caribou from British Columbia were released in the Sullivan Lake area of the Colville National Forest in Washington. An additional 13 caribou were transplanted to the same general area in March 1997. Finally, in March 1998, 11 more caribou were transplanted to the southern Selkirk Mountains. However, because previously transplanted animals moved back and forth between British Columbia and the United States, the 1998 transplants were released just north of the U.S.-Canadian border at Kootenay Pass in British Columbia.", "According to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Canadian release site had several advantages. Specifically, it decreased transport-driving time and thereby reduced stress on the caribou; it placed the caribou directly in a late winter feeding site; and it reduced the project\u2019s costs, since roads near the release site did not have to be plowed.", "An official from British Columbia\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks noted that using the Kootenay Pass release site also eliminated the need for a costly and dangerous quarantine period and increased the likelihood of the transplants\u2019 encountering other caribou and taking up residence in that area rather than dispersing. Researchers had also noticed by this time that while the caribou transplanted during the 2 prior years exhibited considerable movement, they tended to congregate in the Stagleap Provincial Park area, just north of the Canadian border. The transplants released in British Columbia followed the same pattern. Within 2 weeks of their release near Kootenay Pass, all the animals were located within the Idaho portion of the recovery zone. These caribou continued to move and currently tend to congregate with the core population centered around the Stagleap Provincial Park area.", "All of the Washington and British Columbia transplants were also fitted with radio collars, and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife has monitored their movements, survival, and causes of death. Figure 5 shows the locations of the four release sites in the recovery zone.", "Through the augmentation efforts, 103 caribou were transplanted from British Columbia to the southern Selkirk Mountains\u201460 in Idaho, 32 in Washington, and 11 in British Columbia. As of October 1998, 59 of the 103 transplanted caribou had died (38 of the Idaho transplants and 21 of the Washington transplants). Of the remaining 44 transplanted caribou, 23 are alive (1 from Idaho and 22 from Washington/British Columbia) and the status of the 21 others is unknown, primarily because their radio collars are lost or have failed. Most recovery program officials we contacted believe that the augmentation efforts have probably been responsible for maintaining a core population of woodland caribou in the southern Selkirk Mountains. However, an official from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said that he is not convinced that the caribou population would no longer exist without augmentation. He stated that a population of 25 to 30 animals around Stagleap Provincial Park has survived for some time and remains the core population. However, he added that the population probably would not have grown or expanded without intervention.", "Because so many transplanted and some resident caribou have died, the increase in the overall size of the southern Selkirk population is relatively small. Specifically, when the population was listed under ESA, it was estimated to include about 30 caribou. In 1991, the year following the last of the Idaho transplants, the population numbered about 47 caribou. The population reached its highest level under the recovery effort in 1993, when it totaled about 51 individuals. However, it has declined since to about 48 individuals, even with the addition of the 43 caribou transplanted to Washington and British Columbia. FWS stated that it would be inappropriate to judge the success or failure of a reintroduction program on the basis of only 103 individuals transplanted over a 12-year period. According to FWS, mortality of 57 percent (59 confirmed deaths out of a total of 103 transplanted caribou) would not be considered excessive, especially for these types of animals. FWS noted that this mortality is in line with long-term recovery objectives established by the Canadian Wildlife Service in its recovery plan for a population of woodland caribou located within the boundaries of the Gaspesie Conservation Park in Canada. For example, the long-term goal of this plan was to maintain a survival rate of 50 percent for calves aged 6 months to 2 years. Furthermore, FWS stated that the information gained from the augmentation effort could be used to conduct studies, pinpoint problems, and make adjustments in recovery actions. According to FWS, \u201cadaptive management\u201d is an ongoing, essential effort in sustaining the recovery of the woodland caribou and of many other listed species and typifies why recovery is frequently a slow, incremental process that is modified as monitoring and research indicate a need for change.", "In commenting on our report, the British Columbia Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks stated that, in general, the Ministry considers annual adult caribou mortality rates in excess of 15 percent to be high. The Ministry noted that recent estimates of adult mortality based on data from radio-collared caribou suggest that the annual mortality rate is even higher. This is of significant concern to the Ministry, which stated that identifying and addressing the cause of this high mortality remains very important for ensuring the long-term recovery of caribou in the southern Selkirk Mountains.", "The cause of death is not known for many southern Selkirk caribou, primarily because by the time carcasses are located and examined, too little remains to make an accurate determination. However, predation, mainly by cougars, is the most common known cause of death. Natural causes, poaching or hunting, and accidental falls are other known causes. Some recovery program officials cautioned, however, that the primary cause of the decline in the southern Selkirk caribou population is currently unknown and it is important not to designate predation as the ultimate reason. For example, these officials noted that marginal habitat may be the major problem.", "Augmentation efforts have not succeeded in establishing two additional self-sustaining herds in the United States as planned. Some of the Idaho transplants remained near the release site and established a small herd that is centered around Two Mouth Lakes, Idaho. However, the size of this herd has declined steadily over time\u2014from about 26 caribou in 1991 to 5 caribou in 1999. The remaining Idaho transplants have died, left the southern Selkirk Mountains, or congregated with the core population centered around Stagleap Provincial Park. The Washington transplants have moved throughout the recovery zone but have also tended to congregate with the core population. In October 1998, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife issued a progress report on its augmentation efforts. The report stated that instead of transplanting 60 or more caribou during the first 3 years of the project as planned, the Department was able to transplant only 43 caribou. The primary reason for this shortfall was concern about straining the source populations in British Columbia. The report indicated that transplanting only a limited number of animals might have diminished the success of the augmentation effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Recovery Program Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the augmentation efforts, FWS\u2019 recovery plans included a variety of other tasks. Generally, these tasks involved such activities as gathering information on and managing caribou habitat, conducting research on characteristics of the caribou population, endeavoring to reduce caribou mortality, and informing and involving the public and agency personnel about caribou and caribou management. Further information on other recovery program tasks and accomplishments appears in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program\u2019s Limited Impact on Land Use", "paragraphs": ["According to recovery program officials, the impact on land use due specifically to caribou recovery efforts has been relatively minor. Specifically, some restrictions have been placed on timber harvesting within the recovery zone, and a small portion of the recovery zone has been closed to snowmobiling. Forest Service officials noted that even if the caribou recovery efforts were terminated, many land-use restrictions would remain in effect to protect, among other things, old-growth timber reserves; watersheds; and other species, such as grizzly bears.", "When considering the southern Selkirk caribou for listing under ESA, FWS identified improperly designed timber harvesting as a threat to the population. For example, timber harvesting alters caribou habitat and creates additional human access to habitat, which can increase the potential for mortality. Timber cutting can eliminate escape cover, migration corridors, and the ability of the habitat to produce lichens\u2014a major source of nutrition for the caribou. As a result of the caribou recovery effort, some types and methods of timber harvesting have been restricted or modified on lands administered by the Forest Service. According to Forest Service officials, while caribou habitat management guidelines do not prohibit timber harvesting in the recovery zone, they do affect the amount and type of timber that can be harvested within important caribou habitat. For example, to protect or promote the long-term improvement of caribou habitat, commercial operations to thin forests are designed from the outset to develop habitat with high canopy cover or higher levels of lichen production.", "Besides imposing some restrictions on timber harvesting, the Forest Service has closed about 25 square miles of the 2,200-square-mile recovery zone to snowmobiling specifically to protect the caribou. Snowmobiling can harm caribou and their habitat either by directly harassing the animals or by disturbing the habitat to the extent that it becomes unacceptable. The closure was instituted in 1994, after the caribou herd was twice displaced by snowmobiles. Forest Service officials also stated that no Forest Service roads have been closed specifically to protect the caribou. However, because the caribou recovery area overlaps with the Selkirk grizzly bear recovery area, the majority of the road-use restrictions have been put in place primarily to provide security and core habitat for bear. Forest Service officials noted that these road closures and restrictions also benefit caribou and other wildlife species.", "Forest Service officials noted that even if the recovery efforts for caribou were terminated, many land-use restrictions would remain in the recovery area.

As a result of these meetings, they drafted an action plan that outlines efforts immediately needed to maintain the existing caribou population and its habitat. In March 1999, members of the steering committee agreed to name the action plan the \u201cEmergency Caribou Recovery Action Plan.\u201d", "To accomplish the highest-priority need\u2013maintenance of the core population, the draft action plan proposes to continue the annual census to determine the size of the remaining population and to augment the population when it reaches a level equal to or less than 50 animals. The draft action plan notes that 50 is considered to be the short-term critical threshold for augmentation. However, the plan also states that augmentation will occur if the annual population trend is decreasing and the 3-year recruitment rate (the percentage of calves that live to be a year old) is less than 15 percent or if British Columbia has additional animals available for transplant.", "While the success of this strategy is likely to depend on future augmentation efforts, as of January 1999, the availability of caribou for such efforts was uncertain. For example, although the current population includes only about 48 animals, no caribou are available for transplant in 1999. In commenting on our report, British Columbia\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks stated that the availability of caribou for transplant to the southern Selkirk population has, and continues to be, a major issue for British Columbia. The Ministry noted it is currently reviewing the population status of mountain caribou in British Columbia to determine whether potential source populations can sustain the loss of additional caribou for transplant.", "The draft action plan also addresses the need to establish a goal for the total southern Selkirk caribou population. It was agreed, on the basis of the best professional judgment of those involved in the recovery effort, that the preliminary goal would be 200 animals. This figure could change with additional research. The group further agreed on the area near Stagleap Provincial Park as the preferred release site for future augmentation efforts. However, some U.S. agency representatives are concerned about the impression created by using U.S. funds to transplant caribou to the Canadian portion of the recovery zone. In response, other officials noted that the range of these animals still includes the United States. Furthermore, they stated that many different species of wildlife, including grizzly bear and certain waterfowl, regularly move back and forth across the international border and managing all aspects of these ecosystems necessitates work across these boundaries. The draft action plan identified a number of other tasks, including investigating and managing caribou mortality. This task involves (1) monitoring radio-collared caribou to locate those that have died and attempt to determine the causes of death and (2) studying cougar predation on caribou. Currently, researchers in the United States and British Columbia believe that cougar predation may be the most important factor affecting the caribou\u2019s survival. Accordingly, a study of cougar predation has already been initiated. The study plan calls for radio collaring and monitoring 40 cougar (10 each in Idaho and Washington, and 20 in British Columbia). The objectives of the study include (1) assessing the extent and frequency of cougar predation on caribou, (2) determining whether predation is specific to individual cougar, and (3) determining whether cougar predation is based on opportunity or need. Using ESA Section 6 grant funding, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife has hired a doctoral candidate from Washington State University who will coordinate the analysis of the cougar monitoring data. As of March 22, 1999, 11 cougar had been collared\u20147 by Washington and 4 by British Columbia. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game had also begun its collaring effort. If cougar that kill caribou are identified, the agency with jurisdiction over where they are found will have responsibility for deciding how to deal with them.", "Other tasks identified as immediate needs include producing a consolidated map of the entire recovery zone, using Geographic Information System data. The effort would focus initially on Forest Service land, but recovery officials hope to extend the map to include Idaho State and British Columbia lands as well. Another task is to minimize the impact of recreation on caribou. This effort will focus on winter recreation, particularly snowmobiling, and will identify areas of existing or anticipated high snowmobile use, determine where such use conflicts with caribou, and develop recommendations for reducing or eliminating conflicts. An immediate need to expand information and education efforts has also been identified. This effort will involve summarizing ongoing activities, improving the dissemination of existing information, and identifying alternative funding sources.", "In commenting on our report, the British Columbia Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks stated that it supports the following priorities for caribou recovery in the southern Selkirks: (1) ensure a commitment to maintain funding for future recovery tasks; (2) produce a consolidated map of caribou habitat for British Columbia, Idaho, and Washington; (3) establish agreements for zoning and protecting critical winter habitats; (4) minimize recreational disturbance within those habitats; (5) proceed with a caribou/cougar morality study, including an action plan to deal with cougars identified as killing caribou; and (6) expand information and education programs to obtain public support for caribou recovery.", "As of February 1999, officials planning the recovery effort were also developing an estimate of the costs to implement these high-priority needs. In addition, the draft action plan states that there are other longer-term tasks that need to be addressed to ensure the recovery of the caribou.

For example, in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, Washington and Idaho received only about 65 and 57 percent, respectively, of the Section 6 grant funding they requested. Specifically, in fiscal year 1997, Washington asked for $225,000 and Idaho asked for $189,000 for caribou recovery efforts. They received $140,000 and $96,000, respectively. Both states asked for the same amounts in fiscal year 1998; they received $153,200 and $120,200, respectively. For fiscal year 1999, Washington was allocated about $97,000 of the $202,500 it requested and Idaho was allocated $120,000 of the $189,000 it requested. Idaho\u2019s Section 6 funding requests for these years covered the Selkirk ecosystem, including grizzly bear recovery projects. Only about 35 percent of the funds were used for caribou recovery projects. FWS acknowledged that it has not been able to fund caribou recovery work at requested levels but noted that it receives a limited appropriation for Section 6 grants that must be divided among 50 states. FWS stated that these funds, which are allocated to FWS regions on the basis of the number of species listed, are not sufficient to fund all state-proposed recovery projects.", "The funding concern was reiterated in a January 1999 letter from the chairman of the steering committee to the director of FWS\u2019 Region 1 in Portland, Oregon. The chairman noted that the partial funding of recovery efforts financed through Section 6 grants has compromised the success of these efforts over the past few years. For example, because of funding constraints, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife has had to reduce the number of flights it makes to monitor radio-collared caribou. This, in turn, has made it difficult to determine the causes of some caribou deaths. Furthermore, there is also concern about whether enough funding will be available to conduct a complete predator study that will yield valid data.", "The steering committee has also asked for an additional commitment of FWS staff to the recovery program. According to the chairman, caribou recovery is a multiagency, international program that cannot succeed without the commitment of FWS staff to coordinate the effort. Currently, according to FWS, its representative to the caribou recovery team can spend only a relatively small portion of her time on caribou recovery efforts because of a heavy workload pertaining to other ESA issues and activities.", "British Columbia officials have also expressed concern about the commitment of adequate U.S. resources to the recovery effort. For example, at a December 1998 steering committee meeting, the Kootenay regional director for the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks (the region that encompasses the Canadian portion of the recovery zone) indicated that unless British Columbia gets a clear signal of definite resolve from the United States to recover the southern Selkirk caribou population, further augmentation of the population will not be a high priority for British Columbia.", "Finally, the chairman of the steering committee stated that reversing the negative trend for the remaining caribou population would require a strong commitment of staff and funding from all of the participating agencies. He noted that while the other agencies have provided, and are continuing to provide, financial support, caribou recovery ultimately depends on a strong financial commitment from FWS. Officials involved in planning future recovery efforts recognize that all cooperating agencies need to determine whether caribou recovery is a high priority, since funding from these agencies is controlled by the priorities they set.

Although woodland caribou originally occurred in all Canadian border states (Hall 1981) and 350 miles south of their present range in Idaho (Johnson 1967), the Selkirk population of 25-30 woodland caribou is considered the last remaining herd in the 48 contiguous states.", "Selkirk caribou select seasonal habitats within their home range and movements include the classic double migration described by Edwards and Ritcey (1959) for woodland caribou in Wells Gray Provincial Park, British Columbia. Ecological and socioeconomic factors combine to make early winter habitat the most critical seasonal habitat. Early winter habitat is located in the old-growth cedar/hemlock forest types and between this type and the higher-elevation spruce/fir forest type. Most early winter habitat occurs between 1375 and 1675 meters, generally on northerly slopes (Scott and Servheen 1985). Old-growth cedar/hemlock is economically important to the timber industry because of the efficiency of harvest and consequently has been extensively logged in both Canadian and U.S. caribou habitat.", "Caribou begin a major shift in diet selection during the onset of early winter as plant aging and early snows decrease the availability and efficiency of harvest of vascular plants. Soft deep snows physically inhibit caribou from using the arboreal lichen component of the spruce/fir community until snow packs settle and harden. Therefore, caribou must adapt a foraging strategy intermediate to open fall grazing and late winter foraging on arboreal lichens. Weather conditions make early winter the most difficult time to monitor woodland caribou. Lack of information during early winter for Selkirk caribou and studies of woodland caribou (Edwards and Ritcey 1959, Stardom 1975, Bloomfield 1980, Antifeau 1985) and the need to better understand caribou use of early winter habitat in relation to forestry practices was the impetus for this research.", "Rominger, E.M., and J.L.

This research determined early winter habitat to be the most critical seasonal habitat because of the substantial use of the economically important old-growth western red cedar/western hemlock community and because snow reduced the availability of forage and initiated the transition from summer forage comprised primarily of vascular forage, to the late winter diet of almost exclusively arboreal lichens. These concerns were the impetus for the initiation of an in-depth study by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to map habitat components in critical drainages used by caribou during early winter and monitor habitat components at actual early winter caribou use sites during early winter (Rominger and Oldemeyer 1986).", "The objective of this report is to describe the physical and silvicultural components of the Waldie and Curtis Creek drainages and their tributaries.

Early winter use occurs primarily in mature/old-growth stands of economically important timber in both the Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir and the western red cedar/western hemlock communities; the area between the two communities is also used extensively. The lower-elevation, more densely canopied cedar/hemlock community is particularly important because snow is shallower there, which reduces energy costs to caribou and extends the availability of green vascular forage. In the higher-elevation, more open-canopied spruce/fir community, the increased costs of locomotion through deeper snow are apparently offset by increased availability of highly digestible arboreal lichens.", "Compared with randomly selected locations, actual caribou use sites had significantly (P<0.05) more lichen-bearing, recently windthrown trees; were at higher elevation; and had lower slope angles, canopy cover, and tree basal area. Arboreal lichen on windthrown trees was apparently important forage because vascular plants were buried by snow.", "Because Selkirk caribou use spruce/fir and cedar/hemlock communities extensively during early winter, we recommend that mature old-growth stands for both forest types be maintained.

This is a more reasonable estimate when compared with the dry forage and intake of other species. He cites Detrick (1984) as the most complete work, using the destructive technique of cutting branches, collecting all the lichen, and weighing it. The literature available usually refers to subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce.", "Factors to be considered in regard to the lichen intake rate of woodland caribou are the nutritional values, energy variation in foraging strategy, body size and winter severity. There is up to twice the protein in arboreal lichen as compared with terrestrial lichen. Foraging on arboreal lichen is probably more energy efficient than cratering of barren ground caribou. Milder (maritime) climates where caribou were not subjected to temperature extremes should also be considered. However, the larger body size of woodland caribou may cause an increase in intake rate compared with barren ground caribou.", "Rominger, E.M. 1990. \u201cResearch Continues on Augmentation of the Southern Selkirk Mountain Caribou Herd.\u201d Endangered Species Technical Bulletin, Vol. XV(8):6.", "Woodland caribou once occurred widely in forested regions from southeastern Alaska, through much of Canada, to the northern conterminous United States.

The animals in this herd were rarely seen in the United States because most of their seasonal habitats were in Canada. The potential threats to the survival of the southern Selkirk Mountain caribou herd while in the United States, including poaching, habitat loss, collisions with motor vehicles, and genetic problems from inbreeding, led the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the population as endangered in February 1984 (see BULLETIN Vol. IX, No. 3).", "Rominger, E.M., and J.L.

We estimated lichen biomass between two and six meters on standing trees to determine availability at various snow depths during late winter. This estimate was combined with a biomass value between six meters and treetop to estimate lichen availability on whole trees made available to caribou via windthrow. We sampled arboreal lichen from more than 1,050 branches on 266 trees and snags between two and six meters and more than 1,100 branches on 111 trees and snags between six meters and treetop. Total biomass estimates for three diameter-size classes ranged from 444 to 1,170 grams for dead trees and from 716 to 3,075 grams for live trees. Despite the universally large variances concomitant with estimating mean arboreal lichen biomass, the averages of several other studies on arboreal lichen biomass are similar to our estimate for two to six meters on whole trees.

Two populations, each representing an ecotype of woodland caribou, were used as sources for the reintroduction effort. Anahim Lake caribou (woodland ecotype) were captured in west-central British Columbia. Revelstoke caribou (mountain type) were captured in southeastern British Columbia. Over the first two years, 48 radio-collared caribou were released into the southern Selkirk Mountains, including 26 Anahim and 22 Revelstoke animals. A total of 962 relocations were recorded, 443 of which were sampled for habitat characteristics. Significantly more Revelstoke caribou emigrated from the release area and joined resident caribou herds in southern British Columbia, while Anahim caribou incurred significantly greater mortality. These differences were most apparent during the first year after release. Habitat use patterns revealed important interactions between the two translocated populations and the nearest resident (Stagleap, mountain ecotype) caribou herd. The two most important influences affecting the response of the caribou appeared to be their traditional habitat use patterns acquired from their native herds and the habitat use patterns learned, or assimilated, from other caribou after release. The late winter period showed the greatest difference between the caribou ecotypes. Anahim caribou used mature, densely forested areas on south-facing slopes, while the late winter habitat use of Revelstoke and Stagleap-area caribou showed no distinct pattern. There were also differences specific to the caribou populations during the other seasons. Summer habitat use patterns suggest that differences exist between the release area in northern Idaho and the area occupied by the resident Stagleap herd. Differences in habitat use between years of study indicated that some \u201crandom\u201d searching behavior occurred for several months following release and that the translocated caribou could adjust certain habitat use patterns in response to being placed in unfamiliar territory. All seasons revealed some similarities in habitat use between the caribou populations, indicating universal habitat needs of the woodland subspecies.

The interrelationship of snow depth, aspect, lichen biomass within vertical strata of trees, daily intake, constraints upon this intake, and tree density in relation to both forage dynamics and potential predator detection combine to make this process very complex.
