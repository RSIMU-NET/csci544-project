Many major projects have experienced substantial cost and schedule overruns, largely because of contract management problems. GAO was asked to assess, for major departmental projects, (1) DOE's use of performance incentives to effectively control costs and maintain schedules, (2) the reliability of the data DOE uses to monitor and assess contractor performance, and (3) the reliability of the Project Assessment and Reporting System (PARS) data that senior managers use for project oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOE could use performance incentives more effectively for controlling costs and schedules if it developed performance incentive guidance and assigned responsibility for reviewing a contract's project management provisions prior to award. DOE has awarded contracts for 15 of 33 major projects that use a schedule or other performance incentive without an associated cost incentive or constraint; thus a contractor could receive full fees by meeting all schedule baselines while substantially overrunning costs. DOE has relied on unvalidated contractor data to monitor contractors' progress in executing major projects and to award fees for performance. In particular, DOE's self-assessment of contract administration in 2002 found that field personnel overly relied on contractors' accounting systems and contractor-collected data in assessing performance, without significant validation of those data. No subsequent self-assessment has been conducted to determine if this problem continues. Furthermore, DOE has not required that its contracting officers receive the training needed to assess the adequacy of contractors' project management systems that generate data used to monitor progress. A lthough development of PARS is a positive step, the reliability of the project performance data that PARS provides to senior DOE managers is limited by problems with accuracy, completeness, and timeliness. Regarding accuracy, DOE has not assessed the reliability of contractors' project management systems that feed data into PARS for 31 of 33 major projects, even though DOE believes that some systems are deficient. Regarding completeness, GAO identified 3 major projects that are not in PARS. As to timeliness, cost and schedule data for 6 major projects in the June 2004 PARS report were significantly out of date because DOE has not required contractors to submit timely performance data. These contract management problems limit DOE's ability to effectively manage its major projects and avoid further cost and schedule slippages."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy (DOE) pays its contractors billions of dollars  each year to implement projects costing more than $400 million each,  which the department designates as major projects. These major projects  include environmental cleanup at its current and former nuclear weapons  production facilities, refurbishment of nuclear weapons, and construction  of specialized scientific facilities. Our previous reports have found that  many of DOE\u2019s major projects have experienced substantial cost overruns  and delays. As a result, since 1990, we have designated DOE\u2019s contract  management\u2014broadly defined to include contract administration and  project management\u2014as a high-risk area for fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement because of the department\u2019s history of inadequate  management and oversight and failure to hold its contractors accountable.  In recent years, we have continued to find problems with DOE\u2019s contract  management of its major projects. (See the list of related GAO products at  the end of this report.) For example, our 2002 assessment of DOE\u2019s  contract reform initiatives found that 5 of the 16 major projects we  examined had more than doubled in cost\u2014for billions of dollars in total  cost overruns\u2014and experienced more than 5 years in delays.", "In response to these problems, DOE has instituted contracting and project  management reforms. To better align DOE functions with challenges to  improve the planning, execution, and management of its contracts, the  department established the Office of Contract Management in 2000 with  responsibility for assisting the field and other DOE offices in the planning,  implementation, and oversight of (1) the contract award process, which  involves those front-end activities necessary to ensure that contracts are  structured in a way that best fulfills DOE\u2019s needs, and (2) the contract  administration process, which encompasses all dealings between DOE and  its contractors from the time a contract is awarded until the work has been  completed and accepted or the contract has been terminated, payment  made, and any disputes resolved. To improve the contract award process,  the Office of Contract Management has, among other things, developed  updates to DOE\u2019s Acquisition Guide, which amplifies upon the  requirements contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that  governs governmentwide federal procurement activities. Each year, the  Office of Contract Management reviews a limited number of pending  contract actions, including any matters affecting a contract\u2019s deliverables,  schedule, and cost. To improve the contract administration process, the  Office of Contract Management issued, in May 2000, a Reference Book for  Contract Administrators, a consolidated reference tool for DOE\u2019s contract  administrators. The office also has performed periodic self-assessments of  contract administration practices.", "As part of its project management reforms, DOE established the Office of  Engineering and Construction Management in 1999 to oversee the project  management process by developing project management policy, improving  project oversight systems, and implementing a career development  program for DOE project managers. In particular, the Office of Engineering  and Construction Management in 2001 implemented the Project  Assessment and Reporting System (PARS), a Web-based system for  collecting and analyzing current performance data for projects costing  more than $5 million. Although the department has other ways to  communicate project status information, including quarterly reports for  some projects, PARS monthly project status reports for the Deputy  Secretary of Energy (hereafter referred to as PARS reports) are DOE\u2019s  primary tool for keeping senior managers apprised of a project\u2019s  performance. In August 2003, the office initiated a certification program for  contractors\u2019 project management systems that assesses the accuracy of the  cost and schedule performance data that contractors generate by  examining, in particular, whether each contractor\u2019s system complies with  private industry\u2019s standard for earned value management\u2014a systematic  approach for integrating and measuring cost, schedule, and technical  (scope) accomplishments on a project.", "You asked us to examine DOE\u2019s contract management actions designed to  control cost growth and schedule slippage for its major projects.  Specifically, you asked us to assess, for major departmental projects, (1)  DOE\u2019s use of performance incentives to effectively control costs and  maintain schedules, (2) the reliability of the data DOE uses to monitor and  assess contractor performance, and (3) the reliability of the PARS data that  senior managers use for project oversight. Our review focused primarily on  the 33 major projects that had passed, as of March 2004, DOE\u2019s Critical  Decision 2 milestone\u2014the point at which the department approves a  project\u2019s cost, schedule, and scope baselines on the basis of an approved  conceptual design report and acquisition strategy. (See app. I for the 33  major projects that we reviewed.) The projects we reviewed include 28  projects that cost more than $400 million each and 5 projects that our 2002  assessment defined as major projects because their total costs exceeded  $100 million. DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management (Environmental  Management), Office of Science, and National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA) are funding the 33 major projects.", "To determine DOE\u2019s guidance for using different performance incentives  for major projects, we examined the contract provisions for the 33 major  projects that have DOE-approved performance baselines, reviewed various  recent contract-related documents associated with these 33 projects, and  discussed the contents of these documents with key DOE contracting  officials. We then compared the contract provisions with requirements in  the FAR; the DOE Acquisition Regulation; and DOE\u2019s contract-award  guidance, including the Performance-Based Contracting Guide and the  Acquisition Guide. To assess DOE\u2019s oversight of contract administration  activities, we reviewed DOE\u2019s Reference Book for Contract  Administrators, compared the findings made in DOE\u2019s various contract  administration self-assessment reports with the actions the department has  taken, and interviewed contracting officials at the Department of Defense  and administrators at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  because DOE officials acknowledged their leadership in implementing  such project and contract management reforms as earned value  management principles. To evaluate the reliability of PARS data, we  assessed the data\u2019s accuracy, completeness, and timeliness by examining  the underlying data and the way data are reported to senior managers. For  example, we compared the information in monthly PARS reports from  January through September 2004 with project-specific data obtained from  various DOE program offices. When we identified discrepancies, we  assessed whether the discrepancies limited the reliability of data reported  in PARS. Given our review of the documentation provided by DOE and our  discussions with DOE officials, we have reservations about the reliability  of PARS data. These issues are discussed in this report. We conducted our  work between January 2004 and January 2005 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards, which included an assessment of  data reliability and internal controls.

In fulfilling their missions, DOE\u2019s  program offices are responsible for contracting for and overseeing the  execution of the department\u2019s major projects, many of which are first-of-a- kind efforts and thus involve substantial risk and may also be separate line  items in DOE\u2019s budget. For example:  Environmental Management\u2019s mission is to accelerate risk reduction  and cleanup of the environmental legacy of the nation\u2019s nuclear  weapons program and government-sponsored nuclear energy research.  Environmental Management has used a single sitewide contract that  involves several major projects costing billions of dollars for cleaning up  some of its former facilities. In addition, Environmental Management  has undertaken many large-scale individual projects. For example, the  Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant project is an  important part of the cleanup effort at Hanford, Washington. The  project, which was initiated in December 2000, is intended to treat and  prepare for disposal 55 million gallons of high-level radioactive waste by  July 2011 at an estimated cost of $5.7 billion.", "NNSA\u2019s mission is to meet national security requirements by, among  other things, maintaining and enhancing the safety, reliability, and  performance of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, which includes  maintaining the capability to design, produce, and test nuclear weapons.  To fulfill this mission, NNSA undertakes such projects as refurbishing  W-80 nuclear warheads to extend their operational lives. The W-80  refurbishment project was initiated in September 1998 and is expected  to be completed in fiscal year 2017 at an estimated cost of about $2.45  billion.", "The Office of Science\u2019s mission is to deliver the remarkable discoveries  and scientific tools that transform our understanding of energy and  matter and advance the national, economic, and energy security of the  United States. To fulfill this mission, the Office of Science has  constructed specialized scientific research facilities, such as the  Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This  project consists of an accelerator system that delivers short  (microsecond) pulses to a target/moderator system where neutrons are  produced by a nuclear reactor process called spallation. This project is  designed to provide the next-generation spallation neutron source for  neutron scattering and related research in broad areas of the physical,  chemical, materials, biological, and medical sciences. The Spallation  Neutron Source project began in October 1998 and is expected to be  completed in June 2006 at an estimated cost of about $1.4 billion.", "DOE\u2019s principal official responsible for the execution of a major project is  the federal project director, who is located at the project site and is  supported by project managers. The project director is responsible for  overseeing a project\u2019s design, execution, budgeting, and performance. For  contracts with award fee provisions, senior DOE program office managers  consult with contracting and project officers to assess a contractor\u2019s  performance and determine the appropriate award fees.", "In addition to the contract management problems our prior reports have  identified, a recent series of reports by the National Research Council of  the National Academies identified weaknesses in DOE\u2019s project  management. The council\u2019s 2004 report cited several factors that have  contributed to the slow pace of project management improvements and  resulted in inconsistent project performance. These factors include the  desire of DOE site office personnel and contractors to be independent of  oversight from DOE headquarters, insufficient support for training,  inadequate numbers of DOE project managers to oversee contractors\u2019  performance, and the absence of a champion for project managers and  process improvement who has the authority to ensure both adherence to  policies and procedures and the availability of necessary funding and  personnel resources.", "During the past year, DOE has continued to implement contracting and  project management reforms. In particular, in December 2003, the  Secretary of Energy appointed an Associate Deputy Secretary with  responsibility, among other things, for both contract and project  management, addressing a key National Research Council concern. DOE  also entered into an agreement with the Defense Contract Management  Agency, within the Department of Defense, to support the certification of  contractors\u2019 project management systems. More recently, DOE is  developing an action plan in response to the Civil Engineering Research  Foundation\u2019s assessment of departmental project management that  recommended that DOE, among other things, develop a core group of  highly qualified project directors, require peer reviews for first-of-a-kind  and technically complex projects when the projects\u2019 preliminary baselines  are approved, and enhance PARS by making the data more timely.   Furthermore, to improve its contract award process, DOE revised its  Acquisition Guide by adding chapter 16, which lists the various contract  types available and discusses their respective advantages and constraints.  To address future skill gaps in its procurement organization, DOE  established an acquisition career development program and has certified 90  percent of its procurement professionals as attaining mandatory training  and experience standards under this program. Within the Office of  Environmental Management, a series of contract and project management  improvements have occurred consisting of, but not limited to, providing  additional training and managing more of the cleanup work as projects.  Within the Office of Contract Management, a series of contract award and  administration initiatives have been completed. These initiatives include,  among other things, strengthening contract competition policies and  practices, improving acquisition workforce effectiveness, increasing small  business utilization throughout DOE, and strengthening DOE management  and fiscal effectiveness. For fiscal year 2005, the Office of Contract  Management has multiple initiatives planned, including identifying and  implementing follow-on actions related to the DOE management challenge  pertaining to contract competition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Could Use Performance Incentives More Effectively for Controlling Costs and Schedules", "paragraphs": ["Because many of DOE\u2019s major projects are first-of-a-kind and thus involve  substantial risk, DOE\u2019s contracting decisions can be critical to the  successful completion of its major projects.

For  example, DOE has used contracts that have a technical, schedule, or other  performance incentive without an associated cost incentive or cost  constraint (other than the annual funding level for the contract). DOE also  has used cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts without certifying that  contractors\u2019 project management systems generate reliable cost and  schedule data for measuring performance and awarding fees. In addition,  we found that the contract incentives for most of the 25 major  environmental restoration projects substantially differ from the \u201cGold  Chart\u201d performance metrics that Environmental Management uses to  assess its performance and report its progress to the Congress.  Furthermore, for 11 major projects that are components of the  environmental cleanup of a DOE facility, Environmental Management has  not directly linked incentive fees to the successful completion of the  project, generally because the project is part of the contractor\u2019s larger  cleanup responsibility.

To accomplish  these goals, the order states, in part, that DOE officials are to develop an  acquisition plan during the acquisition process that includes such  elements as contracting options and a contractor incentive process. The  order, however, does not elaborate on the possible contracting and  performance incentive options whatsoever.", "In March 2003, DOE issued manual 413.3-1, \u201cProject Management for the  Acquisition of Capital Assets,\u201d to improve the implementation of DOE  Order 413.3. The manual addresses various activities, including a  chapter on contracting that contains no direct reference to major  projects. The chapter states that the type of contract and incentives  proposed should be based on an overall view of the principal risks to the  project and provides a limited discussion of the types of contracts  available. For example, it states that fixed-price contracts are not  appropriate for research and development efforts or other complex  projects where there is a high degree of uncertainty in the execution or  DOE requirements.

Similarly, DOE Acquisition  Regulation \u00a7 970.5215-3 provides that requirements incentivized by other  than cost incentives must be performed within their specified cost  constraint. DOE\u2019s Performance-Based Contracting Guide, dated October  2003, states that (1) cost incentives should be included if other incentives  are included because a schedule or other performance incentive may result  in the contractor paying little attention to the cost of achieving those  incentives unless cost is also a consideration and (2) DOE contracts, in  developing incentives and incentive programs, must comply with the  incentive contract provisions of the FAR and the DOE Acquisition  Regulation.", "The Director of the Office of Contract Management told us that to  implement the FAR requirement to include a cost incentive or cost  constraint whenever a noncost incentive is in the contract, each noncost  incentive does not necessarily need an associated cost constraint dedicated  to that noncost incentive. According to the director, a single cost  constraint, which could be equivalent to the project\u2019s annual funding level,  would fulfill the FAR requirement.", "However, DOE contracting officials at Oak Ridge, West Valley, and  Savannah River believe that to implement the FAR and DOE Acquisition  Regulation requirements in a way that effectively controls costs, a contract  with a technical, schedule, or other noncost incentive should also have an  associated cost incentive to function as a constraint on the expenditure of  funds. One of these officials added that as the noncost incentives become  more objective and measurable, the cost constraint should be more clearly  defined in relation to each noncost incentive. Similarly, another one of  these officials told us that using the annual funding level or the project\u2019s  cost baseline as the constraint is too vague and unworkable, and that some  funding levels and cost baselines do not track down to the performance  incentive level.

In recent years, DOE has made a major effort to move  toward the use of cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts.", "Because a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract provides higher fee awards to  the extent that actual costs are lower than anticipated, it depends upon  reliable cost estimating at the outset in the form of a target cost and reliable  cost reporting later. In July 1997, the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) issued requirements regarding the acceptability of contractors\u2019  project management systems. However, DOE has not certified the  reliability of contractors\u2019 project management systems that generate the  target cost data for the 13 major projects.

For  fiscal year 2003, DOE awarded the contractor about $7.7 million of the $8  million in available fee, or 97 percent, on the basis of acceptable cost and  schedule performance toward closure of the entire site during fiscal year  2003. However, according to the fiscal year 2003 Gold Chart metrics, the  goal for the Fernald Closure Project was to accomplish four radioactive  facility completions and dispose of 2,568 cubic meters of radioactive  waste. According to Environmental Management information, the  contractor did not fully complete one of these tasks. Because the  contractor accomplished only three of the four radioactive facility  completions, Environmental Management might have given a different fee  amount if the two Gold Chart metrics had been used to determine award  fee.", "Conversely, a different fee amount might have been warranted for the Solid  Waste Stabilization and Disposition project at Hanford, Washington. For  fiscal year 2003, DOE awarded the contractor about $2.2 million of about $3  million in available fee, or 73 percent, on the basis of the contractor\u2019s  disposal of radioactive waste in accordance with an approved schedule  that DOE determined the contractor had met. In contrast, Environmental  Management data for fiscal year 2003, using Gold Chart metrics, show that  the contractor actually disposed of 3,634 cubic meters of waste as  compared with a goal of disposing 2,320 cubic meters of waste, or about  157 percent of the work intended. If the Gold Chart metrics had been used  to determine the award fee, the contractor might have received a different  fee amount.", "For the Spent Nuclear Fuels project, at Hanford, Washington, the Gold  Chart metric and the contract\u2019s performance incentive were so dissimilar  that it was difficult to determine how to gauge the contractor\u2019s  performance. For fiscal year 2003, DOE awarded the contractor about $2.8  million of about $3.3 million in available fee, or 85 percent, on the basis of  the contractor\u2019s removing 777 metric tons, or 87 percent, of the 890 metric  tons that had been planned. However, Environmental Management data for  fiscal year 2003, using the Gold Chart metrics, show the contractor  removed 805 units, or 94 percent, of the goal\u2019s 855 units.

In commenting on the draft report,  Environmental Management officials stated that the new Savannah River  cleanup contract incorporates Gold Chart metrics. They added, however,  that the contract renewals for the Oak Ridge, Fernald, and Rocky Flats  facilities do not contain the Gold Chart metrics because each is a cost-plus- incentive-fee contract that awards fee based on the final closure costs and  date for the site. It is unclear whether these cost-plus-incentive-fee  contracts will more effectively track contractors\u2019 performance because  they rely on contractors\u2019 project management systems that DOE has yet to  certify.

Earned value management, when used  correctly, produces data that reflect a contractor\u2019s progress toward  completing a project within cost and schedule targets. In essence, earned  value management measures the value of work completed against the cost  and schedule of work planned, as opposed to comparing actual with  planned expenditures. To illustrate, assume a contract calls for 4 miles of  railroad track to be laid in 4 weeks at a cost of $4 million. After 3 weeks of  work, assume $2 million has been spent. By analyzing planned versus  actual expenditures, it appears the project is underrunning the estimated  costs. However, an earned value analysis reveals that the project is in  trouble because even though only $2 million has been spent, only 1 mile of  track has been laid; thus, the contract is only 25 percent complete. On the  basis of the value of work done, the project will cost $8 million ($2 million  to complete each mile of track), and the 4 miles of track will take a total of  12 weeks (3 weeks for each mile of track) to complete instead of the  originally estimated 4 weeks.", "To ensure correct application of earned value management principles,  contractors must develop budgets and schedules based on measurable  components of a project, which include defined start points, end points,  and scopes of work. In addition, contractors must calculate the value of  work performed against the budgets and schedules for the measurable  project components. Experts in earned value management told us that  without defined start and end points and other measurable project  components, project performance data give little insight as to whether cost  and schedule performance are on track, and the data might mask more  serious problems.", "DOE\u2019s Office of Engineering and Construction Management and the  Defense Contract Management Agency assess whether a given contractor\u2019s  project management system properly uses earned value management  principles by examining whether the contractor\u2019s system complies with the  industry standards and verifying that the contractor is using the system to  manage the project. Once a contractor has fully addressed the concerns  identified by the assessment, DOE is to certify the project management  system, attesting that project performance data\u2014data that convey progress  toward the approved cost and schedule targets\u2014are generated reliably.  Assessment and certification of contractors\u2019 earned value management  systems are critical components of DOE\u2019s management of its performance- based contracting, according to DOE earned value management training  documents. While only three systems have been assessed since August  2003, Office of Engineering and Construction Management officials told us  that they and the Defense Contract Management Agency, working together,  could assess the project management systems for about 10 contractors in a  given year now that they are becoming more familiar with the process.", "In August 2003, the Office of Engineering and Construction Management  and the Defense Contract Management Agency began the process of  assessing contractors\u2019 project management systems as a basis for certifying  that they properly use earned value management principles. In September  2004, DOE certified Sandia National Laboratories\u2019 project management  system for 1 major project, the Microsystems and Engineering Sciences  Applications project, and 6 smaller projects. DOE also plans to certify Oak  Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s project management system for another major  project, the Spallation Neutron Source, once minor deficiencies are  corrected. Overall, however, DOE has assessed project management  systems for only 2 of the 33 major projects we reviewed\u2014and 8 of the 73  projects in PARS\u2014that have passed Critical Decision 2 with DOE-approved  cost and schedule baselines. (The remaining 65 projects in PARS whose  systems have not been assessed have baseline costs of nearly $75 billion.)   According to an Office of Engineering and Construction Management  official, the first three contractors\u2019 systems were selected for assessment  on the basis of visibility, significance, and criticality to the Department\u2019s  success, but also because cognizant DOE officials were confident that the  contractors\u2019 project management systems would meet certification criteria.", "The National Research Council\u2019s 2004 report on DOE\u2019s project management  found that the quality of earned value management across the department\u2019s  projects was inconsistent and stated that senior DOE managers do not  know whether the reported data on cost and schedule performance are  accurate unless contractors\u2019 systems are assessed and certified. Because  DOE has only recently begun to assess contractors\u2019 project management  systems that feed data into PARS, DOE officials acknowledged to us that  they lack assurance regarding the accuracy of PARS performance data,  adding that they believe some of the project management systems not yet  assessed have important deficiencies. For example, a DOE expert in earned  value management noted that contractors for most Environmental  Management projects\u2014about half of the projects in PARS that have passed  Critical Decision 2\u2014have not properly implemented earned value  management principles because, among other things, many of the projects\u2019  components lack defined start and end points. For example, the earned  value management expert believes, on the basis of his assessment of work  breakdown structures and other project components, that the contractor\u2019s  project management system for the $10-billion Yucca Mountain Nuclear  Waste Repository project does not properly use earned value management  principles and generates performance data that cannot be regarded as  accurate. Consequently, senior DOE managers have no assurance that cost  and schedule targets will be met, even if the data suggest they will.", "Similarly, for several major projects we examined, the contractors\u2019 project  management systems do not seem to properly implement earned value  management principles to measure cost and schedule performance. For  example, the $2-billion East Tennessee Technology Park project at Oak  Ridge lacks measurable project components. In some instances, work is  categorized into activities such as \u201cgeneral operations\u201d and \u201ccontractor  operations\u201d that have no apparent defined start and end points. According  to the expert in earned value management, the categories of work for this  project make it difficult to accurately measure project performance  because there is no clear activity or time frame against which to measure  costs incurred or time spent. Instead, PARS data for this project seem to  measure only the project\u2019s expenditures, which can conceal information on  the project\u2019s cost and schedule status and progress toward completion. In  addition, the $5.7-billion Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at  Hanford, Washington, lacks discrete, measurable project components  because work is categorized into activities such as \u201cproviding technology\u201d  and \u201cproviding infrastructure\u201d that lack defined start and end points. While  we recognize that it is appropriate, according to industry standards, to  categorize a small amount of work in this fashion, DOE project  management officials said the particular categories of work in these  instances reflected a poor comprehension of earned value management  and limited their confidence in the assessment of project performance.", "Two Office of Engineering and Construction Management officials  acknowledged that the accuracy of data for these projects is uncertain  because DOE has not assessed whether the contractors\u2019 project  management systems properly applied earned value management  principles. One of these officials suggested that the contractors\u2019 project  management systems for such projects should be assessed as soon as  possible to correct deficiencies and improve the reliability of project  performance data provided to senior managers to oversee progress toward  cost and schedule targets. The Director of the Office of Engineering and  Construction Management agreed that DOE should develop a schedule that  would give priority to assessing these and other high-risk and high-cost  systems. As of January 2005, a schedule had not been developed, but the  director told us that he was in the process of doing so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PARS Reports Generally Do Not Show Total Cost Overruns and Schedule Slippages", "paragraphs": ["The accuracy of the PARS report data is further impaired because PARS  reports generally do not show total cost overruns and schedule slippages,  even though DOE requires each project team to estimate life-cycle costs  and assess project performance against established cost and schedule  baselines. Instead, a project\u2019s DOE project director updates the cost and  schedule baselines in PARS when DOE approves a contract modification.  As a result, PARS reports show relatively small variances between a  project\u2019s actual performance and its approved baselines, so that many of  the projects we reviewed appear not to have experienced problems when,  in fact, they did. For almost all projects, PARS reports do not provide data  that would enable senior DOE managers to assess (1) a contractor\u2019s  performance against the project\u2019s original DOE-approved baselines to  identify total cost overruns and schedule slippages or (2) the effect of any  DOE initiatives to control a project\u2019s costs. The Civil Engineering Research  Foundation\u2019s July 2004 report similarly found that PARS cost and schedule  data often do not convey the actual status of projects since their inception  because of periodic revisions of cost or schedule baselines. Furthermore,  for most Environmental Management projects, PARS measures project  performance from arbitrary dates, such as the beginning of the fiscal year,  which do not necessarily correspond to progress toward DOE-approved  targets. The following examples illustrate how PARS has masked problems  with projects by giving an incomplete picture of project costs or project  performance:  The January 2004 PARS report showed that the $1.6-billion Spent  Nuclear Fuels Stabilization and Disposition project at Hanford,  Washington, was on track to meet cost and schedule performance  targets. However, by April, total costs for the project increased by  nearly $150 million. DOE officials acknowledged that because the  January 2004 PARS report to senior DOE managers measured only  project performance from the beginning of the fiscal year, instead of  against the DOE-approved baselines, the PARS report concealed longer  term problems that threatened the project\u2019s completion within costs.", "In October 2002, the Tritium Extraction Facility at Savannah River,  South Carolina, had an approved total cost of about $400 million. Costs  for the project increased more than $100 million by September 2003, and  subsequent PARS reports showed that costs were on track to meet cost  targets, despite the 25 percent increase in the project\u2019s costs.", "In June 2004, Environmental Management restructured the PARS  reporting for 4 projects at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, by combining their  respective costs and schedules with those of other Oak Ridge projects.   As a result, Environmental Management stopped reporting project  performance data for each project, masking the fact that 2 of them,  totaling about $300 million, were significantly behind schedule. Two  Office of Engineering and Construction Management officials believe  the projects should be reported separately because combining projects\u2019  respective cost and schedule data can inhibit the correct use of earned  value management.", "The April 2004 PARS report showed that the total cost of the Soil and  Water Remediation project at Ashtabula, Ohio, would be $45 million,  although the performance data indicated the project would not likely  meet its baselines. However, this amount does not include about $109  million in expenditures on this project by October 1, 2003.  Environmental Management reports this project\u2019s total costs to be about  $157 million\u2014more than three times the amount reported in PARS.", "PARS reports that total project costs for the Nuclear Facility  Deactivation and Decommissioning project at Columbus, Ohio, will be  about $31.5 million.

Environmental Management  estimates that this project\u2019s total cost will exceed $163 million\u2014more  than five times the amount reported in PARS.", "The June 2004 PARS report showed that 90 percent of the 63 projects with  approved baselines were expected to meet their cost and schedule  baselines. However, this percentage may reflect project managers\u2019 efforts  to keep the projects\u2019 baselines up to date rather than improvements in  project management performance because PARS generally measures  projects\u2019 performance against the most current DOE-approved baselines.  For example, as shown in table 1, the October 2002 PARS report\u2019s  assessment of 2 major projects was red because both projects were  expected to breach their cost/schedule performance baselines. However,  the September 2003 PARS report\u2019s assessment of these major projects was  green because total project costs were within the revised baseline that  DOE had subsequently approved. The September 2003 PARS report did not  indicate the extent to which each project\u2019s total costs had exceeded the  costs that DOE approved at Critical Decision 2 on the basis of an approved  conceptual design report and acquisition strategy.", "In addition to these projects, the 90 percent figure includes many  Environmental Management projects, whose performance is measured  over time frames that do not necessarily reflect performance against DOE- approved baselines. Further, the 90 percent figure does not reflect the 4  Oak Ridge projects whose performance data showed imminent  performance problems before being combined with the performance data  of other projects at the site.", "DOE officials told us that the monthly PARS reports are the primary tool  for communicating project performance information to senior  management. However, for many projects\u2014particularly those overseen by  Environmental Management\u2014PARS does not report projects\u2019 life-cycle  costs or performance against original baselines, even though DOE requires  each project team to estimate life-cycle costs and assess project  performance against established cost baselines and schedule milestones.

In some cases, project  performance data are not reported because the project is incorrectly listed  as being in the design phase when, in fact, it has passed Critical Decision 2.  For example, contractors have spent almost half of the approved funds for  2 projects at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory  projected to cost $4.3 billion without reporting performance data in PARS.   The PARS reports show that these projects are still in the design phase and,  therefore, are not subject to reporting performance data, but a DOE official  acknowledged that both projects have, in fact, passed Critical Decision 3  and other subsequent milestones. As a result, senior DOE managers cannot  rely on PARS for accurate and current performance information for these  projects, nor can they rely on PARS to determine whether these projects  require corrective actions.", "For these and other projects, PARS also lacks forward-looking data, such  as scheduled work to be performed, the projects\u2019 upcoming milestones,  and the projects\u2019 estimated cost at completion. Without such data, PARS  cannot provide information on projects\u2019 cost or schedule challenges and  DOE management does not have a basis for projecting progress or  identifying trends. While not in PARS, this information is available from  acting project directors. For example, although early cost savings for the  Microsystems and Engineering Sciences Applications project at Sandia  National Laboratories led to favorable performance data, DOE\u2019s project  director identified supply imbalances in the steel market that would  increase the estimated construction costs. Using this information, the  project director revised the project\u2019s estimated total cost. Currently, PARS  reports to senior DOE managers lack such forward-looking data that could  alert them to future cost or schedule challenges. The National Research  Council\u2019s 2004 report stated that PARS reports should display forward- looking data to notify senior managers of upcoming milestones.

For example, PARS report data show that the Hanford\u2019s Tank Waste  Treatment and Immobilization Plant is projected to meet the DOE- approved baseline of $5.78 billion. However, PARS does not show that DOE  approved a $1.4-billion increase above the project\u2019s original contract  estimate of $4.35 billion in April 2003, nor does it show that the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, in a May 2004 report, stated that project costs would  probably exceed the $5.78-billion cost baseline by $720 million.", "Even though the DOE project management teams knew of cost and  schedule performance problems for the Tank Waste Treatment and  Immobilization Plant project, PARS reports have shown that this project  was on track for meeting cost and schedule targets.

In these  instances, data were out of date because DOE has not effectively enforced  requirements that contractors produce updated monthly cost and schedule  performance data, and that project directors ensure current performance  data are reported into PARS. For some projects, the lack of up-to-date data  masked problems that resulted in cost overruns and schedule slippages.  For instance:  The September 2003 PARS report showed that the Spent Nuclear Fuels  project at Hanford, Washington, was on track to meet its DOE-approved  total project cost of about $1.6 billion and its schedule completion date  of 2007; however, these data were 3 months out of date. Subsequently,  the April 2004 PARS report (1) showed that total project costs had  exceeded the project\u2019s cost baseline by nearly $150 million and (2)  indicated that the project would exceed this revised total cost and the  scheduled completion date would slip.

However,  the contractor did not update the project\u2019s performance data until April  2004, when the PARS report showed the project would still meet its cost  baseline. Environmental Management officials told us that although they  knew for several months that the K25/27 project\u2019s total cost would  exceed its baseline, the PARS cost data were not updated because the  project was being combined with 5 other Oak Ridge projects. The total  cost of the K25/27 project could exceed $400 million\u2014more than 50  percent above the DOE-approved total project cost.", "In June 2004, the Soil and Water Remediation project at Pantex, Texas,  had a DOE-approved total project cost of about $175 million, but the  Office of Engineering and Construction Management could not assess  the project\u2019s performance because data were not provided.  Subsequently, the September 2004 PARS report showed that the project  was at risk of exceeding its DOE-approved schedule target.", "In addition to these timeliness problems, the monthly data in PARS reports  typically lag a project\u2019s actual performance by 2 to 3 months because of the  time contractors need to generate the data and the time DOE project  managers need to review and incorporate the summary data into the PARS  database. The 2004 National Research Council report stated that the lack of  timely data prevents senior managers from using PARS to assess the  performance of projects in real time. Similarly, Department of Defense  officials familiar with project management have said that using such data to  assess project performance is like \u201coverseeing by looking through a rear  view mirror\u201d because performance problems have usually gotten worse by  the time departmental managers become aware of them.", "We found that the Department of Defense requires all of its newer contracts  to use electronic data interchange to provide more timely information to  department program managers. In addition, some acting project directors  told us that electronically linking PARS to contractors\u2019 project management  systems would improve timeliness because manually entering cost and  schedule data into the PARS database had often resulted in delays of 2 to 3  months to complete the process. In some instances, data were entered  incorrectly, although in each instance the data were corrected before being  reported to senior managers. While the DOE project directors we  contacted uniformly agree that manually entered data are correctly entered  by the time PARS monthly reports are delivered to senior managers,  electronically linking PARS to contractor systems could eliminate the  potential for such errors and enhance senior managers\u2019 ability to address  potential cost or schedule challenges in real time. Alternatively, DOE might  include a provision requiring timely monthly reporting in all applicable  contracts.", "When data can be relied upon, DOE senior managers have taken corrective  actions to address cost or schedule challenges while minimizing costs to  the government. For example, NNSA terminated the Sandia Underground  Reactor Facility project, which was intended to reduce the future  operational costs associated with securing a reactor, when management  learned that cost estimates had increased by more than 150 percent  between project conception and the final design phase. The project was  terminated before costs were incurred. In another instance, Environmental  Management approved a contractor\u2019s recovery plan to complete the Melton  Valley Closure project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, whose schedule  performance had slipped dramatically and required corrective actions.

Two deficiencies\u2014the lack of contracting  criteria for major projects and the lack of reviews of the project  management terms in major project contracts\u2014have resulted in  questionable DOE contracting decisions that limit its ability to effectively  control cost and schedule performance. For example, many of DOE\u2019s  contracts for major projects have used performance incentives that have  used a technical, schedule, or performance incentive without an associated  cost incentive or cost constraint, thereby giving contractors an incentive to  pay limited attention to costs when working toward meeting technical or  performance levels in order to earn a higher award fee.", "Furthermore, for major projects, DOE has given insufficient emphasis to  the oversight of contract administration, which begins after contracts are  awarded and helps ensure that the department gets what it pays for. DOE  needs to give increased emphasis to reviewing how it administers  contracts; correcting previously identified weaknesses, such as  overreliance on contractor data; and providing training to its contracting  officers.
