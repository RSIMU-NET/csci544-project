However, the two centers that stopped using SCRIPS to process Forms 1040EZ last year are experiencing slower processing rates than those of last year. Despite the improved performance, SCRIPS is far from the level of performance IRS had originally expected. For example, IRS originally planned to be processing all Forms 1040EZ on SCRIPS by 1996; it now expects to process about 50 percent of the Forms 1040EZ received in 1996 on SCRIPS. The remaining forms are being processed through IRS\u2019 manual data entry system.", "Although IRS made changes to SCRIPS and performance has improved, we are concerned that IRS did not establish more specific performance expectations for SCRIPS this filing season. IRS specified volume expectations by form type, but it did not establish expectations for improvements in processing rates or reductions in system down time that should result from the enhancements made for the 1996 filing season.
