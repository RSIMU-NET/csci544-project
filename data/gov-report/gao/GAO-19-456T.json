F-35 aircraft are assessed against eight R&M metrics, which inform how much time the aircraft will be in maintenance rather than operations. Half of these metrics are not meeting targets. While the program office has a plan for improving R&M, its guidance is not in line with GAO's acquisition best practices or internal control standards as it does not include specific, measurable objectives, align improvement projects to meet those objectives, and prioritize funding to match resources to R&M requirements. If the R&M requirements are not met, the warfighter will have to settle for a less reliable and more costly aircraft than originally planned. This contributes to the F-35's $1.12 trillion estimated sustainment costs and challenges with maintaining an expanding fleet that also has supply chain and logistics system problems.", "GAO's ongoing work indicates that the Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS)\u2014intended to provide battle management command and control and surveillance across air, land, and sea\u2014is in the early stages of planning.

It started formal operational testing of the baseline aircraft in December  2018 after a 3-month delay. This testing was delayed for two main  reasons: (1) to resolve critical deficiencies identified in developmental  testing, and (2) to accommodate an unexpected grounding following the  crash of an F-35B in September 2018. According to a test official, the  program expects to complete testing in December 2019, about 3 months  later than planned due to delays with the simulator that is used for more  complex testing. Until that testing is complete, there is still a risk that  additional deficiencies may be identified. With the program wrapping up  development of the baseline program, it is transitioning to early  development and testing activities for the Block 4 modernization efforts,  which the F-35 Joint Program Office estimates will cost about $10.5  billion. With Block 4, DOD plans to add new capabilities and modernize  the F-35 aircraft to address evolving threats.", "In April 2019, we found that DOD will not have a complete business case  for Block 4 before it plans to award development contracts in 2019.

In 2018, we found that DOD\u2019s report to Congress  was incomplete. In its report, DOD stated that the acquisition program  baseline would continue to be refined over the next year. DOD officials  stated that the updated F-35 program baseline, with the Block 4 efforts  included, will be released in April 2019.", "Over the past year, the program has already invested over $1.4 billion, in  part to gain the knowledge it needs to develop that business case, such  as a preliminary design review, as well as to establish Block 4 testing  facilities and support early capabilities\u2019 development. The program  incorporated some Block 4 activities into its acquisition strategy, which  was approved in October 2018. However, we found that three key Block 4  business case documents will not be ready before the program\u2019s planned  development contract awards in May 2019:  Independent Technology Readiness Assessment: A Technology  Readiness Assessment is a systematic, evidence-based process that  evaluates the maturity of hardware and software technologies critical  to the performance of a larger system or the fulfillment of the key  objectives of an acquisition program. The program office plans to  conduct a partial independent assessment of initial capabilities  sometime between October and December 2019 with additional  assessments to follow. A program official stated that technologies will  not be integrated into the aircraft until they are adequately mature.  However, without a complete independent Technology Readiness  Assessment, the program will not have identified potential critical  technology elements and, as a result, may be at risk of delaying the  delivery of new capabilities.", "Test and Evaluation Master Plan: Although the F-35 program has  begun testing Block 4 capabilities, it does not have an approved Test  and Evaluation Master Plan. The Test and Evaluation Master Plan  documents the overall structure, strategy, and objectives, as well as  the associated resources needed for execution. Developmental and  operational test officials have expressed concerns about the lack of  an approved test plan, uncertain funding, the number of test aircraft  available, and the draft test schedule, among other things. An  approved, properly resourced test plan is essential for planning and  preparing for adequate testing of the Block 4 capabilities. According to  these officials, without an approved plan, the F-35 program is  providing the test authorities with capabilities to be tested without  giving them the necessary direction on how to adequately prepare to  conduct the tests, making it difficult to execute testing. While this is  still a concern, F-35 program officials explained that over the past 3  months they have been providing the test authorities with the direction  needed to conduct testing.", "Independent Cost Estimate: The Block 4 Independent Cost  Estimate, which details the program\u2019s total estimated life cycle cost, is  not complete. In August 2017, we reported that DOD estimated the  development funding needed for the first phase of Block 4 was  projected to be over $3.9 billion through 2022. Since then, the  program incorporated more fidelity and specific Block 4 efforts that  were not in the original estimate into its Block 4 cost estimate. Based  on the program office\u2019s latest estimate, the cost of Block 4 capabilities  is expected to be $10.5 billion through 2024. According to OSD\u2019s Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation office, it will provide the  Independent Cost Estimate between October and December 2019 to  support the F-35 program\u2019s pending full-rate production decision, but  this would occur several months after the program plans to award the  Block 4 development contracts. According to the GAO Cost Guide, an  Independent Cost Estimate is considered one of the best and most  reliable estimate validation methods as it provides an independent  view of expected program costs that tests the program office\u2019s  estimate for reasonableness. Without an Independent Cost Estimate,  Congress does not have insight into the full potential cost of Block 4.", "The expected completion dates for these documents are between  October and December 2019, at the earliest. Figure 1 shows key Block 4  dates such as the Block 4 re-plan, which included revising the cost  estimate for Block 4 that DOD established in 2017, the planned  development contract awards, and planned completion dates for the three  remaining critical business case documents.", "As seen in figure 1, the program office plans to award Block 4  development contracts in May 2019, at least five months before any of  the critical business case documents will be available. Based on best  practices identified by GAO, without an independent Technology  Readiness Assessment, Test and Evaluation Master Plan, or an  Independent Cost Estimate, program officials cannot have a high level of  confidence that the requirements are firm and that risk has been  adequately reduced before beginning efforts estimated to cost $10.5  billion in funding to develop Block 4. If program officials move ahead with  Block 4 contracts without gaining the knowledge that a full business case  would provide, Block 4 modernization efforts will be at risk of experiencing  the same kind of cost and schedule growth the baseline development  program experienced.", "To address this risk, in April 2019, we recommended to the DOD that it  should ensure the F-35 program office complete its business case, to  include the three documents discussed above, at least for the initial Block  4 capabilities under development before initiating additional development  work. DOD did not concur with this recommendation. In its comments,  DOD stated that the F-35 program office has adequate knowledge to  begin Block 4 development.

All  eight R&M metrics are described in the program\u2019s Operational  Requirements Document (ORD)\u2014the document that outlines the targeted  performance levels for these metrics that DOD and the military services  agreed the F-35 should meet in 2000. Based on our analysis, while the  program is on track to meet half of the targets, the program office has not  taken adequate steps to ensure the others will be met. Additionally, in  December 2018, the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation reported  that, although performance for the four under-performing metrics has  shown slow growth over the years, none of these metrics are meeting  interim goals needed to reach requirements at each variant\u2019s maturity.  Each F-35 variants\u2019 R&M performance against these metrics is shown in  table 1.", "Since the program began tracking R&M performance in 2009, it has seen  small, annual improvements. Over the past year, all variants showed a  slight improvement in targeted performance levels for one metric, the  mean flight hours between failure\u2014design controlled, but saw little or no  discernable improvement for the four metrics not meeting targets.  However, based on current performance, the program does not expect to  meet those targets by full aircraft maturity. According to F-35 program  officials, the ORD R&M metrics should be re-evaluated to determine more  realistic R&M performance metrics, but the program has not yet taken  actions to do so. Until the program office does so, it remains accountable  for ensuring those ORD R&M metrics are achieved.", "In June 2018, we recommended that the F-35 program identify steps it  needs to take to ensure the F-35 aircraft meet R&M requirements before  each variant reaches maturity and update its R&M Improvement Program  (RMIP)\u2014DOD\u2019s action plan for improving R&M\u2014with these steps. DOD  concurred with our recommendation but has yet to take substantive  actions to address it. DOD did, however, complete 16 improvement  projects since we last reported on this. Despite completing these projects,  there were not significant gains in the R&M metrics not meeting targets.  Program officials advised, however, that measurable improvements in  R&M can take time to manifest.

Furthermore, the RMIP has not been a funding priority.", "Federal internal control standards state that programs should define  objectives when implementing programs such as the RMIP. Although  the F-35 program RMIP\u2019s guidance has a general goal of improving R&M,  it does not identify achieving the eight R&M targets listed in the ORD as  an objective.

Instead, officials stated they are using  the RMIP to prioritize and fund projects that will improve aircraft  availability and mission capability\u2014neither of which are included in the  eight R&M metrics, but are necessary and important initiatives. The  program is focusing on these two areas in part because a September  2018 memorandum from the Secretary of Defense to the Secretaries of  the military departments included a goal for the F-35 fleet to attain a  mission capable rate of 80 percent by the end of fiscal year 2019.  According to program officials, improving these two areas will translate  into improvements in the F-35 overall R&M. However, we found that the  RMIP\u2019s guidance does not discuss these priorities or align how any  improvement projects would ensure targets under all eight R&M targets  will be met.", "In our prior work on weapon system acquisitions, we have identified a  number of best practices for improving program outcomes if implemented,  such as clearly establishing well-defined requirements and securing  stable funding that matches resources to requirements. We found that  the program office has not prioritized or dedicated funding in its budget to  improve R&M, in part because program officials explained that they were  focused on initiatives intended to lower the cost of the aircraft. In  addition, any current funding for R&M improvement projects comes from  the program\u2019s operation and maintenance funds, which are only available  for one fiscal year. Officials explained that, if the funding runs out or is  used by the program for other efforts, then R&M projects will go unfunded  or be suspended until new funding is available. In fiscal year 2018, for  example, while some projects were completed, several other projects  were suspended when that year\u2019s funding ran out. As of December 2018,  according to a contractor representative, all of the identified improvement  projects currently unfunded in the program\u2019s RMIP would cost about $30  million to implement, but were not funded.", "Program officials also stated that they are in the process of revising the  RMIP and have considered including more specific objectives in addition  to improving aircraft availability and mission capability, such as more  focus on improving R&M performance where ORD R&M targets are not  currently being met. According to the program, any revisions to the RMIP  and changes to how it will be funded, however, will not be complete until  April 2019.", "By not defining objectives in its RMIP guidance for meeting all eight R&M  metrics, aligning which improvement projects will ensure those metrics  are met, and prioritizing funding for those projects, the program is at risk  of not fully meeting its R&M targets. As a result, the warfighter may  accept aircraft that are less reliable than originally planned, and whose  operation and sustainment costs may raise affordability questions. In  addition, the military services recently identified the need to cut  sustainment costs\u2014by 43 percent in the case of the Air Force\u2014to  improve the F-35\u2019s affordability in sustainment. Increasing costs from less  reliable aircraft will add strain to an already unaffordable program.", "To address these issues, in April 2019, we recommended to DOD that it  should ensure that the F-35 program office  1.  assess whether the ORD R&M targets are still feasible and revise the  2.  as it revises its RMIP, identify specific and measurable R&M  objectives in its RMIP guidance;  3.  as it revises its RMIP, identify and document which RMIP projects will  achieve the identified objectives of the RMIP guidance; and  4.  prioritize funding for the RMIP.", "DOD concurred with these recommendations and stated that it will take  actions to address them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continued Concerns with F-35 Sustainment Costs and Supply Chain, and Logistics System", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on the F-35 program\u2019s rising estimated  sustainment costs and challenges maintaining an expanding fleet.

We also reported  that sustainment costs were not fully transparent to the military services.  For example, the Marine Corps received an initial funding requirement for  fiscal year 2017 sustainment of $293 million, which then increased to  $364 million in the execution without a full explanation from the program  office. We recommended that DOD take steps to improve communication  with the services and provide more information about how F-35  sustainment costs they are being charged relate to the capabilities  received. DOD concurred with the recommendation and has begun taking  actions to address it.", "In addition, DOD faces substantial supply chain challenges that are  lowering F-35 aircraft performance. In April 2019, we reported that F-35  aircraft performance was falling short of warfighter requirements\u2014that is,  aircraft could not perform as many missions or fly as often as required.  Specifically, F-35A aircraft were mission capable only 52 percent of the  time from May through November 2018\u2014far short of the 80 percent target  set by the former Secretary of Defense. This lower-than-desired aircraft  performance is due largely to F-35 spare parts shortages and limited part  repair capabilities. For example, during this time period, F-35 aircraft were  unable to fly about 30 percent of the time due to spare parts shortages.", "Additionally, DOD\u2019s capabilities to repair F-35 spare parts at its depots  are years behind schedule, which has resulted in an average of 188 days  to repair an F-35 part and a backlog of about 4,300 spare parts awaiting  repair at military depots or manufacturers. We also reported that DOD  faces challenges managing, moving and maintaining accountability of F- 35 parts within the supply chain.

ALIS is the F-35\u2019s central logistics system intended to support  operations, mission planning, supply-chain management, maintenance,  and other processes. In April 2016, we identified several risks, including  that ALIS (1) was not initially designed to be deployable, (2) lacked  redundant infrastructure, (3) did not communicate well with legacy aircraft  systems, (4) had data accuracy and accessibility issues, and (5) had  security risks. In addition, DOD had not included certain analyses and  information, such as historical cost data, to increase the credibility and  accuracy of ALIS\u2019s estimated costs. Further, a 2013 DOD-commissioned  study found that schedule slippage and functionality problems with ALIS  could lead to between $20 billion and $100 billion in additional costs.", "We have made several recommendations to DOD to improve ALIS  planning and cost estimates, and to develop a performance measurement  process for ALIS to better address problems based on actual system  performance and user requirements. DOD generally concurred with our  recommendations and has taken some actions, including developing a  plan that identifies and prioritizes key ALIS risks. However, more work  remains. We are currently conducting a review examining DOD\u2019s  progress in implementing our ALIS-related recommendations, addressing  concerns from ALIS users, identifying emergent financial and operational  risks associated with ALIS, taking near-term actions to improve ALIS  functionality, and assessing DOD\u2019s actions regarding the long-term  viability of ALIS to ensure capable sustainment of the F-35 fleet.
