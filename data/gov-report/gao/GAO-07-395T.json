As GAO has reported, DHS faces continued challenges, including clearly defining leadership roles and responsibilities, developing necessary disaster response capabilities, and establishing accountability systems to provide effective response while also protecting against waste, fraud, and abuse.

GAO analysis showed improvements were needed in leadership roles and responsibilities, development of necessary disaster capabilities, and accountability systems that balance the need for fast, flexible response with the need to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. To facilitate rapid and effective decision making, legal authorities, roles and responsibilities, and lines of authority at all government levels must be clearly defined, effectively communicated, and well understood. Improved capabilities were needed for catastrophic disasters--particularly in the areas of (1) situational assessment and awareness; (2) emergency communications; (3) evacuations; (4) search and rescue; (5) logistics; and (6) mass care and sheltering. Effectively implementing the provisions of the Post-Katrina Reform Act will address many of these issues, and FEMA has initiated reviews and some actions in each of these areas. But their operational impact in a major disaster has not yet been tested. As a result of its body of work, GAO's recommendations included that DHS (1) rigorously re-test, train, and exercise its recent clarification of the roles, responsibilities, and lines of authority for all levels of leadership; (2) direct that more robust and detailed operational implementation plans support the National Response Plan (NRP); (3) provide guidance and direction for all planning, training, and exercises to ensure such activities fully support preparedness, response, and recovery responsibilities at a jurisdictional and regional basis; (4) take a lead in monitoring federal agencies' efforts to prepare to meet their responsibilities under the NRP and the interim National Preparedness Goal; and (5) use a risk management approach in making its investment decisions. We also recommended that Congress give federal agencies explicit authority to take action to prepare for all types of catastrophic disasters when there is warning. In his oversight letter to Congress, the Comptroller General suggested that one area needing fundamental reform and oversight is ensuring a strategic and integrated approach to prepare for, respond to, recover, and rebuild from catastrophic events. Congress may wish to consider several specific areas for immediate oversight. These include (1) evaluating development and implementation of the National Preparedness System, including preparedness for an influenza pandemic; (2) assessing state and local capabilities and the use of federal grants to enhance those capabilities; (3) examining regional and multi-state planning and preparation; (4) determining the status of preparedness exercises; and (5) examining DHS polices regarding oversight assistance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our work on disaster preparation  and response. The goal of disaster preparedness and response is easy to  state but difficult to achieve and can be stated as follows:  To prevent where possible, prepare for, mitigate, and respond to  disasters of any size or cause with well-planned, well-coordinated,  and effective actions that minimize the loss of life and property and  set the stage for a quick recovery.", "Achieving this goal for major disasters, and catastrophic disasters in  particular, is difficult because success requires effective pre- and post- disaster coordination and cooperation among different levels of  government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.  Individuals can also contribute to success through such things as knowing  evacuation routes, complying with evacuation orders, and having a family  and individual disaster preparation plan and supplies.", "GAO has identified disaster preparedness and response as a major  challenge for the 21st century. In 2005, GAO issued a special report  examining the federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal outlook, the nation\u2019s  ability to respond to emerging forces reshaping American society, and the  future role of the federal government. Among the issues discussed was  homeland security. In our report we identified the following illustrative  challenges and questions for examining emergency preparedness and  response:    What is an acceptable, achievable (within budget constraints) level of  risk? The nation can never be completely safe; total security is an  unachievable goal. Therefore, the issue becomes what is an acceptable  level of risk to guide homeland security strategies and investments,  particularly federal funding. What criteria should be used to target  federal and state funding for homeland security in order to maximize  results and mitigate risk within available resource levels?", "What should be the role of federal, state, and local governments in  identifying risks\u2014from nature or man\u2014in individual states and  localities and establishing standards for the equipment, skills, and  capacities that first responders need?", "Are existing incentives sufficient to support private sector protection  of critical infrastructure the private sector owns, and what changes  might be necessary?", "What is the most viable way to approach homeland security results  management and accountability? What are the appropriate goals and  who is accountable for the many components of homeland security  when many partners and functions and disciplines are involved? How  can these actors be held accountable and by whom? What costs should  be borne by federal, state, and local governments or the private sector  in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters large and  small\u2014whether the acts of nature or the deliberate or accidental acts  of man?", "To what extent and how should the federal government encourage and  foster a role for regional or multistate entities in emergency planning  and response?", "These issues are enormously complex and challenging for all levels of  government. It is important to view preparedness for and response to  major disasters as a national system with linked responsibilities and  capabilities. This is because effective preparedness for and response to  major disasters requires the coordinated planning and actions of multiple  actors from multiple first responder disciplines, jurisdictions, and levels of  government as well as nongovernmental entities. Parochialism must be put  aside and cooperation must prevail before and after an emergency event.  The experience of Hurricane Katrina illustrated why it is important to  tackle these difficult issues.", "The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (Post- Katrina Reform Act) requires major changes designed to increase the  effectiveness of preparedness and response. The act has established new  leadership positions and position requirements within the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), establishes new missions for  FEMA, requires the transfer of preparedness functions to it, and requires  the FEMA Administrator to undertake a broad range of activities before  and after disasters occur. However, as the Comptroller General testified  last month on DHS\u2019s high-risk status and specifically disaster  preparedness and response, DHS must overcome continued challenges,  including those related to clearly defining leadership roles and  responsibilities, developing necessary disaster response capabilities, and  establishing accountability systems to provide effective services while  protecting against waste, fraud, and abuse.", "My testimony today (1) summarizes our key findings regarding leadership,  response capabilities, and accountability controls; (2) discusses the  organizational changes provided for the in the Post-Katrina Reform Act;  and (3) highlights several disaster management issues for continued  congressional attention. My comments today are based on our Hurricane  Katrina work on disaster and emergency management and our review of  recent emergency management reform legislative changes.

FEMA, within DHS, has responsibility for administering the provisions of  the Stafford Act.", "Besides using these federal resources, states affected by a catastrophic  disaster can also turn to other states for assistance in obtaining surge  capacity\u2014the ability to draw on additional resources, such as personnel  and equipment, needed to respond to and recover from the incident. One  way of sharing personnel and equipment across state lines is through the  use of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, an interstate  compact that provides a legal and administrative framework for managing  such emergency requests. The compact includes all 50 states and the  District of Columbia. We have ongoing work examining how the  Emergency Management Assistance Compact has been used in disasters  and how its effectiveness could be enhanced and expect to report within a  few months.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 required the newly established DHS to  develop a comprehensive National Incident Management System (NIMS).  NIMS is intended to provide a consistent framework for incident  management at all jurisdictional levels regardless of the cause, size, or  complexity of the situation and to define the roles and responsibilities of  federal, state, and local governments, and various first responder  disciplines at each level during an emergency event. It also prescribes  interoperable communications systems and preparedness before an  incident happens, including planning, training, and exercises. The act  required DHS to consolidate existing federal government emergency  response plans into a single, integrated and coordinated national response  plan. DHS issued the National Response Plan (NRP), intended to be an all- discipline, all-hazards plan establishing a single, comprehensive  framework for the management of domestic incidents where federal  involvement is necessary. The NRP, operating within the framework of  NIMS, provides the structure and mechanisms for national-level policy and  operational direction for domestic incident management. The NRP also  includes a Catastrophic Incident Annex, which describes an accelerated,  proactive national response to catastrophic incidents.", "Developing the capabilities needed for large-scale disasters is part of an  overall national preparedness effort that should integrate and define what  needs to be done and where, how it should be done, and how well it  should be done\u2014that is, according to what standards. The principal  national documents designed to address each of these are, respectively,  the National Response Plan, the National Incident Management System,  and the National Preparedness Goal. The interim National Preparedness  Goal, required by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8, is  particularly important for determining what capabilities are needed,  especially for a catastrophic disaster. All states and urban areas are to  align existing preparedness strategies within the National Preparedness  Goal\u2019s eight national priorities. The December 2005 draft National  Preparedness Goal defines both the 37 major capabilities that first  responders should possess to prevent, protect from, respond to, and  recover from a wide range of incidents and the most critical tasks  associated with these capabilities. An inability to effectively perform these  critical tasks would, by definition, have a detrimental affect on effective  protection, prevention, response, and recovery capabilities. A final  National Preparedness Goal is expected to be released soon.", "As the subcommittee is aware, beginning in February 2006, reports by the  House Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and  Response to Hurricane Katrina, the Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee, the White House Homeland Security  Council, the DHS Inspector General, and DHS and FEMA all identified a  variety of failures and some strengths in the preparations for, response to,  and initial recovery from Hurricane Katrina. Collectively, these reports,  along with GAO\u2019s various reports and testimonies, offered a number of  specific recommendations for improving the nation\u2019s ability to effectively  prepare for and respond to catastrophic disasters.

FEMA continues to evolve within DHS  as it implements the changes required by the Post-Katrina Reform Act,  whose details are discussed later. Hurricane Katrina severely tested  disaster management at the federal, state, and local levels and revealed  weaknesses in the basic elements of preparing for, responding to, and  recovering from any catastrophic disaster. Based on work done during the  aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we previously reported that DHS needs to  more effectively coordinate disaster preparedness, response, and recovery  efforts, particularly for catastrophic disasters in which the response  capabilities of state and local governments are almost immediately  overwhelmed.

Hurricane Katrina showed the need to improve  leadership at all levels of government to better respond to a catastrophic  disaster. For example, there were problems with roles and responsibilities  under the NRP and ambiguities about both what constituted an incident of  national significance to trigger the NRP and what constituted a  catastrophic incident to trigger the proactive response of the NRP\u2019s  Catastrophic Incident Annex. On May 25, 2006, DHS released changes to  the NRP regarding leadership issues, such as which situations require  secretarial leadership; the process for declaring incidents of national  significance; and the scope of the NRP and its Catastrophic Incident  Annex. The revised NRP clearly states that the Secretary of Homeland  Security, who reports directly to the President, is responsible for declaring  and managing incidents of national significance, including catastrophic  ones. At the time of Katrina, the supplement to the catastrophic incident  annex, which provides more detail on implementing the annex, was still in  draft. Subsequent to Katrina, DHS published the final supplement to the  Catastrophic Incident Annex, dated August 2006.", "The White House Homeland Security Council report included   44 recommendations that were intended for quick implementation, of  which 18 were focused on improving and clarifying the legal authorities,  roles and responsibilities, and lines of authority. DHS has provided limited  information on the status of its implementation of the White House  recommendations, although it has reported actions taken on some issues  raised in the White House Homeland Security Council report and in other  reports. For example, DHS has pre-designated Principal Federal Officials  and Federal Coordinating Officers for regions and states at risk of  hurricanes and described their respective roles in coordinating disaster  response\u2014which was a source of some confusion in the federal response  to Hurricane Katrina. However, the changes may not have fully resolved  the leadership issues regarding the roles of the principal federal officer  and federal coordinating officer. While the Secretary of Homeland Security  may avoid conflicts by appointing a single individual to serve in both  positions in nonterrorist incidents, confusion may persist if the Secretary  of Homeland Security does not exercise this discretion to do so.  Furthermore, this discretion does not exist for terrorist incidents, and the  revised NRP does not specifically provide a rationale for this limitation.", "Congress also raised concerns in 2006 that FEMA\u2019s performance problems  during the response to Hurricane Katrina may have stemmed from its  organizational placement and its budgetary relationship within DHS. In  May 2006, we noted that organizational changes alone, while potentially  important, were not likely to adequately address the underlying systemic  conditions that resulted in FEMA\u2019s performance problems. We noted that  a number of factors other than organizational placement may be more  important to FEMA\u2019s success in responding to and recovering from future  disasters, including catastrophic ones. Conditions underlying FEMA\u2019s  performance during Hurricane Katrina involved the experience and  training of DHS or FEMA leadership; the clarity of FEMA\u2019s mission and  related responsibilities and authorities to achieve mission performance  expectations; the adequacy of it human, financial, and technological  resources; and the effectiveness of planning, exercises, and related  partnerships. The Post-Katrina Reform Act includes provisions that  address each of these issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enhanced Capabilities for Catastrophic Response and Recovery Are Needed", "paragraphs": ["Numerous reports and our own work suggest that the substantial  resources and capabilities marshaled by state, local, and federal  governments and nongovernmental organizations were insufficient to  meet the immediate challenges posed by the unprecedented degree of  damage and the number of victims caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Developing the capabilities needed for catastrophic disasters should be  part of an overall national preparedness effort that is designed to integrate  and define what needs to be done and where, how it should be done, and  how well it should be done\u2014that is, according to what standards. The  principal national documents designed to address each of these are,  respectively, the National Response Plan, the National Incident  Management System, and the National Preparedness Goal. The nation\u2019s  experience with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reinforces some of the  questions surrounding the adequacy of capabilities in the context of a  catastrophic disaster\u2014particularly in the areas of (1) situational  assessment and awareness, (2) emergency communications,   (3) evacuations, (4) search and rescue, (5) logistics, and (6) mass care   and sheltering.", "Capabilities are built upon the appropriate combination of people, skills,  processes, and assets. Ensuring that needed capabilities are available  requires effective planning and coordination in conjunction with training  and exercises in which the capabilities are realistically tested and  problems identified and subsequently addressed in partnership with other  federal, state, and local stakeholders. In recent work on FEMA  management of day-to-day operations, we found that although shifting  resources caused by its transition to DHS created challenges for FEMA,  the agency\u2019s management of existing resources compounded these  problems. FEMA lacks some of the basic management tools that help an  agency respond to changing circumstances. Most notably, FEMA lacks a  strategic workforce plan and related human capital strategies\u2014such as  succession planning or a coordinated training effort. Such tools are  integral to managing resources, as they enable an agency to define staffing  levels, identify the critical skills needed to achieve its mission, and  eliminate or mitigate gaps between current and future skills and  competencies. FEMA officials have said they are beginning to address  these and other basic organizational management issues. To this end,  FEMA has commissioned studies of 18 areas, whose final reports and  recommendations are due later this spring.", "In identifying available capabilities, FEMA needs to identify and assess the  capabilities that exist across the federal government and outside the  federal government. For example, in a recent report on housing assistance,  we found that the National Response Plan\u2019s annex covering temporary  shelter and housing (Emergency Support Function--6) clearly described  the overall responsibilities of the two primary responsible agencies\u2014 FEMA and the Red Cross. However, the responsibilities described for the  support agencies\u2014the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Housing and  Urban Development (HUD), and Veterans Affairs\u2014did not, and still do  not, fully reflect their capabilities. Further, these support agencies had not,  at the time of our work, developed fact sheets describing their roles and  responsibilities, notification and activation procedures, and agency- specific authorities, as called for by ESF-6 operating procedures. We  recommended that the support agencies propose revisions to the NRP that  fully reflect each respective support agency\u2019s capabilities for providing  temporary housing under ESF-6, develop the needed fact sheets, and  develop operational plans that provide details on how their respective  agencies will meet their temporary housing responsibilities. The  Departments of Defense, HUD, Treasury, and the Veterans Administration,  and Agriculture, concurred with our recommendations. The Red Cross did  not comment on our report or recommendations. As part of a housing task  force, FEMA is currently exploring ways of incorporating housing  assistance offered by private sector organizations.", "Further, recent GAO work found that actions are needed to clarify the  responsibilities and increase preparedness for evacuations, especially for  those transportation-disadvantaged populations. We found that state and  local governments are generally not well prepared to evacuate  transportation-disadvantaged populations (ie. planning, training, and  conducting exercises), but some states and localities have begun to  address challenges and barriers. For example, in June 2006 DHS reported  that only about 10 percent of the state and about 12 percent of the urban  area emergency plans it reviewed adequately addressed evacuating these  populations. Steps being taken by some such governments include  collaboration with social service and transportation providers and  transportation planning organizations\u2014some of which are Department of  Transportation (DOT) grantees and stakeholders\u2014to determine  transportation needs and develop agreements for emergency use of drivers  and vehicles. The federal government provides evacuation assistance to  state and local governments, but gaps in this assistance have hindered  many of these governments\u2019 ability to sufficiently prepare for evacuations.  This includes the lack of any specific requirement to plan, train, and  conduct exercises for the evacuation of transportation-disadvantaged  populations as well as gaps in the usefulness of DHS\u2019s guidance. We  recommended that DHS should clarify federal agencies\u2019 roles and  responsibilities for providing evacuation assistance when state and local  governments are overwhelmed. DHS should require state and local  evacuation preparedness for transportation-disadvantaged populations  and improve information to assist these governments. DOT should  encourage its grant recipients to share information to assist in evacuation  preparedness for these populations. DOT and DHS agreed to consider our  recommendations, and DHS stated it has partly implemented some of  them.", "Finally, the use of a risk management methodology\u2014integrating  systematic concern for risk into the normal cycle of agency decision  making and implementation\u2014should be central to assessing the risk for  catastrophic disasters, guiding the development of national capabilities  and the expertise that can be used to respond effectively to catastrophic  disasters. As I stated in my testimony to this subcommittee on applying  risk management principles to guide federal investments, risk  management should be viewed strategically, that is, with a view that goes  beyond assessing what the risks are, to the integration of risk into annual  budget and program review cycles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Balance Needed between Quick Provision of Assistance and Ensuring Accountability to Protect against Waste, Fraud, and Abuse", "paragraphs": ["Controls and accountability mechanisms help to ensure that resources are  used appropriately. Nevertheless, during a catastrophic disaster, decision  makers struggle with the tension between implementing controls and  accountability mechanisms and the demand for rapid response and  recovery assistance. On one hand, our work uncovered many examples  where quick action could not occur due to procedures that required  extensive, time-consuming processes, delaying the delivery of vital  supplies and other assistance. On the other hand, we also found examples  where FEMA\u2019s processes assisting disaster victims left the federal  government vulnerable to fraud and the abuse of expedited assistance  payments.", "We estimated that through February 2006, FEMA made about $600 million  to $1.4 billion in improper and potentially fraudulent payments to  applicants who used invalid information to apply for expedited cash  assistance. DHS and FEMA have reported a number of actions that are to  be in effect for the 2007 hurricane season so that federal recovery  programs will have more capacity to rapidly handle a catastrophic incident  but also provide accountability. Examples include significantly increasing  the quantity of prepositioned supplies, such as food, ice, and water;  placing global positioning systems on supply trucks to track their location  and better manage the delivery of supplies; creating an enhanced phone  system for victim assistance applications that can handle up to 200,000  calls per day; and improving computer systems and processes for verifying  the eligibility of those applying for assistance. Effective implementation of  these and other planned improvements will be critical to achieving their  intended outcomes.", "Finally, catastrophic disasters not only require a different magnitude of  capabilities and resources for effective response, they may also require  more flexible policies and operating procedures. In a catastrophe,  streamlining, simplifying, and expediting decision making should quickly  replace \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and unquestioned adherence to long-standing  policies and operating procedures used in normal situations for providing  relief to disaster victims. At the same time, controls and accountability  mechanisms must be sufficient to provide the documentation needed for  expense reimbursement and reasonable assurance that resources have  been used legally and for the purposes intended. The federal government  also will be a major partner in the longer-term recovery and rebuilding of  communities along the Gulf Coast. Among the areas requiring federal  attention are (1) assessing the environmental hazards created by the  storms; (2) rebuilding and strengthening the levees; (3) providing  assistance to school districts that have enrolled large numbers of evacuee  children; and (4) building the capacity to address demand in multiple  victims assistance programs such as financial assistance or loans for  repair and replacement of housing and the rebuilding of businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Recommendations Stress Changes in Leadership, Capabilities, and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["In line with a recommendation we made following Hurricane Andrew, the  nation's most destructive hurricane prior to Katrina, we recommended  that Congress give federal agencies explicit authority to take actions to  prepare for all types of catastrophic disasters when there is warning.

We recommended that DHS  create accountability systems that effectively balance the need for fast and  flexible response against the need to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. We  also recommended that DHS provide guidance on advance procurement  practices (precontracting) and procedures for those federal agencies with  roles and responsibilities under the NRP. These federal agencies could  then better manage disaster-related procurement and establish an  assessment process to monitor agencies\u2019 continuous planning efforts for  their disaster-related procurement needs and the maintenance of  capabilities. For example, we identified a number of emergency response  practices in the public and private sectors that provide insight into how  the federal government can better manage its disaster-related  procurements.

As a result, FEMA does not  have information from these sources to define what and how much  it needs to stock. However, FEMA is developing a concept of  operations to underpin its logistics program and told us that it is  working to develop detailed plans and the associated stockage  requirements. However, until FEMA has solid requirements based  on detailed plans, the agency will be unable to assess its true  preparedness.", "Inventory management: FEMA\u2019s system accounts for the location,  quantity, and types of supplies, but the ability to track supplies in- transit is limited.

The agency has a small core of permanent staff,  supplemented with contract and temporary disaster assistance staff.  However, FEMA\u2019s recent retirements and losses of staff, and its  difficulty in hiring permanent staff and contractors, have created  staffing shortfalls and a lack of capability. According to a January  2007 study commissioned by FEMA, there are significant shortfalls  in staffing and skill sets of full-time employees, particularly in the  planning, advanced contracting, and relationship management skills  needed to fulfill the disaster logistics mission.

Disaster preparation and response that is well planned and coordinated  can save lives and mitigate damage, and an effectively functioning  insurance market can substantially reduce the government\u2019s exposure to  post-catastrophe payouts. Lessons learned from past national emergencies  provide an opportunity for Congress to look at actions that could mitigate  the effects of potential catastrophic events. Similarly, the Comptroller  General suggested that Congress could also consider how the federal  government can work with other nations, other levels of government, and  nonprofit and private sector organizations, such as the Red Cross and  private insurers, to help ensure the nation is well prepared and recovers  effectively. Given the billions of dollars dedicated to preparing for,  responding to, recovering from, and rebuilding after catastrophic  disasters, congressional oversight is critical.", "A comprehensive and in-depth oversight agenda would require long-term  efforts.

According to DHS\u2019s National  Preparedness Guidance, the planning scenarios are intended to illustrate  the scope and magnitude of large-scale, catastrophic emergency events for  which the nation needs to be prepared and to form the basis for identifying  the capabilities needed to respond to a wide range of large scale  emergency events. The scenarios focused on the consequences that first  responders would have to address. Some state and local officials and  experts have questioned whether the scenarios were appropriate inputs  for preparedness planning, particularly in terms of their plausibility and  the emphasis on terrorist scenarios.", "Using the scenarios, and in consultation with federal, state, and local  emergency response stakeholders, DHS developed a list of over   1,600 discrete tasks, of which 300 were identified as critical. DHS then  identified 36 target capabilities to provide guidance to federal, state, and  local first responders on the capabilities they need to develop and  maintain. That list has since been refined, and DHS released a revised draft  list of 37 capabilities in December 2005. Because no single jurisdiction or  agency would be expected to perform every task, possession of a target  capability could involve enhancing and maintaining local resources,  ensuring access to regional and federal resources, or some combination of  the two. However, DHS is still in the process of developing goals,  requirements, and metrics for these capabilities and the National  Preparedness Goal in light of the Hurricane Katrina experience.", "Several key components of the National Preparedness System defined in  the Post-Katrina Reform Act\u2014the National Preparedness Goal, target  capabilities and preparedness priorities, and comprehensive assessment  systems\u2014should be closely examined. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, DHS  had established seven priorities for enhancing national first responder  preparedness, including, for example, implementing the NRP and NIMS;  strengthening capabilities in information sharing and collaboration; and  strengthening capabilities in medical surge and mass prophylaxis. Those  seven priorities were incorporated into DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2006 homeland  security grant program (HSGP) guidance, which added an eighth priority  that emphasized emergency operations and catastrophic planning.", "In the fiscal year 2007 HSGP program guidance, DHS set two overarching  priorities. DHS has focused the bulk of its available grant dollars on risk- based investment. In addition, the department has prioritized regional  coordination and investment strategies that institutionalize regional  security strategy integration. In addition to the two overarching priorities,  the guidance also identified several others. These include (1) measuring  progress in achieving the National Preparedness Goal, (2) integrating and  synchronizing preparedness programs and activities, (3) developing and  sustaining a statewide critical infrastructure/key resource protection  program, (4) enabling information/intelligence fusion, (5) enhancing  statewide communications interoperability, (6) strengthening preventative  radiological/nuclear detection capabilities, and (7) enhancing catastrophic  planning to address nationwide plan review results.

Hurricanes,  earthquakes, explosions, or bioterrorist incidents occur within a short  period of time, perhaps a period of minutes, although such events can  have long-term effects, as we have seen in the Gulf region following  Hurricane Katrina. The immediate effects of such disasters are likely to  affect specific locations or areas within the nation; the immediate damage  is not nationwide. In contrast, an influenza pandemic is likely to continue  in waves of 6 to 8 weeks for a number of weeks or months and affect wide  areas of the nation, perhaps the entire nation. Depending upon the severity  of the pandemic, the number of deaths could be from 200,000 to 2 million.  Seasonal influenza in the United States results in about 36,000 deaths  annually. Successfully addressing the pandemic is also likely to require  international coordination of detection and response.", "The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that during a  severe pandemic, absenteeism may reach as much as 40 percent in an  affected community because individuals are ill, caring for family members,  or fear infection. Such absenteeism could affect our nation\u2019s economy, as  businesses and governments face the challenge of continuing to provide  essential services with reduced numbers of healthy workers. In addition,  our nation\u2019s ability to respond effectively to hurricanes or other major  disasters during a pandemic may also be diminished as first responders,  health care workers, and others are infected or otherwise unable to  perform their normal duties.
