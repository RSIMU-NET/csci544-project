Commerce may stop applying its NME methodology if it finds that China warrants designation as a market economy. In light of increased concern about China's trade practices, the conference report on fiscal year 2004 appropriations requested that GAO review efforts by U.S. government agencies responsible for ensuring free and fair trade with that country. In this report, the last in a series, GAO (1) explains the NME methodology, (2) analyzes AD duties applied to China and compares them with duties applied to market economies, and (3) explains circumstances in which the United States would stop applying its NME methodology to China and evaluates the potential impact of such a step.

Companies that do not meet the criteria or do not participate in Commerce investigations receive \"country-wide\" rates. China has been the most frequent target of U.S. AD actions. On 25 occasions, Commerce has applied duties to the same product from both China and one or more market economy. China (NME) duties were over 20 percentage points higher than those applied to market economies, on average. This is because average China country-wide rates were over 60 points higher than comparable market economy rates. Individual China company rates were similar to those assigned to market economy companies, on average. Commerce can declare China a market economy if the country meets certain criteria, thus ending the use of surrogate price information and country-wide rates in China AD actions. These changes would have a mixed impact. Duties would likely decline for Chinese companies not assigned individual rates. Individual company rates would likely diverge, with those that do not cooperate with Commerce receiving rates that are substantially higher than those that do cooperate. In any case, it appears that the actual trade impact of the NME methodology will decline as the portion of total export trade conducted by Chinese companies assigned individual rates increases and as the country-wide rates that largely account for the comparatively high average rates applied to China decline in importance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Imports from China have grown rapidly over the last decade, from a total  value of about $42 billion in 1995 to over $196 billion in 2004.

Interested domestic industries file petitions simultaneously with  Commerce and ITC. If Commerce determines that the petitioning parties  meet certain eligibility requirements, ITC determines whether the  domestic industry has suffered material injury as a result of the alleged  dumping (or is threatened with material injury). While ITC is completing  its work, Commerce conducts an investigation to establish the duty rates, if  any, that should be applied.", "To determine the duty rates to apply in an antidumping investigation,  Commerce identifies (1) the foreign product\u2019s export price entering the  U.S. market and (2) its \u201cnormal value.\u201d Commerce then compares these  prices to determine whether\u2014and by how much\u2014the product\u2019s export  price is less than its normal value. AD duty rates are based on these  differences, which are called dumping margins.", "To establish a product\u2019s export price, Commerce generally refers to the  prices charged in actual sales of that product to purchasers in the United  States. To establish its normal value, Commerce generally refers to the  prices charged for the product in the exporting company\u2019s home market. In  the event that the product is not sold in the exporter\u2019s home market,  Commerce may refer to prices charged for the product in another export  market or construct a normal value based on costs of production in the  exporting country, together with selling, general and administrative  expenses, and profit. The two agencies make preliminary and, after  additional investigation, final determinations as to whether injury has  occurred (ITC) and the size of the duty, if any, that should be imposed  (Commerce). When warranted, Commerce issues \u201cduty orders\u201d instructing  Customs and Border Protection to apply duties against imported products  from the countries under investigation. Both ITC and Commerce publish  their decisions in the Federal Register.", "Since AD duties address unfair pricing practices, and pricing decisions are  generally made by individual companies, Commerce generally calculates  and assigns AD duty rates on an individual company basis. As a result, AD  investigations generally produce a number of individually determined,  company-specific rates, reflecting differences in the extent to which  companies have dumped their products\u2014that is, exported them at less  than their normal value. In addition, AD duty orders also generally specify  a duty rate for other companies that have not been assigned an individually  determined rate.", "In principle, Commerce bases its AD duty determinations on information  obtained from interested parties\u2014including foreign producers and  exporters. Commerce obtains needed information from foreign companies  by sending them questionnaires and following up with additional questions,  as needed, and with on-site visits.", "However, both U.S. law and WTO rules recognize that, in some cases,  officials charged with completing these investigations will be unable to  obtain sufficient information. In such cases, Commerce officials apply facts  available to complete their duty determinations. This may include  secondary information, subject to corroboration from independent  sources.", "Moreover, if Commerce finds that an interested party, such as a foreign  company under investigation, \u201chas failed to cooperate by not acting to the  best of its ability to comply with a request for information\u201d then, in  selecting among the facts available, Commerce may apply an inference that  is adverse to the interests of that party.

For example, in  2004 Commerce placed duties on six Chinese products and in doing so  assigned individually determined or weighted average rates to 53 Chinese  companies. Anecdotal evidence suggests that along with this rise in  company interest in obtaining individual rates has come an increase in the  volume of trade covered by these rates. For example, in one recent case  Commerce fully investigated and assigned individually determined rates to  four companies accounting for more than 90 percent of Chinese exports to  the U.S. market.

Nonetheless, while the NME  methodology is applied, it appears that the actual trade impact of using this  methodology will decline as the portion of total export trade conducted by  Chinese companies assigned individual rates increases, and as the country- wide rates that largely account for the comparatively high average rates  applied to China decline in importance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Commerce provided written comments on a draft of  this report.

However, from 1991 through 1995 Commerce issued six orders that  contained only a country-wide rate. In most of these cases, Chinese  companies failed to respond to Commerce requests for information. For  example, in one case Commerce solicited information through both the  Chinese government and the relevant Chinese industry association.

Commerce determined that the failure of the  other companies to provide requested information justified application of  an adverse inference to determine the country-wide rate.

This result is statistically significant at above the 99 percent level. The  variable for the year of the order is also statistically significant, but it has a  small coefficient.

Once again the coefficient for China is insignificant, while the  coefficient for the country-wide rate is significant at the 99 percent level.  Some coefficients for individual products are significant (e.g., carbon steel  butt-weld pipe fittings), but many are not. The overall adjusted R-square  measure shows that this regression model explains about 31 percent of  total variation in the duty rates.", "In order to examine the effect of applying adverse inferences and facts  available (other than adverse inferences) on the duty rates, we added  additional variables indicating when Commerce used these approaches.  The results show that application of adverse inferences is a significant  variable and has a large effect on the duty rates, but that application of  facts available (other than adverse inferences) is not. When adverse  inferences are introduced, this results in the country-wide rate variable  becoming insignificant (see table 8). However, this is likely due to the fact  that the adverse inferences variable is highly correlated with the country- wide rate. Therefore, it is not surprising that the country-wide rate is no  longer significant since the adverse inferences variable is already  accounting for much of the variation. In addition, the variable for China  once again becomes significant. As we discuss in the body of this report,  Commerce uses adverse inferences in very few determinations for Chinese  companies granted their own rates. Adverse inferences were applied in  making only 3 out of the 50 individual determinations used in this analysis.  However, Commerce used adverse inferences in nearly half of its  determinations against individual market economy companies.", "Since adverse inferences are already factored into this model, as is the  country-wide rate, the remaining differences accounted for by the China  variable in table 3 are between individual (noncountry-wide) Chinese rates  and individual market economy rates in which adverse inferences are not  used. Table 8 shows that there is a statistically significant 27 percentage  point difference between these rates. However, because there are  methodological differences between the NME and market economy  methodologies for individual companies, it is not clear how often adverse  inferences would be used against individual Chinese companies should  they move to a market economy methodology. In other words, we cannot  predict the extent to which, under a market economy methodology,  individual Chinese companies would cooperate with Commerce or  Commerce would find it necessary to use adverse inferences in its  determinations against Chinese companies. It is possible that some  Chinese companies that currently have an individually determined rate  under the NME methodology would face adverse inferences under a  market economy methodology, whereas others would not. This could  produce a result similar to the market economy cases we have examined in  which the overall average (for example, 55 percent) is the result of some  companies receiving comparatively high duty rates (e.g., 77 percent) when  adverse inferences are used and others receiving comparatively low rates  (e.g., 16 percent) when adverse inferences are not used (see table 2). In any  case, these results show that there is a remaining difference between these  two groups after accounting for the use of adverse inferences and the  country-wide rate.", "In order to examine whether the above results hold for all NMEs, we ran  the same regressions for a larger set of 31 products (compared with the 25  products above) in which we found matching cases between nonmarket  economies other than China and market economies. The data set on these  31 products included rates from 128 orders (26 on China, 82 on market  economies, and 20 on NMEs other than China) that contained 355 duty  rates (dependent variable).", "These analyses confirmed our China-market economy only analyses but  also showed that other NME countries tend to have duty rates that are  statistically higher than market economy rates for this sample of matching  cases. (Note that the number of additional products\u2014six\u2014is relatively  small.) Controlling for both the NME designation and the country-wide  rate, the NME designation itself is a significant variable at the 97 percent  level of confidence with a coefficient of 23 percent (the coefficient for  China is not statistically significant). The country-wide variable is also  significant (99 percent level) and larger with a coefficient of 48 percent. As  additional variables are added for individual products, the NME  designation continued to be significant along with the country-wide rate  variable.", "There may be other systematic factors not accounted for in this regression  model that would explain some of the variability not accounted for by the  variables we included.

Some of this variation may be  idiosyncratic and related to differences in individual companies\u2019 practices,  other may relate to how Commerce has implemented its analysis.
