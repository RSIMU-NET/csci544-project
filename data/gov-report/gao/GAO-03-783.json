Nearly all this assistance has been delivered and is being used for counternarcotics operations. However, the Colombian Army cannot operate and maintain the U.S.-provided helicopters at current levels without U.S. support because it does not yet have sufficient numbers of qualified pilots and mechanics. U.S. officials estimate that up to $150 million a year is needed to sustain the ongoing programs. In recent years, the Colombian National Police aerial eradication program has had mixed results. Since 1995, coca cultivation rose in every year until 2002 and opium poppy cultivation remained relatively steady until 2001. But, for 2002, the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy reported that net coca cultivation in Colombia decreased 15 percent, and net opium poppy cultivation decreased 25 percent--the second yearly decline in a row. U.S. officials attributed this success primarily to the Colombian government's willingness to spray coca and poppy plants without restriction. These officials estimate that about $80 million a year is needed to continue the program at its current pace. Although the U.S.-backed counternarcotics program in Colombia has begun to achieve some of the results originally envisioned, Colombia and the United States must deal with financial and management challenges. As GAO noted in 2000, the total costs of the counternarcotics programs in Colombia were unknown. Nearly 3 years later, the Departments of State and Defense have still not developed estimates of future program costs, defined their future roles in Colombia, identified a proposed end state, or determined how they plan to achieve it. Colombia's ability to contribute more is limited, and it continues to face challenges associated with its long-standing insurgency and the need to ensure it complies with human rights standards and other requirements in order for U.S. assistance to continue."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States has been providing assistance to Colombia since the  early 1970s to help reduce illegal drug production and trafficking activities.

Recognizing that illicit drug activities are a serious problem  in Colombia, the Colombian government in October 1999 announced a  $7.5 billion plan, known as Plan Colombia, which among other things  proposed reducing the cultivation, processing, and distribution of illegal  narcotics by 50 percent over 6 years. In fiscal years 2000 through 2003, the  United States provided over $2.5 billion to Colombia for counternarcotics  assistance.  For fiscal year 2004, the administration has proposed an  additional $700 million in assistance to address many of the same purposes.

According to  U.S. and Colombian officials, the counternarcotics brigade was highly  effective during 2001 but somewhat less effective during 2002. For  example, during 2001 the brigade destroyed 25 cocaine hydrochloride  laboratories while in 2002 it destroyed only 4 laboratories.  U.S. embassy  officials stated that the brigade became less effective because the  insurgents moved their drug producing activities, such as the laboratories,  beyond the reach of the brigade. In addition, according to these officials,  the brigade became more involved in protecting infrastructure, such as  bridges and power stations, and performing base security. Moreover, the  aerial eradication program did not call on the brigade to provide ground  security on very many occasions, essentially planning spray missions in the  less threatening areas.", "In August 2002, U.S. embassy and Colombian military officials agreed to  restructure the brigade to make it a rapid reaction force capable of making  quick, tactical strikes on a few days\u2019 notice. As part of this restructuring,  the Colombian Army designated the brigade a national asset capable of  operating anywhere in Colombia rather than just in its prior area of  responsibility in southern Colombia. The newly restructured brigade  consists of three combat battalions and a support battalion with a total of  about 1,900 soldiers, all of whom are professional. Two of the combat  battalions have been retrained. The third combat battalion should be  retrained by mid-June 2003.

According to Office of Aviation officials, these surveys are  intended to provide a stringent on-site assessment of flight operations from  management and safety to logistics and maintenance. The study noted that  the Aviation Service has some unique circumstances that have made its  operations difficult to manage. In particular, it grew from 579 personnel in  1995 to 1,232 in 2002 and operates 8 different types of rotary-wing and 9  different types of fixed-wing aircraft. Nevertheless, the team made a  number of critical observations. For example,  The Aviation Service\u2019s organizational structure, lines of authority, and  levels of responsibility were not clear. In most cases, only the  commanding general was allowed to commit resources and make  operational decisions. This reliance on an overly centralized command  structure resulted in unnecessary delays and, NAS officials told us, the  cancellation of some planned aerial eradication missions because the  commanding general could not be reached.", "The Aviation Service did not have a formal flying hour program. A flying  hour program is used to forecast budgetary requirements. It takes into  account the operational use and training requirements for each aircraft  and the various missions it performs and equates each flight hour to a  cost average for fuel and spare parts, which constitute the majority of an  aviation organization's annual expenses. The lack of a flying hour  program has prevented the police from more accurately forecasting  budgetary requirements. Moreover, according to NAS, maintenance  scheduling is enhanced when the number of flight hours can be  projected, which contributes to higher aircraft availability rates.", "About 35 percent of the maintenance staff were inexperienced.", "According to the survey team, this could result in improper maintenance  procedures being performed, which could adversely affect flight safety  and endanger lives. In addition, all locations the team visited had  deficiencies in standard maintenance procedures and practices. For  example, the survey team found that a UH-60 Black Hawk with gunshot  damage to a fuel cell was used in several local area flights. While fuel  cells are self-sealing to enable an aircraft to return to base for repairs  after sustaining damage, aircraft are not supposed to be routinely flown  in this condition.", "Management of items needing repair and control of spare parts was  deficient. The survey team found 236 items awaiting repair\u2014some from  August 1998. The team also found more than $4 million in UH-1H  helicopter blades and parts stored outside and unprotected.", "The Aviation Service\u2019s safety program did not have formal risk  management practices to ensure that all risk factors\u2014such as weather,  crew experience, and mission complexity\u2014are taken into account. In  addition, the team observed a majority of helicopter gunners failing to  take basic safety precautions, such as ensuring that their machine guns  and mini-guns were rendered harmless when personnel were around the  aircraft, especially during refueling and rearming operations.", "To help correct these and other deficiencies, the survey team made  numerous recommendations for specific improvements. Overall, the team  rated the Aviation Service\u2019s operational and maintenance procedures as  poor but concluded that it had an excellent chance for improvement over  the next 2 to 3 years due to the dedication of its young officers.", "As a result of the survey, in July 2002, a NAS contractor (a $38.8 million, 1-year contract with options for 4 additional years) began providing on-the- job maintenance and logistical training to the Aviation Service and helping  the police address many of the issues raised by the Aviation Resource  Management Survey team. NAS officials already noted that a more formal  flying hour program has improved the availability rates of many of the  aircraft in the Aviation Service\u2019s inventory. For example, the availability  rate of the Aviation Service\u2019s UH-II helicopters\u2014often used to support  aerial eradication missions\u2014increased from 67 percent in January 2002 to  87 percent in December 2002.

Externally, the price of coffee\u2014a traditionally major Colombian export\u2014 reached historically low levels, trade with some neighboring countries fell  as their economies under performed, and foreign private financing to  Colombia was limited by the continuing insurgency and political  developments in the region during 2002.
