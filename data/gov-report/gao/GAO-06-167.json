Second, USTR has not undertaken formal strategic human capital planning to mitigate the risks inherent in its dependency--as a \"networked organization\"--on interagency resources to achieve its mission. Therefore, it does not have a method to account for changes in other agencies' resources that might impact its ability to achieve its mission. Third, USTR has focused its human capital planning efforts primarily on short-term responses to trade negotiating needs identified in its 2-year budget planning process; it has not conducted ongoing parallel efforts to analyze longer-term workforce needs. USTR's efforts to address its specific workforce challenges could benefit from greater use of human capital tools. First, USTR could use more of the existing federal human capital flexibilities to better tailor its human capital approaches to organizational needs. Although the agency has used and benefited from some special hiring and pay authorities, such as the use of higher-than-minimum salary offers, it has yet to take advantage of others, such as retention bonuses. Second, while USTR prides itself on being a results-oriented agency, most USTR staff are not subject to agencywide performance expectations linked to organizational goals.

USTR\u2019s commitment to provide leadership resources for  human capital has not been sustained. For example, USTR does not have  the human capital management resources in place to ensure that critical  human capital management tasks\u2014such as succession planning\u2014are  carried out, which places its interagency leadership role at risk when key  vacancies occur within a short period of time. In fact, the senior human  capital management post has not been filled for over 1\u00bd years. USTR has  relied on one person to act as senior manager for administration, thus  assuming all senior human capital and administrative duties.", "Although a key element of strategic human capital leadership principles is  the use of succession planning to ensure a smooth transition of knowledge  from incumbents to successors to strengthen organizational capacity,  USTR does not conduct formal succession planning. Federal agencies that  manage succession well do so with active leadership support for  identifying critical talent throughout the organization and linking  succession efforts to the agency\u2019s overall long-term goals. Our analysis of  USTR\u2019s human capital data found substantial risk of future leadership and  knowledge loss due to retirement. Five of 22 senior executive service (SES)  staff are currently eligible to retire, representing 23 percent of USTR\u2019s SES  staff. Another 4 SES staff are eligible to retire in five years or less, for a  total of 41 percent either currently eligible to retire or eligible in 5 years or  less. Along with the SES posts, USTR also faces the potential retirement of  several experienced trade experts and attorneys who also have roles  coordinating U.S. trade policy. Just over 10 percent of GS-15 trade analysts,  attorneys, or economists are eligible to retire in 5 years or less. USTR has  not undertaken formal succession planning to fill these eventual vacancies,  even though the staff USTR risks losing to retirement are critical to  managing the interagency process. Instead, senior managers reexamine the  staffing balance as vacancies occur, and office managers may look for good  candidates as replacements from other agencies in the interagency process  or from the private sector. According to a senior manager, USTR receives  an occasional list of staff eligible to retire in the next year or two from the  EOP. However, USTR senior management staffing discussions are limited  to short-term contingency plans for particular posts and are not part of any  systematic agencywide succession planning effort. Likewise, when office  managers look outside the agency to find potential USTR staff, their efforts  also are not part of any formal succession strategy. As we have previously  reported, without careful planning, an organization\u2019s retirement eligibility  rate can suggest that it will experience an eventual loss in institutional  knowledge, expertise, and leadership continuity. Moreover, leading  organizations go beyond a succession approach that simply replaces  individuals. Rather, they instead identify and develop successors for  leadership and other key positions.", "USTR also faces periodic management transitions, which illustrates the  risk to its interagency leadership role of facing multiple senior vacancies  within a short period of time. The turnover in key positions that can result  from such management transitions is particularly critical for a small agency  such as USTR, at which each position is vitally important and staff are not  easily replaced. For instance, a recent transition in early 2005 resulted in  vacancies of five key posts within a 2-month period, including the offices of  China Affairs, Europe and Mediterranean, and Labor. While USTR  generally managed to fill these positions in a timely manner, the risks  inherent in suddenly having large gaps to fill in the government trade  leadership underscore the importance of USTR having the human capital  leadership in place to prepare the agency for transitional vacancies with  minimal disruption to the interagency trade process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USTR Operates as a Networked Organization Performing an Interagency Leadership and Coordination Mission, but Without Formal Interagency Resource Planning", "paragraphs": ["USTR\u2019s lack of commitment to strategic human capital principles in its  human capital leadership and planning also has implications for the  interagency trade process. USTR is a highly networked organization that  performs an interagency leadership and coordination mission. It  administers and chairs TPRG and TPSC, which make up the subcabinet- level mechanism for developing and coordinating U.S. government  positions on international trade and trade-related investment issues.  Supporting TPSC are more than 90 subcommittees responsible for  specialized areas and several task forces that work on particular issues.  USTR works with other agencies to carry out its mission, including  obtaining approval for initiatives in the interagency process. Through  interviews with current and former USTR officials, other trade agency  officials, and trade association representatives, we found that USTR, a  small trade agency that receives support from other larger agencies (e.g.,  Commerce, State, and Agriculture) in doing its work, operates more like an  elite core staff that provides leadership and coordination in working in  concert with others in the interagency trade policy process. USTR\u2019s  networked operational mode is a defining characteristic.", "In developing trade policy and conducting trade negotiations, the USTR  office directors (Assistant USTRs) whom we spoke with described working  with an extended interagency group comprised of other subject experts at  USTR and at a range of agencies. One Assistant USTR for a geographic  office described working with a \u201cvirtual team\u201d that crossed agency  boundaries but was instantaneously connected by e-mail. Another  Assistant USTR stressed that she had also developed a close working  relationship with embassy staff in her primary countries of interest, whom  she described as a critical resource. An Assistant USTR for a functional  office added that USTR was not only interacting with the major trade  agencies in the interagency process but also on many issues with the  relevant regulatory agencies in order to gain their perspective. One  example would be USTR\u2019s Agricultural Affairs office working not just with  the Foreign Agricultural Service at the Department of Agriculture but also  with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for scientific  assessment and analysis on sanitary/phytosanitary issues such as mad cow  disease.", "In explaining how USTR works to marshal interagency support, the  Assistant USTR for the Americas gave the example of the recently  concluded Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), for which  she had the negotiating lead. She said her negotiating team included  members of her office staff working with Central American desk officers at  a range of agencies, such as State and Commerce. However, it also included  subject experts from other USTR offices, for issues such as financial  services, agriculture, intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, market access,  and labor; and they all worked with their counterparts at a range of  agencies, such as Treasury, Agriculture, the Patent and Trademark Office,  the Food and Drug Administration, Commerce, and Labor, respectively. In  addition to their interagency interactions, the Office of the Americas also  coordinated and received input from USTR\u2019s private sector advisory  committees as well as trade associations.", "USTR can operate as a small elite agency precisely because of the  extensive support it receives from the other trade agencies. This support  can be characterized as falling into three main categories of assistance:   Participation in the interagency process\u2014As other trade agencies  participate in the interagency trade process, their staff contribute to the  work of the Trade Policy Staff Committee and its approximately 90  subcommittees. These staff assist in trade policy development in their  areas of expertise. When USTR forms trade negotiating teams, the USTR  negotiating lead generally draws the team largely from this core group  of experts and supplements with others, as necessary. Generally, even  though USTR has the lead, its staff are a small minority, averaging about  24 percent of the total delegation staff.", "Technical assistance\u2014USTR receives extensive technical assistance  from subject experts at the other agencies through formal and informal  requests for information. For instance, U.S. International Trade  Commission staff may provide data analyses on the impact of tariff  reductions or eliminations in prospective free trade agreements. USDA  Foreign Agricultural Service staff may provide commodity expertise on  issues related to Brazilian cotton or Japanese beef, or Health and  Human Services staff may provide information on pharmaceutical  pricing.", "Detailees \u2013 USTR also benefits from temporary staff on detail from  other agencies that continue to pay their salaries; USTR provides office  space and travel expenses. This is an important avenue for  supplementing USTR\u2019s core staff with specific subject expertise on a  temporary basis. For example, as of July 5, 2005, USTR supplemented its  core staff of 206 permanent employees with 26 detailees in its  Washington, D.C., office and 9 in its Geneva, Switzerland, office.", "This extensive assistance underlies USTR\u2019s ability to operate as a  networked organization. USTR officials stressed that it would not make  sense to try to duplicate this expertise within USTR and is unnecessary  because they can tap governmentwide expertise, when needed, without  bringing on staff they might not need permanently. USTR only adds core  staff for the most critical, long-term issues. For example, USTR added  intellectual property rights staff when it became clear it was a long-term  issue important to U.S. industry, according to a senior USTR official. In  addition, USTR also added staff with expertise on labor issues in recent  years.", "However, USTR does not formally discuss or plan human capital resources  at the interagency level, even though it must depend on the availability of  these critical resources to achieve its mission, according to USTR officials.  Interagency discussions focus on the substance of trade policy; USTR does  not formally discuss or plan the resources needed to implement policies. In  two recent reports, we have addressed the need for USTR to conduct  interagency resource planning related to specific trade issues, making  specific recommendations for improvements. Such interagency resource  planning would also facilitate human capital planning by the other agencies  that work with USTR. For example, USTR undertakes resource planning  when forming actual trade negotiating teams rather than at times when this  would contribute to agency resource planning. USTR officials told us that  their view is that when agencies reach formal TPRG agreement on a trade  policy or trade agreement, it carries a commitment by the agencies to  provide resources. In addition, they said that assisting USTR is a part of the  other trade agencies\u2019 missions to support the U.S. government trade  agenda. While officials we interviewed at other agencies generally agreed  with this perspective, some of them also said that potential budget cuts  could result in fewer resources being available for USTR. For example,  officials at the Foreign Agricultural Service expressed concern that the  expanding trade agenda has been a strain on its resources, and it was  facing serious budget cuts. As a result, since USTR does not provide the  other agencies with specific resource requirements when the agencies are  performing their planning, it is shifting the risk to the agencies of having to  later ensure the availability of staff in support of the trade agenda,  potentially straining their ability to achieve other agency missions.", "A fundamental principle of strategic human capital management is that  high-performing organizations manage risk based on strategic planning  supported by reliable and current information. One result of USTR\u2019s lack of  strategic planning for these critical interagency resources is that it does not  have a systematic method to account for potential changes in other  agencies\u2019 resources that might impact its ability to achieve its mission. The  absence of this method also affects the other agencies\u2019 ability to account  for changes that could affect their ability to provide resources to support  the trade agenda."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USTR Is Not Conducting Ongoing Strategic Human Capital Planning", "paragraphs": ["USTR\u2019s human capital planning efforts have been focused primarily on  short-term responses to trade negotiating needs; it has not conducted  ongoing long-term analyses of its workforce needs.

For instance, in the summer of  2005, USTR planned needed adjustments for the fiscal year 2006 budget  and made projections for fiscal year 2007.

The USTR budget office  uses the office-level information to compile a total budget estimate and set  the level of staffing and other budgetary allowances across the agency. For  instance, when the CAFTA negotiations were launched, the Assistant USTR  for the Americas\u2014whose office had the lead responsibility for the  negotiations\u2014estimated what additional staff might be needed, how many  rounds of negotiations might take place over the next 2 fiscal years, and  how much money would be needed for travel, translations, conferences, or  other needed expenses. She also indicated the assistance her office would  likely need from other functional offices (such as Agricultural Affairs or  Services, Investment, and Intellectual Property) and from staff offices  (such as General Counsel or Economic Affairs). In turn, these functional  and staff offices could then also factor this information, as well as the  requests for assistance from the other geographic offices, into their own  office planning.

This means that, rather than establishing  information systems, institutional knowledge at USTR depends on  individuals.

Other trade agency officials have confirmed that USTR  targets their high-performing staff and that several current USTR  employees were hired from their agencies. However, USTR has benefited  from the hiring flexibility to hire private sector attorneys at a \u201chigher-than-  minimum step,\u201d which, according to a senior manager in USTR\u2019s Office of  General Counsel, helps attract experienced private sector attorneys who  may be reluctant to start federal service at the minimum pay step.

Moreover, insufficient and ineffective use of flexibilities can significantly  hinder the ability of federal agencies to recruit, hire, retain, and manage  their human capital. Examples of expanded human capital flexibilities for  which USTR has authority, but does not use, include the following:  Expanded direct hire authority, which would streamline hiring for  critical needs, such as trade experts;  Recruitment and retention authorities, both of which would allow USTR  to offer bonuses of 25 to 50 percent for new hires and highly qualified  employees; and   Enhanced annual leave authority, which would allow nonfederal staff,  such as private sector attorneys, to enter federal service with higher- than-minimum annual leave rates.", "See appendix III for a more detailed description of federal human capital  flexibilities available to USTR.", "Closely aligned with USTR\u2019s recruiting efforts is how well it can retain staff,  but USTR\u2019s efforts to minimize its retention risks have also been limited.

Only SES staff, making up just over 10 percent of USTR  employees, are subject to agencywide performance competencies. In  addition, attorneys in the Office of General Counsel and its Monitoring and  Enforcement Unit have performance competencies that are linked to  agency goals, accounting for another 12 percent of staff. USTR managers  have stressed the importance of certain individual skills needed to advance  USTR\u2019s mission, such as the ability to effectively interact within the  interagency trade policy framework. However, USTR employees not  subject to agencywide standards are instead held accountable for a range  of expectations that vary among USTR offices according to specific  assignments. As we have previously reported, linking performance  expectations to organizational goals is important because strategic goals  should guide job responsibilities. In this way, an agency can ensure that  staff performance supports agency goals. Moreover, high-performing  organizations use their performance management systems to help provide  continuity during transition by maintaining a consistent focus on a broad  set of mission priorities. In USTR\u2019s case, without a performance  management system that ties individual performance to USTR\u2019s goals, it  does not have a mechanism to translate its strategic goals into individual  performance. Without agencywide goals, USTR is at risk of having its  mission guided by office-level goals, which would not be conducive to  meeting agency goals, given that USTR has over 15 separate mission- related offices. In addition, USTR could help mitigate the potentially  disruptive effects of periodic management transitions, such as it  experienced this year, with a concrete set of performance expectations that  guide staff performance throughout such periods and ensure consistency in  mission priorities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USTR needs to place more emphasis on strategic human capital principles,  otherwise it leaves itself open to human capital risks that could otherwise  be mitigated. While USTR often cites its small size as a reason it can afford  to sidestep requirements that are often applied to larger bureaucracies, in  the case of human capital management, it is precisely because every  individual is important that effective human capital leadership is critical.  Yet our review has found that USTR is focused on achieving trade results  but has overlooked the substantial additional value it could gain from  strategic human capital management. For example, without a senior  manager acting as its chief human capital officer, USTR cannot ensure that  critical human capital leadership tasks, such as succession planning, are  accomplished in a way that maximizes USTR\u2019s ability to achieve its mission  with minimal risk of interagency disruption due to management transitions.  Given the number of SES staff who will be eligible to retire within the next  5 years, it is important that USTR address these issues strategically rather  than reactively. Further, although USTR seems to be making effective use  of its networked structure to marshal the relevant expertise across the  government in support of the trade agenda, it has not taken additional steps  to mitigate the risk inherent in its dependency on interagency resources.  Without a method to plan interagency resources devoted to the trade  agenda, USTR has no way to account for potential changes in other  agencies\u2019 resources. Given the prospect of a tightening federal budget  environment, lack of a formal interagency resource planning method  means USTR is in no position to evaluate how budget reductions could  impact USTR\u2019s ability to achieve its mission. In addition, USTR has not  conducted ongoing strategic human capital planning for its own longer- term organizational workforce needs and does not maintain the  information systems required for such analysis. While USTR primarily uses  its 2-year budget planning process to focus its human capital planning  efforts, this approach limits it to planning how it can best achieve its trade  mission with the resources available to it in the short term. USTR has not  taken steps to strategically identify and respond to current and emerging  human capital risks in its workforce. As a result, by not conducting ongoing  strategic workforce planning, USTR is opening itself up to human capital  risks that it could be taking steps to mitigate.", "USTR could also better meet some of its key workforce challenges by  making better use of available human capital tools. In an increasingly  competitive recruitment environment, USTR could benefit from using the  additional hiring and pay flexibilities available to it. In addition, USTR has  not ensured that its performance standards support its organizational goals  by extending agencywide performance criteria to its entire staff.
