By law, the states in which these leases are located receive a share of the royalties collected, which are calculated as a percentage of the value of the oil or gas that is produced.", "The value of much of the oil from federal leases has been based on posted prices\u2014offers by purchasers to buy oil from a specific area. However, recent evidence indicates that oil is now often sold for more than the posted prices, suggesting that the value of the oil from federal leases and the amount of federal royalties should both be higher. On the basis of this evidence, in 1995 MMS began revising its regulations for valuing oil from federal leases and in February 1998 issued its most recent revision. The proposed regulations would reduce the use of posted prices to value much of the oil from federal leases and would instead generally require that other, and oftentimes higher, prices be used. By requiring that higher prices be used to value much of the oil from federal leases, the proposed regulations would increase federal royalties by as much as $66 million annually, according to MMS.", "Although states that receive distributions of these royalties generally support the proposed regulations, oil industry representatives generally oppose them, believing that oil companies should not pay royalties on higher prices and that they would suffer increased administrative requirements. As an alternative, the oil industry has suggested that MMS instead be required to accept, as the federal government\u2019s royalties, a percentage of the actual oil and gas produced from federal leases (known as royalties in kind), rather than cash royalties based on the value of that oil and gas. MMS would then sell this oil and gas to generate revenues.

There are approximately 22,000 federal oil and gas leases, which are located in 30 states, off the shore of California, and in the Gulf of Mexico. The federal government distributes about half of the royalties collected from federal leases located in states back to those states (although Alaska receives 90 percent) and shares a smaller portion of the royalties collected from leases off the shore of California and in the Gulf of Mexico with California and the Gulf states. About 78 percent of the federal leases are located in nine western states, but they produce relatively small amounts of oil and gas. In 1996, the most recent year for which data were available, these leases provided less than 13 percent of the total federal royalties; leases in the Gulf of Mexico provided about 83 percent of the total federal royalties (and leases in the rest of the country and off the shore of California provided the remaining 4 percent).", "Oil and gas royalties are calculated as a percentage (usually 12-1/2 percent for onshore federal leases and 16-2/3 percent for federal leases off the shore of California and in the Gulf of New Mexico) of the value of production, less certain allowable adjustments (reflecting, e.g., the cost of transporting oil to markets).

Posted prices can change frequently, and contracts using posted prices frequently specify that an additional premium be paid. Spot prices can change daily; two commonly cited spot prices are the prices paid for Alaska North Slope (ANS) and West Texas Intermediate crude oil. NYMEX futures contracts each establish a price for the future delivery of 1,000 barrels of sweet crude oil (similar in quality to West Texas Intermediate oil) at Cushing, Oklahoma, where several major oil pipelines intersect and storage facilities exist.", "When oil is bought and sold by parties with competing economic interests, the exchange is said to be \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d and the price paid establishes a market value for the oil. Roughly one-third of the oil from federal leases is sold at arm\u2019s length; the remaining two-thirds is exchanged between parties that do not have competing economic interests under terms that do not establish a price or market value. For example, oil companies that both produce and refine oil may transport the oil they produce to their own refineries rather than sell it. These oil companies may also exchange similar quantities of oil with other oil companies\u2014rather than sell it\u2014to physically place oil closer to their refineries and thereby reduce their costs of transporting it. Other oil companies that do not refine oil (often referred to as independent producers) may sell the oil they produce to marketing subsidiaries or to other companies with which they share economic interests.", "The value of oil from a federal lease is determined by the price paid in a sale \u201cat the lease,\u201d which is how independent producers traditionally sold their oil. Since the collapse of world oil prices in 1986, however, independent producers have employed marketers and traders to transport their oil from their leases to market centers and to refineries, where the oil is sold at higher prices. Under these circumstances, federal regulations provide that the price paid at the actual point of sale can be adjusted to approximate the price that would have been paid if the oil had been sold at the lease and that federal royalties can be paid on the adjusted price."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Royalties in Kind", "paragraphs": ["While oil and gas royalties are most often paid in cash, they may instead be paid with a portion of the actual oil or gas that is produced (e.g., the lessor, who receives the royalties, would take 12-1/2 barrels of oil from every 100 barrels of oil that is produced). This practice of taking royalties in kind is uncommon because few lessors can or want to store oil or gas or market and sell it. However, some lessors accept royalties in kind under certain circumstances because they can sell the oil or gas for more than they would have received if the royalties had been paid in cash. Paying royalties in kind rather than in cash eliminates the need to determine the sales price of the production because royalties in kind are calculated only on the basis of the volume of oil or gas that is produced.", "Representatives of the oil industry have suggested that the federal government accept some or all of its oil and gas royalties in kind and have testified before the Congress supporting a federal royalty-in-kind program. Legislation has been introduced in the Congress that would require the federal government to accept all its oil and gas royalties in kind (a recent amendment to the legislation would exempt certain wells).

For other transactions (i.e., those not at arm\u2019s length), the price of the oil is defined as the higher of either the gross proceeds or the amount arrived at by the first applicable valuation method from the following list of five alternatives: (1) the lessee\u2019s posted or contract prices, (2) others\u2019 posted prices, (3) others\u2019 arm\u2019s-length contract prices, (4) arm\u2019s-length spot sales or other relevant matters, and (5) a netback or any other reasonable method.

For transactions that are not at arm\u2019s length, however, the proposed regulations substantially change the means for determining the price of the oil, no longer relying on the use of posted prices and instead relying on spot prices.", "To determine federal royalties, the proposed regulations define the price of oil not sold in arm\u2019s-length transactions differently in each of three domestic oil markets: (1) Alaska and California (including leases off the shore of California); (2) the six Rocky Mountain states of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming; and (3) the rest of the country, including the Gulf of Mexico.

MMS also relied on additional studies, for which it had contracted, that concluded that posted prices did not reflect market value in other areas of the country as well.

Although the lawsuit and settlement included issues other than the valuation of oil, one of the major issues was whether the companies\u2019 use of posted prices represented the market value of oil produced from leases owned by the city and the state. After conducting a preliminary assessment of the implication of the settlement for federal oil leases in California and consulting with state officials, in June 1994 the Department of the Interior assembled an interagency task force with representatives from MMS, Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor, the departments of Commerce and Energy, and the Department of Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division. MMS also initiated audits of two of the seven major oil companies that produced oil from federal leases in California.", "The task force examined documents submitted by the companies in the lawsuit that had formerly been sealed by the court, reviewed the results of MMS\u2019 audits, and employed consultants to analyze the market for oil in California. The market studies noted that the seven major oil companies dominated the oil market in California by controlling most of the facilities that produce, refine, and transport oil in the state\u2014that is, most of these transactions were not at arm\u2019s length\u2014and that this domination in turn suppressed posted prices. According to one of the studies, transactions involving ANS crude oil were at arm\u2019s length however\u2014although ANS oil is refined in California, it is transported into the state by a company that does not own any refineries in California, and it is actively traded. As a result, ANS oil commanded substantial premiums over California oil that was comparable in quality. The task force concluded that the major oil companies in California inappropriately calculated federal royalties on the basis of posted prices, rather than include the premiums over posted prices that they paid or received. The task force estimated that the companies should have paid between $31 million and $856 million in additional royalties (the wide range reflects the use of different methodologies and different treatments of accrued interest) for the period 1978 through 1993.

Comments submitted by states were often at odds with comments provided by the oil industry: States generally support the proposed regulations because MMS anticipates that royalty revenues\u2014which are shared with the states\u2014will increase; the oil industry, on the other hand, generally opposes the proposed regulations because they would increase oil companies\u2019 royalty payments and administrative burden. When MMS disagreed with a comment received, the agency provided reasons for not revising the proposed regulations as suggested.

For these sales, MMS proposed that the value of oil from federal leases in Alaska and California would be based on ANS spot prices and that the value of oil from other federal leases would be based on NYMEX futures prices. Both the ANS and NYMEX prices would be adjusted for differences in the location of the leases and the quality of the oil.", "MMS received 70 written responses to this second notice. The oil industry generally opposed the proposed regulations, commenting that they were burdensome, that ANS and NYMEX prices did not reflect the market value of oil, that adjustments to these prices were burdensome and inadequate, and that the government should take its oil royalties in kind if it was dissatisfied with the current valuation regulations. Independent oil producers also commented that NYMEX prices should not be applied to the Rocky Mountain states because this oil market is geographically separate from the rest of the country. The states generally supported the proposed regulations, but individual states differed in their opinions on the applicability of NYMEX prices to value oil from federal leases and offered suggestions on the price adjustments for location and quality. The oil industry and several states opposed the proposed 2-year limitation on the use of the gross proceeds methodology, believing it was unnecessarily restrictive.", "In its third Federal Register notice, published in July 1997, MMS responded to the comments received by revising its proposed regulations: It deleted the proposed limitation on the use of the gross proceeds methodology, specifically asked for alternative suggestions for valuing oil not sold in arm\u2019s-length transactions, and solicited comments on six additional issues. MMS received 28 written responses. Independent oil producers supported the deletion of the limitation on the use of the gross proceeds methodology.

(App. II provides more information on these programs.) According to information from studies and the programs themselves, royalty-in-kind programs seem to be feasible if certain conditions are present. In particular, the programs seem to be most workable if the lessors have (1) relatively easy access to pipelines to transport the oil or gas to market centers or refineries, (2) leases that produce relatively large volumes of oil or gas, (3) competitive arrangements for processing gas, and (4) expertise in marketing oil or gas. However, these conditions do not exist for the federal government or for most federal leases: The federal government does not currently have relatively easy access to pipelines, has thousands of leases that produce relatively low volumes, has many gas leases for which competitive processing arrangements do not exist, and has limited experience in oil or gas marketing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Easy Access to Pipelines", "paragraphs": ["Once produced from a lease, oil or gas generally becomes more valuable (i.e., can be sold for higher prices) the closer it is moved to a market center or refinery, and pipelines are often the only cost-effective means of transporting it. Several of the entities operating royalty-in-kind programs told us that having relative ease of access to pipelines is a key component of their programs because it assures them that they can transport their production when they need to at a relatively low cost. For example, Alberta uses its regulatory authority to direct its lessees to deliver the province\u2019s oil royalties, using extensive pipelines that transport the oil to centrally located storage tanks, where oil marketers who are under contract with Alberta sell the oil. In Texas, state law mandates that all gas pipelines in the state accept and transport gas from the state\u2019s gas royalty-in-kind program. Representatives of the oil royalty-in-kind programs in the City of Long Beach, the states of California and Texas, and the University of Texas reported that because oil from certain leases could be transported on only one pipeline charging high fees, they were unable to accept royalties in kind from these leases or incurred losses in selling this oil because of the high transportation fees.", "The federal government does not currently have the statutory or regulatory authority over pipelines that would ensure relative ease of access for transporting oil and gas from federal leases. In addition, some pipelines are privately owned, and the owners are free to set their own transportation fees. In some areas of the country, oil from federal leases can be transported on just a single pipeline, and the owner of that pipeline may charge substantial fees. In 1995, MMS conducted a limited royalty-in-kind program on federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico, collecting gas royalties in kind and offering gas for sale near the leases. Because purchasers had to transport the gas and pay transportation fees to use the privately owned pipelines, the purchase bids that MMS received were relatively low. MMS estimated that this program lost about $4.7 million (about 7 percent) when compared to the revenues the agency would have received if it had taken its gas royalties in cash. Oil and gas marketers we contacted confirmed that the federal government would need to transport any royalties in kind it received to market centers or refineries in order to increase its revenues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Large Volumes", "paragraphs": ["To be cost-effective, royalty-in-kind programs must have volumes of oil and gas that are high enough for the revenues made from selling these volumes to exceed the programs\u2019 administrative costs. The volumes of oil or gas that are needed for programs to be cost-effective vary among programs. For example, when Wyoming tried in 1997 to initiate a limited oil royalty-in-kind program on 508 leases that produced, on average, less than 3 barrels of oil in royalties per day, it did not receive any bids that would have allowed the state to generate more revenues than it already received by taking its royalties in cash. Texas and the University of Texas generally do not accept royalty volumes of less than 10 barrels daily in their oil royalty-in-kind programs. MMS does not accept oil royalties in kind from leases supplying less than around 50 barrels per day, because it believes that the benefits to refiners from smaller volumes would not offset its administrative costs. And while Alberta accepts all of its oil royalties in kind, these royalty volumes are relatively large: 200 to 10,000 barrels per day are common. Similar situations exist in gas royalty-in-kind programs; for example, program representatives from Texas and the University of Texas told us that they needed to have large volumes of gas\u2014a minimum of either 300,000 or 2,000,000 cubic feet per day, depending on the pipeline used, to obtain pipeline transportation.", "The majority of oil and gas leases on federal lands produce relatively small volumes and are geographically scattered across many miles\u2014particularly for federal leases located in the western states. For example, MMS estimates that about 65 percent of the wells on federal oil leases in Wyoming produce less than 6 barrels of oil daily, which would result in less than 1 barrel per day in oil royalties in kind. Most federal leases in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico also produce low volumes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competitive Gas Processing Arrangements", "paragraphs": ["Because natural gas may need to be processed before it can be sold, arranging for this processing is a critical consideration in operating a gas royalty-in-kind program. The University of Texas noted that many of the university\u2019s leases produce small volumes of gas requiring processing and that these volumes must be aggregated into a larger amount to be accepted by gas-processing plants.", "Many federal leases also produce small volumes of gas that need to be processed. In certain areas, there is only a single plant to process the gas from many of these leases. In these circumstances, the lack of competition might allow the plants to charge high fees.

About two-thirds of the oil in California is produced by seven major oil companies, which also own about three-quarters of the refinery capacity in the state and have major investments in oil pipelines in the state. Many of these pipelines are common carrier lines that are regulated by the state and therefore must be made available to transport the oil of independent producers. However, these seven major oil companies also own three heated pipelines\u2014which make the heavy oil more liquid and therefore more easily transported through pipelines\u2014that are not common carrier lines; the seven major oil companies use their heated lines to transport their oil to their refineries in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

In operating these programs, these entities generally select specific leases to include, solicit bids from interested parties to purchase the oil that has been taken as royalties in kind, and issue short-term contracts (normally from 6 to 18 months) to the successful bidders to purchase this oil.

In selecting this sample, we sought to represent a cross-section of the oil industry and included in our sample major oil companies that both produced and refined oil, large independent companies that only produced oil, small independent producers, independent refiners, oil marketers, and oil industry trade associations.
