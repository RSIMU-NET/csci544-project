In fiscal year 2013, the Army had the highest competition rate, 66 percent, while the Missile Defense Agency had the lowest competition rate, 29 percent. The 14 justifications for noncompetitive awards that GAO reviewed generally included the elements required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation such as the authority permitting other than full and open competition. The majority of DOD's noncompetitive contracts and task orders (including all in GAO's sample) were coded under the \u201conly one responsible source\u201d exception to competition requirements. Seven of the 14 justifications explained that the awards could not be competed due to a lack of technical data. In these cases, DOD did not purchase the necessary data rights with the initial award. In some cases the justifications provided insight into how a lack of data rights resulted in reliance on a single vendor over time.", "DOD's focus on using open systems architecture and acquiring sufficient data rights\u2014which DOD's Better Buying Power memo encourages\u2014is influencing the way DOD acquires goods and services. Programs are trying to move away from dependency upon single suppliers for parts, maintenance or upgrades and are moving toward open systems architecture, which allows components to be modified, replaced or maintained by multiple suppliers. Some DOD programs have shown that using open systems architecture and obtaining data rights involves early consideration and extensive analysis of how each system can best use these approaches to maintain a competitive environment throughout a program's lifecycle. For example, an emphasis on open systems architecture and effective management of data rights resulted in increased competition for the Air Force's user equipment for the Global Positioning System and KC-46 Tanker Modernization programs.", "In 2010, DOD introduced requirements for competitive solicitations that result in only one offer; however, these rules are focused late in the acquisition process and DOD has limited insight into the reasons only one offer is received. The 15 one-offer awards GAO reviewed generally satisfied DOD's rules, which require contracting officers to ensure adequate solicitation periods and conduct cost or price analysis. These rules were intended to help ensure more effective competition but may apply too late in the acquisition process. DOD contracting officials and vendors told GAO that engagement with vendors well before the 30 day solicitation period is key to ensuring vendors have adequate time to review draft requests for proposals, plan resources, provide feedback on potentially restrictive requirements, and determine whether to prepare proposals. Moreover, contracting officers for the contracts GAO reviewed seldom collected information about reasons only one offer was received, which could limit their ability to revise acquisition strategies appropriately or plan for future competitive acquisitions. DOD's one-offer rules do not require contracting officials to engage with the vendor community to learn why vendors chose not to submit offers. However, contracting officials chose to do so in two sample cases, and in one case, based on this information, changed the acquisition strategy to allow for recompetition sooner than planned."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DOD should ensure that existing acquisition planning guidance promotes early vendor engagement, and establish guidance for when contracting officers should assess the reasons only one offer was received on competitive awards.

Competitive contracts can help save money,  improve contractor performance, curb fraud, and promote accountability  for results. In fiscal year 2013, DOD obligated $307.5 billion through  contracts and task orders, of which 57 percent was competed.  Acknowledging the need to make more efficient use of resources, DOD\u2019s  2010 \u201cBetter Buying Power\u201d (BBP) initiative placed an emphasis on  maximizing opportunities for competition in the acquisition of products  and services.", "While federal statutes and acquisition regulations generally require that  contracts be awarded on the basis of full and open competition, they also  permit federal agencies to award noncompetitive contracts in certain  circumstances, for example, when only one vendor can supply the  requirement or when a sole-source award is made under specified small  business programs. Generally, noncompetitive contracts must be  supported by written justifications that address the specific exception to  full and open competition that applies to the procurement. Also, the  government obligates billions of dollars annually under contracts and task  and delivery orders that are awarded using competitive procedures but for  which the government receives only one offer\u2014situations the Office of  Management and Budget has cited as high risk.

The conference report  accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2012 mandated us to report annually for 3 years on DOD\u2019s  noncompetitive and one-offer awards. For this report, we examined (1)  the trends in DOD\u2019s use of competitive awards, (2) the extent to which  justifications for exceptions to competitive procedures were adequate and  the reasons for the exceptions, (3) how DOD\u2019s strategies aimed at  promoting long-term competition are changing behavior, and (4) the  extent to which DOD\u2019s recent requirements address the reasons why only  one offer was received for competitive solicitations.", "To identify trends in DOD\u2019s use of competitive awards, we used the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to  identify DOD obligations under competitive and noncompetitive contracts  in fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the five most recent years for which  complete data were available. For the purposes of this report, we defined  noncompetitive obligations to include obligations through contracts that  were awarded using the exceptions to full and open competition listed in  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.3. We also included  noncompetitive orders issued under multiple award indefinite delivery /  indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts or under the General Service  Administration\u2019s schedules program.

For the  purposes of this report, we focused on four DOD components: Air Force,  Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and Navy.", "To assess the extent to which justifications for exceptions to competitive  procedures were adequate and the reasons for the exceptions, we  randomly selected a nongeneralizable sample of 14 contracts and orders  coded as noncompetitive in FPDS-NG.

For awards in our sample, we reviewed the signed  justification and approval document, the acquisition plan, market  research, and other key information in the contract files. We reviewed the  justifications for these awards to determine whether the documentation  met criteria in the FAR for content, timing, approval, and public  availability. In particular, we assessed whether the justifications were  clear and contained sufficient information to justify the use of the specific  authority cited as required by the FAR. As needed, we also discussed the  selected contracts and orders with contracting officials involved in these  awards to obtain additional information.", "To study how DOD strategies aimed at future competition are changing  program behavior, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 10 major  weapon programs based on responses from these programs to a  questionnaire developed for GAO\u2019s fiscal year 2013 weapons  assessment. We selected 10 programs that indicated that the program  may use, will use, or had already incorporated open systems architecture,  and may acquire, will acquire, or had already acquired a complete  technical data package. We did not select programs that had responded  that use of open systems architecture or acquisition of technical data  rights would not take place or the programs that did not respond to these  questions.

Only awards for which one offer was received in response to a  solicitation issued using competitive procedures, as coded in FPDS-NG,  were included in the sample. For each selected award, we obtained  evidence of the solicitation issuance and proposal due date,  documentation of cost or price analysis, and other key information. We  interviewed contracting officials involved with each award to understand  the competitive environment for each award and the possible reasons  why only one offer was received. We also interviewed several vendors  who had expressed interest in some of these awards but chose not to  submit offers.

Generally, noncompetitive awards  must be supported by written justifications that address the specific  exception to full and open competition that is being used in the  procurement.", "In addition, federal agencies can establish IDIQ contracts with one or  more contractors and may issue orders under these contracts. For  multiple award IDIQ contracts, agencies are generally required by the  FAR to provide all contractors with an IDIQ contract a fair opportunity to  be considered for each order above certain dollar thresholds; however,  agencies can award noncompetitive orders under certain circumstances,  which generally require a written justification. The General Services  Administration administers a program that uses IDIQ contracts with  vendors for commercially available goods and services, and federal  agencies place orders under the contracts. When doing so  noncompetitively, the FAR requires procuring agencies to justify the need  to restrict the number of vendors considered. Finally, agencies can also  competitively award contracts after limiting the pool of available  contractors\u2014a process called full and open competition after exclusion of  sources. For example, agencies are required by the FAR to set aside  procurements for small businesses if there is a reasonable expectation  that two or more responsible small businesses will compete for the work  and will offer fair market prices.", "Justifications generally are to provide sufficient facts or the rationale to  explain the use of the specific exception to competition. For example,  under FAR part 6, justifications must include, at a minimum, 12  elements. Examples of these required elements include  a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency\u2019s needs and their estimated value; identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition; a determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable; a description of market research conducted, if any; and a statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required.", "Examples of allowable exceptions to full and open competition for DOD  include circumstances when only one or a limited number of contractors  are the only sources capable of performing the requirement or when an  agency\u2019s need is of such unusual and compelling urgency that the  government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to  limit the number of sources. The FAR generally requires that  justifications be published on the Federal Business Opportunities  (FedBizOpps.gov) website and be approved at various levels within the  contracting organization.

Open  systems architecture promotes competition by allowing components to be  added, removed, modified, replaced, or maintained by multiple suppliers,  not just the manufacturer that developed the system. An open system is  designed with modular components each having its own functions. This  design makes the system easier to develop, maintain, and modify  because components can be changed without significantly impacting the  remainder of the system.", "Likewise, our prior work states that incorporating open systems  architecture and the acquisition of appropriate data rights, such as design  drawings, specifications, and standards, during program development can  result in greater competition and reduce costs during production. Further,  incorporation of open systems architecture and management of data  rights can lead to greater competition and reduced upgrade and repair  costs over a program\u2019s life cycle. But introducing this approach later in a  program\u2019s life cycle, such as for a planned modification or upgrade, is  more difficult, complex, and costly to do as it may require significant  modifications to an already-developed system. Defense systems can  have a life span of 40 years; figure 1 shows that the greater part of a  weapon system\u2019s total ownership cost consists of its operating and  support costs.

As a result, DOD is not in a position to accurately  measure the impact of the one-offer requirements since it was  implemented. We recommended that DOD develop an action plan for  DOD components to collect reliable data on competitive procurements for  which only one offer is received, so that the department can determine  the effect of its requirements on one-offer awards.

Program  officials said that they used open systems architecture to maximize  competition between multiple vendors and that they plan to acquire  data rights to address long\u2010term sustainment and competition for  future upgrades to the system. Further, the program is expected to  require the contractor to clearly define and describe all component  and system interfaces and ensure that this information is both  accurate and available to other potential vendors.

Program officials we spoke with stressed that open  systems architecture is a key tenet for the evolution of the air and  missile defense sensors and that decisions to incorporate open  systems architecture and acquire data rights need to be made very  early in program development. Early incorporation will enable the  Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense to compete future production  both at the system level and at the subsystem level. For example, the  program is designed so that the most current technology can be  inserted into just one component of the system through a competitive  acquisition without having to make any changes to any other parts of  the system. This design will allow the program to compete either the  entire system or subcomponents when the system goes into  production.", "Program officials at MDA\u2019s Ground Based Midcourse Defense  program conducted extensive data rights analysis and subsequently  acquired all technical data required for successful competition of the  development and sustainment contract.

Because of the lifecycle responsibility, they said that it is  important for critical data not to become obsolete so a modular  approach using standard interfaces was implemented to enable  maintenance and support, and prevent obsolescence issues, where  feasible. The program is procuring a technical data package in  support of the program\u2019s long-term technical data requirements for  design, manufacture and sustainment.

In particular, the Air Force conducted an analysis  of the FAR, the DFARS and applicable intellectual property laws to  ensure that the program acquired the sufficient data and licensing  rights, including data, for operations, maintenance, installation, and  training. The program obtained the operations, maintenance,  installation, and training data for a fixed price and these data rights  should allow the agency to maintain the system and compete both the  development of the training systems and the reprocurement package  for another system component. The Air Force was able to obtain the  rights for the operations, maintenance, installation, and training data  because the program required offerors to price data and include open  systems architecture and standard interfaces to the maximum extent  practical for a commercial derivative military aircraft.", "DOD officials also told us that training is a highly instrumental way to  change patterns of behavior and that to promote competition, the agency  needs an acquisition workforce that is educated on types of data rights.

Generally, the contracting officials for our cases did not feel that the  length of time the solicitation was open was a reason only one offer was  received, particularly because almost all of them were open for 30 days or  more. In several cases, vendors requested more time and the contracting  office extended the solicitation period beyond the initial 30 days, but the  vendor still did not submit an offer.

In 2011, we found that none of the agencies we reviewed had  measured or provided guidance on the time required to perform key steps  during the presolicitation acquisition planning phase.

In addition, DOD has not  conducted a formal study of the reasons only one offer is received and  the one-offer rules do not reflect this type of evaluation.", "Understanding the reasons only one offer was received can inform  whether to revise acquisition strategies going forward. In two cases,  contracting teams collected information from vendors that did not bid to  understand what the reasons were. For one award, the contracting office  requested additional information from the eight vendors with \u201cno bid\u201d  responses on a multiple award task order contract. Six vendors felt they  did not have the experience necessary to meet the requirements, and two  vendors stated that they were partnering with the sole offeror as  subcontractors. In another case, contracting officials did not reach out to  potential bidders, but observed from the proposal that they had teamed  with the sole offeror as subcontractors instead of choosing to compete. In  the other instance, contracting officials said they learned that some  vendors were in a teaming relationship with the incumbent that they did  not want to jeopardize. Officials said that another vendor explained the  release of this solicitation coincided with 24 other solicitations, and that if  this solicitation had come out later it would have made it easier for them  to submit an offer. Based in part on this information, the Navy changed  their acquisition strategy to decrease the period of performance from  5 years to 2 years, allowing for another competition sooner than planned.  Officials told us they may make other changes to the acquisition strategy  for the next procurement as well, including breaking the requirement into  pieces and using different contract vehicles. In contrast, we reviewed  another award that was initially planned to be a multiple award task order  contract, under which competition would continue on future task orders.  When only one offer was received, DOD went forward and awarded a  single award task order contract, with 1 base year and 4 option years.

We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to  examine the trends in DOD\u2019s use of noncompetitive awards and the  factors influencing DOD\u2019s competition rate, including the number of  awards, dollar amount obligated, and the percentage of contracts  awarded competitively overall and by component.", "To further examine the trends in DOD\u2019s use of noncompetitive awards,  we used data from FPDS-NG to identify DOD obligations under  competitive and noncompetitive contracts from fiscal year 2009 through  2013, the five most recent years for which complete data were available.  For the purposes of this report, we defined noncompetitive obligations to  include obligations through contracts that were awarded using the  exceptions to full and open competition listed in Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.3 (Other than Full and Open Competition).  We also included noncompetitive orders issued under multiple award  indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts or under the General  Service Administration\u2019s schedules program.

To determine if recent justification documents  complied with these requirements, we randomly selected 15 contracts  and orders coded as noncompetitive in FPDS-NG. Specifically, we  identified the two-digit product service code categories with the highest  dollar obligations. We then randomly selected one contract or task order  for each of these 15 product service codes from April 1, 2012, through  March 31, 2013. We ensured that our selection contained only contracts  or orders with a base and options values exceeding $650,000 and that it  included at least one award from the Air Force, Army, MDA, and Navy.  We also excluded from our review contracts or orders awarded under  simplified acquisition procedures and noncompetitive orders that were not  subject to multiple award fair opportunity as well as exceptions that do not  require a justification, such as international agreements. Our sample was  reduced to 14 when we removed 1 contract because it was miscoded.  Our final sample included 3 Air Force awards, 5 Army awards, 1 MDA  award, and 5 Navy awards. See appendix II for more details on the  selected noncompetitive awards.", "For the awards in our sample, we requested and reviewed the signed  justification and approval documents and additional documentation in the  contract files, including the first page of the signed contract, acquisition  plan, price negotiation memorandum, documentation of market research,  and statement of work/performance work statement and documentation, if  any, that the justification was posted on Federal Business Opportunities  website including the dates posted. We assessed justifications and  additional documentation for the 14 selected contracts or task orders  against elements in the FAR such as content, timing, approval, and public  availability. As needed, we contacted contract officials involved with  awarding these contracts to obtain additional information so we could  better understand the analysis conducted that resulted in the decision to  award these contracts or orders noncompetitively.", "To study how DOD\u2019s strategies aimed at promoting long-term competition  are changing behavior we selected a nongeneralizable sample of 10  major weapons systems programs. Our selection was based on 31  responses received from program offices on a questionnaire developed  for GAO\u2019s fiscal year 2013 weapons assessment. We analyzed the  survey responses for programs received for that report, where sent a  questionnaire to 65 defense acquisition programs and sub-elements of  programs to determine the extent to which programs were implementing  acquisition reforms. We selected 10 programs that had responded that  the program may use, will use, or had used open system architecture,  and also responded that the program may acquire, will acquire or had  acquired technical data. We did not select programs that had responded  that use of open systems architecture or acquisition of technical data  rights would not take place or the programs that did not respond to these  questions. We selected five major defense acquisition programs and five  future major defense acquisition programs. Further, we made certain that  our sample contained programs from the Air Force, Army, Navy, and  MDA. To learn how these programs are using open systems architecture  and acquiring effective data rights to promote competition, and what  informed the process that led to these decisions, we contacted officials  from each program to request interviews and we reviewed program  documents. We also interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary  of Defense and the Office of the Secretary of the Navy on the use of open  systems architecture and acquiring effective data rights. In addition, we  interviewed competition advocates at the Air Force, Army, MDA, and  Navy to discuss recent initiatives to promote long-term competition. We  did not evaluate the entire program or the outcome of actions described  to increase future competition.", "To examine the extent to which DOD\u2019s requirements address the reasons  why only one offer was received for competitive solicitations, we  examined DOD policies, regulations, and other related documents. To  determine whether recent awards complied with the requirements, we  reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 15 contracts and task orders.  Only awards for which one offer was received in response to a solicitation  issued using competitive procedures, as coded in FPDS-NG, were  included in the sample. The sample included the largest dollar value  award from each of the 15 largest product service categories, measured  by obligations, made from April 1, 2012, through March 31, 2013. For one  product service code, we selected the second largest award to ensure  that we reviewed at least one award from the following components: Air  Force, Army, MDA and Navy. The sample included 4 Air Force awards, 5  Army awards, 1 MDA award, and 5 Navy awards. See appendix III for  more details on the selected one-offer awards.", "For each selected award, we obtained evidence of the solicitation  issuance and proposal due date, documentation of cost or price analysis,  and other key information. We interviewed contracting officials involved  with each award to understand the competitive environment for each  award and the reasons why one offer was received. We also e-mailed or  interviewed several vendors who had expressed interest in some of these  awards but chose not to submit offers. We assessed recent DOD  implementing regulations to determine whether key reasons for one-offer  awards were addressed.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2013 to May 2014, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Selection of Noncompetitive Justification and Approval Documents", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Product or service category Air Force Space vehicles", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Missile Defense Agency Professional support", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Selected One-Offer Awards", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Penny Berrier, Assistant Director;  Alexandra Dew Silva; Lisa Fisher; Laura Greifner, Julia Kennon; Jean  McSween; Kenneth Patton; Jose Ramos; Roxanna Sun; and Alyssa Weir  also made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
