But the board has not fully defined roles and responsibilities of key members, working groups, and individuals, and it does not have clearly defined procedures for selecting and overseeing investments. As a result, the agency lacks adequate visibility into and oversight of IT investment decisions and activities.", "IT modernization: FEMA has begun to take steps to modernize its IT environment, but key planning documents are not current and complete. For example, the agency has an IT strategic plan and is currently drafting its modernization plan; however, the plans do not reflect the agency's current goals and objectives. Further, the IT strategic plan describes the Chief Information Officer's (CIO) mission, goals, and objectives through fiscal year 2016, but has not been updated since 2013. In addition, while the Office of the CIO is currently drafting the agency's IT modernization plan, including an implementation strategy and an overall schedule, it is not yet final. As a result, the agency is limited in its ability to move toward its goal to modernize its systems and eliminate duplicative IT investments.", "Workforce planning: The agency has not yet established time frames to address long-standing workforce management challenges. For example, while it conducted a workforce assessment to identify skill levels of employees in the agency's Office of the CIO, it has not completed recommended actions called for by this assessment. In addition, its workforce planning efforts have not included an assessment of the many IT staff located in the agency's regions and other offices. Consequently, FEMA has less assurance that its IT workforce will have the skills needed to successfully manage its programs.", "None of the three emergency management programs GAO selected for this review had fully implemented key IT management controls in the areas of risk management, requirements development, project planning, and systems testing and integration. Specifically, the three selected emergency management programs inconsistently implemented these practices by, for example, not always developing adequate risk mitigation plans, establishing processes for requirements management, developing and updating schedules and cost estimates, and ensuring complete and adequate system testing along with systems integration plans. These weaknesses were due, in part, to a lack of FEMA policies to guide programs in implementing these key IT management controls. Until FEMA fully establishes and implements such policies and controls, it has limited assurance that these programs will cost-effectively support its disaster response efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FEMA fully define its investment board's roles and responsibilities and procedures for selecting and overseeing investments, update its strategic plan and complete plans for IT modernization, and establish time frames for completing workforce planning efforts.

FEMA estimated that Hurricane Katrina  caused an estimated $108 billion in damages. Following the federal  response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Post-Katrina Emergency  Management Reform Act of 2006 (Post-Katrina Act) was enacted into  law. The act enhanced FEMA responsibilities to lead the country\u2019s  emergency management system. In doing so, the act required FEMA to  address the shortcomings identified in the preparation for and response to  Hurricane Katrina. For example, it required the FEMA Administrator, in  coordination with the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO), to take  appropriate measures to update and improve the agency\u2019s IT systems.", "In view of the act\u2019s requirements, you asked us to review FEMA\u2019s efforts  to improve its IT systems.

We  also interviewed officials from the National Advisory Council; the Disaster  Emergency Communications Division; Regions 2, 4, and 6; Mobile  Emergency Response Center (Thomasville, Georgia); and the National  Processing Center (Maryland). Further, we interviewed agency officials  from FEMA\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), its Office of  Policy & Program Analysis, and DHS\u2019s IG office to obtain their  perspectives on the challenges associated with FEMA\u2019s IT systems. We  then aggregated the key challenges. To determine the extent to which  FEMA had adequate controls in place to address these challenges, we  compared the agency\u2019s efforts to best practices we have identified in the  areas of IT investment management, human capital management, and  strategic planning.", "For the second objective, we selected three FEMA IT programs to  determine the extent to which FEMA has implemented key management  controls. The three programs we reviewed were the Disaster Assistance  Improvement Program (DAIP), Emergency Management Mission  Integrated Environment (EMMIE), and the Integrated Public Alert and  Warning System (IPAWS). In selecting these programs, we relied on the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s exhibit 53 and applied selection  criteria, including whether the program was associated with objectives of  the systems identified in the Post-Katrina Act or had spending in fiscal  year 2015. We then identified key practices in the areas of risk  management, requirements management, project planning, and systems  integration and testing from the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s  Capability Maturity Model\u00ae Integration for Acquisition (CMMI-ACQ) and  the Project Management Institute\u2019s Guide to the Project Management  Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae Guide).

Specifically, technical  issues in establishing a testing and development environment that  matched the production environment delayed project testing and  caused cost and schedule shortfalls. For example, costs for a project  under FEMA\u2019s DAIP investment rose approximately 27 percent  ($210,000) due, in part, to the delayed deployment of another  investment. We recommended that the department define and  document corrective actions for these shortfalls. The department  agreed with our recommendation and subsequently developed a  remediation plan for most of the shortfalls to limit the negative impact.", "In 2011, we reported that FEMA faced significant management  challenges in areas that affect the National Flood Insurance Program,  which is to provide direct disaster relief after floods. These  challenges included ineffective collaboration among offices within the  agency that were responsible for administering the program, including  the Mission Support office, which provided mission-critical functions,  such as IT, acquisition, and financial management. To address these  challenges, we recommended, among other things, that FEMA  develop protocols to encourage and monitor collaboration between  the office that administers the National Flood Insurance Program and  relevant support offices, including those for IT, acquisition  management, and financial management. In response, the Mission  Support Bureau had an ongoing effort to meet with FEMA program  offices to better understand the needs of their customers and  encourage collaboration between the Bureau and these offices. In  2015, we identified this program on our high-risk list due to the  structural weaknesses on how the program is funded and  weaknesses in management and program operations. In response,  officials stated that the agency is in the acquisition stage for a new IT  system for the entire National Flood Insurance Program.", "We also reported, in 2009, that FEMA faced coordination issues and  technical challenges in developing and implementing the IPAWS  program. Specifically, the agency faced challenges related to  systems integration and development. Subsequently, we  recommended that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the  Administrator of FEMA, as IPAWS is developed and deployed, to  establish and implement a plan to verify, among other things, the  dependability and effectiveness of systems used to disseminate  alerts.

Specifically, in 2011, the IG had reported that  FEMA IT systems did not fully support mission needs, were not  integrated, and did not fully provide needed capabilities because, in part,  they had been developed, patched, and interconnected in an ad hoc  manner. As a result of system limitations, the IG noted that end users  were engaged in inefficient, time-consuming business practices, creating  their own tools such as spreadsheets and databases. Accordingly, the IG  recommended that the CIO implement a plan of action and milestones to  address the integration and reporting limitations of existing systems. The  IG also recommended that the CIO implement and enforce a  standardized, agency-wide process that sufficiently defines and prioritizes  the acquisition, development, operation, and maintenance requirements  for all systems.
