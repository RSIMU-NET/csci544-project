This statement, which draws on that prior work, focuses on (1) the processes and analyses OSD and the services use to assess force structure and military personnel levels; (2) the extent to which the services' requirements analyses reflect new demands as a result of the changed security environment; and (3) the extent of information DOD has provided to Congress to support requests for military personnel."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Both OSD and the military services play key roles in determining force structure and military personnel requirements and rely on a number of complex and interrelated analyses. Decisions reached by OSD during the QDR and the budget process about planning scenarios, required combat forces, and military personnel levels set the parameters within which the services can determine their own requirements for units and allocate military positions. Using OSD guidance and scenarios, the Army's most recent biennial analysis, completed in 2006, indicated that the Army's total requirements and available end strength were about equal. The Marine Corps' most recent assessment led to an adjustment in the composition and mix of its units. Both the Army and Marine Corps are coping with additional demands that may not have been fully reflected in OSD guidance, the QDR, or in recent service analyses. First, the Army's analysis did not fully consider the impact of converting from a division-based force to modular units, partly because modular units are a new concept and partly because the Army made some optimistic assumptions about its ability to achieve efficiencies and staff modular units within the QDR-directed active military personnel level of 482,400. Second, the Army's analysis assumed that the Army would be able to provide 18 to 19 brigades at any one time to support worldwide operations. However, the Army's global operational demand for forces is currently 23 brigades and Army officials believe this demand will continue for the foreseeable future. The Marine Corps' analyses reflected some new missions resulting from the new security environment. However, the Commandant initiated a new study following the 2006 QDR partly to assess the impact of requirements for a Special Operation Command. Prior GAO work has shown that DOD has not provided a clear and transparent basis for military personnel requests that demonstrates how they are linked to the defense strategy. GAO believes it will become increasingly important to demonstrate a clear linkage as Congress confronts looming fiscal challenges facing the nation and DOD attempts to balance competing priorities for resources. In evaluating DOD's proposal to permanently increase active Army and Marine Corps personnel levels by 92,000 over the next 5 years, Congress should carefully weigh the long-term costs and benefits. To help illuminate the basis for its request, DOD will need to provide answers to the following questions: What analysis has been done to demonstrate how the proposed increases are linked to the defense strategy? How will the additional personnel be allocated to combat units, support forces, and institutional personnel, for functions such as training and acquisition? What are the initial and long-term costs to increase the size of the force and how does DOD plan to fund this increase? Do the services have detailed implementation plans to manage potential challenges such as recruiting additional personnel, providing facilities, and procuring new equipment?"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) processes for determining force structure and military personnel  requirements for the Army and Marine Corps. The war in Iraq, along with  continuing operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world, have led  to significant stress on U.S. ground forces and have raised questions about  whether they are appropriately sized and structured to meet the demands  of the new security environment. Units are being tasked to stay in theater  longer than anticipated, and some personnel are now embarking on their  third overseas deployment since 2001. Although the department\u2019s 2006  Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) concluded that the Army and Marine  Corps should plan to stabilize at a level of 482,400 and 175,000 active  military personnel respectively, the Secretary of Defense recently  announced plans to permanently increase the size of the active Army and  Marine Corps by a total of 92,000 troops over the next 5 years. Given the  significant long- term costs associated with such an increase, it is  important to understand how DOD determines military personnel  requirements and the extent to which requirements are based on rigorous  analysis. As our prior work has shown, valid and reliable data about the  number of personnel required to meet an agency\u2019s needs are critical  because human capital shortfalls can threaten an organization\u2019s ability to  perform missions efficiently and effectively. This is particularly true for  the DOD, where the lack of rigorous analysis of requirements could have  significant consequences for military personnel called upon to execute  military missions or, alternatively, could lead to inefficiencies in allocating  funds within the defense budget.", "My testimony today will focus on three issues: (1) the processes and  analyses used by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the  Army and Marine Corps to assess force structure and military personnel  levels; (2) the extent to which the services\u2019 recently completed  requirements analyses reflect new demands resulting from the changed  security environment; and (3) the extent of information provided to  Congress to support the department\u2019s requests for military personnel. In  light of the recent proposal to permanently increase the size of the Army  and Marine Corps, my comments will focus largely on requirements for  active personnel, although the service requirements process I will be  discussing apply to both the active and reserve components, and our prior  work has shown that ongoing operations have taken a toll on the reserve  components as well.

To operationalize  the defense strategy, the 2006 QDR identified four priority areas for further  examination: defeating terrorist networks, defending the homeland,  shaping the choices of countries at strategic crossroads, and preventing  hostile state and non-state actors from acquiring or using weapons of mass  destruction. These areas illustrated the types of capabilities and forces  needed to address the challenges identified in the defense strategy and  helped DOD to assess that strategy and review its force planning  construct. Changes in the security environment and the force planning  construct may require DOD and the services to reassess force structure  requirements\u2014how many units and of what type are needed to carry out  the national defense strategy. Likewise, changing force structure  requirements may create a need to reassess active end strength\u2014-the  number of military personnel annually authorized by Congress which each  service can have at the end of a given fiscal year.", "The services allocate their congressionally authorized end strength among  operational force requirements (e.g., combat and support force units),  institutional requirements, and requirements for personnel who are  temporarily unavailable for assignment. Operational forces are the forces  the services provide to combatant commanders to meet mission  requirements, such as ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Institutional forces include command headquarters, doctrine writers, and  a cadre of acquisition personnel, which are needed to prepare forces for  combat operations. Personnel who are temporarily unavailable for  assignment include transients, transfers, holdees, and students.", "The Secretary of Defense\u2019s recent proposal to permanently increase the  size of the Army and Marine Corps represents a significant shift in DOD\u2019s  plans, as reflected in the 2006 QDR. In fiscal year 2004, the Army\u2019s  authorized end strength was 482,400 active military personnel. Since that  time, the Army has been granted authority to increase its end strength by  30,000 in order to provide flexibility to implement its transformation to a  modular force while continuing to deploy forces to overseas operations.  Rather than return the Army to the 482,400 level by fiscal year 2011, as  decided in the 2006 QDR, DOD\u2019s new proposal would increase the Army\u2019s  permanent end strength level to 547,000 over a period of 5 years. DOD\u2019s  plans for Marine Corps end strength have also changed. In fiscal year 2004,  the Marine Corps\u2019 was authorized to have 175,000 active military  personnel. For the current fiscal year, Marine Corps end strength was  authorized at 180,000, although DOD\u2019s 2006 QDR planned to stabilize the  Marine Corps at the 175,000 level by fiscal year 2011. The Secretary\u2019s new  proposal would increase permanent Marine Corps end strength to a level  of 202,000 over the next 5 years. In terms of funding, DOD is currently  authorized to pay for end strength above 482,400 and 175,000 for the Army  and Marine Corps, respectively, with emergency contingency reserve  funds or from supplemental funds used to finance operations in Iraq and  Afghanistan. Until Congress receives the President\u2019s budget request, it is  unclear how DOD plans to fund the proposed increases.", "In 2004, the Army began its modular force transformation to restructure  itself from a division-based force to a modular brigade-based force\u2014an  undertaking it considers the most extensive reorganization of its force  since World War II. This initiative, according to Army estimates, will  require an investment exceeding $52 billion through fiscal year 2011. The  foundation of the modular force is the creation of standardized modular  combat brigades in both the active component and National Guard. The  new modular brigades are designed to be self-sufficient units that are more  rapidly deployable and better able to conduct joint and expeditionary  operations than their larger division-based predecessors. The Army  planned to achieve its modular restructuring without permanently  increasing its active component end strength above 482,400, in accordance  with a decision reached during the 2006 QDR. The February 2006 QDR  also specified that the Army would create 70 active modular combat  brigades in its active component and National Guard.", "According to the Army, the modular force will enable it to generate both  active and reserve component forces in a rotational manner. To do this,  the Army is developing plans for a force rotation model in which units will  rotate through a structured progression of increased unit readiness over  time. For example, the Army\u2019s plan is for active service members to be at  home for 2 years following each deployment of up to 1 year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determination of Force Structure and Military Personnel Requirements Is A Complex Process Involving Both OSD And The Services", "paragraphs": ["Both OSD and the military services play key roles in determining force  structure and military personnel requirements and rely on a number of  complex and interrelated process and analyses-\u2013rather than on one clearly  documented process.

These scenarios  are included in planning guidance that the Office of the Secretary of  Defense provides the services to assist them in making more specific  decisions on how to allocate their resources to accomplish the national  defense strategy. For example, these scenarios would include major  combat operations, stability operations, domestic support operations, and  humanitarian assistance operations.", "GAO examined whether DOD had established a solid foundation for  determining military personnel requirements. While we are currently  reviewing the plans and analyses of the 2006 QDR, our February 2005  assessment of DOD\u2019s processes identified several concerns that, if left  uncorrected, could have hampered DOD\u2019s QDR analysis. First, we found  that DOD had not conducted a comprehensive, data-driven analysis to  assess the number of active personnel needed to implement the defense  strategy. Second, OSD does not specifically review the services\u2019  requirements processes to ensure that decisions about personnel levels  are linked to the defense strategy.

This process involves first determining  the number and type of forces needed to execute the National Military  Strategy based on OSD guidance, comparing this requirement with the  Army\u2019s present force structure, and finally reallocating military positions  to minimize the risks associated with any identified shortfalls. Taken  together, this process is known as \u201cTotal Army Analysis.\u201d The Army has  conducted this analysis for many years and has a good track record for  updating and improving its modeling, assumptions, and related processes  over time, as we noted in our last detailed analysis of the Army\u2019s process.  Active and reserve forces are included in this analysis in order to provide a  total look at Army requirements and the total end strength available to  resource those requirements. Also, the number of combat brigades is  specified by OSD in the QDR and is essentially a \u201cgiven\u201d in the Army\u2019s  requirements process. The Army\u2019s process is primarily intended to assess  the support force structure needed to meet the requirements of the  planning scenarios, and to provide senior leadership a basis for better  balancing the force.", "In the first phase of the Army\u2019s requirements determination process, the  Army uses several models, such as a model to simulate warfights using the  scenarios provided by OSD and the number of brigades OSD plans to use  in each scenario. The outcomes of the warfighting analyses are used in  further modeling to generate the number and specific types of units the  Army would need to support its brigade combat teams. For example, for a  prolonged major war, the Army needs more truck companies to deliver  supplies and fuel to front line units. For other types of contingencies, the  Army may use historical experience for similar operations to determine  requirements since models are not available for all contingencies. The  Army also examines requirements for the Army\u2019s institutional force, such  as the Army\u2019s training base, in order to obtain a total bottom line  requirement for all the Army\u2019s missions.", "In the second phase of the Army\u2019s process\u2014known as the \u201cresourcing  phase\u201d\u2014 the Army makes decisions on how to best allocate the active and  reserve military personnel levels established by OSD against these  requirements. In order to provide the best match, the Army will develop a  detailed plan to eliminate lower priority units, and stand up new units it  believes are essential to address capability gaps and meet future mission  needs. For example, in recent years, the Army has made an effort to  increase units needed for military police, civil affairs, engineers, and  special operations forces. These decisions are implemented over the  multiple years contained in DOD\u2019s Future Years Defense Program. For  example, the intent of the Army\u2019s most recent analysis was used to help  develop the Army\u2019s budget plans for fiscal years 2008\u20132013.", "Historically, the Army has had some mismatches between the  requirements it estimated and its available military personnel levels.

However, the Army did not  consider the full impact of this transformation in its analysis, in part  because these initiatives were relatively new at the time the analysis was  conducted. The Army\u2019s recent analysis recognized that modular units  would require greater numbers of combat forces than its prior division- based force and assumed this could be accomplished by reducing military  positions in the Army\u2019s institutional forces, such as its command  headquarters and training base, rather than increasing the size of the  active force. However, in our September 2006 report discussing the Army\u2019s  progress in converting to a modular force, we questioned whether the  Army could meet all of its modular force requirements with a QDR- directed, active component end strength of 482,400. Under its new  modular force, the Army will have 42 active brigades compared with 33  brigades in its division-based force. In total, these brigades will require  more military personnel than the Army\u2019s prior division-based combat  units. Therefore, as figure 1 illustrates, the Army planned to increase its  active component operational force\u2014that is, its combat forces\u2014from  315,000 to 355,000 personnel to fully staff 42 active modular brigade  combat teams. To accomplish this with an active end strength level of  482,400, the Army had hoped to substantially reduce the size of its active  component institutional force\u2014that is, its training base, acquisition  workforce, and major command headquarters\u2014from 102,000 to 75,000  military personnel. The Army also planned to reduce the number of active  Army personnel in a temporary status at any given time, known as  transients, transfers, holdees, and students, or TTHS. In fiscal year 2000,  this portion of the force consisted of 63,000 active military personnel and  the Army planned to reduce its size to 52,400.", "While the Army has several initiatives under way to reduce active military  personnel in its institutional force, our report questioned whether those  initiatives could be fully achieved as planned. The Army had made some  progress in converting some military positions to civilian positions, but  Army officials believed additional conversions to achieve planned  reductions in the noncombat force would be significantly more  challenging to achieve and could lead to difficult trade-offs. In addition,  cutting the institutional force at a time when the Army is fully engaged in  training forces for overseas operations may entail additional risk not fully   anticipated at the time the initiatives were proposed. Last, we noted that  the Army is still assessing its modular unit concepts based on lessons  learned from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and other analyses led by  the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command, and the impact on force  structure requirements may not yet be fully known.", "We should note that, at the time of our report, the Army did not agree with  our assessment of its personnel initiatives. In written comments on a draft  of our report, the Army disagreed with our analysis of the challenges it  faced in implementing its initiatives to increase the size of the operational  force within existing end strength, noting that GAO focused inappropriate  attention on these challenges. The Army only partially concurred with our  recommendation that the Secretary of the Army develop and provide the  Secretary of Defense and Congress with a report on the status of its  personnel initiatives, including executable milestones for realigning and  reducing its noncombat forces. The Army stated that this action was  already occurring on a regular basis and another report on this issue  would be duplicative and irrelevant. However, the reports the Army cited  in its response were internal to the Army and the Office of the Secretary of  Defense. The comments did not address the oversight needs of Congress.  We stated in our report that we believe that it is important for the  Secretary of Defense and Congress to have a clear and transparent picture  of the personnel challenges the Army faces in order to fully achieve the  goals of modular restructuring and make informed decisions on resources  and authorized end strength.", "Another factor to consider is that the Army\u2019s most recent requirements  analysis was linked to planning scenarios directed by OSD and did not  fully reflect current operational demands for Iraq and Afghanistan. The  Army\u2019s analysis assumed that the Army would be able to provide 18 to 19  brigades at any one time (including 14 active and 4 to 5 National Guard  brigades) to support worldwide operations.

As a  result of this review, the Marine Corps approved a number of force  structure changes including increases in the active component\u2019s infantry,  reconnaissance, and gunfire capabilities and decreases in the active  component\u2019s small-craft company and low-altitude air defense positions.  However, this review was based on the assumption that the Marine Corps  would need to plan for an end strength of 175,000 active personnel. As a  result, the Marine Corps\u2019 2004 review focused mostly on rebalancing the  core capabilities of the active and reserve component rather than a  bottom-up review of total personnel requirements to meet all 21st century  challenges.  In March 2006, shortly after the QDR was issued, the Marine Corps  Commandant formed a Capabilities Assessment Group to assess  requirements for active Marine Corps military personnel. One of the  group\u2019s key tasks was to determine how and whether the Marine Corps  could meet its ongoing requirements while supporting the QDR decision to  establish a 2,600 personnel Marine Corps Special Operations Command.  The group was also charged with identifying what core capabilities could  be provided at a higher end strength level of 180,000. We received some  initial briefings on the scope of the group\u2019s work. Moreover, Marine Corps  officials told us that the group completed its analysis in June 2006.  However, as of September 2006 when we completed our work, the Marine  Corps had not released the results of its analysis.

During the next decade, Congress will be faced with  making difficult trade-offs among defense and nondefense-related  spending. Within the defense budget, it will need to allocate resources  among the services and their respective personnel, operations, and  investment accounts while faced with multiple competing priorities for  funds. DOD will need to ensure that each service manages personnel levels  efficiently since personnel costs have been rising significantly over the  past decade. We have previously reported that the average cost of  compensation (including cash, non-cash, and deferred benefits) for  enlisted members and officers was about $112,000 in fiscal year 2004. The  growth in military personnel costs has been fueled in part by increases in  basic pay, housing allowances, recruitment and retention bonuses,  incentive pay and allowances, and other special pay.

High-performing organizations routinely use  current, valid, and reliable data to inform decisions about current and  future workforce needs.

Moreover, the Marine Corps\u2019 decision to initiate a new study to  assess active military personnel requirements shortly after the 2006 QDR  was completed is an indication that the QDR did not achieve consensus in  required end strength levels.", "In evaluating DOD\u2019s proposal to permanently increase active Army and  Marine Corps personnel levels by 92,000 over the next 5 years, Congress  should carefully weigh the long-term costs and benefits. It is clear that  Army and Marine Corps forces are experiencing a high pace of operations  due to both the war in Iraq and broader demands imposed by the Global  War on Terrorism that may provide a basis for DOD to consider permanent  increases in military personnel levels. However, it is also clear that  increasing personnel levels will entail significant costs that must be  weighed against other priorities. The Army has previously stated that it  costs about $1.2 billion per year to increase active military personnel  levels by 10,000. Moreover, equipping and training new units will require  billions of additional dollars for startup and recurring costs.", "DOD has not yet provided a detailed analysis to support its proposal to  permanently increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps. Given the  significant implications for the nation\u2019s ability to carry out its defense  strategy along with the significant costs involved, additional information  will be needed to fully evaluate the Secretary of Defense\u2019s proposal.", "To help illuminate the basis for its request, DOD will need to provide  answers to the following questions:    What analysis has been done to demonstrate how the proposed increases  are linked to the defense strategy? To what extent are the proposed  military personnel increases based on supporting operations in Iraq versus  an assessment of longer-term requirements?", "How will the additional personnel be allocated to combat units, support  forces, and institutional personnel, for functions such as training and  acquisition?", "What are the initial and long-term costs to increase the size of the force  and how does the department plan to fund this increase?", "Do the services have detailed implementation plans to manage potential  challenges such as recruiting additional personnel, providing facilities, and  procuring new equipment?", "Our prior work on recruiting and retention challenges, along with our  prior reports on challenges in equipping modular units, identify some  potential challenges that could arise in implementing an increase in the  size of the Army and Marine Corps at a time when the services are  supporting ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. For example, we  have reported that 19 percent of DOD\u2019s occupational specialties for  enlisted personnel were consistently overfilled while other occupational  specialties were underfilled by 41 percent for fiscal years 2000 through  2005. In addition, we have reported that the Army is experiencing  numerous challenges in equipping modular brigades on schedule, in part  due to the demands associated with meeting the equipment needs of units  deploying overseas. Such challenges will need to be carefully managed if  Congress approves the Secretary of Defense\u2019s proposal.", "Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, this concludes my  prepared remarks.
