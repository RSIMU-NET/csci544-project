The regulations are designed to protect the health and safety of residents and ensure that they are receiving active treatment for their disability and not merely custodial care.  Each CoP encompasses a broad range of discrete standards that HCFA determined were essential to a well-run facility. The CoPs cover most areas of facility operation, including administration, minimum staffing requirements, provision of active treatment services, health care services, and physical plant requirements. (See app. II for a more detailed description of the ICF/MR CoPs.) The eight CoPs comprise 378 specific standards and elements.", "HCFA requires that states conduct annual on-site inspections of ICFs/MR to assess the quality of care provided and to certify that they continue to meet federal standards for Medicaid participation.

These agencies may also conduct complaint surveys at any time during the year in response to specific allegations of unsafe conditions or deficient care.", "If the surveyors identify deficiencies, the institution must submit a plan of correction to the survey agency and correct\u2014or show substantial progress toward correcting\u2014any deficiency within a specified time period. For serious deficiencies, those cited as violating the CoPs, HCFA requires that the institution be terminated from Medicaid participation within 90 days unless corrections are made and verified by the survey agency during a follow-up visit.

Serious active treatment deficiencies were cited 115 times in 84 institutions on the past four annual surveys.", "Eighteen institutions were cited for this CoP deficiency on their most recent annual survey. Serious active treatment deficiencies cited on the survey reports included, for example, staff\u2019s failure to prevent dangerous aggressive behavior, failure to ensure that a resident with a seizure disorder and a history of injuries wore prescribed protective equipment, and failure to implement recommended therapy and treatment to maintain a resident\u2019s ability to function and communicate.", "State surveyors also frequently found other CoP violations. They found, for example, residents of one state institution who had suffered severe hypothermia, pneumonia, and other serious illnesses and injuries as a consequence of physical plant deterioration, inadequate training and deployment of professional staff, failure to provide needed medical treatment, drug administration errors, and insufficient supervision of residents. Surveyors determined that the state had failed to provide sufficient management, organization, and support to meet the health care needs of residents and cited the facility for violating the governing body and management CoP.", "Other CoP violations found during this period include serious staffing deficiencies and client protection violations. Surveyors of one state institution reported deficiencies such as excessive turnover, insufficient staff deployment, frequent caseload changes, and lack of staff training. In this institution, surveyors also found residents vulnerable to abuse and mistreatment by staff and staff who failed to report allegations of mistreatment, abuse, and neglect in a timely manner. Other staff who were known to abuse residents in the past continued to work with residents and did not receive required human rights training.", "State agencies also conduct complaint surveys in large public ICFs/MR in response to alleged deficiencies reported by employees, advocates, family members, providers, or others.

In addition, the Department found that in the same facility a few years earlier, a moderately retarded resident suffered massive brain damage and lost the ability to walk and talk due to staff failure to provide emergency care in response to a life-threatening seizure. In another state institution, Justice found facility incident reports from 1992 and 1993 documenting that some residents were covered with ants and one resident was found with an infestation of maggots and bloody drainage from her ear.

Second, enforcement efforts have not been sufficient to ensure that deficient care practices do not recur. Third, because states are responsible for both delivering and monitoring the care provided in most public institutions, state agency surveys of these institutions may lack the necessary independence to avoid conflicts of interest. Finally, a decline in direct HCFA oversight has reduced HCFA\u2019s ability to monitor problems and help correct them.

State surveyors examine a broad range of facility practices, environmental conditions, and client outcomes to ensure minimum compliance with HCFA standards. Surveys are generally limited to a review of the current care provided to a sample of residents in an institution, are conducted annually, and may last 1 to 2 weeks at a large public institution.", "In contrast, Justice Department investigations are intended to determine whether civil rights violations exist. They generally focus on deficient care practices about which Justice has received specific allegations, often related to medical and psychiatric care. Such investigations may include a review of care provided to all individuals in a facility, extend over several months, and include an examination of client and facility records covering several years to assess patterns of professional practice.", "The professional qualifications and expertise of individuals conducting state agency surveys and Justice\u2019s investigations also differ. State surveyors are usually nurses, social workers, or generalists in a health or health-related field. Not all have expertise in developmental disabilities. Although HCFA recommends that at least one member of a state survey team be a qualified mental retardation professional (QMRP), 17 states had no QMRPs on their survey agency staffs as of March 1996. Justice\u2019s investigators are usually physicians, psychiatrists, therapists, and others with special expertise in working with the developmentally disabled. According to HCFA and Justice officials, Justice Department investigators generally can better challenge the judgment of professionals in the institution regarding the care provided to individual residents than can state surveyors.", "HCFA officials acknowledged that the differences between Medicaid surveys and Justice investigations could explain some of the differences between their findings. They told us, however, that they have begun to implement several changes to the survey process to increase the likelihood that state surveys will identify all serious deficiencies. These include new instructions to surveyors for assessing the seriousness of deficiencies, increased training for surveyors and providers, and implementation of a new survey protocol intended to focus more attention on critical quality-of-care elements and client outcomes.", "The new survey protocol reduces the number of items that must be assessed each year and places greatest emphasis on client protections, active treatment, client behavior and facility practices, and health care services. The new protocol gives surveyors latitude, however, to expand the scope of a facility\u2019s survey if they find specific problems. HCFA\u2019s pilot test of the new protocol showed that although surveyors identified fewer deficiencies overall than with the standard protocol, they issued more citations for the most serious CoP violations.

For example, between December 1990 and May 1995, state survey agencies cited 33 large public institutions for violating the same CoP on at least one subsequent survey within the next 3 years. Moreover, 25 were cited for violating the same CoP on one or more consecutive surveys.", "HCFA officials told us that the sanctions available to the states under Medicaid have not always been effective in preventing recurring violations and are rarely used against large public ICFs/MR. Only two possible sanctions are available under the regulations for CoP violations: suspension\u2014that is, denial of Medicaid reimbursement for new admissions\u2014or termination from the program. Medicaid regulations do not contain a penalty for repeat violations that occur after corrective action.", "Denying reimbursement to large public institutions for new admissions is not a very relevant sanction because many of these institutions are downsizing or closing and are not generally accepting many new admissions. Furthermore, terminating a large institution from the Medicaid program is counterproductive because denying federal funds may further compromise the care of those in the institution. No large public institutions were terminated from Medicaid for reasons of deficient care and not reinstated from 1990 through 1994, the period for which data were readily available.", "HCFA officials told us that they were particularly concerned about institutions where surveyors found repeat violations of the same CoPs.

The state survey agency, usually a part of a state\u2019s department of health, conducts surveys to determine whether ICFs/MR are in compliance with quality standards.

Officials from HCFA and Justice, providers, and experts told us that this effort helped improve the quality of care in many institutions and stimulate improvements to the state survey process.", "The recent decline in federal oversight, however, has increased the potential for abusive and dangerous conditions in these institutions. HCFA officials told us that regional office staff have neither conducted sufficient reviews nor acted on facility deficiencies in recent years because of competing priorities and resource constraints. According to these officials, resources previously used for federal surveys of ICFs/MR have been diverted to allow compliance with requirements for increased federal monitoring surveys of nursing facilities and for other reasons. Regional office officials report that these resource constraints have limited their current review efforts to mostly private ICFs/MR of six beds or less.", "HCFA regional office staff are now less able to identify deficiencies or areas of weakness and to provide targeted training or other support to state surveyors.

Furthermore, serious deficiencies continue to recur in some of these institutions.", "Effective federal oversight of large public ICFs/MR and the state survey agencies that inspect them requires that the inspection process be well defined and include essential elements of health care, active treatment, and safety; that enforcement efforts prevent the recurrence of problems; that surveyors be independent; and that HCFA officials have sufficient information to monitor the performance of institutions and state survey agencies. The approach and resources of Medicaid surveys, the lack of effective enforcement mechanisms, the potential conflicts of interest occurring when states are charged with surveying the facilities they operate, and the decline in direct federal monitoring efforts have all weakened oversight of large public ICFs/MR and state survey agencies.", "HCFA has begun to implement changes to the structure and process of state agency surveys of ICFs/MR.
