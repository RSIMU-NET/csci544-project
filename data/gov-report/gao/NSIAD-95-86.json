Proponents also argue that more government support for exports is needed to level the playing field against foreign (mostly European) competitors. Opponents of providing additional U.S. government support argue that such support could delay restructuring of the defense industry and jeopardize longer-term national security by increasing global weapons proliferation.", "Because of the continuing congressional debate on how much support to provide to defense exporters, we reviewed (1) conditions in the global defense export market and (2) the tools used by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States to enhance the competitiveness of their defense exports.

The United States has traditionally supported defense exports to meet national security and foreign policy objectives through its security assistance program. In the United States more recently, however, the impact of exports on maintaining the industrial base has gained support as a rationale for providing additional assistance to defense exporters.", "Defense exports in general have a positive impact on the balance of trade. In 1993 defense exports represented about 0.3 of total exports for Germany, 1.7 percent for France, 2.2 percent for the United States, and 2.4 for the United Kingdom. The impact of defense exports to total exports, however, shows a general downward trend since 1990 for three of the four countries we reviewed. During 1990 defense exports represented 0.4 percent of total exports for Germany, 3.2 percent for France, and 3.4 percent for the United States.

The United States had the largest share of global arms deliveries at 32 percent in 1990 and increased its share to 49 percent in 1993. The overall increase in the U.S. market share from 1990 to 1993 was due, in part, to decreased sales by the former Soviet Union. In 1990 the Soviet Union\u2019s arms deliveries were $17 billion. By 1993 Russia\u2019s defense exports had decreased 82 percent to less than $3 billion. The dollar value of U.S. arms deliveries also decreased during this time, declining 22 percent from $18 billion in 1990 to $14 billion in 1993. Arms deliveries data for calendar year 1994 is not yet available. However, the Department of Defense (DOD), which collects data on a fiscal year basis, reported that fiscal year 1994 U.S. arms deliveries were about $10 billion.

For example, in order to reduce dangerous or destabilizing arms transfers, the United States does not sell its defense products to certain countries, as part of its national security objectives. Those countries include Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and several countries of the former Soviet Union. According to the State Department, U.S. sales to other countries are reviewed on a case-by-case basis against U.S. conventional arms transfer policy criteria.

These studies indicate that (1) each sale has its own unique set of circumstances and (2) the outcome is dependent on various factors. For example, the OMB study on financing defense exports concluded that each customer\u2019s decision-making process on defense acquisitions is sufficiently different that it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions about the relative importance of any one factor. While the study was conducted to determine the need for defense export financing, it found that other factors influence defense sales, such as price, technical sophistication of the equipment, the cost and availability of follow-on support, system performance, lead time from placement of order to delivery, the availability of training, political influence, and the financial and economic conditions of purchasing countries.", "The OTA study identified co-production and technology transfer as factors that can influence a defense sale. This study noted countries that desire to develop their own defense industries are likely to consider access to technology when buying defense goods.", "In our May 1991 testimony before the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs on a proposal to finance defense export sales, we pointed out that it is difficult to quantify the effect of financing on defense sales because of all the other factors involved in the decision-making process.

These officials cited the same factors identified by earlier government studies, including offsets, political ties, and price and quality of a product. However, when discussing the reasons behind any particular sale\u2019s outcome, U.S. government officials and industry representatives identified different reasons for the outcome of the sale. For example, in the recent German tank sale to Sweden, U.S. government officials identified offsets as the deciding factor in the sale, while an industry representative believed that the historical ties between Sweden and Germany was the reason why the German tank was chosen. In a sale of French tanks to the United Arab Emirates, U.S. government officials considered offsets to be the more important determinant in the sale, while an industry representative cited historical relationships between the buyer and the seller as the primary factor.", "Moreover, several U.S. and European government officials and industry representatives stated that potential customers abroad view domestic procurement of a product as an important endorsement of confidence and one that helps lower unit costs by increasing the economies of scale associated with a system. These officials added that it is very difficult for a company to sell a defense article if its own country\u2019s defense department or ministry does not use the equipment. For example, according to a U.S. government official, Northrop\u2019s F-20 was designed specifically for export; however, Northrop was unable to sell the aircraft overseas, in part, because the U.S. government did not purchase it for domestic use. Further, because of the large size of the U.S. domestic defense market, European businesses feel that they are at a disadvantage with respect to their U.S. competitors, according to a 1992 survey conducted by the major French land-defense industry association and the consulting firm Ernst & Young."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Governments Generally Provide the Same Types of Assistance to Defense Exporters", "paragraphs": ["We found that France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States generally provided the same types of assistance, but the extent and structure of the assistance varies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Government-Backed or -Provided Export Financing", "paragraphs": ["All three European countries provide some form of government-backed export credit guarantees for both non-defense and defense exports as a means to provide security assistance and promote sales of their defense products.

Therefore, we were unable to obtain information on the extent of guarantees provided to defense exports in either country.", "In the United States, government financing is provided through the FMF program. According to DOD officials, FMF is provided as an instrument to advance U.S. foreign policy and national security interests rather than a means to promote U.S. exports. In fiscal year 1994 the United States used the program to provide about $3.1 billion in grants, mostly to Israel and Egypt, and $0.8 billion in loans to Greece, Turkey, and Portugal. Applicable U.S. legislation provides that FMF grants are generally intended to fund purchases of U.S. military goods and related services. It is unlikely U.S. contractors would lose sales to foreign competitors for FMF grant-funded purchases. The U.S. government is fully funding the purchase of U.S. military goods and services by other countries, thus giving U.S. companies an advantage over foreign competitors that are only offering government guarantees on loans. In addition, in fiscal year 1994, the Defense Security Assistance Agency waived about $273 million in research and development costs on foreign military sales to nine allied countries.", "U.S. commercial banks provide some financing of defense exports; however, the U.S. government does not guarantee such financing.

In 1993 these four countries represented 81 percent of the world\u2019s total defense market. Together, Russia and China represented 13 percent of the total market, but were not part of this review because a large share of Russian and Chinese defense products are sold to countries to which the United States would not sell.", "While several U.S. government agencies collect information on defense exports, it is difficult to compare their analyses because each agency uses different methodologies for collecting and reporting the data. We used mostly Congressional Research Service (CRS) data on defense exports for calendar years 1990 to 1993 to compare the U.S. position in the global defense market relative to its European competitors. We also used more current data on French defense exports, in terms of deliveries, provided by the U.S. government. This new data increased the level of French defense exports, both in absolute and relative terms, previously reported by CRS. Further, we use calendar year data rather than fiscal year data because data on European defense exports is reported on a calendar year basis. We did not independently verify CRS data, but the data is generally accepted among government agencies as dependable. In addition, we used the State Department\u2019s Office of Defense Trade Controls data on deliveries of U.S. direct commercial sales, because CRS does not include that data in its annual reports on global arms sales.", "To determine the U.S. position in the global defense market in the near future, we used the value of U.S. defense orders as reported by CRS. However, the value of these orders includes only those placed through the Foreign Military Sales program and does not include orders placed by direct commercial means. While the State Department reports the value of export licenses approved for direct commercial sales, it does not report the value of actual defense orders placed as a result of those licenses. The value of direct commercial sales deliveries as a result of those licenses, according to government documents, may be as little as 40 to 60 percent of the value originally reported when the license was approved.
