As a result, continuing serious deficiencies in financial reporting leave VA at risk of processing errors and misstatements in its financial statements. Although VA had corrective action plans in place intended to result in near-term remediation of the 16 fiscal year 2008 significant control deficiencies, many of these plans did not contain the detail needed to provide VA officials with assurance that the plans could be effectively implemented on schedule. VA lacked documented policies and procedures needed to assure the consistent and comprehensive design of these corrective action plans, and 8 of 13 of VA's plans for correcting its financial reporting deficiencies lacked key information regarding milestones for action steps and validation activities.As of August 2009, VA had missed milestones in 5 of the 13 corrective action plans. For example, our analysis of plans for remediating deficiencies regarding the capitalization of property, plant, and equipment and inadequate benefit payment reconciliations showed that slipping milestones could jeopardize VA's timely completion of these plans, and consequently may impair VA's ability to obtain improved data reliability within the time frames originally envisioned.

Because VA has  developed a corrective action template for addressing A-123 control  deficiencies, the FPIAR Director told us she is considering whether to  adopt this template for corrective action plans to remediate financial  reporting control weaknesses, which could provide efficiencies and help  integrate resolution of some deficiencies. VA\u2019s Deputy CFO also told us  that oversight by the SAT, combined with the use of the corrective action  plan template, will allow for more rigorous oversight of remediation  efforts of weaknesses detected in the financial statement audits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["VA has had serious, long-standing material weaknesses in financial  reporting that could result in significant misstatements in financial  information reported to Congress and used by VA to manage its  operations. One of the significant deficiencies is not planned for resolution  until FLITE is fully implemented, which will not be until 2014. Other  deficiencies can be addressed in the near term. While VA has corrective  action plans for near-term actions intended to provide more accurate and  complete financial data, they often lacked key information. Consequently,  VA managers could not readily identify and address slippage in  remediation activities, exposing VA to continued risk of errors in financial  information and reporting. Immediate actions to provide a rigorous  framework for the design and oversight of corrective action plans will be  essential to ensuring the timely remediation of internal control  weaknesses before FLITE implementation. Well-defined corrective action  plans provide a \u201croad map\u201d for remediation activities and facilitate  effective oversight by senior VA officials. Continued support from senior  VA officials and administration CFOs will also be critical to ensure that  key corrective actions are developed and implemented on schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To help focus VA\u2019s corrective action plans on more effectively establishing  and completing consistent and comprehensive near-term actions, we  recommend that the Secretary of VA direct the Assistant Secretary for  Management to issue policies and procedures for identifying and reporting  on financial audit weaknesses to include:    Detailed guidance (such as a set of tools and templates in place to  identify and report on programmatic weaknesses) on required  corrective action plan elements (including milestones for completion of  interim action steps and validation steps).", "Establishing a VA Secretariat-level agency-wide governance structure  for overseeing all OMB Circular No. A-123 and financial statement audit  material weakness remediation activities that provides for (1) involving  key stakeholders in the remediation process (such as the FPIAR,  administration CFO\u2019s, and other senior VA officials); (2) clearly  defining stakeholder roles and responsibilities; (3) establishing and  implementing strategic workforce planning for FPIAR; and (4)  regularly assessing and reporting on the status of corrective action  plans and identification of any actions needed to address any slippages  of remediation activities.", "To help ensure the timely and complete capitalization of property, plant,  and equipment, we recommend that the Secretary of VA direct the  Assistant Secretary for Management to issue procedures on specific  actions and identify specific reasonable time frames, such as within 30  days, to implement VA policy to capitalize PP&E projects when they are  placed in service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In its written comments, VA generally agreed with our findings and  recommendations and identified specific actions it has taken and plans to  take to implement these recommendations. In response to our  recommendation to provide detailed guidance (such as a set of tools and  templates in place to identify and report on programmatic weaknesses) on  required corrective action plan elements (including milestones for  completion of interim action steps and validation steps), VA stated that the  FPIAR has begun integrating its corrective actions for financial audit  weaknesses with VA\u2019s OMB Circular No. A-123 processes. VA also said  that FPIAR will migrate to a set of corrective action plan tools, templates,  and documented procedures in fiscal year 2010.", "VA partially concurred with our recommendation that VA establish a  Secretariat-level agencywide governance structure for OMB Circular No.  A-123 and financial statement audit remediation activities. In its  comments, VA stated it already established a Senior Assessment Team as  the coordinating body for corrective action planning to address control  deficiencies identified as a result of OMB Circular No. A-123 reviews and  financial statement audits. As discussed in our draft report, we recognized  VA has taken action to establish agencywide accountability for oversight  of its corrective action plans and has begun to establish related practices.  However, these practices had not yet evolved into the rigorous framework  needed to effectively ensure timely control weakness remediation. VA  stated that its Internal Controls Service is developing a handbook for all  stakeholders that will provide detailed guidance for corrective action  planning, monitoring, reporting, and validation procedures for all financial  statement audit and OMB Circular No. A-123 significant deficiencies and  material weaknesses. Also, VA noted that as FPIAR matures, it will  continue to define and meet staffing requirements.", "VA also concurred with our recommendation that VA issue procedures for  specific actions and identify reasonable time frames, such as within 30  days, to implement VA policy to capitalize PP&E projects when they are  placed in service. VA provided a copy of recently issued procedures which  identified specific actions and time frames for the capitalization of PP&E.  These procedures provide guidance for monthly communications between  engineering staffs, program directors, and the appropriate fiscal activity  regarding construction project status, costs, and useful life. The  procedures also provide that property should be capitalized no later than  the end of the fiscal month following the month that the property is put  into use or accepted by VA. If fully and effectively implemented, the  guidance should help address the problems we found related to timely  capitalization of VA\u2019s PP&E.", "In its written comments, VA also provided technical comments which we  considered and incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to other interested congressional  committees and to affected federal agencies.

We also evaluated the timeliness of implementation of corrective action  plans for two significant deficiencies\u2014one to address the inadequate  capitalization and accounting for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)  and another to improve reconciliations of benefit payments. One plan was  designed and implemented by the Veterans Health Administration, and one  by the Veterans Benefit Administration\u2014the two principal VA  administrations. We selected these plans for further review because the  related deficiencies were not currently being audited or reviewed by other  oversight organizations, their associated account balances exceeded a  material dollar threshold ($12.7 billion), and the deficiencies contributed  to the two material weaknesses that we, VA officials, and VA\u2019s  independent auditor considered most integral for developing useful and  reliable information for decision making.
