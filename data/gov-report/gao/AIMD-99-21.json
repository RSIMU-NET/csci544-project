Based on these concerns, a spending plan was developed and transmitted to the congressional committees on May 29, 1996.

These 103 payment vouchers represented the material transactions and approximately 99 percent of the total dollar value of MPD- reported actual expenditures as of April 10, 1998. We examined the selected vouchers, consisting of purchase orders, invoices, and receiving reports, to verify that contracted services were rendered and inventory items and other supplies were received, placed into operation, and appropriately charged against the $15 million.

Most of the remaining $3.9 million obligated but not yet spent is for the District Cellblock Renovations and Automated Reports projects budgeted for $2.2 and $1.2 million, respectively. The funds for the automated reports project were obligated in May 1998, and the related work is expected to be completed in June 1999. The funds for the cellblock renovations were obligated in March 1998, but because design specifications had not been finalized as of September 1998, MPD was not able to provide us with a scheduled completion date.", "The September 4, 1996, spending plan included 21 individual projects. Subsequently, the chiefs of police requested and the Authority approved two separate revisions that redistributed the residual and unobligated funds and added one project. The residual funds became available as a result of some projects coming in under budget and the unobligated funds that resulted from the three deferred projects. These revisions enabled MPD to purchase additional bulletproof vests in excess of the original budgeted number, as well as mountain bikes and associated equipment (project number 22) as part of the summer crime initiative.", "The September 4, 1996, spending plan developed by MPD was based on estimated acquisition amounts and installation costs.

This total consists of the net difference of $182,311 between planned and actual amounts used for nine completed projects, plus $95,655 that was freed up when three projects were deferred. To meet the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA) standards, MPD had originally budgeted $70,000 for General Order Revisions, $12,000 for a Re-writable CD System to distribute training to field units, and $25,000 for a Library Enhancement project. These three projects were deferred by the new Chief of Police to allow a new management team to assess CALEA requirements and decide on the best method or structure to satisfy these requirements. At the time the decision was made to defer the projects, the library project had already been started and almost half the funds allocated to that project had been spent, leaving $13,655 of the original $25,000 available for reprogramming.

The first purchase orders totaling $745,000 for lockers, shredders, printers, and cameras\u2014projects 5, 6, 16, and 18\u2014were received by the Authority on December 2, 1996.", "In a February 5, 1997, letter to MPD, the Authority expressed concern about MPD\u2019s lack of progress in spending the remainder of the $15 million and requested from the former Chief of Police an action plan detailing his strategy for completing the remaining procurements. In MPD\u2019s response to the Authority, the former Chief of Police attributed the lack of progress to the number of procurement levels required in the District\u2019s complex procurement process.", "MPD officials cited additional reasons for the delay in expending the funds. They stated that although a spending plan was transmitted to the Congress on May 29, 1996, it was revised several times and was not finalized by the former Chief of Police until after the receipt of the views of the Chairmen of the congressional committees in the letter dated September 4, 1996. Also, changes in key management personnel resulted in a lack of leadership on the projects tied to the spending plan and in changes to the scope of work and the pace of the projects involved. For example, concurrent with management changes, specifications were rewritten for two high-cost projects\u2014the cell block renovation and the automated reports budgeted at $2.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively\u2014as well as for the new security system, budgeted at $350,000.", "The Department of Public Works (DPW) initiated an assessment of holding cells\u2019 conditions at the various districts in September 1996. However, 7 months later, MPD had decided that with its significant backlog of requests for procurement action, it would be advisable to forward all procurement actions of $100,000 or more to the federal government\u2019s General Services Administration (GSA) to expedite the procurement process. Toward this end, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between MPD and GSA was drawn up and signed by the Chief of Police, the MPD CFO, the District\u2019s CFO, the D.C. Mayor, and the Deputy Administrator of GSA in April 1997. At this point, DPW suspended work on the cellblock project.", "GSA used existing federal government supply sources and assisted MPD in establishing written policies and procedures to expedite procurement actions. Of the 22 projects on the spending plan, 13 projects, valued at approximately $9 million, were contracted using GSA-approved contracting sources. MPD re-assigned the cellblock renovation project to GSA in October 1997. MPD could not explain why it took 6 months from the MOU date to reassign this project. As of September 1998, GSA had completed the design phase, submitted it to MPD for review and concurrence, and was waiting for approval to proceed with contracting.", "When efforts were made to contract the security system project through GSA, the cost estimate provided by GSA in September 1997 was $850,000, which was $500,000 higher than the budgeted amount of $350,000. In July 1998, the project was reassigned to the Commander, Criminal Investigations Division at MPD. As of September 1998, MPD had spent $43,172 of the $350,000 on the security system project. The remaining amount has yet to be expended.", "With the information technology projects, a senior MPD official stated that the age of the headquarters building (built in 1941) made it difficult to create workstations because the building lacked sufficient electrical outlets and adequate wiring to accommodate the system needs.
