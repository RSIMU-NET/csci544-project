The launch date for a demonstration satellite has been delayed by over 5 years and the cost estimate for the program has more than doubled--to about $15 billion. In February 2010, a Presidential task force decided to disband NPOESS and, instead, have the agencies undertake separate acquisitions. GAO was asked to (1) assess efforts to establish separate satellite programs; (2) evaluate the status and risks of the NPOESS components still under development; and (3) evaluate the implications of using the demonstration satellite's data operationally. To do so, GAO analyzed program management and cost data, attended program reviews, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NOAA and DOD have begun planning to transition the NPOESS program to separate acquisitions, but neither has finalized its plans. NOAA has developed preliminary plans for its new program--called the Joint Polar Satellite Program--to meet the requirements of the afternoon NPOESS orbit. DOD expects to make decisions on the spacecraft and sensors by June and October 2010, respectively. Because neither agency has completed its plans, the impact of the decision to disband the program on expected costs, schedules, and promised capabilities has not been fully determined. Moving forward, the agencies face key risks in transitioning from NPOESS to their separate programs. These risks include the loss of key staff and capabilities, delays in negotiating contract changes and establishing new program offices, the loss of support for the other agency's requirements, and insufficient oversight of new program management. Until these risks are effectively mitigated, it is likely that the satellite programs' costs will continue to grow and launch dates will continue to be delayed, which could lead to gaps in the continuity of critical satellite data. While NOAA and DOD are establishing plans for their separate acquisitions, the development of key components of the NPOESS program is continuing. In recent months, a critical imaging sensor has been completed and integrated onto the spacecraft of a demonstration satellite, called the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP). In addition, the program continues to work on components of the first and second NPOESS satellites, which are to be transferred to NOAA and DOD to become part of their respective follow-on programs. However, the expected launch date of the NPP satellite has been delayed by 9 months due to technical issues in the development of a key sensor. Further, the program is slowing down and may need to stop work on key components because of potential contract liabilities and funding constraints, but has not developed a prioritized list on what to stop first. This may further delay NPP and the components of the first NOAA and DOD satellites under their new programs. Because the NPP demonstration satellite was designed as a risk-reduction mission, not as an operational asset, it has several limitations. These limitations include fewer ground-based data processing systems, fewer security controls, and a shorter satellite lifespan than exist for current or planned operational satellites. These design limitations mean that, in some cases, NPP's data will not be as timely, useful, and secure as other polar satellites and that there is a risk of a gap in the nation's climate and weather services should NPP fail before the next satellite is launched. Agency officials acknowledge these limitations and are assessing options to make NPP data more timely and secure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to NOAA and DOD to address key risks in transitioning to their respective new programs.

These satellites obtain environmental data  that are processed to provide graphical weather images and specialized  weather products. These satellite data are also the predominant input to  numerical weather prediction models, which are a primary tool for  forecasting weather days in advance\u2014including forecasting the path and  intensity of hurricanes. The weather products and models are used to  predict the potential impact of severe weather so that communities and  emergency managers can help prevent and mitigate its effects. Polar  satellites also provide data used to monitor environmental phenomena,  such as ozone depletion and drought conditions, as well as data sets that  are used by researchers for a variety of studies such as climate monitoring.", "Unlike geostationary satellites, which maintain a fixed position relative to  the earth, polar-orbiting satellites constantly circle the earth in an almost  north-south orbit, providing global coverage of conditions that affect the  weather and climate. Each satellite makes about 14 orbits a day. As the  earth rotates beneath it, each satellite views the entire earth\u2019s surface  twice a day. Currently, there is one operational POES satellite and two  operational DMSP satellites that are positioned so that they cross the  equator in the early morning, midmorning, and early afternoon. In  addition, the government is also relying on a European satellite, called the  Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellite. Together, they ensure that,  for any region of the earth, the data provided to users are generally no  more than 6 hours old. Besides the four operational satellites, six older  satellites are in orbit that still collect some data and are available to  provide limited backup to the operational satellites should they degrade or  fail.

When first received, satellite data are considered raw  data. To make them usable, processing centers format the data so that  they are time-sequenced and include earth location and calibration  information. After formatting, these data are called raw data records. The  centers further process these raw data records into channel-specific data  sets, called sensor data records and temperature data records. These data  records are then used to derive weather and climate products called  environmental data records. These environmental data records include a  wide range of atmospheric products detailing cloud coverage,  temperature, humidity, and ozone distribution; land surface products  showing snow cover, vegetation, and land use; ocean products depicting  sea surface temperatures, sea ice, and wave height; and characterizations  of the space environment. Combinations of these data records (raw,  sensor, temperature, and environmental data records) are also used to  derive more sophisticated products, including outputs from numerical  weather models and assessments of climate trends.

Within the program office, each agency has the  lead on certain activities: NOAA has overall program management  responsibility for the converged system and for satellite operations; the Air  Force has the lead on the acquisition; and NASA has primary responsibility  for facilitating the development and incorporation of new technologies  into the converged system. NOAA and DOD share the cost of funding  NPOESS, while NASA funds specific technology projects and studies. In  addition, an Executive Committee\u2014made up of the administrators of  NOAA and NASA and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics\u2014is responsible for providing policy guidance,  ensuring agency support and funding, and exercising oversight authority.

Together, the  sensors were to receive and transmit data on atmospheric, cloud cover,  environmental, climatic, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical  observations. The subsystems were to support non-environmental search  and rescue efforts, system survivability, and environmental data collection  activities.", "In addition, a demonstration satellite, called the NPOESS Preparatory  Project (NPP), was planned to be launched several years before the first  NPOESS satellite in order to reduce the risk associated with launching  new sensor technologies and ensure continuity of climate data with  NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System satellites. NPP is a joint mission between  the NPOESS program office and NASA. NPP was to host four NPOESS  sensors and provide the program office and the processing centers an  early opportunity to work with the sensors, ground control, and data  processing systems.", "When the NPOESS development contract was awarded in 2002, the  schedule for launching the satellites was driven by a requirement that the  NPOESS satellites be available to back up the final POES and DMSP  satellites should anything go wrong during the planned launches of these  satellites. Early program milestones included (1) launching NPP by May  2006, (2) having the first NPOESS satellite available to back up the final  POES satellite launch then planned for March 2008, and (3) having the  second NPOESS satellite available to back up the final DMSP satellite  launch then planned for October 2009.

These issues ultimately required difficult decisions to be made  about the program\u2019s direction and capabilities.", "The Nunn-McCurdy law requires DOD to take specific actions when a  major defense acquisition program\u2019s cost growth exceeds certain  thresholds. Where applicable, the law requires the Secretary of Defense to  certify the program to Congress when it is expected to overrun its current  baseline by 25 percent or more. In November 2005, NPOESS breached the  25 percent threshold, and DOD was required to certify the program for it  to continue. The requirements for certifying a program, as relevant here,  involved a determination that (1) the program is essential to national  security, (2) there are no alternatives to the program that will provide  equal or greater military capability at less cost, (3) the new estimates of  the program\u2019s cost are reasonable, and (4) the management structure for  the program is adequate to manage and control costs.

This restructuring decision delayed the launch of NPP and the  first two satellites (called C1 and C2) by roughly 3 to 5 years\u2014a deviation  from the requirement to have NPOESS satellites available to back up the  final POES and DMSP satellites should anything go wrong during those  launches. The restructured program also reduced the number of satellites  to be produced by relying on European satellites for the midmorning orbit  and planning to use NPOESS satellites in the early-morning and afternoon  orbits. In addition, in order to reduce program complexity, the Nunn- McCurdy certification decision decreased the number of NPOESS  instruments from 13 to 9 and reduced the functionality of 4 sensors. Table  1 summarizes the major program changes made by the Nunn-McCurdy  certification decision and table 2 describes the sensors that were planned  for NPP and NPOESS after the Nunn-McCurdy certification.", "The changes in NPOESS sensors affected the number and quality of the  resulting weather and environmental products. In selecting sensors for the  restructured program during the Nunn-McCurdy process, decision makers  placed the highest priority on continuing current operational weather  capabilities and a lower priority on obtaining selected environmental and  climate measuring capabilities. As a result, the revised NPOESS system  had significantly less capability for providing global climate, ocean, and  space environment measures than was originally planned. Specifically, the  number of environmental data records was decreased from 55 to 39, of  which 6 were of a reduced quality. The 39 data records that remain include  cloud base height, land surface temperature, precipitation type and rate,  and sea surface winds. The 16 data records that were removed include  cloud particle size and distribution, sea surface height, net solar radiation  at the top of the atmosphere, and products to depict the electric fields in  the space environment.

Program officials  subsequently modified their life-cycle cost estimate in December 2008 to  $13.95 billion, which included about $1.15 billion for revised pre- and post- launch operations and support costs and about $300 million to address  development issues. The revised cost estimate did not include funds to  modify information security requirements.", "In June 2009, we added to our previous concerns about the tri-agency  oversight of the NPOESS program. Specifically, we reported that the  Executive Committee was ineffective because the DOD acquisition executive  did not attend committee meetings; the committee did not track its action  items to closure; and many of the committee\u2019s decisions did not achieve  desired outcomes.

In  the fall of 2008, an independent review team assessed the program and  delivered its final report in June 2009. Among other things, the  independent review team found that the program had a low probability of  success, the continuity of data was at risk, and the priorities of DOD and  NOAA were not aligned. The team recommended using NPP data  operationally to mitigate potential gaps in coverage, co-locating the  program at an acquisition center, and involving the White House to resolve  priority differences.

Unless NOAA is proactive in  retaining these staff, the new program may waste valuable time if staff  must relearn program details and may repeat mistakes made and lose  lessons learned by prior program staff.", "Delays in negotiating contract changes and establishing new  programs\u2014We have previously reported that restructuring a program like  NPOESS could take significant time to accomplish, due in part to the time  taken revising, renegotiating, or developing important acquisition  documents, including contracts and interagency agreements. According  to NOAA officials, the plan for JPSS may require negotiations with  contractors and between contractors and their subcontractors. In  addition, both NOAA and DOD will need to establish and fully staff  program offices to facilitate and manage the transition and new programs.  However, these contract and program changes have not yet occurred and  it is not clear when they will occur. These changes could take significant  time to complete. Meanwhile, the NPOESS program office continues to  support\u2014and fund\u2014development activities that may not be used in the  new programs, because neither NOAA nor DOD have made key decisions  on the technologies, such as the spacecraft and sensors, that will be  included on the new programs. Until decisions are made on how the  program is to proceed with contract changes and terminations, the  contractors and program office cannot implement the chosen solution and  some decisions, such as the ability to hold schedule slips to a minimum,  could become much more difficult.", "Failure to support the other agency\u2019s requirements\u2014As a joint program,  NPOESS was expected to fulfill many military, civilian, and research  requirements for environmental data. The task force decision to  restructure NPOESS noted that decisions on future satellite programs  should ensure the continuity of critical satellite data. However, because  the requirements of NOAA and DOD are different, the agencies may  develop programs that meet their own needs but not the other\u2019s. DOD,  NOAA, and NASA will still need to work together to ensure that  requirements are known, agreed upon, and managed, and that changes in  their respective program\u2019s capabilities do not degrade the continuity  requirements. For example, NOAA officials reported that they do not plan  to include the Microwave Imager/Sounder in their follow-on program and  will instead procure data from a different sensor on an international  satellite. However, it is not clear that NOAA\u2019s plans will meet the needs of  all of DOD\u2019s users, including the Navy and Army. Similarly, it is not clear  that DOD will continue to support the climate community\u2019s requirements  for highly calibrated and accurate measurements. If the agencies cannot  find a way to build a partnership that facilitates both efficient and effective  decision-making on data continuity needs, the data continuity needs of  both agencies may not be adequately incorporated into the new programs.", "Insufficient oversight of new program management\u2014Under its new  JPSS program, NOAA plans to transfer parts of the NPOESS program to  NASA, but it has not yet defined how it will oversee NASA\u2019s efforts.  Transferring the program to NASA will not necessarily resolve existing  cost, schedule, and subcontractor management issues. We recently  reported that the acquisition challenges faced in major NASA acquisitions  are similar to the ones faced by DOD acquisitions, including NPOESS.  Specifically, we reported that NASA has consistently underestimated time  and cost and has not adequately managed risk factors such as contractor  performance. Because of these issues, we listed NASA\u2019s acquisition  management as a high-risk area in 1990, and it remains a high-risk area  today. In addition, our work on the GOES I-M satellite series found that  NOAA did not have the ability to make quick decisions on problems  because portions of the procurement were managed by NASA.", "Specifically, this management approach limited NOAA\u2019s insight and  management involvement in the procurement of major elements of the  system. NOAA officials reported that they are developing a management  control plan with NASA and intend to perform an independent review of  this plan when it is completed. They could not provide a time frame for its  completion. Without strong NOAA oversight of NASA\u2019s management of  program components, JPSS may continue to face the same cost, schedule,  and contract management challenges as the NPOESS program.", "While NOAA, NASA, and DOD acknowledge that there are risks associated  with the transition to new programs, they have not yet established plans to  mitigate these risks. Until these risks are effectively mitigated, it is likely  that the satellite programs\u2019 costs will continue to grow and launch dates  will continue to be delayed. Further launch delays are likely to jeopardize  the availability and continuity of weather and climate data. For example,  the POES satellite currently in the afternoon orbit is expected to reach the  end of its lifespan at the end of 2012. If NPP is delayed, there could be a  gap in polar satellite observations in the afternoon orbit. Similarly, a delay  in the launch of the first JPSS satellite may lead to a gap in satellite data  after NPP reaches the end of its lifespan.", "Data continuity gaps pose different implications for DOD and NOAA. For  both agencies, a loss of satellite data represents a reduction in weather  forecasting capabilities. Within the military, satellite data and products  allow military planners and tactical users to focus on anticipating and  exploiting atmospheric and space environmental conditions. For example,  accurate wind and temperature forecasts are critical to any decision to  launch an aircraft that will need mid-flight refueling. For NOAA, satellite  data and products are provided to weather forecasters for use in issuing  weather forecasts and warnings to the public and to support our nation\u2019s  aviation, agriculture, and maritime communities. NOAA also faces risks in  losing longer-term climate observations. Maintaining the continuity of  climate and space data over decades is important to identify long-term  environmental cycles (such as the 11-year solar cycle and multiyear ocean  cycles, including the El Ni\u00f1o effect) and their impacts, and to detect trends  in global warming.

This means that if NPOESS development were to  continue according to schedule, the program would need to stop all  development work in August 2010 in order to fund the approximately $84  million in potential termination liability for this year.

However, in March 2009, delays in the  expected launch of the first NPOESS satellite led the Executive Committee  to decide to use NPP data operationally. Because the NPP demonstration  satellite was not designed as an operational asset, it has several  limitations. These limitations include fewer ground-based data processing  systems, fewer security controls, and a shorter satellite lifespan than  current or planned operational satellites. These design limitations mean  that in some cases, NPP\u2019s data will not be as timely and useful as current  polar satellites or as secure as planned satellites.

This arrangement means that the two centers that do not have  the data processing systems will experience a lag in obtaining NPP data.  Specifically, under current operations, the four satellite data processing  centers receive polar satellite data within about 100 to 150 minutes. NPP\u2019s  data will be available to the two centers with the data processing system  within approximately 140 minutes; it will be available to the two other  centers within about 170 minutes. This presents a delay of 20 to 70 minutes  from current operations for the two centers without the data processing  system.", "Because of this delay, NPP data will not be as useful to DOD as the data  from legacy DMSP and POES satellites. DOD officials reported that they  plan to incorporate NPP data when and where they can to supplement  data from the legacy satellites. However, DOD\u2019s centers will not be able to  incorporate NPP data into all of their operational products, due to the time  delay. For example, officials from one data processing center reported that  the delay in obtaining NPP data could adversely affect their atmospheric  and oceanographic numerical weather prediction capabilities. This  situation would be exacerbated if POES or DMSP satellites fail in orbit  before the first NPOESS/JPSS satellite is launched because the DOD  centers may not be able to use NPP data to make up for the data loss.  According to DOD officials, the three DOD centers are currently  investigating options to shorten the time it will take for the data to go from  the one center with the data processing system to the other two that lack  the system, but do not have a timeline for making decisions on how to  proceed. NASA officials reported that there are other options for  shortening the time lag.
