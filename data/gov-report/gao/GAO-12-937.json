To extend broadband access and adoption, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) provided over $7 billion to NTIA and RUS for grants or loans to support broadband projects. NTIA and RUS made all awards by September 30, 2010.", "This report responds to mandates under the Recovery Act for GAO to examine the use of Recovery Act funds and report on the quarterly estimates of jobs funded. This report addresses (1) the progress of broadband projects, (2) their effect on expanding access to and adoption of broadband, and (3) any challenges awardees face in completing projects and agency actions to address these challenges. GAO analyzed program documentation and data and interviewed agency officials and BTOP and BIP awardees."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The progress of the broadband projects is difficult to measure because of data limitations. As projects progress, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) disburse awarded funds to projects on, for example, a reimbursement basis. As of July 2012, NTIA has disbursed approximately $1.9 billion of the $3.8 billion it awarded for projects under the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), and as of June 2012, RUS has disbursed approximately $1 billion of the $3.3 billion it awarded for projects under the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP). These disbursements are one measure of progress, and the disbursements indicate that the projects in aggregate are less than half complete. However, disbursements sometimes lag behind actual progress for a number of reasons, such as contracts that provide for payment after work is completed. In addition, the agencies have been inconsistent in collecting non-financial data on project progress. While NTIA has collected data on BTOP projects, RUS did not collect data until recently. According to NTIA data, 76 percent of planned network miles are complete. According to RUS, the data it has recently collected are not reliable measures of fiber miles and wireless access points deployed by BIP projects. Without reliable information on the progress of BIP projects in expanding infrastructure, RUS may struggle to demonstrate the progress and effectiveness of the BIP program.", "Data limitations make it difficult to fully measure the effect of BTOP and BIP on expanding access to and adoption of broadband. NTIA\u0092s non-financial data indicate that BTOP awardees have established over 57,000 new or upgraded network miles, with connections to over 8,000 community anchor institutions, such as schools, libraries, and hospitals, and nearly 34,000 new computer workstations for use in public computer centers, such as libraries. RUS initially did not collect comparable non-financial data for BIP projects, and the data it has are not reliable; therefore, it is not possible to fully assess the effect of BIP on expanding access to broadband. With respect to broadband adoption, however, both NTIA and RUS have faced difficulties collecting reliable data from awardees on subscribership for BTOP and BIP projects. Both agencies have taken steps to address this issue, with NTIA providing guidance to awardees and RUS developing a tool for staff reviews of subscribership data reported by awardees.", "Both NTIA and RUS helped awardees address multiple challenges in completing their broadband projects. Specifically, awardees identified challenges complying with regulations and obtaining permits, as well as handling construction-related issues such as broadband fiber shortages. BTOP\u0092s non-infrastructure projects\u0097which provide computers to libraries or encourage broadband adoption\u0097faced a different set of challenges, including staffing, contracting, and procurement. NTIA and RUS have taken a number of actions\u0097including providing regular contact and expertise, webinars, and guidance\u0097to help awardees address these challenges. In addition, RUS hired additional staff to address delays in its review and approval of contracts, a challenge that delayed some BIP projects."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To ensure RUS is collecting reliable information regarding the effect of its investments in broadband, GAO recommends that RUS take steps to improve the quality of its data on the number of fiber miles and wireless access points created by BIP projects.

The ability to share large amounts of  information at ever-greater speeds increases productivity, facilitates  commerce, and drives innovation. Furthermore, broadband can improve  citizens\u2019 quality of life. For example, broadband technology makes it  possible for a patient to visit a local clinic and receive medical attention  from specialists hundreds of miles away, for a student to access  information not available from the local library, and for a firefighter to  download blueprints of a burning building. Broadband is particularly  critical in rural areas, where advanced communications can reduce the  isolation of remote communities and individuals.", "To extend access to broadband throughout the United States, as well as  to stimulate the economy and create jobs, Congress appropriated $7.2  billion for broadband programs under the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), enacted on February 17,  2009. This $7.2 billion included: $4.7 billion for the Department of Commerce\u2019s National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to create the  Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) to award  competitive grants to a variety of entities for broadband infrastructure,  public computer centers, and innovative projects to stimulate demand for  and adoption of broadband. $2.5 billion for the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service  (RUS) for the Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) to provide loans,  grants, and loan/grant combinations for broadband infrastructure projects  primarily in rural areas.", "The agencies made all awards by September 30, 2010.

This report is part of GAO\u2019s ongoing efforts to  monitor Recovery Act programs and builds on our prior reports reviewing  BTOP and BIP. In particular, we examined: (1) What progress has been  made implementing broadband projects funded by the Recovery Act? (2)  What effect, if any, have these projects had on expanding access to and  adoption of broadband service? (3) What challenges, if any, do grant and  loan recipients face in completing broadband projects and what actions  have the agencies taken to help address these challenges? The  information provided in this report and in appendix II responds to two  recurring mandates in the Recovery Act. The first, which we respond to  as part of this report, requires that we review bimonthly, the use of  Recovery Act funds by recipients. The second, which we respond to in  appendix II, requires us to comment and report quarterly on estimates of  jobs funded and counted as full-time equivalents (FTE), as reported by  recipients of Recovery Act funds.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed program data collected by NTIA  and RUS, interviewed agency officials and program awardees, and  reviewed relevant documentation. Specifically, to determine the progress  made implementing broadband projects, we analyzed the data collected  by NTIA and RUS on the total funding awarded and the amount of funds  disbursed to each project. We also reviewed NTIA\u2019s data on the progress  made in meeting BTOP\u2019s program targets related to deploying  infrastructure; RUS did not collect comparable data until recently, and  could not assure the quality of its data. To assess the effect of the  projects on expanding access to and adoption of broadband service, we  analyzed the data reported by BTOP awardees on the number of network  miles deployed (which can include miles of broadband fiber and non-fiber  miles, such as microwave links), institutions connected, computer  workstations installed in public computer centers, and broadband  subscribers. We also interviewed BTOP and BIP awardees to understand  the effects of their individual projects; we selected awardees to interview  that varied in progress (gauged by the percentage of their total award that  had been disbursed), and that were geographically dispersed. We also  selected awardees who received large awards. To determine the  challenges that grant and loan recipients face in completing projects, we  interviewed NTIA and RUS officials, as well as BTOP and BIP awardees.  We also reviewed BTOP awardees\u2019 progress reports for the first quarter  of 2012, in which awardees noted challenges or issues they were facing  in achieving planned progress. For BIP, we reviewed a tracking  spreadsheet maintained by RUS where agency officials note the status of  each BIP project and, in some cases, would note issues or challenges  facing individual projects. To determine the reliability of the data used in  this report, we reviewed relevant documentation, including manuals,  guidance, and forms provided to awardees reporting the data,  descriptions of internal controls, and Inspector General reviews of the  data from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the  Treasury (which manages the payment system used by BTOP recipients).  We also interviewed agency officials about their processes for reviewing  the data and ensuring their accuracy. We found the data generally  reliable for our purposes and note the limitations of the data where  appropriate. For more information on our scope and methodology, see  appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 through  September 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In addition to being administered by different agencies, BTOP and BIP  differ in several ways, including in methods for providing funding to  awardees, types of awardees funded, and services funded through the  programs. NTIA funded a range of organizations from states and  municipalities to non-profit and commercial organizations, whereas RUS  made BIP loans, grants, and combinations of loans and grants primarily  to private-sector entities, including for-profit companies and cooperatives.  In addition to funding infrastructure projects, BTOP funded public  computer center (PCC) projects and sustainable broadband adoption  (SBA) projects. Also, the vast majority of BTOP\u2019s infrastructure awards  were investments in \u201cmiddle-mile\u201d infrastructure projects, which provide a  link from the Internet backbone to the last mile networks of local providers  (such as cable or phone companies) that provide broadband service to  end users. The availability of broadband service to end users depends  upon access to adequate middle-mile facilities, which can be costly to  deploy in rural areas. In contrast, BIP primarily funded \u201clast-mile\u201d  infrastructure projects that provide service directly to end users. Table 1  provides more detail about the BTOP and BIP programs, including the  current number of projects and the amount of funding they represent.", "NTIA and RUS solicited applications to the programs and made awards in  two rounds, with the first funding round beginning in June 2009 and  ending in April 2010, and the second round beginning in January 2010  and ending in September 2010. In the joint Notice of Funds Availability,  NTIA and RUS provided that projects should be substantially complete  within 2 years of receiving an award. The agencies disburse awarded  funds as projects progress. To meet the substantially complete  requirement, a project must receive two-thirds of its award 2 years after  receiving the award. NTIA and RUS also provided that projects should  be complete within 3 years of receiving an award. In October 2011, RUS  modified these requirements to provide that BIP projects must commence  within 180 days of the latter of the completion of the project\u2019s historic  preservation or environmental review, and be fully complete no later than  June 30, 2015. NTIA maintained the original requirements. Since NTIA  made several rounds of awards, the 3-year completion deadlines for the  projects are staggered throughout 2012 and 2013. Table 2 shows the  various deadlines, and the number of BTOP projects subject to that  deadline.", "NTIA and RUS must oversee BTOP and BIP projects, respectively,  through each program\u2019s completion. NTIA and RUS both have officials  monitoring the overall progress of the programs and reviewing requests  for funds. In addition to these officials, the agencies also provided staff to  serve as the primary point-of-contact for their awardees and answer  questions and address issues that arise for specific awardees. NTIA\u2019s  Federal Program Officers (FPO) provide this assistance to BTOP  awardees; RUS\u2019s General Field Representatives (GFR) serve the same  role for BIP awardees. In addition, BTOP and BIP awardees face a  variety of reporting requirements. For example, the Recovery Act requires  fund recipients, including BTOP and BIP awardees, to submit quarterly  reports that provide a description of their projects or activities, the  progress of their projects, and estimates of the number of resulting jobs  funded, measured on a FTE basis.awardees submit quarterly and annual progress reports to the agency  that provide financial data and information on the projects\u2019 status and  effects.

Sixty-eight percent of BTOP  awardees have received more than half of their awarded funds, versus 24  percent of BIP awardees. The fact that the BTOP program includes non- infrastructure projects, such as public computer center and sustainable  broadband adoption projects, may partially explain this disparity; NTIA  officials noted that since most of these non-infrastructure projects are not  required to undergo an environmental assessment, they tend to progress  more quickly than the infrastructure projects. See table 3.", "Of the BTOP projects that have reached the 2-year target to be  substantially complete, more than half have received two-thirds of their  total award. As previously mentioned, NTIA provided that BTOP projects  should receive two-thirds of their total award within 2 years of receiving  the award. There are 102 projects that started before August 2010 and  thus have reached the two-thirds benchmark in terms of project time  elapsed. Of these 102 projects, 61 have received two-thirds of their  awarded funds as of July 2012. NTIA officials told us that in cases where  a project does not meet the two-thirds complete threshold, NTIA program  officers follow up to determine whether the project is delayed, or whether  disbursements are not reflecting the amount of work completed, as  mentioned above. In these cases, program officers will conduct a hands- on review, which helps NTIA determine whether the project needs a  performance improvement plan with specific actionable recommendations  to get the project back on track.", "While disbursements are one measure of progress, officials from NTIA  and RUS told us that disbursements do not fully reflect the amount of  work completed.

Thus  disbursements do not fully reflect the amount of work completed at any  point in time. NTIA officials noted that in some cases, awardees have  entered into contracts that are structured so that the awardee does not  pay the contractor until the bulk of construction is complete. For example,  one awardee we interviewed noted that although the project was 95  percent complete, it had only received 65 percent of the project\u2019s funding,  giving the incorrect impression that the project was behind schedule. In  our review of BTOP awardees\u2019 first quarter 2012 reports to NTIA, we  found that some recipients cited this issue when reporting their financial  progress in the quarterly reports. Others noted that cost savings made  their disbursements appear as if the project were behind schedule, but  that was not the case.

NTIA established the baselines for these key  performance indicators by aggregating the information awardees provided  in their applications to the program, and provided program targets to the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB). NTIA tracks progress against  these indicators and reports that as many as 76 percent of network miles  are complete and more than 97 percent of new workstations are  complete.

The  awardee added that as broadband expands in the area, the local  economy has benefited as tourism-oriented businesses are better able to  provide Web sites and online reservation systems. Another awardee  noted that its project serves some areas that previously had broadband  service; however, the choice of service provider was limited, and the  broadband options were generally expensive and slow. This awardee  reported that its BTOP-funded infrastructure improved broadband speed  for community anchor institutions, including schools, community colleges,  and health care providers, from 1 gigabyte per second to 10 gigabytes  per second.", "Interviewees also reported that the public computer center (PCC)  program expanded access to broadband in their communities. BTOP\u2019s 65  PCC projects have deployed new workstations (computers) at multiple  locations, such as community colleges and public libraries, throughout a  city or state. For example, the New Jersey State Library reported that its  PCC project has deployed 845 computers to 124 public libraries, and 128  laptops that community colleges use to provide workforce development  courses to the public. Some public computer centers also received  upgraded broadband connections and wireless routers. Officials from the  State Library of Louisiana noted that residents will use wireless hot spots  in the library to access the Internet from their own devices, adding that  one woman brings her children to the library parking lot after hours so that  they can access the signal and work on their homework when the library  is closed. In addition, PCC projects have installed workstations designed  to be accessible by users with visual impairments. The workstation in  figure 2 includes software that reads aloud what is on the computer  screen, screen magnification software, and a desktop magnifier that  enlarges materials placed under it. As of March 2012, PCC awardees  reported that they provided nearly 34,000 new workstations for public  use.", "PCC projects have also provided classes on a variety of topics, including  English as a second language, digital literacy, and job training. Officials  from the New Jersey State Library project noted that while they initially  targeted people with limited or no computer skills and provided basic  computer training, they encountered unexpectedly high demand and  expanded course offerings to reach recent college graduates, those with  managerial experience, as well as offering additional resources for small  businesses and entrepreneurs. We visited classes in Louisiana and  Washington, D.C., and observed participants learning software programs.  The State Library of Louisiana noted in its first quarter 2012 report that its  various training programs had over 19,000 participants.

NTIA\u2019s sustainable  broadband adoption (SBA) projects were established to stimulate demand  for broadband Internet access, and applicants were required to describe  how they would calculate subscribership for their projects. For example,  the SBA project Computers for Youth/Los Angeles Unified School District  Broadband Engagement Program provides 4-hour workshops in high- poverty Los Angeles schools, during which it provides hands-on, bilingual  training to sixth-grade students and their families on using broadband for  educational purposes. The participants receive a free computer pre- loaded with educational software as well as access to toll-free bilingual  help-desk support, and Computers for Youth conducts a survey before  and after the workshop to determine whether the families subscribed to  broadband service after attending the workshop. Computers for Youth  stated in its first quarter 2012 report that over 30,000 participants  (students and their parents) had attended a family-learning workshop  during the course of its program and that nearly 5,000 households had  newly subscribed to broadband.

For  example, these agreements may have to be obtained from state and  local governments, tribal governments, federal entities (such as the  Bureau of Land Management), private landowners, and railroads. One  awardee we spoke with experienced delays of up to 9 months in the  installation of equipment and fiber because of the amount of time it took  to receive right of way permits from railroad companies. In addition,  make-ready work, which includes the tasks associated with preparing  utility poles for the installation of equipment and fiber, must be complete  before any construction occurs, and this need has posed challenges to  maintaining project timelines. For example, one BTOP awardee indicated  in its first quarter 2012 report to NTIA that \u201ckeeping make-ready  completion ahead of construction crew availability remains the major  challenge for the project.\u201d", "Weather, terrain, and broadband fiber availability. Weather-related  challenges and difficult terrain can cause delays in construction.  Awardees reported delays for, among other things, a major tornado that  caused damage to a service area and equipment, hurricanes, snowfall,  and flooding. Difficult terrain can also cause delays. One awardee told us  that its project unexpectedly called for boring through solid granite under  a river, which required additional tools and time. NTIA and RUS officials  told us that BTOP and BIP projects were also delayed due to fiber  shortages caused by the 2011 tsunami in Japan and increased worldwide  demand for fiber. For example, one BTOP infrastructure awardee noted  in its first quarter 2012 report to NTIA that it was \u201cexperiencing delays in  the delivery of the fiber\u2026 while we received a few shipments  during this quarter it was much less than promised.\u201d", "RUS officials also noted some challenges specific to the BIP program,  such as:", "Approval of contracts and plans. RUS officials told us that to ensure  quality construction is completed, they require that awardees gain  approval of contracts before the construction begins or materials are  purchased. RUS officials said that on average, it takes the agency 1 and  a half months to 2 months to approve a contract. However, some RUS  GFRs and awardees said that RUS did not approve BIP contracts in a  timely fashion in some instances, which resulted in project delays. In  particular, some GFRs said that RUS took 6 to 12 months to approve a  contract. RUS officials noted that there could be a number of reasons  why contracts had not been approved, including that the contracts were  not correct when they were submitted for approval.", "Compliance with reporting requirements. RUS officials told us some  awardees that received a loan or loan/grant combination have  experienced challenges complying with RUS reporting requirements. The  officials explained that awardees who had not previously borrowed from  RUS are more likely to experience difficulties complying with reporting  requirements than those awardees with a history of borrowing from RUS.", "Proposed changes to the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC)  Universal Service Fund. Some RUS officials were concerned about how  reforms to FCC\u2019s Universal Service Fund, which provides  telecommunications funding to some BIP awardees, could potentially  affect projects\u2019 income streams. FCC\u2019s reforms include changes to the  distribution and use of Universal Service Fund payments to make the  funds available to support both telephone service and broadband  deployment. As a result of the reforms, rural telecommunications  carriers could receive reduced universal service support payments. In  August 2011, RUS provided data to FCC on how these changes could  potentially affect the income stream of RUS borrowers and grant  awardees. Subsequently, in its 2011 Order and Further Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking on this issue, FCC stated that the reforms it  adopted were more modest than the estimates used by RUS to  determine the potential impact of the reforms, and that RUS did not  consider the potential for borrowers to adopt operational efficiencies that  would offset reductions in universal service support.", "NTIA officials and awardees also identified challenges that apply to non- infrastructure BTOP projects, such as:", "Staffing or expertise. PCC and SBA projects faced staffing and expertise  challenges, such as high staff turnover, or the need for additional staff to  handle tasks such as providing technical support for computers or  manning computer labs. Our analysis of BTOP awardees\u2019 first quarter  2012 reports to NTIA indicate that 7 of 43 SBA projects and 22 of 64  PCC projects reported challenges with either a lack of staff or lack of staff  expertise.", "Contracting, procurement, and financing. Contracting and procurement  issues also commonly caused delays at the beginning of PCC and SBA  projects, according to NTIA officials. These projects can be run by state  or local entities, and four of the Federal Program Officers (FPOs) we  spoke with told us that the projects they oversee were delayed by the  need to comply with state or local contracting or procurement  requirements. For example, FPOs told us that one project was delayed  by 4 to 5 months because the state legislature needed to approve the  spending of BTOP funding, and another project run by a large city was  delayed by more than a year because of its internal contracting process.", "Technical issues. Issues related to equipment, software, and Internet  service, have also been challenging to SBA and PCC projects. Our  analysis of BTOP awardees\u2019 first quarter 2012 reports to NTIA indicate  that 8 of 43 SBA projects and 16 of 64 PCC projects noted challenges  with the technical aspects of the projects. For example, one awardee  reported that software conflicts caused system crashes for the  workstations deployed for seniors and adults with disabilities.", "Outreach and program participation. Some awardees reported outreach  and participation challenges, such as difficulty in participant retention. For  example, one awardee reported that most of the participants were senior  citizens and were easily discouraged when they felt that they could not  retain new skills after each class or training session.

Therefore,  non-financial data provide additional insight into the progress of the  programs toward completion. In its letter, RUS says that the number  of fiber miles is not as relevant as the number of subscribers. But,  since RUS began tracking fiber miles and wireless access points  deployed, we assume the agency considers these important  measures of progress. Yet, at the time of our review, RUS officials  told us that they could not ensure the quality of the data. We agree  that the number of subscribers is an important performance measure  for the programs; however, unlike fiber miles and wireless access  points deployed, the number of subscribers is not an indicator of the  progress of a project toward completion. Rather, it is an outcome- based performance measure for a completed project, as the number  of subscribers depends in part on the deployment of fiber miles and  wireless access points. Further, as we discuss in the report, RUS  officials told us that its subscriber data are inaccurate. Therefore, at  an aggregate, program level, RUS does not have accurate non- financial data to measure the progress of BIP.  2.

RUS noted that  it uses the information provided in contracts to monitor the  construction of fiber facilities and the installation of access points on a  project-by-project basis.
