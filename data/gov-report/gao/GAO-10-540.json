Effective internal controls over grant awards and oversight of grantees' performance are critical to LSC's mission. GAO and the LSC Inspector General have previously reported weaknesses and made recommendations. GAO's objectives for this report were to determine the extent to which LSC (1) implemented key internal controls in awarding and overseeing grantees, (2) measured its performance, (3) evaluated staffing needs, and (4) adhered to its budget execution processes. GAO analyzed key records and prior recommendations as well as interviewed LSC officials regarding LSC's internal control and performance frameworks, staffing, and contract processes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although LSC's controls over reviewing and awarding grants are intended to help ensure fair and equitable consideration, they need improvement. Final award and fund decisions are documented and approved; however, LSC's grant application evaluation process and associated decisions were not documented, including key management discussions in the evaluation process. This lack of documentation of factors considered in making these decisions increases the risk that grantee application evaluation and funding decisions may not consider all key relevant information and makes it difficult to describe the basis for decisions later. In addition, LSC has no requirement for carrying out and documenting managerial review and approval of competitive grant evaluations or renewals, limiting its ability to identify gaps or incompatible data in applications. Although LSC has efforts underway to ensure it visits all grantee sites at least once every 3 years, LSC did not consistently or explicitly document the application of risk criteria when selecting which grantees to visit, complete timely site visit reports, or track the recommendations from the site visits. These weaknesses hindered LSC's ability to effectively oversee grantees. LSC is not required to follow the Government Performance and Results Act but has developed a Strategic Directions document with some performance measures. However, these measures do not reflect all of LSC's core activities and are not linked to its two primary offices for awarding and overseeing grants. Therefore, LSC cannot effectively measure its performance in several key dimensions, such as identifying and targeting resources in addressing the most pressing civil legal needs of low-income individuals across the nation. LSC has not systematically assessed its long-term staffing needs to achieve strategic goals and objectives, which could help ensure it has the staff capabilities needed to meet its short- and long-term goals. LSC has not consistently provided performance reviews for all of its staff, limiting opportunities to encourage high performance, identify training needs, and communicate with staff. At times, LSC did not adhere to its budget execution process in awarding contracts supporting its key grant-making responsibilities. Because officials did not follow LSC's approval controls for two contracts and there was a breakdown in tracking funds, LSC had a budget shortfall of $70,000 in 2009. Missing or flawed internal controls limit LSC's ability to effectively manage its grant award and grantee performance oversight responsibilities. Although LSC has taken steps to address all 17 GAO recommendations identified in prior work, several have yet to be fully addressed. In the near term, it will be important for LSC leadership to address both current and continuing weaknesses. For the long term, LSC will need to focus on strengthening its overall system of internal controls in order to establish a solid basis for effectively accomplishing its core mission."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Legal Services Corporation\u2019s (LSC) mission is to make federal funding  available to support the provision of legal assistance in civil matters to  low-income individuals throughout the United States.

LSC has completed action on 11 recommendations. For example, L SC  established an audit committee function to provide oversight to LSC\u2019s  financial reporting and audit process; established a shorter time frame for  issuing LSC\u2019s audited financial statements; established a comprehensive  and effective continuity of operations plan program; and performed follow  up on all improper or potentially improper uses of grant funds that we  identified in our prior report.  However, 6 out of 17 recommendations  remain to be fully implemented. These include recommendations in such  key LSC grant award and compliance areas as (1) developing and  implementing procedures to periodically evaluate key management  processes, including, at a minimum, processes for risk assessment and  mitigation, internal control, and financial reporting; (2) implementing an  approach for selecting grantees for internal control and compliance  reviews that is founded on risk-based criteria, uses information and results  from oversight and audit activities, and is consistently applied; and (3)  developing and implementing policies that clearly delineate organizational  roles and responsibilities for grantee oversight and monitoring, including  grantee internal controls and compliance.

In addition, LSC did not link the performance  measure number of technical assistance and training sessions conducted  by LSC to the OPP organization even though OPP has organizational  responsibility for such technical assistance.", "Further, we found LSC did not have procedures providing for periodic  reassessment of key metrics to ensure they reflect up-to-date LSC mission  priorities and objectives. According to the Chief Administrative Officer,  LSC has recognized that its existing performance measures should be  revised and periodically reassessed to ensure they are up-to-date and have  begun actions in this regard. For example, since 2006, management has  been developing a performance measure to obtain current information on  \u201ctimeliness and degree of resolution of OCE corrective action notices.\u201d  LSC reviewed the results of a number of follow-up visits to confirm  grantee resolution of OCE corrective action notices. The review found that  the existing measure based on using the corrective action notices as an  indicator of timeliness of resolution was insufficient. Instead, it was  determined that without site visit verification of the resolution of original  site visit findings the performance measure could not be reported on."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LSC Management Has Not Consistently Focused on Key Human Capital Issues", "paragraphs": ["LSC\u2019s employee handbook provides overall policy direction over its human  capital practices. However, we found existing procedures were flawed in  several key respects concerning staffing needs assessments, evaluating  performance, and providing appropriate internal control training.  Specifically, LSC did not (1) systematically assess short- and long-term  workload and staffing needs in relation to the corporation\u2019s strategic goals  and objectives, (2) provide required performance reviews for OPP staff in  3 of the 6 years we reviewed and for OCE staff in 2 of the 6 years we  evaluated, or (3) provide formal training for current and incoming staff on  internal controls. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government provides that all personnel are to possess and maintain a  level of competence enabling them to effectively accomplish their  assigned duties. In addition, Human Capital Principles for Effective  Strategic Workforce Planning provides that effective staffing  assessments should provide short- and long-term strategies for acquiring,  developing, and retaining staff to achieve programmatic goals. Strategic  human capital practices are key to ensuring that an entity (1) has the staff  capabilities needed to meet short- and long-term goals, (2) can effectively  address performance problems, and (3) has staff who are trained in  internal controls and related sound management practices.", "Our review found that LSC did not have procedures for assessing staffing  needs. According to the Chief Administrative Officer and Director of  Human Resources, LSC does not use mission priorities to establish staffing  needs. Instead, the Vice President for Programs and Compliance said OPP  and OCE consider workload needs and required staffing levels when  preparing their budgets.", "According to the LSC employee handbook, LSC\u2019s policy is that employee  performance is to be evaluated annually at the beginning of the calendar  year by the supervisor of record, based on job performance in the prior  year. OPP staff stated that it is through the annual employee performance  evaluation process that training needs are identified.", "However, LSC did not have procedures for ensuring review of employee  performance and training. For calendar years (CY) 2003 and 2005, OPP  and OCE personnel did not receive annual performance evaluations, and  for CY 2008 OPP personnel did not receive performance evaluations. For  2003 and 2005, the Director of OHR stated that LSC did not follow its  employee performance evaluation policy for conducting the required staff  evaluations in 2003 and 2005 because of concerns about the appraisal  process. As a result, LSC\u2019s President suspended the appraisal process for  these years. In 2008, according to the OPP director, OPP personnel did not  receive appraisals because of a concern that evaluations would have to be  done by a combination of people, none of whom had complete  responsibility for overseeing the work throughout the year. Without the  employee performance appraisals for all of its staff, LSC has limited its  opportunities to encourage high performance, identify training needs, and  communicate with staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controls over Contract Approval and Budgetary Tracking Were Not Always Effective", "paragraphs": ["Although LSC had policies requiring approval and funds availability  determination before issuing contracts for its grant activities and  programs, it had not established specific funds tracking procedures to  ensure that necessary approvals were obtained and funds were available  before awarding contracts.

Our review of the nine contracts that  exceeded the $10,500 presidential approval threshold revealed that LSC  lacked any documentation showing that the required Contract Approval  Form was completed before the contracts were awarded. The LSC Chief  Administrative Officer (CAO) told us that verbal approvals were given by  the President for five of the contracts. Of the remaining four contracts,  one had the LSC President\u2019s approval on the contract itself (but not the  contract approval form), while the remaining three LSC contracts did not  have any evidence of approvals. The LSC Administrative Manual, issued in  February 2005, requires review and approval of all contracts before award  by (1) office directors to ensure that they are within budgetary limitations;  (2) OLA for legal assurance; (3) the Comptroller to ensure the  requirements of the Administrative Manual were followed and to start a  purchase order; and (4) if over $10,500, the LSC President. In accordance  with the LSC Administrative Manual, a Contract Approval Form, which  shows all approvals by designee signature, must be used to meet  documentation requirements and be retained for all contracts awarded.", "Two contracts that did not follow LSC\u2019s approval process resulted in an  unplanned budgetary adjustment for fiscal year 2009. Specifically, we  found two Office of Information Technology (OIT) contracts supporting  grants management and administration that were not properly authorized  and for which fund availability was not determined prior to contract  award, which resulted in a LSC budget shortfall of over $70,000 in fiscal  year 2009. According to the Director of OIT, after verbal approval by the  LSC CAO, these contracts were executed by the Director of OIT without  taking any action to determine that sufficient monies were available to  fund the contracts, and without obtaining the required prior approval of  OLA, the Comptroller, and the LSC President. LSC\u2019s Comptroller informed  the Board of Directors, President, and Inspector General of OIT\u2019s  overspending and asked for and received a $70,000 internal budgetary  adjustment on August 31, 2009, to transfer budgeted funds from LSC\u2019s  capital expenditures account to the consulting budget.", "Consistent with our findings, the LSC financial statement auditor reported  in its January 2010 Report of Deficiencies in Internal Control Over  Financial Reporting and Other Matters for 2009 that the Contract  Approval Forms were not used as required by the LSC Administrative  Manual, and there was no evidence of approval by OLA. The auditors  recommended in January 2010 that LSC implement procedures to ensure  policies for contract awards are followed.", "LSC recently revised its Administrative Manual, effective October 1, 2009,  to include a Contract Approval Form, with a provision that the LSC  President approve all contracts over $10,500. Further, the LSC CAO stated  that training was provided for all administrative staff on the proper  procedures to follow for processing contracts. Such training should help  ensure that a Contract Approval Form accompanies all LSC contracts, and  that OLA and the Comptroller both review and document approval of all  contracts and sign off on the Contract Approval Form before contract  execution.

A weak  control environment limits LSC\u2019s ability to effectively manage its grant  award and grantee performance oversight responsibilities. As such, it will  be important for the LSC President and Board of Directors to continue to  set a \u201ctone at the top\u201d supportive of establishing and maintaining effective  internal control not only by managers but also by personnel throughout  the entity\u2019s program operations. In this regard, LSC would benefit from an  entitywide internal control assessment, including whether the risks  associated with grantee selection are effectively considered, past  recommendations and corrective actions are properly tracked, and  whether effective controls are in place over performance measurement,  performance evaluation, and contract awards. LSC could also strengthen  its overall control environment by providing training to staff throughout  the entity on how internal controls, when functioning as intended, are  integral to the achievement of the entity\u2019s mission objectives.", "In the near term, it will be important for LSC leadership to direct  immediate action to address the continuing weaknesses, as well as those  identified in our current review.
