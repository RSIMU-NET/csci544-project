The remaining 6 projects provided evidence of monthly EVM data reviews; however, the rigor of both the formal and informal surveillance reviews is questionable given the numerous data anomalies GAO found.", "GAO also found that 3 projects had reliable EVM data while 7 had only partially reliable data. For the EVM data to be considered reliable per best practices it must be complete and accurate with all data anomalies explained.", "NASA EVM focal points, headquarters officials, project representatives, and program executives cited cultural and other challenges as impediments to the effective use of EVM at the agency. Traditionally, NASA's culture has focused on managing science and engineering challenges and not on monitoring cost and schedule data, like an effective EVM system produces. As a result, several representatives said this information traditionally has not been valued across the agency. This sentiment was also echoed in a NASA study of EVM implementation. Also cited as a challenge to the effective use of EVM was NASA's insufficient number of staff with the skills to analyze EVM data. Without a sufficient number of staff with such skills, NASA's ability to conduct a sound analysis of the EVM data is limited. However, NASA has not conducted an EVM skills gap analysis to determine the extent of its workforce needs.", "NASA has undertaken several initiatives aimed at improving the agency's use of EVM. For example, NASA strengthened its spaceflight management policy to reflect the industry EVM standard and has developed the processes and tools for projects to meet these standards through its new EVM system. While these are positive steps, the revised policy contains only the minimum requirements for earned value management. For example, it lacks a requirement for rigorous surveillance of how projects are implementing EVM and also does not require use of the agency's newly developed EVM system to help meet the new requirements. NASA has attempted to address EVM shortcomings through policy changes over the years, but these efforts have failed to adequately address the cultural resistance to implementing EVM."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NASA establish a time frame for requiring new spaceflight projects to implement its new EVM system; conduct an EVM skills gap assessment; develop a change management plan for EVM; and strengthen its EVM requirements by requiring projects to implement formal EVM surveillance.

Historically, NASA has experienced problems with  persistent cost growth and schedule slippage in the majority of its major  projects. As a result, NASA acquisition management has remained on  GAO\u2019s high risk list since it was first introduced in 1990. Our work has  shown that several factors contribute to NASA\u2019s cost and schedule  performance, including poor cost estimating and underestimating risks  associated with the development of its major systems.", "Over the years, NASA has undertaken a number of actions to improve its  acquisition management function and has shown some progress in  improving its performance. One of these actions has been to adopt  earned value management (EVM). EVM is a project management tool  developed by the Department of Defense in the 1960s to help project  managers monitor risks. EVM measures the value of work accomplished  in a given period and compares it with the planned value of work  scheduled for that period and the actual cost of work accomplished.  EVM\u2019s intended purpose is to integrate a project\u2019s cost, schedule, and  technical efforts for management and provide reliable data to decision  makers.", "Starting in 1997, NASA began to require its projects to implement EVM  on all significant contracts. In 2005, NASA broadened its application of  EVM to encompass significant project efforts implemented by in-house  civil service and associated support contractor personnel. NASA has had  uneven success in effectively implementing EVM, according to GAO and  NASA Inspector General reports conducted since 1999. NASA has  recognized a need for improved EVM implementation, and has an  ongoing effort focused on doing so. In light of these issues, the House  Science, Space, and Technology Committee and the Senate Committee  on Commerce, Science, and Transportation asked GAO to examine the  use of EVM at NASA. Specifically, we assessed (1) the extent to which  NASA is using EVM to manage its major space flight acquisitions, (2) the  challenges that NASA faces in implementing an effective EVM system,  and (3) NASA\u2019s efforts to improve its use of EVM.", "To determine the extent to which NASA\u2019s major spaceflight projects are  using EVM to manage the acquisition, we reviewed 10 major spaceflight  projects, each with a life cycle cost estimate of more than $250 million  that had been approved to proceed into the implementation phase of  development. Collectively, the projects we reviewed will cost over $14  billion to develop (See table 2 for a list of the projects). We collected all  available EVM data for the 10 projects for the period of August 2010 to  August 2011 and used established earned value formulas and tools to  identify cost and schedule variances and trends. We also assessed the  projects\u2019 implementation of three fundamental EVM practices that,  according to GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, are  necessary for maintaining a reliable EVM system\u2014using a certified  system, conducting integrated baseline reviews, and performing  surveillance. We analyzed monthly project management review briefings  to support our analysis. To assess the reliability of the cost data, we  electronically tested the data for anomalies, and reviewed relevant project  documentation and interviewed agency and project officials about the  data. To determine the challenges the agency faces in its efforts to  implement an effective EVM system, we developed standard sets of  questions and interviewed NASA headquarters officials, program  executives, and EVM focal points at each center and the Human  Exploration and Operations and Science Mission Directorates to discuss  their roles as well as the extent to which EVM data is used to inform  decision making. We also reviewed prior GAO and relevant NASA  Inspector General reports on EVM. Also, we submitted written questions  to the project offices to obtain their views on implementing EVM on their  projects. To determine the steps that NASA is taking to improve its use of  EVM, we compared NASA policies and guidance intended to improve the  agency\u2019s implementation of EVM to best practices for earned value  management as documented in GAO\u2019s cost guide. We also interviewed  agency officials responsible for developing and implementing the NASA\u2019s  new system to discuss ongoing initiatives. For additional details on our  scope and methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2011 through November  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["EVM is a project management tool that, when properly used, can provide  accurate assessments of project progress, produce early warning signs of  impending schedule delays and cost overruns, and provide unbiased  estimates of anticipated costs at completion. Pulling together essential  cost, schedule, and technical information in a meaningful, coherent  fashion is a challenge for most projects. Without such information,  managers can have a distorted view of a project\u2019s status and risks. EVM  also allows individuals outside the project to see a standardized metric  describing the cost and schedule performance of that particular project  and compare it consistently with other projects.", "EVM measures the value of work accomplished in a given period and  compares it with the planned value of work scheduled for that period and  with the actual cost of work accomplished. Differences in these values are  measured in both cost and schedule variances. Positive variances  indicate that activities are costing less or are completed ahead of  schedule. Negative variances indicate activities are costing more or are  falling behind schedule. For example, if a contractor completed $5 million  worth of work and the work actually cost $6.7 million, there would be a  $1.7 million negative cost variance. Schedule variances are also  measured in dollars, but they compare the earned value of the work  completed with the value of work that was expected to be completed. For  example, if a contractor completed $5 million worth of work at the end of  the month but was budgeted to complete $10 million worth of work, there  would be a $5 million negative schedule variance.", "Earned value provides information that is necessary for understanding the  health of a project and an objective view of project status. Cost and  schedule variances can also be used in estimating the cost and time  needed to complete the project. While some data that an EVM system  produces are retrospective and indicate performance to date, EVM data  can also be used to predict future performance. For example, estimates  at completion for a project can be calculated by using efficiency indices  which are based on a project\u2019s past cost and schedule performance. See  appendix II for additional information on the importance of EVM.", "A project\u2019s EVM data comes from multiple sources. For example, each  contractor that supports a project will produce and deliver EVM reports to  the project for the work they and their subcontractors perform, if the  contract so requires. In addition, the project will collect EVM information  for the work that it performs in-house at a NASA center. All of this lower  level EVM data can then be consolidated at the project level to produce a  project level EVM report. Pulling together EVM data from multiple levels  into a project level report gives the project a comprehensive outlook of its  cost and schedule, and provides the project manager with early warning  of potential cost and schedule overruns.", "EVM has evolved from an industrial engineering tool to a government and  industry best practice, providing improved information to conduct  oversight of acquisition programs. As such, it is guided by industry best  practices and standard, and is required by regulations and requirements  at the federal government and the agency level at NASA. These  requirements and standards are summarized in table 1 below.", "Almost two decades of NASA\u2019s past efforts to improve its use of earned  value management have had uneven success. An EVM Focal Point  Council was created in 1996 and focal points were designated at each  NASA center and the Office of Procurement and the Office of the Chief  Financial Officer to provide an open forum to share experiences and  develop a network of support within the NASA EVM community. In 1997,  the agency issued NASA Policy Directive 9501.3 \u201cEarned Value  Management Performance\u201d which established the basis for applying EVM  to NASA contracts. Prior to this policy, centers used their own individual  policies on performance measurement systems. However, in 1999, the  NASA Inspector General reported that EVM policy was not consolidated  as an overall program management responsibility and that the Agency  Program Management Council did not receive comprehensive EVM  information.policy from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to the Office of the  Chief Engineer to emphasize EVM as a project management tool, rather  than a financial management tool.", "As a result, in 2003, NASA shifted responsibility for the EVM  In 2004, GAO reported that only 2 of 10 NASA projects reviewed used  EVM consistently and appropriately. Several barriers to EVM implementation were identified, such as lack of reliable financial data,  trained EVM staff, data analysis tools, and incentives. Among other  things, GAO recommended that NASA take action to ensure that a true  EVM system is used as an organizational management tool to bring cost  to the forefront in NASA\u2019s decision-making process and that acquisition  and EVM management policies and procedures be enforced. In response  to our recommendations, NASA stated that it was updating NASA  Procedural Requirements 7120.5, its program and project management  processes and requirements policy, to improve its cost estimating and  ensure that its cost estimate and earned value analyses were effectively  used, and the updated policy was issued in 2005. Similar to other  agencies in our 2009 report on governmentwide use of EVM, we reported  on weaknesses in NASA\u2019s EVM policies and practices and recommended  that the agency modify its policies governing EVM to ensure that they are  consistent with best practices. In particular, we found problems with the  EVM training requirements for personnel responsible for investment  oversight and management responsibilities. In addition, NASA\u2019s policy for  revising project cost and schedule baselines did not have adequately  defined criteria on the acceptable reasons for permitting a rebaselining.  We also found weaknesses in how the NASA projects we reviewed  implemented EVM and managed their negative performance trends.  NASA acknowledged the identified weaknesses and stated that it was  revising its NASA procedural requirements for programs and projects to  include expanded and strengthened policies governing EVM application  and processes, and revised policies for rebaselining projects.", "In January 2010, the Agency Program Management Council approved the  funding for the EVM capability project to develop an EVM system that  complies with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748. Another goal of the project  was to determine whether it was feasible to implement a single EVM  system that would integrate the scope, schedule, and budget of EVM data  for NASA\u2019s in-house managed efforts and contractor data across the  agency. According to agency officials, NASA invested about $2 million  into the capability project to pilot the EVM system through two projects:  the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and the  Constellation Extra-Vehicular Activity project. Through the pilots, the  capability project demonstrated that an agency-wide EVM system was  feasible. As a result, a finalized set of processes, tools, guidance, and  training products that compose NASA\u2019s new EVM system was developed.  This new system was peer reviewed and approved by a panel of EVM  experts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA Projects Have Not Consistently Implemented Key EVM Practices and Most Did Not Have Access to Reliable EVM Data", "paragraphs": ["Our assessment of 10 major spaceflight projects showed that NASA has  not yet fully implemented EVM and thus is not taking full advantage of an  important tool that could help reduce acquisition risk. GAO found that the  projects had shortfalls in two of the three fundamental practices that we  assessed. Specifically, we found that half of the projects did not use an  EVM system that was certified as compliant with the ANSI/EIA-748  standard. Most of the projects conducted an integrated baseline review  (IBR), a practice that ensures the performance measurement baseline  reflects all requirements and that resources are adequate to complete the  work. Specifically, 9 projects conducted an IBR for their overall efforts;  however, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA)  project office only conducted an IBR of one of its major contractors. In  addition, we found that only 4 of the 10 projects had established formal  independent surveillance reviews to ensure that key elements of the EVM  process were maintained over time so that the data produced by the  system provided timely indications of actual or potential problems. For the  6 projects that did not have formal independent surveillance in place,  each provided evidence that they instituted monthly EVM data reviews,  which according to project officials, helps them to continually monitor cost  and schedule performance. However, the rigor of both the formal and  informal surveillance reviews is questionable given the numerous EVM  data anomalies we found in the monthly EVM reports. Specifically, we  found many unexplained anomalies, such as the presence of negative  numbers or missing data, which caused us to question the reliability of the  data. Out of the 10 projects we reviewed, we found that just 3 projects  had reliable EVM data while the remaining 7 had only partially reliable  data.", "Overall, the projects are using EVM, but NASA has not consistently  implemented EVM across these projects. For example, we found that  several projects were not implementing EVM at the project level, which is  considered a best practice. Table 2 summarizes the performance of each  of the 10 projects in meeting the three fundamental EVM practices and  the reliability of the data.", "Of the 10 projects we reviewed, 4 projects had a certified EVM system, 3  did not, and 3 had a mixture in which some contractors and  subcontractors had certified systems and some did not. When an EVM  system is certified, the agency has assurance that the implemented  system was validated for compliance with the ANSI/EIA-748 standard by  independent and qualified staff and therefore can be considered to  provide reliable and valid data from which to manage a project. The  Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Tracking and Data Relay  Satellite System (TDRS), Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), and  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) were the only projects that  provided evidence that the contract performance reports provided came  from EVM systems that were certified as compliant with the ANSI/EIA-748  standard. The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer  (LADEE), Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and Radiation Belt Storm  Probes (RBSP) projects did not have EVM systems that were certified to  be compliant with the ASNI/EIA-748 standard. Finally, the Jet Propulsion  Laboratory, a federally funded research and development center that the  California Institute of Technology manages under a contract with NASA,  was the only NASA Center with a certified EVM system. The Jet  Propulsion Laboratory is responsible for managing the Orbiting Carbon  Observatory 2 (OCO-2) project. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile  Evolution Mission (MAVEN) and SOFIA prime contractors also had  certified systems; however, their project offices did not. NASA does not  require a certified EVM system for their in-house work.", "Using the project\u2019s integrated master schedule and contract performance  reports, we assessed the EVM data provided by the projects against  selected fundamental ANSI/EIA guidelines to determine the extent to  which each project\u2019s EVM system, whether certified or not, was meeting  them. The guidelines we reviewed included whether the work breakdown  structure (WBS)\u2014which provides the basis of the project schedule\u2014was  consistent between the EVM report and the schedule, whether the  schedule identified significant task interdependencies, and whether the  project had identified a time-phased budget baseline for tracking cost and  schedule variances. As shown in figure 1, a work breakdown structure  breaks down product-oriented elements into a hierarchical structure that  shows how elements relate to one another as well as to the overall end  product. By subdividing a project into smaller elements, management can  more easily plan and schedule the program\u2019s activities and assign  responsibility for the work.", "We found that even for the projects that had certified systems, there were  problems with consistency between the WBS and the EVM report and the  schedule. For example, we found discrepancies in the hierarchical  structure and numbering of WBS elements for JWST, an $8.8 billion  project. Specifically, the project\u2019s WBS dictionary showed mission  assurance efforts numbered differently than contractor reports for two  contractors, each of which had mission assurance labeled with different  WBS numbers. NASA officials explained that neither the spacecraft nor  the near infrared camera contractor was required to follow the project- level WBS structure or numbering scheme. NASA officials explained that  while it is not a requirement for the project and contractor WBSs to be the  same, it is recommended that the prime contractor lower-level WBS  numbering scheme be consistent with the overall project WBS numbering  format. Doing so allows easier total project integration of cost and EVM  data for project reporting. Consistency of the WBS element between the  cost estimate and the schedule facilitates updating the cost estimate with  actual costs and ensures there is correlation between the cost estimate  and schedule.", "Our review of the project schedules also revealed that about half of the  schedules were missing predecessor and/or successor dependencies  and had constraints that prevented the schedule from responding  properly to updates. Since the schedule is the foundation for the EVM  baseline, it must be properly sequenced. This means knowing how one  activity (the predecessor) affects another (the successor) and how each  affects the critical path. When the schedule is not sequenced correctly,  the reliability of the EVM data is called into question. Our review found  that the MMS project was missing dependencies for 31 percent of its  remaining activities for its instrument suite contract and 36 percent of the  remaining activities for the instrument suite were constrained. Due to  the major sequencing issues in the MMS instrument schedule, we  questioned the reliability of the overall network and the schedule\u2019s ability  to correctly calculate float values and the critical path. MMS project  officials said they believed many of the constrained activities we found  were not valid because they reside in another schedule. In addition,  officials said some of the constraints found are in the Harness area, and if  removed, these constraints would have no effect on the overall schedule.  Furthermore, MMS officials said some of the sequencing issues may be  caused by manual integration because some instrument provider  schedules are in Microsoft Project and others are in Primavera, and  therefore it is not possible to ensure all tasks have been linked properly.  As part of their schedule health check process, the MMS project  scheduler tests the schedule for missing dependencies, logic errors, and  reasonable durations and the results are shared with the project office  and the contractor so that appropriate action can be taken. However,  when we removed the 15 level of effort type activities from the missing  dependencies count, the schedule still showed 28 percent of the  remaining activities missing dependencies. We also removed the 14 level  of effort type activities and 4 Harness from the constraint count, the  schedule still showed 33 percent of the remaining activities were  constrained. MMS program officials said that they have a process in place  to manage float and the critical path, however, the schedule we reviewed  still showed significant sequencing issues.", "Finally, we found that 4 of the 14 the schedules we analyzed were not  resource loaded. This means that the schedule did not have the required  labor, materials, equipment, and other resources assigned to the  appropriate activities. When the schedule is not resource loaded, then  costs need to be spread over time using some other method that may not  be as straightforward as having the costs integrated directly within the  schedule. Having a resource-loaded schedule is a best practice for  developing the time phased budget baseline. The time-phased budget  baseline represents the plan that performance is measured against for  the life of a project. It takes into account that program activities occur in a  sequenced order, based on finite resources, with budgets representing  those resources spread over time. Deviations from the baseline identify  areas where management should focus their attention."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Majority of Projects Conducted an Integrated Baseline Review", "paragraphs": ["In keeping with best practices, 9 of the 10 projects conducted integrated  baseline reviews.

Conducting an IBR  increases confidence that the performance measurement baseline  provides reliable cost and schedule data for managing the project and  that it projects accurate estimated costs at completion. OMB has  endorsed the IBR as a critical process for risk management on major  investments and requires agencies to conduct IBRs for all contracts that  require EVM.

The remaining 3 projects did not have any formal  surveillance, but provided evidence that EVM data, such as cost and  schedule variances, were being reviewed during their monthly status  reviews. Beyond reviewing cost and schedule variances and variances at  completion, formal surveillance reviews ensure that the processes and  procedures continue to satisfy the ANSI/EIA EVM guidelines. A formal  surveillance plan involves establishing an independent surveillance  organization with members who have practical experience using EVM.  This organization then conducts periodic surveillance reviews to ensure  the integrity of the contractor\u2019s EVM system and where necessary  discusses corrective actions to mitigate risks and manage cost and  schedule performance. Effective surveillance ensures that the key  elements of the EVM process are maintained over time and on  subsequent applications.", "NASA delegates surveillance of contractor EVM systems to the Defense  Contract Management Agency (DCMA); however, NASA has no entity to  perform independent surveillance reviews to ensure that the ANSI/EIA- 748 standard is being met for EVM efforts performed in-house or by  nonprofit organizations. Without an independent surveillance function, an  organization\u2019s ability to use EVM as intended may be hampered since  surveillance monitors problems with the performance measurement  baseline and EVM data.

The other projects only partially met the criterion to have an EVM system  in place that produces reliable data. If done correctly, EVM data can  provide an objective means for measuring project status and forecasting  potential project cost overruns and schedule slippages so that timely  action can be taken to minimize their impact. To do so, however, the  underlying EVM data must be reliable, meaning that they are complete  and accurate and all data anomalies are explained. In our analysis, we  found multiple cases of data anomalies that caused us to question the  reliability of the EVM data. For example, we found several EVM reports  where a contractor reported that no work was planned or accomplished,  but actual costs were incurred without an explanation in the variance  analysis report to say why this happened. Additionally, we found cases  where a contractor reported that work was planned and actual costs were  incurred, but a negative amount of work was performed\u2014work that was  previously reported as completed was now reported as not completed.  Further, we also found several instances where a project reported an  estimate at completion but no budget at completion. Finally, we found  instances of negative values in the EVM reports. When explanations were  provided in the variance analysis reports, the reasons for these anomalies  included use of estimated, rather than actual costs, or adjustments from  prior periods due to mistakes or errors with the underlying EVM systems.  For example, the SOFIA project said that many of the negative values in  its EVM reports were due to over-reporting of earlier progress,  mischarges by employees, delayed cost postings, inappropriate use of  charge codes. When there are data anomalies such as those we  identified for SOFIA, the EVM data can become skewed and can distort  true performance.", "Variance thresholds try to quantify an acceptable range of deviation; those that do not  exceed a threshold are usually not a concern while those that do are worthy of further  inspection to determine the best course of action to minimize any negative impacts to the  cost and schedule objectives. should be minimized and the reason for each should be fully explained in  the monthly EVM variance analysis reports. To do less limits the  completeness and accuracy of the EVM data and makes the resulting  variance determinations unreliable. While an industry standard for what  constitutes an acceptable volume of anomalies does not exist, EVM  experts in the public and private sectors stated that the occurrence of  EVM data anomalies should be rare.", "For four projects that provided subcontractor EVM data, we tried to map  EVM data at the project level to lower level EVM data at the subcontractor  level. However, we were only able to successfully map the data for one of  the projects. This mapping allows project managers to track cost and  schedule by defined deliverables to more precisely identify which  components are causing cost or schedule overruns and to more  effectively mitigate the root cause of the overruns. When the reports do  not allow for traceability, project managers are not able to effectively  measure progress, use the reports to monitor and control costs based on  the original baseline, and/or to track where and why there were  differences. For example, when we attempted to map the EVM data in the  lower level reports for MAVEN\u2019s spacecraft, science operations center,  remote sensing instrument, and Langmuir Probes and Waves instrument  efforts to the overall MAVEN project EVM report, we were not able to see  how the costs tracked from one report to another and therefore could not  reconcile the costs between the reports. Such issues raise the question of  which reports contain the true costs for these efforts. However, MAVEN  officials walked us through the process they use to ensure that lower-level  reports map to the project level reports. Furthermore, MAVEN officials  said they do not mandate that their contractors follow a certain reporting  format, instead any adjustments necessary to ensure that the lower-level  reports map to the project-level reports are made by the project office.  Though the MAVEN project does not prescribe to a standard reporting  format, attempting to manually resolve incompatible pieces of data can  become time-consuming, expensive and can lead to data reliability  issues. We also had similar difficulty mapping various levels of EVM data  for the MMS project. The MMS project was able to demonstrate how the  Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) budget at completion in the lower- level report mapped to the SwRI budget at completion in the MMS project  report, but because of the way the contractor submits their data, project  officials said that the two reports will never match. Although the project  was able to explain how the data tracked, again, attempting to manually  resolve incompatible pieces of data can become time-consuming and can  lead to data reliability issues.

For  example, 3 of the 10 projects we reviewed did not report project level  EVM data. Implementing EVM at the project level rather than just for the  contract is considered a best practice. In addition, OMB policy requires  the use of an EVM system for both in-house and contractor work and  when there is both government and contractor work, the data from the  two EVM systems must be consolidated at the reporting level for total  program management and visibility. Integrating government and  contractor cost, schedule, and performance status at the project level  should result in better project execution through more effective  management. In addition, some of the in-house projects we analyzed  were only required to meet EVM principles and gather \u201cEVM-like\u201d data.

Technical challenges  were also cited as an impediment to effective EVM use, but opinions  differed within NASA on the extent of their impact. The technical  challenges cited involved difficulty in gathering sufficiently detailed data  for timely inclusion and analysis in an EVM system. In addition, though  NASA has not conducted an EVM skills gap analysis, NASA  representatives said it is a challenge for the agency to implement EVM  effectively due to a lack of sufficient staff with the skills and experience to  analyze EVM data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NASA Culture Seen as Not Valuing EVM", "paragraphs": ["Almost half of the more than 30 NASA representatives we interviewed,  including a large number of those charged with implementing EVM  agencywide\u2014known as EVM focal points\u2014and officials from the Chief  Engineer\u2019s office, cited NASA\u2019s culture as a challenge to the effective use  of EVM at the agency. Specifically, several NASA representatives said  that historically, NASA\u2019s culture has not focused on or valued the kind of  information that EVM can highlight. For example, a NASA EVM analyst  said the culture has been focused on science and engineering and that  accomplishment of that work has been the first priority for managers.  Discussion of the cost of the work has been a secondary concern. A  NASA EVM focal point described overcoming a culture that is based on  applied and basic research rather than discrete tasks with discrete  deliverables, which are among the requirements for effective EVM  implementation. Further, a senior official at NASA headquarters told us  that in project reviews, discussion of cost and schedule information, like  EVM data and analysis, tends to be pushed to the very end of the review  meeting and generally is not discussed in detail. Because EVM data is  not universally valued within NASA, in some cases, the data generated to  satisfy a project\u2019s EVM requirement may be of limited use. For example,  one NASA EVM focal point said some managers are just \u201cchecking the  box\u201d with respect to using EVM. The task is performed but the  requirement to collect EVM data was viewed as a nuisance that ultimately  did not provide worthwhile information. Nonetheless, several of those we  interviewed said persistent inquiries about EVM data from senior  management at headquarters, especially over the last couple of years,  are having a positive impact on the culture and forcing projects to pay  more attention to the data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical and Other Challenges Cited as Making EVM Use More Difficult", "paragraphs": ["The NASA representatives we interviewed also cited technical challenges  as having an impact on the effective use of EVM, although their views  varied on the extent of these challenges. For example, about half of the  focal points we interviewed reported that a challenge to using an EVM  system at NASA was aligning it with the agency\u2019s accounting system, the  SAP Core Financial System. One of the problems cited was that EVM  data collection may require more detailed data than a project has  collected for the agency\u2019s accounting system and this may require the  use of estimated costs instead of actual costs. Estimating these costs can  create additional work for the project, delay the production of EVM data,  and limit the reliability of the EVM data that is produced. Nonetheless, a  NASA manager said, projects could more effectively plan their work to  better accommodate the accounting system. For example, NASA\u2019s  accounting system is set up to measure and report on labor in terms of  full-time equivalents. A project, however, may have set up its earned  value management system with a different measure for labor, such as  productive hours. As a result, the accounting system cannot fill in the  proper numbers for an earned value analysis, potentially causing more  work for the project. Further, the EVM data could be less accurate due to  the use of estimates rather the actual figures. However, if the project had  planned from the outset to have the same measure of labor as the  accounting system, there would not be a problem having this data fit the  EVM system.", "An Office of the Chief Financial Officer representative did not believe that  the projects have consistently demonstrated that the accounting system is  a problem, but nonetheless agreed that potential work-arounds and slight  changes to processes are potential solutions for these issues. The Office  of the Chief Financial Officer has started an initiative to address both the  level of detail of the data and improve the monitoring of contractor cost  performance at levels that may be lower than levels at which obligations  are made and costs are reported in the financial system. A report on a  NASA EVM pilot project noted that the greatest impediment for  implementing EVM is cultural resistance, not technical challenges.  Specifically, it noted that \u201cit\u2019s not the EVM Process. It\u2019s not the EVM  Tools. It\u2019s not the SAP Accounting System. It is the NASA culture.\u201d", "NASA\u2019s use of contracts with one entity to provide goods or services to  several different NASA projects was also cited as a challenge to use of  EVM. For example, NASA centers may have a contract with one firm to  provide engineering support services. Multiple projects may seek services  using a single task order on this contract. Because of the way the NASA  accounting system is configured, this approach can create artificial  variances when looking at EVM data on a month-to-month basis.  According to a NASA representative, contractual requirements can  correct these issues and allow for a closer accounting of the funds for  EVM purposes and in fact, one NASA center has already instituted such  requirements in a new contract for services. NASA plans to address this  issue as current service contracts expire, but it will take time for the new  data requirements that would provide the desired data to be implemented.", "Other challenges cited include the difficulty of gathering sound EVM data  from nonprofit subcontractors, such as universities. One project, for  example, reported that EVM data from nonprofit subcontractors were  immature or non-existent. The nonprofits may be doing a significant  amount of work for a center, but are not equipped to collect earned value  data at the level of detail needed, Office of the Chief Financial Officer and  center representatives reported. EVM focal points said the problem of  collecting EVM data from nonprofits to feed into a larger project-level  EVM system could be mitigated through contract language that clearly  specifies what data are required from contractors. According to these  officials, this kind of language has been included in Jet Propulsion  Laboratory contracts and has been successfully demonstrated as a result.  Furthermore, NASA is concerned that if nonprofits and small businesses  are required to have a fully compliant or certified EVM system, they may  not be able to bid on the work. However, the Federal Acquisition  Regulation is clear that no offeror can be eliminated from consideration  for a contract award because the entity does not have a compliant or  certified EVM system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Understanding of EVM Varies Widely Across NASA", "paragraphs": ["NASA representatives we interviewed said there was a need for improved  abilities across the agency to analyze EVM data and implement EVM  systems. Specifically, several focal points said the challenge for NASA is  not as much in obtaining EVM data because most of the information  comes from private contractors responsible for much of NASA\u2019s work, but  in having a staff that can analyze the data and integrate it at the project  level. A senior NASA official also noted that the career civil servants, who  typically are the first level of review for EVM data, do not have  background or training in EVM and cannot conduct a sound analysis of  the data. A project representative echoed this comment and noted a  general awareness of EVM within projects but a shortage of in-depth  knowledge to understand EVM fundamentals and how to interpret the  data it produces. For example, some projects seek to reset EVM  baselines to match funding allocations, which thwarts efforts to examine  cost and schedule trends. One EVM focal point told us it has been difficult  to convince project managers that EVM can predict what will happen in  their projects given the highly technical nature of their work. For example,  a senior manager of a program that experienced significant schedule  delays and cost overruns stated that he is an \u201cEVM skeptic\u201d and that he  does not see EVM data as helpful in helping him track the performance of  a project.", "Additionally, the employee skill sets available to analyze and implement  EVM vary widely from center to center, headquarters officials said. In  recent years, NASA has provided EVM training to a large number of  employees; however, the agency has not conducted a skills gaps  analysis, which could help to determine the number and extent of the  staff\u2019s EVM expertise. NASA centers may have staff skill levels reflective  of the level of EVM use at the center. Some centers have many projects  producing EVM data while others may only rarely work on a project that  uses EVM. Without a sufficient number of trained staff to analyze  contractor data and implement in-house EVM efforts, NASA will likely  continue to struggle to effectively use EVM as a valuable project  management tool."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NASA Policy Is in Line with Best Practices but Implementation Remains the Challenge", "paragraphs": ["NASA has undertaken several initiatives aimed at improving the agency\u2019s  use of EVM. For example, NASA strengthened its spaceflight  management policy to require projects to comply with the 32 ANSI/EIA- 748 guidelines and has developed the processes and tools for projects to  meet this requirement through its new EVM system. While these are  positive steps, the policy continues to lack a requirement for rigorous  oversight or surveillance of how projects are implementing EVM and  NASA does not require projects to use the new EVM system to implement  the EVM requirement of the revised policy. In addition, the issues that  have impeded NASA\u2019s ability to effectively implement EVM, such as its  culture, are longstanding and, as a result, NASA has not had much  success implementing EVM in the past.", "The agency\u2019s recent revision of NASA Procedural Requirements  7120.5\u2014the policy that governs NASA\u2019s spaceflight projects and contains  project EVM requirements\u2014strengthened the EVM requirements over  prior versions of the policy. For example, the revised policy requires all  spaceflight projects to demonstrate compliance with each of the 32 EVM  guidelines as set forth in ANSI/EIA-748, whereas the prior policy only  required projects to comply with seven high-level EVM principles. The  new requirements took effect through the release of an interim directive  on September 28, 2011 and have since been made final in NASA\u2019s most  recent update to 7120.5. As a result, projects meeting EVM reporting  thresholds that enter implementation after that date are required to  comply with the new requirement. According to an agency official, the  Office of the Chief Engineer and the mission directorates will determine  which projects that began development under the prior policy must  comply with the new EVM requirements. At major milestones, Office of  the Chief Engineer representatives will review whether the projects have  implemented the 32 EVM guidelines.", "However, the new policy still only contains the minimum requirements for  earned value management, such as the thresholds for implementing EVM  and the requirement to comply with ANSI/EIA-748 guidelines. The policy  does not require projects to implement formal independent surveillance of  their EVM systems. Without effective surveillance, agencies cannot  ensure they are meeting the ANSI/EIA-748 guidelines because internal  management systems are not being reviewed to determine if they are  providing reliable cost, schedule and technical performance data. In  addition, effective surveillance helps pinpoint problems, and is useful for  verifying the effectiveness of corrective action plans used to mitigate EVM  system deficiencies. While projects are not required to implement formal  independent surveillance, NASA does plan to conduct periodic  surveillance of project EVM systems. For example, NASA plans to  conduct EVM assessments at two key decision point life cycle reviews  and through the Office of the Chief Engineer compliance surveys.these methods will increase the agency\u2019s surveillance efforts, best  practices call for project level surveillance to be an ongoing, continuous  process conducted by an independent surveillance function.", "The policy also does not require projects to use NASA\u2019s new EVM  system, although the system was designed to help projects meet the  ANSI/EIA-748 guidelines. We found that the system meets the intent of  the ANSI/EIA-748 guidelines. Examples of how NASA\u2019s EVM system will  satisfy three key ANSI/EIA-748 guidelines are summarized in table 3  below.", "For the projects required to comply with the new policy, use of the  agency-developed EVM system would meet the ANSI/EIA guidelines;  however, some projects will be permitted to continue using their individual  EVM systems as long as the 32 guidelines are met. According to agency  officials, while future revisions to the policy may require use of the  standardized agency-developed EVM system by all projects, at this time,  the agency does not plan to require projects to use the agency-developed  system in order to meet the guidelines. Instead, senior managers will  determine on a case by case basis whether a project will use the  agency\u2019s new EVM system. Currently, only the Space Launch System  and ICESat-2 projects have been selected to implement the new EVM  system. According to an agency senior official, the Agency Program  Management Council approved a phased rollout of the new system  because NASA does not have the resources to implement it agency-wide.  For example, there are not enough NASA subject matter experts to  provide the support needed by the projects when applying the new EVM  system and to build the institutional capability at the centers. Their  approach aims to incrementally build the capacity to do EVM, and seek  increased acceptance of EVM as the requirement for its use is expanded."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strong Leadership Needed to Fully Implement EVM", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, NASA has attempted to address its EVM shortcomings  through a series of policy changes, but these efforts have failed to  adequately address the cultural resistance to implementing EVM  highlighted by many of the NASA officials we interviewed. NASA has  made uneven progress since we reported in 2004 that the agency needed  to improve its use of EVM as a project management tool. Furthermore, a  2008 NASA internal study noted that projects needed to be educated on  the value and approaches for using EVM and to provide support for  setting up EVM within the projects early. Also, an internal agency briefing  on EVM stated that a change management initiative would be necessary  in order to successfully implement EVM at NASA centers. Our work has  also shown that implementing a large-scale initiative, such as EVM,  requires more than just policy changes. To see real change and, in  effect, a cultural shift at NASA, top leadership must provide to employees  a succinct and compelling reason that effective implementation of EVM is  important. Articulating a compelling reason for implementing EVM  enables employees and other stakeholders to understand the expected  outcome of the management initiative and engenders not only their  cooperation, but also their ownership of the outcome, which our work has  shown can take at least 5 to 7 years to fully implement. NASA, by having  a policy that is not comprehensive, allowing projects to opt out of using  the new EVM system, and not committing resources to adequately train  staff, continues to limit progress in the cultural change needed to  implement EVM.

Currently, only a few of the 10 major spaceflight  projects we reviewed were able to produce reliable EVM data, raising  concern that they cannot produce reliable estimates of cost at completion.  Moreover, until the data are sufficiently reliable, NASA, as well as  external stakeholders, lose valuable insights into project performance that  EVM provides. A sound EVM system is not merely an accounting tool; it  can alert managers to developing problems so that they can be proactive  in reducing the project\u2019s cost and schedule overruns.

Managing change will be key if NASA\u2019s latest effort to overcome  these challenges and implement an agencywide EVM plan is to succeed.  To accomplish effective earned value management, strong leadership is  required to set an expectation that reliable and credible data are  necessary to manage a successful project.

In particular, the agency agreed with  our recommendation to perform an EVM skills gap analysis and develop a  workforce training plan to address any deficiencies identified. To that end,  NASA plans to conduct a skills gap assessment and to augment its EVM  training program to address the gaps identified. In addition, the agency  also concurred with our recommendation to develop an EVM change  management plan and is planning to develop a strategy targeted at all  levels of the workforce from project team members to the agency\u2019s  leadership.", "The agency partially concurred with our recommendation that NASA  establish a time frame by which all new spaceflight projects will be  required to implement NASA's newly developed EVM system, stating that  they already require projects to perform EVM with an ANSI/EIA 748  compliant system. NASA stated that its phased rollout approach for  implementing the agency\u2019s EVM system is based on available resources,  budgetary constraints, and institutional and project needs.  However,  NASA's approach does not include a timeframe for when projects will be  required to use the new system. We recommended that NASA establish a  timeframe for rolling out the system to all projects because a large  number of projects are not in compliance with NASA\u2019s requirement, and  very few are implementing the new EVM system. Using the newly  developed EVM system could help projects better ensure NASA's  projects are using a system that is compliant with the ANSI/EIA standard.  The agency also noted its disagreement with the notion that all projects,  in particular those that have a skilled EVM workforce and a compliant  system in place, should be forced to use the agency's new system.  Accordingly, we acknowledged in our report that there may be situations  where a project should not be required to use the agency\u2019s EVM system,  such as when a project already uses a certified system or for current,  ongoing projects. Furthermore, we reported that NASA lacks the  appropriate level of surveillance of its projects\u2019 EVM systems to monitor  project adherence to the EVM standard; in addition, the extent to which  EVM has been effectively implemented across NASA's projects varies. If  NASA chooses not to require projects to use its new system it should take  steps to ensure that it monitors their compliance with the standard.  Finally, while we appreciate that NASA must balance its resources with its  needs, the benefits that an effective EVM system can provide, such as  allowing project managers to identify cost growth and take actions to stem  further growth, warrants prioritization of resources to ensure earlier  widespread implementation of NASA's EVM system.", "The agency also partially concurred with our recommendation that NPR  7120.5 be modified to require projects to implement a formal EVM  surveillance program. Citing resource constraints, NASA commented that  it does not plan to implement a formal surveillance program, but agreed  that the reliability and utility of the EVM data needed to be improved. As a  result, the agency plans to establish a surveillance process, expand the  workforce\u2019s EVM skills, and provide analytical tools including developing  an EVM System Acceptance and Surveillance Guide. Furthermore, NASA  said that it was not appropriate to incorporate the surveillance  requirement in NPR 7120.5 because of the level of detail associated with  requirements in that policy. The most important part of our  recommendation is that EVM surveillance should be required to ensure  better quality data. We reported that only 4 of the 10 projects we  assessed had a comprehensive EVM surveillance system in place and  the others had limited or no surveillance being performed and only 3 of  the 10 projects had fully reliable data.

We disagree and note that in the report we discuss  progress the agency has made over the past year, such as strengthening  the EVM requirements in its policy and developing its new EVM system.  Furthermore, we did not solely rely on project EVM data to develop our  findings. For example, interviews with project officials and additional  documentation they provided further validated our findings. Finally, it is  important to note that NASA Acquisition Management has been on GAO\u2019s  High Risk list for many years due to the agency\u2019s cost and schedule  performance on its major projects.

In addition, we assessed the projects against 3 fundamental  EVM practices that we believe are necessary for maintaining a reliable  EVM system, as identified in our cost guide. We also analyzed the  contract performance reports for each project to determine the level of  data reliability. Specifically, we identified instances of the following: (1)  negative planned value, earned value, or actual cost; (2) planned value  and earned value without actual cost; (3) earned value and actual cost  without planned value; (4) actual cost without planned value or earned  value; (5) earned value without planned value and actual cost; (6)  inconsistencies between the estimated cost at completion and the  planned cost at completion; (7) actual cost exceeding estimated cost at  completion; and (8) planned or earned values exceeding planned cost at  completion.", "For the contracts that had more than 6 months of data, we used contract  performance report data in order to generate our estimated overrun or  underrun of the contract cost at completion by using formulas accepted  by the EVM community and printed in the GAO Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide. To perform this analysis, we examined contractor  performance reports over the period for which we had data to show  trends in cost and schedule performances. We generated multiple  formulas for the projected contract cost at completion that were based on  how much of the contract had been completed up to August 2011 or  earlier for some projects. The ranges in the estimates at completion are  driven by using different efficiency indices based on the project\u2019s past  cost and schedule performance to forecast the cost of the remaining work  and adding that cost to the actual costs to date. The efficiency indices  capture how the project has performed in the past and can be useful in  predicting how it will perform in the future.", "We also analyzed monthly project management review briefings to  support our analysis.

Without this information, management of the project will be fragmented,  presenting a distorted view of project status. For several decades, the  Department of Defense (DOD) has utilized a tool called earned value  management (EVM) to compare the value of work performed to the  work\u2019s actual cost. Earned value management goes beyond the two- dimensional approach of comparing budgeted costs to actual costs. It  attempts to compare the value of work accomplished during a given  period with the work scheduled for that period. By using the value of  completed work as a basis for estimating the cost and time needed to  complete the project, the earned value concept should alert project and  senior managers to the potential problems early in the project.", "In 1996, DOD adopted 32 criteria for evaluating the quality of earned  value management systems. These 32 criteria are organized into 5 basic  categories: organization, planning and budgeting, accounting  considerations, analysis and management reports, and revisions and data  maintenance. In general terms, the criteria require contractors to define the contractual scope of work using a work breakdown measure the progress of work based on objective indicators; structure;  identify organizational responsibility for the work;  integrate internal management subsystems;  schedule and budget authorized work;  collect the cost of labor and materials associated with the work  performed; analyze any variances from planned cost and schedules; forecast costs at contract completion; and  control changes.", "The criteria have evolved to become an American National Standards  Institute (ANSI) and Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) standard for EVM,  which has been adopted by major U.S. government agencies, industry,  and the governments of Canada and Australia. The full application of  EVM system criteria is appropriate for large-cost reimbursable contracts  where the government bears the cost risk. For such contracts, the  management discipline described by the criteria is essential. In addition,  data from an EVM system have been proven to provide objective reports  of contract status, allowing numerous indices and performance measures  to be calculated. These can then be used to develop accurate estimates  of anticipated costs at completion, providing early warning of impending  schedule delays and cost overruns.", "The standard format for tracking earned value is through a Contract  Performance Report (CPR). The CPR is a monthly compilation of cost,  schedule and technical data which displays the performance  measurement baseline, any cost and schedule variances from that  baseline, the amount of management reserve used to date, the portion of  the contract that is authorized unpriced work, and the contractor\u2019s latest  revised estimate to complete the project.", "As a result, the CPR can be used as an effective management tool  because it provides the project manager with early warning of potential  cost and schedule overruns. Using data from the CPR, a project manager  can assess trends in cost and schedule performance. This information is  useful because trends can be difficult to reverse. Studies have shown that  once projects are 15 percent complete, the performance indicators are  indicative of the final outcome. For example, a CPR showing a negative  trend for schedule status would indicate that the project is behind  schedule. By analyzing the CPR, one could determine the cause of the  schedule problem such as delayed flight tests, changes in requirements,  or test problems because the CPR contains a section that describes the  reasons for the negative status. A negative schedule condition is a cause  for concern, because it can be a predictor of later cost problems since  additional spending is often necessary to resolve problems. For instance,  if a project finishes 6 months later than planned, additional costs will be  expended to cover the salaries of personnel and their overhead beyond  what was originally expected. CPR data provides the basis for  independent assessments of a project\u2019s cost and schedule status and can  be used to project final costs at completion in addition to determining  when a project should be completed.", "Examining a project\u2019s management reserve is another way that a project  can use a CPR to determine potential issues early on. Management  reserves, which are funds that may be used as needed, provide flexibility  to cope with problems or unexpected events. EVM experts agree that  transfers of management reserve should be tracked and reported  because they are often problem indicators. An alarming situation arises if  the CPR shows that the management reserve is being used at a faster  pace than the project is progressing toward completion. For example, a  problem would be indicated if a project has used 80 percent of its  management reserve but only completed 40 percent of its work. A  project\u2019s management reserve should contain at least 10 percent of the  cost to complete a project so that funds will always be available to cover  future unexpected problems that are more likely to surface as the project  moves into the testing and evaluation phase.", "An Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) is conducted to ensure the reliability  of the EVM data and that the performance measurement baseline  accurately captures all the work to be accomplished. Data from the CPR  can then be used to assess project status\u2014typically, monthly. Cost and  schedule variances are examined and various estimates at completion  are developed and compared to available funding. The results are shared  with management for evaluating contractor performance. Finally, because  EVM requires detailed planning for near-term work, as time progresses,  planning packages are converted into detailed work packages. This cycle  continues until all work has been planned and the project is complete.", "An IBR is an evaluation of the performance measurement baseline to  determine whether all project requirements have been addressed, risks  identified, and mitigation plans put in place and all available and planned  resources are sufficient to complete the work. Too often, projects overrun  because estimates fail to account for the full technical definition,  unexpected changes, and risks. Using poor estimates to develop the  performance measurement baseline will result in an unrealistic baseline  for performance measurement.", "After the CPRs start being delivered to the government, it is important to  oversee the project by conducting surveillance of the EVM system.  Surveillance is reviewing a contractor\u2019s EVM system as it is applied to  one or more projects. Its purpose is to focus on how well a contractor is  using its EVM system to manage cost, schedule, and technical  performance. For instance, surveillance checks whether the contractor\u2019s  EVM system summarizes timely and reliable cost, schedule, and  technical performance information directly from its internal management  system; complies with the contractor\u2019s implementation of ANSI/EIA-748  guidelines; provides timely indications of actual or potential problems by  performing spot checks, sample data traces, and random interviews;  maintains baseline integrity; gives information that depicts actual  conditions and trends; and provides comprehensive variance analyses at  the appropriate levels, including corrections for cost, schedule, technical,  and other problem areas.", "Effective surveillance ensures that the key elements of the EVM process  are maintained over time and on subsequent applications. EVM system  surveillance ensures that the contractor is following its own corporate  processes and procedures and confirms that the contractor\u2019s processes  and procedures continue to satisfy the ANSI guidelines.", "The surveillance team designated to perform project reviews should  consist of a few experienced staff who fully understand the contractor\u2019s  EVM system and the processes being reviewed. The surveillance  organization should appoint the team leader and ensure that all  surveillance team members are independent. This means that they  should not be responsible for any part of the projects they assess. Key  activities on the surveillance team\u2019s agenda include reviewing documents,  addressing government project office concerns, and discussing prior  surveillance findings and any open issues. Sufficient time should be  allocated to all these activities to complete them. The documents for  review should give the team an overview of the project\u2019s implementation  of the EVM process.", "Successful surveillance is predicated on access to objective information  that verifies that the project team is using EVM effectively to manage the  contract and complies with company EVM procedures. Objective  information includes project documentation created in the normal conduct  of business. Besides collecting documentation, the surveillance team  should interview control account managers and other project staff to see if  they can describe how they comply with EVM policies, procedures, or  processes. During interviews, the surveillance team should ask them to  verify their responses with objective project documentation such as work  authorizations, cost and schedule status data, variance analysis reports,  and back-up data for any estimates at completion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Case Studies of Selected Projects\u2019 Implementation of Earned Value Management", "paragraphs": ["We conducted case studies of 10 major spaceflight system acquisition  projects.

The ANSI/EIA guidelines also  state that projects should have a schedule that describes the sequence of  work by listing activities in the order in which they are to be carried out  and identifying significant task interdependencies required to meet project  requirements. Finally, the ANSI/EIA guidelines state that a project should  establish and maintain a time-phased budget baseline to track cost and  schedule variances in an EVM system.", "As mentioned above, this appendix includes an analysis of each project\u2019s  earned value trends from August 2010 to August 2011. These data and  trends are often described in terms of cost and schedule variances. Cost  variances compare the earned value of the completed work with the  actual cost of the work performed. Schedule variances are also measured  in dollars, but they compare the earned value of the completed work with  the value of the work that was expected to be completed. Positive  variances are good\u2014they indicate that activities are costing less than  expected or are completed ahead of schedule. Negative variances are  bad\u2014they indicate activities are costing more than expected or are falling  behind schedule. Variances are merely measures that indicate that work  is not being performed according to plan and that it must be assessed  further to understand why. Although our EVM cost projections may show  that a project is experiencing negative cost variances and schedule  slippages, this does not mean that a project has exceeded its agency  baseline commitment and will require additional funds to complete the  project. These estimates use a project\u2019s EVM baseline, which represents  only a portion of the agency baseline commitment for a project.

In addition, officials also said some of the  sequencing issues may be caused by the manual integration because  since some instrument provider schedules are in Microsoft Project and  others are in Primavera, and therefore it is not possible to ensure all tasks  have been linked properly.

Boeing has a certified  EVM system that complies with the ANSI/EIA EVM standard. Though the  contractor has a certified system, the implementation of that system is  questionable based on our findings below. We also assessed whether the  spacecraft contractor\u2019s EVM data against three ANSI/EIA guidelines.  These guidelines state that the authorized work elements for the project  should be defined typically using a WBS that has been tailored to the  project and the WBS is the same for the cost estimate, schedule, and  EVM. We found that the WBS used in the spacecraft integrated master  schedule was consistent with the WBS used for the EVM data.", "The ANSI/EIA guidelines also state that projects should have a schedule  that describes the sequence of work by listing activities in the order in  which they are to be carried out and identifying significant task  interdependencies required to meet project requirements. We found some  sequencing issues in the contractor\u2019s schedule. For example, 13 percent  of the remaining activities were constrained. When schedules are not  sequenced properly, float values and the calculated critical path will not  be valid. Project officials acknowledged the constraints and said they are  a result of having to adjust support activities due to spacecraft integration  and test delays as well as alignments to the current/actual manifest dates,  which differ from the Boeing contractual and launch readiness dates. In  addition, critical path metrics are generated and analyzed monthly to track  the Boeing performance against the critical path activities. Finally, the  ANSI/EIA guidelines state that a project should establish and maintain a  time-phased budget baseline to track cost and schedule variances in an  EVM system. Though resource loading the schedule is not required to  meet the ANSI/EIA guidelines, it is a best practice and therefore  resources should be accounted for in the schedule in order to develop  this baseline, according to the GAO cost guide. We found that the  schedule was not resource loaded. Project officials said the integrated  master schedule is resource loaded but not inside the Microsoft Project  schedule because it does not directly interface with the Boeing  financial/EVM system. They stated that the integrated master schedule is  produced using Microsoft Project and imported into a planning software  tool. After the resource loading effort is performed, the planning data is  transferred into the EVM system. The tool integrates the Microsoft Project  schedule with the Boeing financial system and the resource allocations  for each task.

Labor costs  were also higher than expected due to part failures and the late  completion of component qualifications. Extended test activities also  contributed to the cumulative negative cost variance. Finally, more than  expected resources were needed to complete board and slice designs,  generate drawings, and assemble and test components because of the  complexity of the design. Due to the negative cost and schedule variance  we are forecasting a variance at completion ranging from $152 million to  $185 million.

Figure 20 below  illustrates that as of August 2011, the project was reporting a positive  cumulative cost variance of $0.08 million. Because there were no  variance analysis reports accompanying the sustaining effort, we were  unable to determine what was causing the positive cost variance. Project  officials stated that the Performance Measurement Baseline for this effort  was almost entirely level of effort, so minimal variances would be  occurring. They added that during the August 2011 time period, the  contract reflected an April 2012 launch date even though the launch was  being delayed. Consequently, Boeing\u2019s reports were reflecting work  scheduled to occur in support of the earlier launch date when in fact very  little effort was being done.
