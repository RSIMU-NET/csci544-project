A diagnosis of drug abuse is generally made when drug use has led to social, legal, or interpersonal problems. A clinical diagnosis of drug dependence\u2014or addiction\u2014is based on a group of criteria including physiological, behavioral, and cognitive factors. In particular, drug addiction is characterized by compulsive drug-seeking behavior. People who are dependent on drugs often use multiple drugs and usually have substantial impairment of health and social functioning. Furthermore, addiction is generally accompanied by withdrawal symptoms and drug tolerance, resulting in the need to increase the amount of drugs consumed.", "Moreover, severe dependence is often associated with health conditions or impairments in social functioning, including mental health disorders that generally are serious and difficult to treat. Drug abusers are more likely than nonabusers to sustain injuries; be involved in violence and illegal activities; have chronic health problems, including a higher risk of contracting HIV (human immunodeficiency virus); and have difficulty holding a job.", "Most scientists agree that addiction is the result of chemical and physical changes in the brain caused by drug use. However, they recognize that addiction extends beyond physiological components to include significant behavioral and psychological aspects. For example, specific environmental cues that a drug abuser associates with drug use can trigger craving and precipitate relapse, even after long periods of abstinence. Therefore, people receiving treatment for drug abuse often enter treatment a number of times\u2014sometimes in different approaches or settings, and sometimes in the same approach or even the same treatment facility. Often, the substance abuser reduces his or her drug use incrementally with each treatment episode.", "Experts recognize that not all drug users require treatment to forgo drug use because some drug users do not progress to abuse or dependence.

However, in the first year after their return home, only 5 percent of those addicted in Vietnam remained addicted in the United States. The author concluded that most addictions are relatively brief, and that most drug abusers are capable of discontinuing drug use without treatment.

Most of the group in treatment had received treatment in multiple settings, most commonly in drug treatment facilities and self-help groups. Only about one-fourth of those who needed drug treatment in the previous year reported having received it during that year. Adolescents (aged 12 to 17) were even less likely to receive needed treatment, with 18 percent of those needing treatment receiving it.", "The treatment of drug addiction can be classified under two major approaches: pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy. Pharmacotherapy relies on medications to block the euphoric effects or manage the withdrawal symptoms and cravings experienced with illicit drug use. One such widely used medication is methadone, a narcotic analgesic that blocks the euphoria of heroin, morphine, codeine, and other opiate drugs and suppresses withdrawal symptoms and craving between treatment doses. Methadone maintenance generally requires daily clinic visits to receive the methadone dose; over time, some clients are given take-home doses. Methadone maintenance can continue for as long as several years, and in some cases, maintenance may last a lifetime.", "A number of other drugs have also been shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of opiate addiction. Levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) suppresses withdrawal symptoms for 72 to 96 hours and thus can reduce clients\u2019 clinic visits to 3 days per week. Naltrexone, like LAAM, is long-acting and can be administered in small daily doses or in larger doses 3 times a week. Naltrexone is believed to be most effective for highly motivated clients, especially those with strong social supports. Buprenorphine has been effective in clinical trials in retaining patients in treatment and facilitating abstinence. In addition, buprenorphine has been shown to produce less physical dependence than methadone and LAAM.", "Behavioral therapy includes various forms of psychotherapy, contingency-based therapy, cognitive therapy, and other types of therapies. It may include skills training and a variety of counseling approaches, from highly structured individual or family counseling to more informal group counseling. Some programs combine elements of both pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy. For example, many methadone maintenance programs are designed to also provide counseling services, which may include psychotherapy or individualized social assistance. Participation in counseling facilitates regular monitoring of client behavior, appearance, and drug use. Some outpatient nonmethadone programs also use pharmacological treatment, such as medications for initial detoxification, medications to control craving, or drugs that address psychiatric disorders such as depression or schizophrenia. Drug abusers receiving pharmacotherapy, behavioral therapy, or both may also participate in self-help groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, or Rational Recovery and are generally encouraged to continue participation in these groups after leaving formal treatment to help maintain abstinence and a healthy lifestyle.", "A number of other, less commonly used approaches to drug treatment offer alternatives to these established approaches. One such example is the use of spirituality as a component of treatment. Some researchers have acknowledged that people with a strong spiritual or religious involvement seem to be at lower risk for substance abuse, yet research in this area remains extremely limited. Experts have yet to agree on how to define faith-based drug treatment. Some define faith-based programs as those that are based on religious beliefs and practices, such as Teen Challenge, while others consider any treatment approach that recognizes spirituality, such as Narcotics Anonymous or Cocaine Anonymous, to be faith-based.", "Regardless of how faith-based treatment is defined, there has not been sufficient research to determine the results of this type of treatment. For example, a recent research conference assessed the evidence on spiritual treatment for alcohol and drug abuse. The panel found strong evidence for a few limited assertions: that better treatment outcomes correlate with Alcoholics Anonymous involvement after outpatient treatment and that meditation-based interventions are associated with reduced levels of alcohol and drug use. The panel concluded that the issues for future research in this area include the definition and measurement of spiritual variables and the possible spiritual factors that could play a role in recovery from substance abuse.", "Regardless of the approach used, drug treatment services are provided in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Most people are served by outpatient programs, where treatment can vary from psychotherapy at comprehensive health centers to informal group discussions at drop-in centers. People who enter outpatient drug-free treatment generally (though not always) have a less severe level of addiction and associated problems than those who receive treatment in inpatient settings. Although weekly counseling is the predominate treatment approach available at outpatient settings, some programs also offer pharmacological treatment and some give assistance with social needs, including education, job training, housing, and health care.", "Inpatient settings include hospitals as well as residential facilities, such as therapeutic communities. Hospital-based drug treatment is used for detoxification from drugs and to provide other services for individuals having severe medical or psychiatric complications. Data from 1992-93 show that, of the group reporting drug treatment during the past year, 28 percent received treatment in an inpatient hospital setting. Chemical dependency programs, one type of inpatient treatment program, recognize drug problems as having multiple causes, including physiological, psychological, and sociocultural aspects. Treatment may last up to several weeks and may include pharmacological intervention, education about drug addiction, counseling, participation in self-help groups, and medical or psychiatric services.", "Long-term residential treatment programs are designed for people with more severe drug problems\u2014those with dependence on one or more drugs who have failed previous treatment efforts. For example, therapeutic communities provide treatment that is generally planned for 6 to 12 months in a residential setting. Clients are generally chronic drug abusers who have failed at other forms of drug abuse treatment, while staff are largely previous drug abusers.

Evaluations of treatment effectiveness can use one of several methodologies, depending on the specific questions to be addressed.

In particular, studies of the validity of self-reported data demonstrate that information on treatment outcomes collected by self-report should be interpreted with some caution.

Methodologists agree that randomized clinical trials are the most rigorous study designs and therefore offer the strongest support for their findings. Studies that rely on a simple observational design produce less definitive findings but can provide a good indication of the operation of drug treatment programs as well as information on treatment outcomes. A quasiexperimental design, the most frequently used in field settings, falls somewhere in between.", "Randomized clinical studies are designed to isolate the effects of a treatment by randomly assigning individuals to either a control group\u2014receiving no treatment or an alternative treatment\u2014or to a group that receives the treatment being studied. This study design has been used in the assessment of methadone maintenance for treating heroin addiction. Randomized trials are often used to study the efficacy of a treatment, asking the question, \u201cCan it work?\u201d Although such studies provide the most definitive information about whether particular treatments are effective, they are not widely used in drug treatment research. According to an analysis by the Lewin Group, among the reasons cited for the limited use of randomized trials are the difficulties in obtaining informed consent from drug abusers and the perceived ethical issue of randomly assigning people who are seeking drug treatment to a control group in which no treatment or a treatment regimen not of the client\u2019s choice is provided.", "Simple and controlled observation designs typically employ a repeated-measures methodology, whereby the researchers collect information on drug use patterns and other criteria from clients before, during, and after treatment. Generally, controlled observation studies examine multiple treatment groups, and simple observation studies follow a single treatment group without a nontreatment comparison group. Observational studies provide information about the effectiveness of treatments when implemented in uncontrolled, or real-world, conditions. Observational design has been used to assess treatment provided in all four of the major treatment settings: residential therapeutic communities and outpatient methadone maintenance, outpatient drug-free, and inpatient chemical dependency programs.", "Quasiexperimental study designs generally have a comparison group, a key feature of strong research design, but an investigator does not randomly assign individuals to treatment and comparison groups. Instead, comparisons are made between possibly nonequivalent client groups or by using statistical techniques that adjust for known differences in client characteristics. Even in a quasiexperimental design, a repeated-measures methodology might be used in comparing the behaviors of the same group of drug abusers before, during, and after treatment. A quasiexperimental design is often applied in evaluations of naturally occurring events, such as introducing a new treatment approach or closing a treatment program. Such a design allows greater confidence (than observation alone) that any differences detected are due to treatment but not as much confidence as random assignment of clients to treatment and comparison groups. Quasiexperimental study designs have been used to assess the effectiveness of both methadone maintenance programs and therapeutic communities as well as outpatient drug-free programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treatment Evaluations Define and Measure Outcomes Differently", "paragraphs": ["Treatment program goals generally include a wide range of issues, such as reducing drug use, reducing criminal behavior, and improving employment status. Most researchers have agreed that reducing drug use from the level it would have been without treatment (harm reduction) is a valid goal of drug treatment and an indication of program success. In addressing this issue, researchers acknowledge that abstinence from illicit drug consumption is the central goal of all drug treatment, but they contend it is not the only acceptable goal of treatment, since total abstinence from drug use may be unrealistic for many users. According to the Institute of Medicine, \u201can extended abstinence, even if punctuated by slips and short relapses, is beneficial in itself and may serve as a critical intermediate step toward lifetime abstinence and recovery.\u201d", "Even with harm reduction as the common objective, treatment outcome measures vary among\u2014and sometimes within\u2014treatment programs. Operationalizing the outcome measures is also done differently across programs, which makes it difficult to compare treatment outcomes of different programs. For example, one program may measure reduction in drug use by examining the frequency of drug use, while another may choose to focus on reduced relapse time. Major drug treatment studies use other outcomes as well to measure treatment effectiveness, ranging from reductions in criminal activity to increased productivity. Indicators for these outcome measures also vary by study. (See table 2.)", "Another issue related to measuring treatment outcomes is concern about the time frame for client follow-up. Since drug addiction is commonly viewed as a life-long disease, many argue that long-term follow-up is needed to fully assess treatment outcomes. However, many of those who complete treatment programs are lost in the follow-up assessment period. Treatment assessment periods vary considerably, ranging from a 1-year follow-up for most studies to a 12-year follow-up for a subset of clients in one of the major studies we reviewed. The research literature indicates difficulties in tracking drug abusers even for 1-year follow-up periods.

The central debate regarding data collection on the use of illicit drugs surrounds the common use of self-reported data. A recent NIDA review of current research on the validity of self-reported drug use highlights the limitations of data collected in this manner. According to this review, recent studies conducted with criminal justice clients (such as people on parole, on probation, or awaiting trial) and former treatment clients suggest that 50 percent or fewer current users accurately report their drug use in confidential interviews. In general, self-reports are less valid for the more stigmatized drugs, such as cocaine; for more recent rather than past use; and for those involved with the criminal justice system.", "The largest studies of treatment effectiveness, which have evaluated the progress of thousands of people in drug treatment programs, have all relied on self-reported data. That is, the drug abuser is surveyed when entering treatment, and then again at a specified follow-up interval. In general, individuals are asked, orally or in writing, to report their drug use patterns during the previous year. Self-reports of drug use may be subject to bias both prior to and following treatment and can be either over- or understated. Drug abusers may inflate their current level of drug use when presenting for treatment if they believe that higher levels of use will increase the likelihood of acceptance into treatment. Drug use may also be underreported at treatment intake or follow-up. Motivations cited for underreporting include the client\u2019s desire to reflect a positive outcome from treatment and the perception of a strong societal stigma associated with the use of particular drugs.", "As questions have developed about the accuracy of self-reported data,researchers have begun using objective means to validate the data collected in this manner, although these methods also have limitations. Generally, a subgroup of the individuals surveyed after treatment is asked to provide either a urine sample or a hair sample, which is then screened for evidence of drug use. The results from the urinalysis or hair analysis are then compared against self-reports of drug use. Some researchers believe that it may be possible to systematically adjust self-reported data to correct for the biases exposed by urinalysis or hair analysis, although this technique is not currently in use.", "Recent major studies of drug treatment effectiveness have used urinalysis to validate self-reported data. For example, the National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study (NTIES) found that self-reports of recent drug use (in the past 30 days) for opiates and cocaine were lower than current drug use as revealed by urinalysis. However, the self-reports of substance use over the entire follow-up period (that is, use on at least five occasions) yielded an equivalent or higher rate of use than the results of analyzing urine specimens collected at the follow-up interview. (See table 3.) Other studies found similar underreporting of drug use. The Treatment Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS), which followed people entering treatment in the early 1980s, reported that 40 percent of the individuals testing positive for cocaine 24 months after treatment had reported using the drug in the previous 3 days.", "Despite the discrepancies observed, each of the data collection methods used to measure treatment effectiveness has particular weaknesses. As shown above, validation studies indicate that self-reports of current drug use underreport drug use. At the same time, researchers emphasize that client reporting on use of illicit drugs during the previous year (the outcome measure used in most effectiveness evaluations) has been shown to be more accurate than reporting on current drug use. In comparison, urine tests can accurately detect illicit drugs for about 48 hours following drug use. However, urinalysis does not provide any information about drug use during the previous year. In addition, individual differences in metabolism rates can affect the outcomes of urinalysis tests. Hair analysis has received attention because it can detect drug use over a longer time\u2014up to several months. However, unresolved issues in hair testing include variability across drugs in the accuracy of detection, the potential for passive contamination, and the relative effect of different hair color or type on cocaine accumulation in the hair.", "To examine the validity of self-reported data on other outcome measures, NTIES researchers compared self-reports on arrests to official arrest records and found 80 percent agreement, with underreporting of arrest histories most frequent among individuals interviewed in prison or jail and among men under 25 years of age.

For example, surveys of the dosages used in methadone maintenance programs have shown that a large proportion of programs use suboptimal or even subthreshold dosages, which would likely result in poorer treatment outcomes than those of programs that provide optimal dosage levels to their clients. Similarly, outpatient drug-free programs operate with different numbers and quality of staff and have varying levels of coordination with local agencies that offer related services that are generally needed to support recovering abusers. An outpatient drug-free program that has close ties with local services, such as health clinics and job training programs, is likely to have better treatment outcomes than a program without such ties.", "Assessing treatment effectiveness is also complicated by differences in client factors. Researchers recognize that client motivation and readiness for treatment, as well as psychiatric status, can significantly affect the patient\u2019s performance in treatment. For example, unmotivated clients are less likely than motivated ones to adhere to program protocols and to continue treatment.

These large, multisite studies were designed to assess drug abusers on several measures before, during, and after treatment. These studies are generally considered by the Institute of Medicine and the drug treatment research community to be the major evaluations of drug treatment effectiveness, and much of what is known about typical drug abuse treatment outcomes comes from these studies.", "These federally funded studies were conducted by research organizations independent of the groups operating the treatment programs being assessed. Although the characteristics of the studies vary somewhat, all are based on observational or quasiexperimental designs. The most recently completed study, DATOS, is a longitudinal study that used a prospective design and a repeated-measures methodology to study the complex interactions of client characteristics and treatment elements as they occur in typical community-based programs. NTIES, completed in March 1997, was a congressionally mandated, 5-year study that examined the effectiveness of treatment provided in public programs supported by SAMHSA.", "All of these studies relied on self-report as the primary data collection method. That is, drug abusers were interviewed prior to entering treatment and again following treatment, and asked to report on their use of illicit drugs, their involvement in criminal activity, and other drug-related behaviors. As described previously in this report, studies examining the validity of self-reported data suggest that many individuals do not report the full extent of drug use following treatment. Since results from the major studies of treatment effectiveness were not adjusted for the likelihood of underreported drug use (as revealed by urinalysis substudies), the study results that follow may overstate reductions in drug use achieved by drug abusers. Researchers contend that the bias in self-reports on current drug use is greater than the bias in self-reports on past year use and that therefore the overall findings of treatment benefits are still valid.", "Each of these major studies attributed benefits to drug treatment when outcomes were assessed 1 year after treatment. They found that reported drug use declined when clients received treatment from any of three drug treatment approaches\u2014residential long-term, outpatient drug-free, or outpatient methadone maintenance\u2014regardless of the drug and client type. As shown in table 5, DATOS, the study most recently completed, found that the percentage of individuals reporting weekly or more frequent drug use or criminal activity declined following treatment.", "Previous studies found similar reductions in drug use. For example, researchers from the TOPS study found that across all types of drug treatment, 40 to 50 percent of regular heroin and cocaine users who spent at least 3 months in treatment reported near abstinence during the year after treatment, and an additional 30 percent reported reducing their use. DARP found that in the year after treatment, abstinence from daily opiate use was reported by 64 percent of clients in methadone programs, 61 percent in therapeutic communities, and 56 percent in outpatient drug-free programs. NTIES found that 50 percent of clients in treatment reported using crack cocaine five times or more during the year prior to entering treatment, while 25 percent reported such use during the year following treatment.", "The major studies also found that criminal activity declined after treatment. DATOS found that reports of criminal activity declined by 60 percent for cocaine users in long-term residential treatment at the 1-year follow-up. Only 17 percent of NTIES clients reported arrests in the year following treatment\u2014down from 48 percent during the year before treatment entry. Additionally, the percentage of clients who reported supporting themselves primarily through illegal activities decreased from 17 percent before treatment to 9 percent after treatment. DARP found reported reductions in criminal activity for clients who stayed in treatment at least 3 months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Longer Treatment Episodes Have Better Outcomes, but Treatment Duration Is Limited by Client Drop-Out", "paragraphs": ["Another finding across these studies is that clients who stay in treatment longer report better outcomes. For the DATOS clients that reported drug use when entering treatment, fewer of those in treatment for more than 3 months reported continuing drug use than those in treatment for less than 3 months (see table 6). DATOS researchers also found that the most positive outcomes for clients in methadone maintenance were for those who remained in treatment for at least 12 months.", "Earlier studies reported similar results. Both DARP and TOPS found that reports of drug use were reduced most for clients who stayed in treatment at least 3 months, regardless of the treatment setting. In fact, DARP found that treatment lasting 90 days or less was no more effective than no treatment at facilitating complete abstinence from drug use and criminal behavior during the year following treatment.", "Although these studies show better results for longer treatment episodes, they found that many clients dropped out of treatment long before reaching the minimum length of treatment episode recommended by those operating the treatment program. For example, a study of a subset of DATOS clients found that all of the participating methadone maintenance programs recommend 2 or more years of treatment, but the median treatment episode by clients was about 1 year. Long-term residential programs participating in DATOS generally recommended a treatment duration of 9 months or longer, while outpatient drug-free programs recommended at least 6 months in treatment; for both program types, the median treatment episode was 3 months. TOPS found that in the first 3 months of treatment, 64 percent of outpatient drug-free program clients and 55 percent of therapeutic community clients discontinued treatment. For clients receiving methadone maintenance treatment, drop-out rates were somewhat lower\u201432 percent\u2014in the first 3 months.", "Researchers note that drug abuse treatment outcomes should be considered comparable to those of other chronic diseases; therefore, significant dropout rates should not be unexpected. These results are similar to the levels of compliance with treatment regimens for people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. A review of over 70 outcome studies of treatment for diabetes, hypertension, and asthma found that less than 50 percent of people with diabetes fully comply with their insulin treatment schedule, while less than 30 percent of patients with hypertension or asthma comply with their medication regimens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research Suggests That Outpatient Treatment Reduces Drug Use as Much as Residential Treatment, but Costs Vary Widely", "paragraphs": ["A 1990 Institute of Medicine assessment of the treatment literature concluded that despite the heterogeneity of the programs and their clients, treatment outcomes are \u201cqualitatively similar\u201d regardless of whether treatment is provided in a residential or outpatient setting. In 1997, an ONDCP report showed that 34 percent of clients in outpatient treatment were no longer \u201cheavy users\u201d following treatment, while 38 percent of clients in residential settings reported the same. Evidence from the recent DATOS study confirmed that reported reductions in cocaine use were similar for outpatient drug-free and residential settings when clients remained in treatment for at least 3 months. Researchers point out, however, that more severe drug abusers may receive treatment in residential treatment settings than in outpatient settings, making such comparisons difficult.", "However, analysis of the data from DATOS showed mixed results on the impact of treatment on drug-related criminal activity. Clients in long-term residential treatment for at least 6 months were significantly less likely than clients who did not complete more than 13 weeks of treatment to report engaging in an illegal activity in the year after treatment. In contrast, clients in methadone or drug-free treatment in an outpatient setting who remained for at least 6 months were not significantly less likely to report engaging in illegal activity than clients who did not complete more than 13 weeks of treatment in these settings.", "Although the available evidence does not show sharp differences in outcomes, studies do show wide variation in treatment costs for inpatient and outpatient settings. A recent NTIES study found that costs per day were lowest in outpatient settings, where the average treatment period is several months. In contrast, short-term (1 month) residential treatment costs were much higher, resulting in a cost per treatment episode that was double the cost of outpatient treatment episodes. (See table 7.)", "Regardless of the findings of similar outcomes and great variation in costs, there is still reason to support residential treatment for certain patients. In some cases, residential treatment may be required for optimum treatment outcomes, such as for drug abusers with severe substance-related problems, those who have failed in outpatient treatment, or those with severe psychosocial impairments. In contrast, patients with greater psychosocial stability and less substance-related impairment appear to benefit most from nonhospital and nonresidential treatment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Evidence Varies on the Best Treatment Approaches for Specific Groups of Drug Abusers", "paragraphs": ["Research provides strong evidence to support methadone maintenance as the most effective treatment for heroin addiction.

Methadone maintenance, however, is the treatment most commonly used, and numerous studies have shown that those receiving methadone maintenance treatment have better outcomes than those who go untreated or use other treatment approaches\u2014including detoxification with methadone. Methadone maintenance has been shown to reduce heroin use and criminal activity and improve social functioning. HIV risk is also minimized, since needle usage is reduced. Proponents of methadone maintenance also argue that reductions in the use of illicit drugs and associated criminal behavior help recovering drug abusers focus on their social and vocational rehabilitation and become reintegrated into society.", "However, outcomes among methadone programs have varied greatly, in part because of the substantial variation in treatment practices across the nation. Many methadone clinics have routinely provided clients dosage levels that are lower than optimum\u2014or even subthreshold\u2014and have discontinued treatment too soon. In late 1997, an NIH consensus panel concluded that people who are addicted to heroin or other opiates should have broader access to methadone maintenance treatment programs and recommended that federal regulations allow additional physicians and pharmacies to prescribe and dispense methadone.", "Similarly, several studies conducted over the past decade show that when counseling, psychotherapy, health care, and social services are provided along with methadone maintenance, treatment outcomes improve significantly. However, the recent findings from DATOS suggest that the provision of these ancillary services\u2014both the number and variety\u2014has eroded considerably during the past 2 decades across all treatment settings. DATOS researchers also noted that the percentage of clients reporting unmet needs was higher than that in previous studies.", "There are other concerns associated with methadone maintenance.

Although a number of pharmacotherapies have been studied and some have proven successful in one or more clinical trials, no medication has demonstrated substantial efficacy once subjected to several rigorously controlled trials. Nor has any medication used in combination with one or more cognitive-behavioral therapies proven effective in enhancing cocaine abstinence. Researchers are hopeful, however, that a pharmacological agent for treating cocaine addiction will be developed.", "Without a pharmacological agent, researchers have relied on psychotherapeutic approaches to treat cocaine addiction. Studies have shown that clients receiving three cognitive-behavioral therapies have demonstrated prolonged periods of abstinence and high rates of retention in treatment programs. The cognitive-behavioral therapies, based largely on counseling and education, include (1) relapse prevention, which focuses on teaching clients how to identify and manage high-risk, or \u201ctrigger,\u201d situations that contribute to drug relapse; (2) community reinforcement/contingency management, which establishes a link between behavior and consequence by rewarding abstinence and reprimanding drug use; and (3) neurobehavioral therapy, which addresses a client\u2019s behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and relational problems at each stage of recovery.", "These programs have shown promise in curbing drug use. One relapse prevention program showed cocaine-dependent clients were able to remain abstinent at least 70 percent of the time while in treatment.

In addition, they usually do not show the long-term physical effects of drug abuse. Despite a number of studies on the topic, little is known about the best way to treat adolescent drug abusers. Researchers believe that adolescents have special treatment needs; however, research has not shown any one method or approach to be consistently superior to others in achieving better treatment outcomes for adolescents. Among the wide variety of treatment approaches and settings used for adolescents, family-based therapies show promise.", "Historically, adolescents have been referred to residential treatment settings, which may range from group-home living with minimal professional involvement to a setting that provides intensive medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial treatment 24 hours a day. Experts now recognize that many adolescents can be successfully treated in an outpatient treatment setting, where treatment may range from less than 9 hours per week to regular sessions after school to intensive day programs that provide more than 20 hours of treatment per week. Although not thoroughly evaluated, pharmacotherapy may also be used to treat adolescent drug abuse. Researchers believe that self-help or peer support groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, are important adjuncts to treatment for adolescents.", "The relative effectiveness of alternative approaches for treating adolescents remains uncertain. An earlier study of adolescents found that residential treatment resulted in more substantial and consistent reductions in drug use, drug-related problems, and illegal activity than did outpatient drug-free programs. In contrast, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry acknowledged in its 1997 treatment practice parameters that research on drug treatment for adolescents has failed to demonstrate the superiority of one treatment approach over another.

Family-based intervention is based on the assumption that family behaviors contribute to the adolescent\u2019s decision to use drugs. Many researchers believe that family interventions are critical to the success of any treatment approach for adolescent drug abusers, since family-related factors\u2014such as parental substance use, poor parent-child relations, and poor parent supervision\u2014have been identified as risk factors for the development of substance abuse among adolescents. Family relationships may be the primary target for intervention or one of many target areas. A 1995 literature review suggests that family intervention can engage and retain drug abusers and their families in treatment, significantly reducing drug use and related areas of problem behavior.
