This review focuses on the FBI's (1) use of effective practices for acquiring Sentinel and (2) basis for reliably estimating Sentinel's schedule and costs.

For example, the FBI has followed best practices when soliciting offers from contractors to lead the development of Sentinel; it has also followed the practices in evaluating the offers and making a contract award decision. In addition, it has established and is following effective processes to proactively identify and mitigate program risks before they have a chance to become actual cost, schedule, or performance problems. Further, it has taken a range of steps to effectively define expectations for its prime contractor and to measure performance against these expectations and related incentives and hold the contractor accountable for results. However, the bureau has not done the same for one key aspect of tracking and overseeing its program management support contractors. In particular, it has not established performance and product quality standards for these support contractors. According to FBI officials, such standards are not necessary because they monitor their support contractors on a daily basis, including the review and approval of all work products. By not implementing this practice, GAO believes that the FBI's monitoring does not adequately ensure that Sentinel support contractors are performing important program management functions effectively and efficiently. The FBI's policies, procedures, and supporting tools that form the basis for Sentinel's schedule and cost estimates do not adequately reflect key best practices. While the FBI has issued an information technology (IT) program management handbook, related guidance, and tools that define how IT program schedules and costs are to be estimated, this handbook and related material do not, for example, address such key practices as having a historical database of program schedule and cost estimates to inform future estimates. As a result, the reliability of Sentinel's schedule and cost estimates is questionable. GAO's analyses of the Sentinel cost estimates and program officials' statements confirm this. For example, the analyses show that the estimates do not include all relevant costs, such as a technology refresh, and are not grounded in fully documented methodologies or a corporate history of experiences on other IT programs. FBI officials agreed that they need to update their IT program management handbook and related materials to incorporate schedule and cost estimating best practices and to establish a historical database of its estimating experiences on IT programs. Until FBI takes these steps, IT programs, such as Sentinel, are unlikely to have reliable schedule and cost estimates to support informed investment decision making, and their actual progress is unlikely to track closely to estimates."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In early 2005, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began its Sentinel  program, estimated to be a 6-year, $425 million program to replace and  expand both its failed Virtual Case File (VCF) project and its antiquated,  paper-based, legacy system for supporting mission-critical intelligence  analysis and investigative case management activities. One of the reasons  we and others have cited for VCF\u2019s failure was limited use of acquisition  management best practices. Because of the FBI\u2019s experience with VCF and  the importance of Sentinel to the bureau\u2019s mission operations, you  requested us to review the FBI\u2019s management of Sentinel.", "In response to your request, we agreed to perform a series of incremental  reviews to address a broad range of objectives. We initiated our work on  these reviews in August 2005 and released the first of our reports on  Sentinel in October 2006. This report provides the results of our second  review. As agreed, the two specific objectives for this report are to  determine the FBI\u2019s (1) use of effective practices for acquiring Sentinel  and (2) basis for reliably estimating Sentinel\u2019s schedule and costs. For the  first objective, we focused on contract solicitation and award, risk  management, organizational change management, configuration  management, and contractor tracking and oversight. In addressing both  objectives, we researched relevant best practices, reviewed FBI policies  and procedures, program plans and other program documents, and  interviewed appropriate program officials to ascertain whether the  practices had been defined and implemented. We conducted our work  from our Washington, D.C., headquarters and at FBI headquarters and  facilities in the greater Washington, D.C., metropolitan area between  September 2005 and May 2007 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

Approximately 12,000 special  agents and 16,000 analysts and mission support personnel are located in  the bureau\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters and in more than 70 offices in  the United States and in more than 50 offices in foreign countries. Mission  responsibilities at the bureau are divided among a number of major  organizational components, including:  Administration: manages the bureau\u2019s personnel programs, budgetary  and financial services, records, information resources, and information  security.", "National Security: integrates investigative and intelligence activities  against current and emerging national security threats and provides  information and analysis for the national security and law enforcement  communities.", "Criminal Investigations: investigates serious federal crimes and probes  federal statutory violations involving exploitation of the Internet and  computer systems.", "Law Enforcement: provides law enforcement information and forensic  services to federal, state, local, and international agencies.", "Office of the Chief Information Officer: develops the bureau\u2019s IT  strategic plan and operating budget and develops and maintains  technology assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Technology Is Instrumental to FBI Mission Operations", "paragraphs": ["To execute its mission responsibilities, the FBI relies extensively on the  use of information systems. In particular, the bureau operates and  maintains hundreds of computerized systems, databases, and applications,  such as  the Combined DNA Index System, which supports forensic  examinations;  the National Crime Information Center and the Integrated Automated  Fingerprint Identification System, which help state and local law  enforcement agencies identify criminals;  the Automated Case Management System, which manages information  collected on investigative cases;  the Investigative Data Warehouse, which aggregates data from  disparate databases in a standard format to facilitate content  management and data mining; and  the Terrorist Screening Database, which consolidates identification  information about known or suspected international and domestic  terrorists.", "Following the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001,  the FBI shifted its mission focus to detecting and preventing future attacks  and began to reorganize and transform. According to the bureau, the  complexity of this mission shift, along with the changing law enforcement  environment, strained its existing IT environment. As a result, the bureau  accelerated the IT modernization program that it had begun in September  2000. This program, later named Trilogy, was the FBI\u2019s largest IT initiative  to date and consisted of three parts: (1) the Information Presentation  Component to upgrade FBI\u2019s computer hardware and system software, (2)  the Transportation Network Component to upgrade the agency\u2019s  communication network, and (3) the User Application Component to  upgrade and consolidate the bureau\u2019s five key investigative software  applications. The heart of this last component became the Virtual Case  File (VCF) project, which was intended to replace the obsolete Automated  Case Support system, FBI\u2019s primary case management application.", "While the first two components of Trilogy experienced cost overruns and  schedule delays, in part because of fundamental changes to requirements,  both are currently operating. However, we recently reported that certain  information security controls over the Trilogy-related network were  ineffective in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of  information and information resources. For instance, we found that FBI  did not consistently (1) configure network devices and services securely  to prevent unauthorized insider access; (2) identify and authenticate users  to prevent unauthorized access; (3) enforce the principle of least privilege  to ensure that authorized access was necessary and appropriate; (4) apply  strong encryption techniques to protect sensitive data on its networks; (5)  log, audit, or monitor security-related events; (6) protect the physical  security of its network; and (7) patch key servers and workstations in a  timely manner. Taken collectively, we concluded that these weaknesses  place sensitive information transmitted on the network at increased risk of  unauthorized disclosure or modification and could result in a disruption of  service. Accordingly, we recommended that the FBI Director take several  steps to fully implement key activities of the bureau\u2019s information security  program for the network. These activities include updating assessments  and plans to reflect the bureau\u2019s current operating environment, providing  more comprehensive coverage of system tests, and correcting security  weaknesses in a timely manner.", "In commenting on this report, the FBI\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO)  concurred with many of our recommendations, but did not believe that the  bureau had placed sensitive information at an unacceptable risk for  unauthorized disclosure, modification, or insider threat exploitation. The  CIO cited significant strides in reducing risk since the Robert Hanssen  espionage investigation. In response, we stated that until weaknesses  identified in network devices and services, identification and  authentication, authorization, cryptography, audit and monitoring,  physical security, and patch management are addressed, increased risk to  FBI\u2019s critical network remains. Further, until the bureau fully and  effectively implements certain information security program activities for  the network, security controls will likely remain inadequate or  inconsistently applied.", "The third component of Trilogy\u2014VCF\u2014 never became fully operational.  In fact, the FBI terminated the project after Trilogy\u2019s overall costs grew  from $380 million to $537 million. VCF fell behind schedule and pilot  testing showed that completing it was infeasible and cost prohibitive.  Among reasons we and others have cited for VCF\u2019s failure were poorly  defined system requirements, ineffective requirements change control,  limited contractor oversight, and human capital shortfalls because of, for  example, no continuity in certain management positions and a lack of  trained staff for key program positions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sentinel: A Brief Description", "paragraphs": ["The Sentinel program began in 2005, and is intended to be both the  successor to and an expansion of VCF. In brief, Sentinel is to meet FBI\u2019s  pressing need for a modern, automated capability for investigative case  management and information sharing to help field agents and intelligence  analysts perform their jobs more effectively and efficiently. The program\u2019s  key objectives are to (1) successfully implement a system that acts as a  single point of entry for all investigative case management and that  provides paperless case management and workflow capabilities, (2)  facilitate a bureau-wide organizational change management program, and  (3) provide intuitive interfaces that feature data relevant to individual  users. Using commercially available software and hardware components,  Sentinel is to provide a range of investigative case management and  workflow capabilities, including  leads management and evidence management;    document and records management, indexed searching, and electronic  links to legacy FBI systems and external data sources;  training, statistical, and reporting tools; and    security management.", "The FBI chose to use a governmentwide acquisition contract (GWAC) for  Sentinel after conducting a multi-step evaluation of the different GWACs  available to federal agencies. In August 2005, the FBI issued a request for  vendor proposals to more than 40 eligible companies under a National  Institutes of Health (NIH) contracting vehicle. According to the CIO, the  request was also provided to more than 500 eligible subcontractors. For  the next 8 months, FBI\u2019s Sentinel Source Selection Evaluation Team  reviewed and evaluated vendors\u2019 responses to the task order request for  proposal to determine which proposal represented the best value.

According  to FBI officials, the FBI is conducting end user training for Phase 1 and  expects to roll out the Phase 1 production in June 2007. The specific  content of each phase is to be proposed by and negotiated with the prime  contractor. The general content of each phase has these and other  capabilities include  Phase 1: A Web-based portal that will provide a data access tool for the  Automated Case Management System and other legacy systems; a service- oriented architecture definition to support delivery and sharing of  common services across the bureau.", "Phase 2: Case document and records management capabilities, document  repositories, improved information assurance, application workflow, and  improved data labeling to enhance information sharing.", "Phase 3: Updated and enhanced system storage and search capabilities.", "Phase 4: Implementing the remaining components of the new case  management system to replace ACS.", "To manage the acquisition and deployment of Sentinel, the FBI established  a program management office within the CIO\u2019s office. The program office  is led by a program manager and consists of the eight primary FBI units  (see fig. 1). Overall, the FBI estimates that the four phases will cost about  $425 million through fiscal year 2011. For fiscal year 2005, the FBI  reprogrammed $97 million in appropriated funds from various sources to  fund Sentinel work. For fiscal years 2006 and 2007, the FBI said it  budgeted about $85 million and $138 million respectively, for Sentinel, of  which it reports having obligated about $95 million.

For example, two software engineering analyses of nearly 200 systems  acquisitions projects indicated that teams using systems acquisition best  practices produced cost savings of at least 11 percent over similar projects  conducted by teams that did not employ the kind of rigor and discipline  embedded in these practices. In addition, our research shows that best  practices are a significant factor in successful acquisition outcomes,  including increasing the likelihood that programs and projects will be  executed within cost and schedule estimates.", "We and others have identified and promoted the use of a number of best  practices associated with acquiring IT systems. In 2004, we reported on 18  relevant best practices and grouped them into two categories: (1) ten  practices for acquiring any type of business system and (2) eight  complementary practices that relate specifically to acquiring commercial  component-based business systems. Examples of these practices relevant  to any business systems acquisition include ensuring that (1) reasonable  planning for all parts of the acquisition occurs, (2) a clear understanding of  system requirements exists, and (3) risks are proactively identified and  systematically mitigated. Examples of best practices relevant to  commercial component-based systems acquisitions include ensuring that  (1) commercial product modification is effectively controlled, (2)  relationships among commercial products are understood before  acquisition decisions are made, and (3) the organizational impact of using  new system functionality is proactively managed.

Consistent with this, the FBI\u2019s  strategic plan contains explicit IT-related strategic goals, objectives, and  initiatives (near-term and long-term) to support the collection, analysis,  processing, and dissemination of information. This recognition is  important because, as we previously reported, the bureau\u2019s longstanding  approach to managing IT has not always been fully consistent with leading  practices. The effects of this can be seen in, for example, the failure of  projects such as VCF. To address these issues, the FBI has, as we reported  in 2004, centralized IT responsibility and authority under the CIO and the  CIO has taken steps to define and implement management capabilities in  the areas of enterprise architecture, IT investment management, systems  development and acquisition, and IT human capital.", "Since 2004, the FBI has continued to make progress in establishing key IT  management capabilities. As we previously reported, the FBI has created  a life cycle management directive that governs all phases and aspects of  the bureau\u2019s IT projects, including Sentinel. The directive includes  guidance, planned reviews, and control gates for each project milestone,  including planning, acquisition, development, testing, and operational  management of implemented systems.", "However, we have also reported that the challenge now for the FBI is to  build on these foundational capabilities and implement them effectively on  the program and project investments it has under way and planned,  including Sentinel. More specifically, we stated that the success of Sentinel  will depend on how well the FBI defines and implements its new IT  management approaches and capabilities. Among other things, we said  that it will be crucial for the FBI to understand and control Sentinel  requirements in the context of (1) its enterprise architecture, (2) the  capabilities and interoperability of commercially available products, and  (3) the bureau\u2019s human capital and financial resource constraints, and to  prepare users for the impact of the new system on how they do their jobs.  We concluded that not taking these steps will introduce program risks that  could lead to problems similar to those that contributed to the failure of  the VCF.", "In this regard, we recently reported on Sentinel\u2019s implementation of IT  human capital best practices. We determined that the FBI had moved  quickly to staff the Sentinel program office, had created a staffing plan that  defined program positions needed for the program, and had filled most of  them, primarily with contract staff. However, we also determined that the  Sentinel staffing plan addressed only the program office\u2019s immediate  staffing needs. It did not provide for the kind of strategic human capital  management focus that is essential to success. Exacerbating this situation  was that the FBI was not proactively managing Sentinel human capital  availability as a program risk. We concluded that, unless the FBI adopted a  more strategic approach to managing human capital for the Sentinel  program and treated human capital as a program risk, the chances of  delivering required intelligence and investigative support capabilities in a  timely and cost-effective manner were reduced. Accordingly, we  recommended that the FBI adopt such an approach, and the FBI agreed  with our recommendations. According to the FBI\u2019s CIO, Sentinel human  capital management improvements are being accomplished as part of  ongoing Office of the CIO\u2019s human capital management initiatives, which  are being pursued in close coordination with ongoing FBI-wide human  capital management improvements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FBI Is Largely Following Several Best Practices in Managing Key Aspects of Sentinel", "paragraphs": ["The FBI is managing various aspects of Sentinel in accordance with a  number of key system acquisition best practices because the FBI CIO and  Sentinel program manager have made doing so an area of focus, which  reduces Sentinel acquisition risks.

These  practices provide for establishing an organizational framework to conduct  a solicitation, including things such as establishing a solicitation policy,  defining roles and responsibilities, hiring a qualified solicitation team  (including designating responsibility for the selection of a vendor and  including contract specialists on the solicitation team). These practices  also include guidance on how to evaluate proposals, including things such  as: (1) explicitly evaluating systems integration contractors on their ability  to implement commercial IT components; (2) specifying the contractual  requirements and the proposal\u2019s evaluation criteria in the solicitation  package; (3) evaluating the technical and management elements of  proposals on the basis of how they satisfy the requirements of the  contract; and (4) selecting a contractor that is qualified to satisfy the  contract\u2019s requirements.", "The FBI followed all of these best practices for Sentinel. For instance, the  FBI developed a policy for conducting the solicitation\u2014the Sentinel  Source Selection Plan\u2014that addressed, among other things, the  qualifications for members of the source selection organization. The  source selection plan also identified the individual ultimately responsible  for conducting the solicitation and making the award decision.", "With regard to evaluating proposals, the Sentinel solicitation package  contained the contractual requirements and evaluation criteria the bureau  would use. Those criteria were designed to explicitly evaluate vendors on  their ability to integrate commercial IT products and components like  those to be used in Sentinel. In addition, FBI evaluated vendor proposals  based on both the technical and management elements of their respective  proposals, including elements like past performance, proposed technical  approach, proposed management approach, plans for mitigating  organizational conflict of interest, proposed security approach, and  demonstrated prior success in meeting schedule requirements, controlling  costs, and program planning. In addition, the FBI used a GWAC, in which  vendors\u2019 technical competence had already been already established, thus  helping to ensure that the FBI\u2019s selected vendor was qualified.

In brief, risk management is a process for identifying potential  acquisition problems and taking appropriate steps to avoid them. It  includes identifying risks and categorizing them based on estimated  impact, developing and executing risk mitigation strategies, and reporting  on progress in doing so. Risk management practices include, among other  things: (1) encouraging project-wide participation in the identification and  mitigation of risks; (2) defining and implementing a process for the  identification, analysis, and mitigation of acquisition risks; (3) examining  the status of identified risks in program milestone reviews; (4) establishing  a written policy for managing acquisition risk; and (5) designating  responsibility for acquisition risk management activities.", "FBI\u2019s approach for managing Sentinel\u2019s risks employs best practices. (See  table 3.) For instance, the Sentinel Risk Management Plan encourages all  project team members to identify and mitigate risks, and program officials  told us that an e-mail notification system has been implemented in which  team members use an e-mail template to forward perceived or newly  identified risks to program management. Furthermore, the Risk  Management Plan and the prime contractor\u2019s Risk and Opportunity  Management Plan establish mechanisms for analyzing and mitigating  identified risks. Under these plans, risk review boards (1) solicit input on  risks from employees, (2) approve specified risk mitigation plans for these  risks and assign the risks to their respective risk registers, and (3)  periodically review each risk within the register to monitor the  implementation of the mitigation plans. Further, these plans (as well as the  bureau\u2019s Life Cycle Management Directive) call for program control gate  and milestone reviews that include the status of identified risks, which our  analysis of gate and milestone documentation shows includes  consideration of risks. This is important because it gives FBI management  the opportunity to be apprised of the risks facing the program and what  program staff is doing to prevent these risks from occurring when  milestone decisions are made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FBI Is Beginning to Address Organizational Change and Impacts of Sentinel", "paragraphs": ["The FBI is beginning to plan for and position itself for the human capital  and business process changes that are embedded in the commercial off- the-shelf (COTS) software products that are to be used for Sentinel.

One category of best practices related to COTS  acquisitions is proactively planning for and positioning the organization  for the people and process changes that will occur as a result of adopting  the functionality embedded in commercial products. In short, such change  occurs because COTS products are created based on a set of requirements  that will have marketability to a broad customer base, rather than to a  single customer, which in this case is the FBI. While such products are  configurable to align with the customer\u2019s architectural needs, such as  business rules and date standards, the standard core functionality in the  products will require the implementing organization to adopt the product\u2019s  embedded business processes, which in turn will require changes to the  roles and responsibilities of the organization\u2019s workforce and the policies  and procedures that they follow.", "To ensure that the organizational impact of implementing a COTS-based  system is effectively managed, best practices advocate that (1) project  plans explicitly provide for preparing users for the impact that the  business processes embedded in the commercial components will have on  their roles and responsibilities and (2) the organization actively manages  the introduction and adoption of changes to how users will be expected to  execute their jobs.", "As noted earlier, Phase I of Sentinel does not involve extensive use of  COTS. Rather, Phase I largely involves development of a customized Web- based portal to the FBI\u2019s legacy case management system. Thus, the need  for the FBI to have already planned for and be positioned to introduce  significant Sentinel-induced organizational change is not expected to be as  critical as in later phases. According to the Sentinel program manager, the  impact on users in Phase 1 will be minimal due to the small scope of  changes that users will need to deal with. Phase 2, in comparison, will  introduce changes to individual users\u2019 roles, responsibilities, and business  practices resulting from re-engineered business processes and a range of  COTS-based system capabilities. This means that most of the  organizational change management activities for Sentinel are planned for  such later phases.", "Recognizing the relevance of organizational change management to post- Phase 1 efforts, the FBI has taken steps consistent with both of these  previously-cited best practices.

The results  of this analysis have been incorporated into their communication and  training plans and are to be addressed through things such as user  manuals and program documentation.

Among other things, we observed that the tool features a series  of access controls that permit only authorized changes to program  assets. For example, the tool did not allow unauthorized changes to  configuration items. The FBI and the prime contractor have established  configuration control boards, engineering review boards, and software  change control boards as specified in the plan to establish a baselined  configuration for Sentinel\u2019s assets and to authorize changes to them.  These boards work together (see fig. 2) to review suggested changes to  configuration items on the basis of potential impacts on the rest of the  system, including risk, cost, and schedule implications.

One such control that we observed includes the  automatic recording of who made a change to the software or  hardware asset and when the change was made. Nevertheless, the FBI  has tasked one of its support contractors with checking the status of  configuration items on a daily basis to augment the tool controls.  According to the contractor\u2019s representative performing this check, the  boards\u2019 configuration-related decisions are compared with the  configuration status reflected in the tool; deviations are to be reported  to program management.

Among other things, best  practices and related federal guidance call for a program schedule to be  program-wide in scope, meaning that it should include the integrated  breakdown of the work to be performed by both the government and its  contractors over the expected life of the program. Best practices also call  for the schedule to expressly identify and define the relationships and  dependencies among work elements and the constraints affecting the start  and completion of work elements.

By doing  so, dependencies among activities that collectively lead to the  accomplishment of events or milestones can be established and used as  a basis for guiding work and measuring progress.", "Establishing the duration of key activities: The schedule should  reflect how long each activity will take to execute. In determining the  duration of each activity, the same rationale, data, and assumptions  used for cost estimating should be used for schedule estimating.  Further, these durations should be as short as possible and they should  have specific start and end dates. Excessively long periods needed to  execute an activity should prompt further decomposition of the activity  so that shorter execution durations will result.", "Assigning resources to key activities: The schedule should reflect who  will do the work activities, whether all required resources will be  available when they are needed, and whether any funding or time  constraints exist.", "Establishing the critical path for key activities: The schedule should  identify the longest duration path through the sequenced list of key  activities, which is known as the schedule\u2019s critical path.

As a general  rule, the reserve should be applied to high risk activities, which are  typically found along the critical path.", "Integrating key activities horizontally and vertically: The schedule  should be horizontally integrated, meaning that it should link the  products and outcomes associated with already sequenced activities  (see previous section).

We have grouped these practices into  four characteristics of a high-quality and reliable cost estimate. They are    Comprehensive: The cost estimates should include both government  and contractor costs of the program over its full life cycle, from  inception of the program through design, development, deployment,  and operation and maintenance to retirement of the program. They  should also provide a level of detail appropriate to ensure that cost  elements are neither omitted nor double counted, and they should  document all cost-influencing ground rules and assumptions.", "Well-documented: The cost estimates should capture in writing such  things as the source data used and their significance, the calculations  performed and their results, and the rationale for choosing a particular  estimating method or reference. Moreover, this information should be  captured in such a way that the data used to derive the estimate can be  traced back to, and verified against their sources.", "Accurate: The cost estimates should provide for results that are  unbiased, and they should not be overly conservative or optimistic (i.e.,  should represent most likely costs). In addition, the estimates should  be updated regularly to reflect material changes in the program, and  steps should be taken to minimize mathematical mistakes and their  significance. Among other things, the estimate should be grounded in  documented assumptions and a historical record of cost and schedule  estimating and actual experiences on other comparable programs.", "Credible: The cost estimates should discuss any limitations in the  analysis performed due to uncertainty or biases surrounding data or  assumptions, and their derivation should provide for varying major  assumptions and recalculating outcomes based on sensitivity analyses,  and the associated risk and uncertainty inherent in estimates should be  disclosed. Further, the estimates should be verified based on cross- checks using other methods and by comparing the results with  independent cost estimates.", "The FBI\u2019s policies and procedures that govern estimating program costs  are defined in the bureau\u2019s IT Program Management Handbook, Cost- Benefit Analysis Guide, and IT Investment Management Process. To the  bureau\u2019s credit, these documents reflect some of the previously cited best  practices. For example, the handbook calls for cost estimates to be  comprehensive and to be life cycle in scope, including total costs (e.g.,  research, development, production, training, operations and maintenance,  software licensing, and labor) over its full life cycle (from initiation to  system retirement). Moreover, FBI guidance partially provides for  documenting these estimates and ensuring their accuracy by, for example,  stating that estimating assumptions should be documented and that the  estimates are to be updated on a regular basis.", "However, these policies and procedures do not reflect all of the cost  estimating best practices associated with well-documented, accurate, and  credible estimates. With respect to being well-documented, they do not  require that the sources of historical data used in the estimate be  documented and, with respect to accuracy, they do not provide for the  establishment and use of a historical database of estimating and actual  experiences on comparable programs. Without documenting estimated  data sources, the basis for the estimates, including the circumstances  surrounding the data used to derive and whether these data have been  properly normalized, cannot be understood. This means that the reliability  of the estimate for either current use in managing a program or for  inclusion in a historical database for use in future program estimates,  cannot be assured. Further, without provision for establishing and using a  historical database, one will not be available to inform future estimates, as  is the case for the FBI. With respect to credibility, the FBI\u2019s policies and  procedures do not address the need to consider and reflect any limitations  in the analyses on which the estimates are based, or to document any  uncertainty or biases surrounding the data used. As a result, the associated  uncertainty in the estimate itself cannot be determined, thus limiting the  estimate\u2019s integrity and utility. Further, the FBI\u2019s policies and procedures  do not provide for the conduct of risk/sensitivity analyses and disclosure  of the associated risk and uncertainty of the estimates. Thus, estimates  will not include important information to inform program decision  making, such as the range of potential costs surrounding the point  estimate and the reasons behind this range.", "FBI Office of the CIO officials agreed that these practices are not included  in the bureau\u2019s policies and procedures that form the basis for IT program  cost estimates and that they need to be. Until an effective basis for cost  estimating is in place and employed, FBI IT programs, like Sentinel, will  likely not have reliable cost estimates to properly inform investment  decision making and the risk of actual program cost performance not  tracking closely to estimates will be increased.", "Our analysis of Sentinel cost estimates revealed reliability issues. In  particular, none of the estimates are comprehensive in that they each omit  relevant costs. For example, one estimate does not include government or  support contractor costs and, according to program officials, another  estimate does not include technology refresh, certain government labor  costs, or inflationary costs. In addition, these estimates cannot be  considered fully accurate or well documented. For example, according to  program officials, none of the estimates was derived using a historical  database reflecting actual and estimated costs on similar programs.  Further, none of the estimates had a fully documented estimating  methodology, although some parts of one cost estimate were documented.  Also, none of the estimates could be traced to the source of the data that  were used in developing them. These reliability concerns with the Sentinel  cost estimates are due in part to the FBI\u2019s not following its own cost  estimating policies and procedures and in part to the previously  mentioned limitations in the FBI\u2019s cost estimating policies, procedures,  and supporting tools.

While  implementing such practices does not guarantee program success, doing  so will minimize the program\u2019s exposure to risk and thus the extent to  which the program falls short of expectations. In the case of Sentinel,  living up to expectations is critical because not only are the capabilities  that Sentinel is to provide mission critical, they are long overdue and thus  time is of the essence.", "To the FBI\u2019s credit, it has implemented a number of best practices for  Sentinel and by doing so has placed itself on a path to both avoid the kind  of missteps that led to the failure of VCF and increase the chances of  putting needed mission capabilities in the hands of bureau agents and  analysts as soon as possible. Nevertheless, the FBI is still not where it  needs to be in managing its program office support contracts and in having  reliable estimates of Sentinel schedules and costs to manage and disclose  progress and to inform bureau, Department of Justice, and congressional  investment decision making. As a result, there is a risk that contractor- provided program management support will not be performed effectively  and efficiently. Given that Sentinel\u2019s program office relies extensively on  such contractor support to execute its many program management  functions, less than high quality support contractor performance could  adversely affect Sentinel\u2019s success. Risks also exist relative to having a  reliable basis for informed decisions about Sentinel\u2019s investment options  because bureau policies, procedures, and tools that form the basis for  Sentinel schedule and cost estimates do not reflect important best  practices. Moreover, the cost estimates that the FBI has developed to date  for Sentinel reflect these limitations.
