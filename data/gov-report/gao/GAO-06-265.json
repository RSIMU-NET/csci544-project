The U.S. Department of Education oversees the program, which received nearly $15 million in fiscal year 2004.

Over 80 percent of Troops teachers are male and over 25 percent are African American--characteristics that differ from the new teacher population overall. However, participation has recently decreased and hiring has been geographically concentrated. The majority of the program's teachers hired from school years 2001-2002 through 2004-2005 were employed in seven states. Most teachers receiving financial assistance through the program between the enactment of NCLBA and June 30, 2005, were placed in districts designated as high-need on the basis of serving children who qualify for federal assistance. About 90 percent of these funded participants continued teaching in high-need districts during their second year, and over 75 percent of the original group taught in high-need districts for a third year. About one-third of Troops hired during this period reported teaching in the priority areas of math, science, special education, or vocational education. Education has taken some steps to improve program management, but has not effectively coordinated resources with another teacher recruitment program also targeting military personnel. While Education has developed a draft work plan for Troops-to-Teachers and improved the definition of a high-need district for eligibility purposes, it has not assessed the data it uses to make high-need school determinations. Further, it disbanded a teacher policy group that once provided a forum for department managers to discuss recruitment and retention initiatives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Approximately 3 million teachers work in public and private elementary  and secondary schools across the country, but school districts still face  difficulty recruiting and retaining highly qualified teaching professionals.  In 1992, when the shortage of math and science teachers was increasing  and the military forces were undergoing a significant reduction in  personnel, Congress authorized the Department of Defense (DOD) to  oversee a new national Troops-to-Teachers program designed to help  separated members of the military obtain their teaching credentials and  teach in school districts with large low-income populations and a shortage  of teachers in priority subject areas, such as math and science. Since  Troops-to-Teachers\u2019 inception, more than 8,400 program participants  reported that they were hired as elementary and secondary school  teachers, with about half of those entering the profession since 2002.", "Funding for the Troops-to-Teachers program has varied over time. In fiscal  year 2003, the program received a $29 million appropriation, while more  recently, in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the appropriation held steady at  nearly $15 million. Each year, some funds obligated to Troops-to-Teachers  are used to provide direct financial assistance in the form of stipends and  bonuses to attract and retain participants. Dollars not allocated toward  financial assistance fund (1) the centralized administration of the program  by personnel in the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education  Support (DANTES)\u2014a DOD unit that operates the program and provides  members of the military with services, such as education-related  counseling and distance learning courses\u2014and (2) the local counseling  and placement assistance that Troops-to-Teachers\u2019 state placement  assistance offices provide.", "In 1999, Congress reauthorized the Troops-to-Teachers program and  transferred program oversight from DOD to the Department of Education  (Education), effective in 2000. Through a memorandum of agreement  between DOD and Education, DANTES continues daily program  administration\u2014registering individuals, identifying high-need schools and  districts, and making determinations about who qualifies for bonuses and  stipends\u2014while Education, rather than DOD, has responsibility for  program oversight and management. In that same year, Congress  mandated that GAO conduct an assessment of the program\u2019s  accomplishments from fiscal years 1994 through 2000. We concluded that  the main focus of the program had shifted from an outplacement resource  for separated military personnel to a recruitment tool to address teacher  shortages. The report also concluded that opportunities existed for  Education to integrate the program into its overall teacher recruitment  and retention initiatives, which included efforts to assist both civilian and  military mid-career professionals become teachers. The 2002 enactment of  the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) reauthorized the program and its  funding through 2007, increased the total amount that could be spent on  state placement assistance services, and mandated a second GAO report.  To address the NCLBA mandate, this report answers the following  questions:  1. What are the number and characteristics of program participants, and  what factors affect participation?  2. To what extent have participants been recruited and retained to teach in  high-need districts and priority subject areas?  3. What steps has Education taken to facilitate program management?", "To conduct our work, we analyzed data that DANTES maintains on all  individuals who have registered for the program, focusing specifically on  those who have received funding between the enactment of NCLBA on  January 8, 2002, and June 30, 2005, which marks the end of the 2004-2005  school year. For this population, we analyzed demographic and financial  assistance data, as well as information on the schools and subject areas in  which the teachers became employed. To assess the reliability of school  placement data, we matched the data DANTES provided to data from  Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics\u2019 Common Core of  Data, which includes district and school-level information on free and  reduced price meal eligibility, and the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Small Area  Income and Poverty Estimates program, which includes district-level  information on poverty. In addition, of the 30 funded Troops-to-Teachers  placement assistance offices, we contacted personnel from 7 to obtain the  perspectives of those helping both large and small numbers of troops find  employment through the program. We also interviewed Education officials  to discuss their management of the program and to assess program  practices against GAO standards for internal controls, which establish a  framework for effective agency operations. Further, we interviewed  officials at DANTES and reviewed the results from a recent survey of  program participants conducted by the National Center for Education  Information\u2014a private, non-partisan research organization specializing in  survey research and data analysis. We also spoke with several researchers  in the field of teacher recruitment, preparation, and professional  development, and reviewed related reports on these topics. We assessed  the reliability of all data elements used in the report and determined that  the data were sufficient and reliable for the purposes of our study. We  conducted our work between May 2005 and January 2006 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Based on Education  data, 46 states reported implementing alternative routes to certification,  and about 35,000 individuals each year obtain their teaching credentials  through alternative programs. According to Education, many alternative  certification programs are designed to recruit teachers into shortage areas  such as math, science, and special education or to increase gender and  ethnic diversity in the teaching workforce.", "The Troops-to-Teachers program facilitates the entry of former military  personnel into the teaching profession by assessing their academic history  and professional skills and by counseling individuals toward appropriate  programs to obtain certification.", "Members and former members of the armed forces are generally eligible to  participate in Troops-to-Teachers if they have a baccalaureate or advanced  degree and meet any of the following four requirements:    They are retired from active or reserve service.

In addition, program participants must agree to accept full-time  employment as a teacher for at least 3 years with a high-need school  district or public charter school. NCLBA further requires that in selecting  eligible members of the armed forces to receive assistance under the  program, priority is to be given to members who have educational or  military experience in science, mathematics, special education, or  vocational or technical subjects, and agree to seek employment as science,  mathematics, special education, or vocational education teachers.", "Participants in the program may receive stipends of not more than $5,000  to help defray the cost of enrollment in a teaching certification program if  they agree to teach in high-need school districts, defined as those in which  there are specific numbers or percentages of children from families with  incomes below the poverty line, or public charter schools. Participants  may instead receive bonuses of $10,000 if they agree to teach in high-need  schools\u2014defined as those in which the student population meets certain  low-income eligibility criteria or in which large percentages of students  have disabilities\u2014that are also located in high-need districts. As further  clarified by Education in a recent final rule, participants initially receiving  a stipend who agree to teach for at least 3 years in a high-need school  within a high-need school district or a public charter school can receive a  total payment of $10,000 less their stipend payments. Reimbursement  generally is required of the participant under certain circumstances, such  as failing to obtain certification, to become a highly qualified teacher, or to  obtain employment. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for stipends  and bonuses are ineligible for financial assistance, but can still receive  counseling and referral services through the program. Table 1 illustrates  the terms of the financial assistance available.", "DANTES administers the Troops-to-Teachers program, working with 30  state placement assistance offices, 6 of which are considered regional  offices because they provide coverage for neighboring states in which  there are no designated Troops-to-Teachers personnel. Each state office is  responsible for recruiting participants through advertisements and face-to- face encounters, assessing participants\u2019 academic transcripts, guiding  them toward the appropriate state certification programs, and providing  placement assistance to direct them to high-need schools or districts and  priority subject areas. According to the program\u2019s authorizing statute, no  more than $5 million per year can be used to establish and maintain these  placement assistance offices, and grants to states for these placement  offices are made at the Secretary of Education\u2019s discretion.", "As figure 1 illustrates, many legislative changes made to the Troops-to- Teachers program have affected both the program\u2019s administration and  the identification of schools and districts in which employment makes  servicemembers eligible to receive financial assistance.", "With regard to eligibility for financial assistance, the type of school in  which a participant is statutorily required to teach has changed  significantly since the program started. Prior to NCLBA\u2019s reauthorization  of the program, participants were required to teach in a district receiving  Title I funds in order to receive a stipend. Under current requirements,  participants can receive a stipend for teaching in a high-need district or  public charter school and can receive a bonus for teaching in a high-need  school. The definition of a high-need school that was established in the  National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000 included a school  that had a dropout rate exceeding the national average or that had a large  percentage of students speaking English as a second language; however,  this definition has changed. Table 2 illustrates the current definitions for  both a high-need school and a high-need district. The table also  incorporates Education\u2019s recent clarification on the definition of a high- need district, which became effective through a final rule in September  2005.", "With regard to program administration, legislative shifts have prompted  changes in oversight. DANTES has maintained daily administration of the  program since its inception, but when the statute shifted program  oversight to Education, a memorandum of agreement was needed to  outline the relationship between DANTES, DOD, and Education.  According to the current agreement, which was signed in February 2004,  DANTES\u2019 fiscal and administrative responsibilities\u2014such as facilitating  recruitment activities, selecting participants, managing program  participant files, and overseeing state placement assistance offices\u2014 remained intact, but DANTES\u2019 personnel were also expected to provide  Education with an annual performance report, an itemized financial  report, and a program report on key participant characteristics.", "According to the agreement, DOD has the following responsibilities:    Transfer funds from Education to DANTES for the administration of  the program.", "Assign responsibility for the administration and management of the  program to DANTES.", "Provide information about the program to military personnel as part of  its pre-separation counseling.", "While, among other responsibilities, Education is now expected to:    Transfer the congressionally appropriated funds to DOD.

Monitor on an annual basis the implementation of all activities carried  out by the program through review and approval of annual budget  plans, compliance reviews, audits, and site visits.", "Monitor the expenditure of available funds during any fiscal year and  assure that no more than 10 percent of these funds is used for  administrative infrastructure.", "Provide support and technical assistance.    Provide legal and policy advice on programmatic issues arising under  the authorizing legislation.", "Aside from overseeing Troops-to-Teachers, Education engages in several  additional activities to encourage teacher recruitment in high-need areas.  For example, the department provides funding to forgive the student loans  of highly qualified math, science, and special education teachers serving in  low-income communities. Education also provides states with recruitment  grants to help reduce shortages of qualified teachers in high-need districts  through scholarships and support services.

State placement personnel  said that the high demand for troops to support the conflicts in Iraq and  Afghanistan has resulted in decreased Troops-to-Teachers program  registrations. Further, personnel in some offices noted that DOD\u2019s stop  loss policy has reduced the volume of calls and inquiries. These  individuals also speculated that Education\u2019s recent rule, which was  implemented in September 2005, and changed the criteria for receipt of  bonuses, would further reduce the number of participants. According to  these officials, the projected decrease in registrations would result  because potential applicants would no longer be able to attain the needed  financial assistance if the schools most appealing to them did not meet the  new criteria specified in the rule. However, others reported that  registrants typically lacked information about school eligibility at the time  of their application. As we will discuss later in the report, due to several  data limitations, the effect of the rule on the number of qualifying schools  and districts cannot be precisely determined.", "In addition, some officials noted that barriers to entering the teaching  profession, such as difficulty identifying and enrolling in a flexible and  convenient teacher certification program, could limit participation, but  they expressed the opinion that as these programs became more  prevalent, teacher credentialing could accelerate and more individuals  would consider the profession to be a viable option. According to a 2005  survey of nearly 1,500 Troops-to-Teachers participants, 58 percent of  respondents received their teaching credentials through traditional,  campus-based teacher education programs\u2014either at the undergraduate  or graduate level\u201440 percent of respondents took an alternative  certification route to receive the same credential, and the remaining  respondents were unsure how to characterize their programs.", "At the individual level, motivational factors also were reported as  influencing participation. According to the 2005 survey, nearly 60 percent  of respondents said they would not have become a teacher if the Troops- to-Teachers program had not been available, and more than 60 percent of  respondents said they decided to become teachers because of their desire  to work with young people. The state placement personnel we interviewed  made comments that reflected this, with officials from three of the seven  offices specifically noting troops\u2019 interests in working with young people,  and officials from five offices mentioning that troops often have  experience coaching and mentoring younger and newer recruits.  Additionally, personnel from all seven of the placement assistance offices  we interviewed characterized troops entering the classroom as mature,  experienced in working with diverse socio-economic groups, professional,  and adaptable.

Officials from DANTES and the  placement offices said that troops tend to seek employment close to a  military base because of the services provided there, such as medical,  career counseling, and commissary services. States with a larger number  of military bases also had a larger number of Troops participants hired in  their schools.", "The majority of states (34) hired fewer than 50 program teachers between  July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2005\u2014accounting for 15 percent of hires during  this period\u2014but placement offices serving these states accounted for a  significant proportion of placement office funds (24 percent or $1.1 million  of $4.6 million). Given the hiring variation across the country, DANTES  compiles a report card to assess efficiencies in the 30 funded placement  assistance offices.

Since a district\u2019s designation as high-need depends, in some cases, on the  designation of schools within that district as high-need, and the number of  schools nationwide designated as high-need is unknown, any discussion of  how the rule change would affect qualifying districts depends on certain  assumptions. If we assume that all districts with a poverty rate from 10 to  20 percent contain a high-need school to which all funded teachers have  been assigned, then the percentage of districts qualifying would drop from  66 to 61. However, if none of these districts contains a high-need school,  then the percentage of qualifying districts drops from 66 to 24.", "Although Education better defined high-need districts, it has not assessed  the data it uses to make high-need school determinations. Based on the  statute, DANTES has defined a high-need school as having either 50  percent of more of its student population eligible to receive free and  reduced-price lunches or \u201clarge percentages of children receiving special  education services under IDEA.\u201d However, unlike the criterion related to  lunches, which states a specific qualifying percent that can be assessed  using Education data sources, the statute does not make clear what  constitutes a \u201clarge percentage\u201d of students served under IDEA. In  addition, the department does not have a basis for calculating IDEA  information at the school-house level because its own Common Core of  Data has that information only for districts.", "According to DANTES\u2019 records, in an attempt to operationalize the  definition of a high-need school, the department provided verbal guidance  on or before February 15, 2002, on this issue, specifying that DANTES  should use an eligibility threshold of 11 percent, which it characterized as  the national average. However, no one at the department we spoke with  was familiar with the origins of this guidance, and according to our review  of Education\u2019s data, the percentage of students receiving services under  IDEA across the nation was actually 13 percent in 2001 and 14 percent in  2002 and 2003. By our analysis, three-quarters of districts nationwide  have 11 percent or more of their student population receiving IDEA  services\u2014indicating that the threshold the department established to  define a \u201clarge percentage\u201d may not result in a very targeted universe of  schools.  In commenting on a draft of this report, Education officials noted  that in November 2005, they provided DANTES with the latest national  data on the percentage of students served under IDEA\u201413.8 percent.   According to Education, DANTES will use this figure when making  determinations for the upcoming school year.", "Because Education does not collect IDEA information at the school-house  level, it is not possible to determine the concentration of students  receiving services under IDEA in individual schools, and DANTES must  use alternative data sources to determine if schools meet the IDEA  criterion. Specifically, DANTES currently relies on a database operated by  Standard and Poor\u2019s that presents the percentage of students receiving  services under IDEA for some schools in certain states. If information on  the schools where participants are working or applying is omitted from the  database, DANTES then has to call the schools to make determinations on  a case by case basis. Table 4 illustrates the different sources DANTES  must use to determine if schools and districts meet the criteria necessary  for designation as high-need.", "Education officials noted the difficulty of amassing the various data  needed for DANTES to adhere to the definition of high-need schools, and  cited this as a reason for not developing a centralized database of  information. However, according to Education officials, the department  had not assessed the reliability of the steps DANTES currently uses to  make high-need school determinations. Without a thorough review of the  validity of available data, the department is unable to determine (1) if  DANTES is applying the existing eligibility criteria appropriately, and (2) if  the eligibility thresholds, particularly with regard to IDEA, reflect current  conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Lacks Controls to Ensure Effective Allocation of Program Funds and Timely Execution of Its Management Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Education has not effectively implemented some of the controls necessary  to ensure that the program is efficiently achieving its objectives. GAO\u2019s  standards for agencies\u2019 internal control activities note the importance of  qualified and continuous supervision, overall workforce continuity  planning, and regular review of performance reports, budgets, and trends  to ensure effective agency operations. Since 2001, Education has had four  different individuals responsible for the Troops-to-Teachers program.  Further, while one former manager had drafted a preliminary work plan,  which included developing an evaluation plan and working with DANTES  to develop performance measures, officials acknowledged that they had  not focused on implementing the steps, and said that the current work  plan needed improvement. When we established that no timeline was in  place to implement the existing plan, officials responded that they would  finalize a revised plan and implement it by February 2006. Officials added  that while Troops-to-Teachers is included in Education\u2019s annual  performance report, they are also working on alternative outcome  measures that better assess the quality of teachers recruited through the  program.", "In addition, Education lacks the necessary controls to ensure that the  program is spending its funding not only within the parameters established  by the statute and the memorandum of agreement, but also in an efficient  and productive way. The statute caps annual grants that can be made to  states for Troops-to-Teachers\u2019 placement office operations at $5 million  and the memorandum caps expenses associated with administrative  infrastructure, such as DANTES\u2019 spending on database management or  personnel, at 10 percent of the total available funds. While Education  officials check to ensure that the program does not exceed its caps, they  neither review how DANTES spends its budget nor do they monitor the  spending patterns of placement assistance offices. As noted earlier, 13 of  the 30 funded placement offices received low scores of either \u201cC\u201d or \u201cD\u201d  but department officials told us they have not determined if the cost per  hire ratios, which drive the grades DANTES assigns, are appropriate  measures of state offices\u2019 performance. As a result, the department is not  positioned to comment on the dispersion of these grades or to take action  to address poor performing offices. Specifically, without assessing these  measures or alternative performance data, Education cannot determine  whether state offices should be closed or consolidated to improve  program efficiency. Additionally, our analysis of the program\u2019s overall  expenditures for fiscal year 2002 showed that about 60 percent was  allotted to financial assistance and 40 percent of funds supported  operational or administrative expenses in the central office and placement  offices. For fiscal year 2004, to date, the amount expended on financial  assistance has been just over 50 percent of the program\u2019s total  expenditures. Without a thorough review of these spending patterns, the  department\u2019s ability to take action when spending approaches the caps  may be limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Has Not Made Efforts to Coordinate Program Administration with Other Federal Teacher Development Activities", "paragraphs": ["Education operates another teacher recruitment and retention program\u2014 the Transition to Teaching program\u2014that overlaps somewhat with the  mission of Troops-to-Teachers. Both programs recruit mid-career  professionals to teach in high-need schools and in subjects such as math  and science, for which qualified teachers are in short supply. Both  programs target career changers and Transition to Teaching funds are also  used to recruit from the military population. However, as illustrated in  table 5, Transition to Teaching is distinct from Troops-to-Teachers in that  it provides grants directly to organizations, such as universities or county  offices of education, that operate teacher certification programs.", "We found that 12 of the 123 grants (approximately 10 percent) made  through the Transition to Teaching program from the 2002 and 2004 award  years funded programs that specifically targeted military personnel. For  example, several universities receiving Transition to Teaching grants  recruit from the retired military population and operate programs that  provide mentoring services to assist with their retention and development.  The remaining Transition to Teaching grantees generally focus their  recruitment on career changers from a wide variety of professions,  although they too may provide mentoring and ongoing support for new  teacher candidates.", "Despite the similarities in the mission of Transition to Teaching and  Troops-to-Teachers, and the fact that they are administered by the same  office within Education, we found minimal coordination between the  programs. Although Education officials said that department personnel  from both programs attend the same conferences and share ideas, there  was little evidence of resource coordination beyond discussions of how  the programs related. Additionally, officials noted that a teacher policy  group had previously existed within the department so that managers  could meet regularly to discuss the teacher-related programs they  oversaw. Though department officials told us that the group had  disbanded, they noted it would be a useful tool to facilitate ongoing  collaboration.", "Differences in data collection and monitoring strategies exist that may  further limit the coordination of these programs. For example, DANTES  collects participation data on the Troops-to-Teachers program. For the  Transition to Teaching program, however, Education merely lists grant  recipients and summarizes their programs. Additionally, Education  collects very little data to assess grant recipients\u2019 program outcomes.  According to Education\u2019s performance report on Transition to Teaching,  grantees use different methods for reporting data to the department.  Further, the department does not have any summary information on the  program\u2019s outcomes over time, but agency officials told us they have  contracted with an independent research group to evaluate performance  for a sample of 2002 grant recipients. Because Education does not know  the demographic characteristics of the individuals who benefit from the  Transition to Teaching program, the department cannot determine the  extent to which the two programs complement and coordinate with one  another to move former military personnel into teaching positions.", "Education officials told us that they believe statutory barriers would  prevent the consolidation of Troops-to-Teachers with the other programs  like Transition to Teaching.

However, without thoroughly  reviewing the data sources that DANTES uses to designate schools as  high-need, Education cannot ensure that DANTES is (1) making accurate  decisions about which schools meet the criteria and (2) placing new  teachers in these high-need schools. Further, without providing updated  guidance on eligibility thresholds for students served under IDEA,  Education cannot ensure that the criteria currently used reflect schools\u2019  changing conditions.", "Education, which has overseen the program since 2000, has taken some  steps to manage the program, but it only recently established a timeline to  finalize and implement a draft work plan. As of December 2005, however,  it remained unclear whether or not this plan would include a formal  mechanism, such as a joint work group, to coordinate with a similar  program also administered by the department\u2014the Transition to Teaching  program. Without more detailed coordination strategies, Education may  be missing an important opportunity to leverage its resources and develop  an effective campaign to recruit and retain mid-career professionals in  high-need schools.", "Finally, although the program\u2019s operating budget is relatively small,  without stronger controls in place to determine if program spending levels  are appropriate, the department cannot ensure that placement offices are  efficiently serving both eligible participants and the children in the  neediest schools and districts. Thus, while the program is spending within  its caps, because the department does not review how placement offices  manage their funds, it is unable to identify those offices that are working  well, determine ways in which consolidation may be wise, and justify the  continued investment of federal dollars. In addition, without leveraging the  efficiencies of placement offices that operate with low costs per hire, and  considering the closure or consolidation of less efficient offices, the  department may be unable to reduce the program\u2019s operating costs and  free additional funds for financial assistance, should the number of  program registrants rise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making three recommendations to further improve Education\u2019s  oversight of the Troops-to-Teachers program.", "To assist with the identification of eligible high-need schools and to  help direct participants to them, the Secretary of Education should  assess the reliability of the data DANTES uses to determine a \u201clarge  percentage\u201d of students served under IDEA and periodically review  existing guidance to ensure that the eligibility threshold related to the  IDEA criterion reflects the changing conditions in schools.", "To better link programs that serve the military population and that  relate to teacher recruitment and retention overall, the Secretary of  Education should consider reconvening teacher policy groups or  otherwise developing a plan to coordinate the use of existing  departmental resources and staff assigned to monitor similar programs.", "To better exercise its discretion for grant-making to state placement  offices and to ensure that budgets are created to reflect success in  facilitating teacher placement, the Secretary of Education should  consider data that DANTES collects on placement offices\u2019 cost per hire  ratios, or develop other measures of efficiency, and take action when  offices are deemed ineffective at helping participants find employment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education and DOD for their review  and comment.
