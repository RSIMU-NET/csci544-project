As part of its audit of the 2009 financial statements of the Deposit Insurance Fund and the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation Resolution Fund administrated by FDIC, GAO assessed (1) the effectiveness of FDIC's controls in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its financial systems and information and (2) the progress FDIC has made in mitigating previously reported information security weaknesses. To perform the audit, GAO examined security policies, procedures, reports, and other documents; tested controls over key financial applications; and interviewed key FDIC personnel."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FDIC did not sufficiently implement access and other controls intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its financial systems and information. For example, it did not always (1) sufficiently restrict user access to systems, (2) ensure strong system boundaries, (3) consistently enforce strong controls for identifying and authenticating users, (5) encrypt sensitive information, or (4) audit and monitor security-relevant events. In addition, FDIC did not have policies, procedures, and controls in place to ensure the appropriate segregation of incompatible duties, adequately manage the configuration of its financial information systems, and update contingency plans. A key reason for these weaknesses is that FDIC did not always fully implement key information security program activities such as effectively developing, documenting, and implementing security policies, and implementing an effective continuous monitoring program. Until these weaknesses and program deficiencies are corrected, the corporation will not have sufficient assurance that its financial information and assets are adequately safeguarded from inadvertent or deliberate misuse, fraudulent use, improper disclosure, or destruction. Despite the newly identified weaknesses, FDIC has mitigated each of the information security weaknesses previously reported by GAO. To its credit, the corporation has made improvements to its configuration management controls and aspects of its security management. For example, it maintained a full and complete requirements baseline for two systems and included key information in a remedial action plan. Nevertheless, GAO concluded that weaknesses in information security controls constituted a significant deficiency in internal controls over the information systems and data used for financial reporting. Until FDIC corrects the security weaknesses identified during this year's audit, it will face an elevated risk of the misuse of federal assets, unauthorized modification or destruction of financial information, inappropriate disclosure of other sensitive information, and disruption of critical operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that FDIC improve key information activities to enhance the corporation's information security program.

These objectives were integral  to supporting our opinion on FDIC\u2019s internal controls provided in  conjunction with our integrated audit of the financial statements of the  two funds administrated by FDIC, by assessing the controls over systems  that support financial management and the generation of financial  statements for two FDIC funds.", "To determine whether controls over key financial systems were effective,  we tested the effectiveness of information security and information  technology-based internal controls. We concentrated our evaluation  primarily on the controls for financial applications and enterprise database  applications associated with a corporatewide system that functions as a  unified set of financial and payroll systems that are managed together and  operated in an integrated fashion; a system to calculate and collect FDIC  deposit insurance premiums and Financing Corporation bond principal  and interest amounts from insured financial institutions; a Web-based  application that provides full functionality to support franchise marketing,  asset marketing, and asset management; a system to request access to and  receive permission for the computer applications and resources available  to its employees, contractors, and other authorized personnel; a primary  receivership and subsidiary financial processing and reporting system; and  the general support systems. Our selection of the systems was based on  discussions with our stakeholders.", "Our evaluation was based on our Federal Information System Controls  Audit Manual, which contains guidance for reviewing information system  controls that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of  computerized information.", "Using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards  and guidance and FDIC\u2019s policies, procedures, practices, and standards,  we evaluated controls by  observing methods for providing secure data transmissions across the  network to determine whether sensitive data were being encryptedtesting and observing physical access controls to determine if computer  tage,  facilities and resources were being protected from espionage, sabo damage, and theft;  evaluating the control configurations of selected servers and database  management systems; inspecting key servers and workstations to determine whether critical  patches had been installed or were up-to-date; and examining access responsibilities to determine whether incompatible  functions were segregated among different individuals.", "Using the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA), which establishes key elements for an effective agencywide  information security program, we evaluated FDIC\u2019s implementation of its  security program by  reviewing FDIC\u2019s risk assessment process and risk assessments for key  FDIC systems that support the preparation of financial statements to  determine whether risks and threats were documented consistent with  federal guidance; analyzing FDIC\u2019s policies, procedures, practices, and standards to  determine their effectiveness in providing guidance to personnel  responsible for securing information and information systems;    analyzing security plans to determine if management, operational, and  technical controls were in place or planned and that security plans were  updated;  examining training records for personnel with significant security  responsibilities to determine if they had received training commensurat with those responsibilities; analyzing configuration management plans and procedures to determine if  configurations were being m anaged appropriately;  analyzing security testing and evaluation results for four key FDIC system to determine whether management, operational, and technical controls  were tested at least annually and based on risk;    examining remedial action plans to determine whether they addressed  vulnerabilities identified in FDIC\u2019s security testing and evaluations; a  examining contingency plans for four key FDIC systems to determine  whether those plans had been tested or updated.", "We also discussed with key security representatives and management  officials whether information security controls were in place, adequate designed, and operating  effectively.", "To determine the status of FDIC\u2019s actions to correct or mitigate previou reported information security weaknesses, we identified and reviewed its  information security policies, procedures, and guidance.
