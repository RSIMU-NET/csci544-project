When the study showed that the lights did not influence drivers\u2019 speed or other behavior in construction zones, the state stopped requiring the lights. The Department estimated that this change would save more than $4 million annually without affecting safety. The Indiana Department of Transportation also benefited from its research programs. Its maintenance engineers, in cooperation with university researchers, developed a computer-aided system for planning efficient routes to remove snow and ice. The Department, which is responsible for more than 30,000 lane-miles of roadway, expected that this system would enable it to eliminate about 120 snow removal routes and save between $86,000 and $120,000 per year for each eliminated route."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ISTEA Provided New Direction and Funding for Surface Transportation Research", "paragraphs": ["The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) expressed the need for a new direction in surface transportation research, finding that despite an annual federal expenditure of more than $10 billion on surface transportation and its infrastructure, the federal government lacked two key components for an effective surface transportation research program: (1) a clear vision of the role of federally funded surface transportation research and (2) an integrated framework for the fragmented surface transportation research programs dispersed throughout the government.", "In response to these concerns, ISTEA established a framework for changing surface transportation research.

According to the Transportation Research Board, the private sector\u2019s highway research is sponsored by national associations representing industry and the engineering professions or by companies that design and construct highways and supply highway-related products. According to a federal research official, the private sector has few incentives to conduct highway research because its main service\u2014constructing highways and bridges\u2014occurs in a contracting environment in which payment for completing services is based more on adhering to rigid design standards than on finding innovative means of building better highways. The private sector\u2019s rail research is supported through the Association of American Railroads, whose researchers confirmed that they focus on applied research that is targeted to improving safety and building better equipment. For example, the association is coordinating research on the effects of 125-ton cars on conventional track structures. In addition, when the private sector conducts research, it often does not share its results with the research community because its findings are proprietary.

Government and university officials and other transportation experts told us that having separate modal agencies with their own constituencies works against a strategic approach. Each modal agency handles its budget independently and responds to its own constituency. This modal structure makes it difficult for DOT to develop a surface transportation system mission; accommodate the need for types of research\u2014such as intermodal and systems assessment research\u2014that do not have a modal focus; identify and coordinate research that cuts across modes; and evaluate research. Evaluation is particularly difficult because DOT has no single database that provides complete information on its research programs and projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT Has No Focal Point for Surface Transportation Research", "paragraphs": ["A March 1996 study by the Transportation Research Board stated that when DOT was created, the intent was to have an Assistant Secretary for Research and Development, analogous to the Director of Defense Research and Engineering in the Department of Defense (DOD). Such a position was established when DOT was first created but was abandoned in the late 1970s with the formation of RSPA. DOT attempted to reorganize and consolidate its research program in fiscal year 1996, when it proposed, in its budget submission, to consolidate the surface modal agencies and their research programs. DOT also proposed to create a new position\u2014an Assistant Secretary for Transportation Technology\u2014and centralize the budgeting and programming for its research under this position. According to DOT, an assistant secretary would be able to look beyond the modal perspective and scrutinize all research programs, thereby improving the coordination of the Department\u2019s research agenda. The Congress did not approve either proposal in 1995.", "In the absence of an Assistant Secretary for Transportation Technology, DOT\u2019s primary focal point for coordinating research is the Director of Technology Deployment in the Office of the Secretary. Although this position does not have the centralized budgeting and programming authority that DOT sought for an Assistant Secretary for Transportation Technology, the former Director encouraged strategic planning and coordination among the modal agencies\u2019 research functions. The position has not been filled since it became vacant in May 1996. However, the Deputy Secretary of Transportation announced on August 21, 1996, that RSPA\u2019s newly appointed Associate Administrator for Research, Technology, and Training would assume the coordination functions formerly assigned to the Director of Technology Deployment on an interim basis. The Department has yet to decide whether the position of Director of Technology Deployment will be retained.", "Although DOT has made RSPA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Research, Technology, and Training responsible for coordinating the Department\u2019s research, RSPA does not have the resources or the authority to fill the role of an Assistant Secretary for Transportation Technology. According to RSPA, its mission is to make America\u2019s transportation systems more integrated by conducting and fostering cross-cutting research and special programs. In contrast to DOT\u2019s operating agencies, which focus on specific sectors of the transportation system, RSPA concentrates on the system as a whole. However, a 1991 study by the National Academy of Public Administration found that RSPA had played only a limited role in research and development policy, in part because its budget is small compared with the modal agencies\u2019 research budgets.

These directives, or earmarks, take a variety of forms, from specifying dollar amounts for particular recipients to suggesting areas of research for consideration. The earmarks also represent different proportions of the agencies\u2019 research budgets. For example, FTA calculated that the Congress earmarked 80 percent of one of its primary research programs in fiscal year 1996. A DOT official noted that other agencies, such as FHWA, can better accommodate earmarks because their research budgets are larger and some earmarks are compatible with ongoing research programs. However, FHWA officials stated that without earmarks, the agency would have more latitude to match funds with critical needs. The appropriations committees\u2019 conferees recognized that earmarking funds may be detrimental to meeting research programs\u2019 goals when they stated in the fiscal year 1996 conference report on DOT\u2019s appropriations that they would seriously consider discontinuing their earmarking of the ITS program in fiscal year 1997."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT\u2019s Research Plans Do Not Reflect a Strategic Approach", "paragraphs": ["DOT is attempting to develop a strategic surface transportation plan with clear goals and objectives for the federal role.

However, strategic questions posed by ISTEA, such as what surface transportation research should provide to meet users\u2019 needs in the future, receive limited attention. As a former DOT official observed, the third plan moves in a more strategic direction, but it is far from being a strategic plan.
