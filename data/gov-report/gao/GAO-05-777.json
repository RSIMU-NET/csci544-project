Prior to completing this analysis, officials estimated the centralized approach would save about $94 million over 3 years. They said when they developed this estimate, there was a lack of published information about costs related to paper or electronic rulemaking systems. They used their professional judgment and information about costs for developing and operating EPA's paper and electronic systems, among other things, to develop the estimate. E-Rulemaking officials extensively collaborated with rulemaking agencies and most officials at the agencies we contacted thought the collaboration was effective. E-Rulemaking officials created a governance structure that included an executive committee, advisory board, and individual work groups that discussed how to develop the e-Rulemaking system. We contacted 14 of the 27 agencies serving on the advisory board and most felt their suggestions affected the system development process. Agency officials offered several examples to support their views, such as how their recommendations for changes to the system's design were incorporated. While managing the development of the centralized system, e-Rulemaking officials followed all but a few of the key practices for successfully managing an initiative. For example, officials did not have written agreements with participating agencies that included system performance measures. The first agencies began migrating to the centralized system in May 2005 with the public scheduled to have access in September 2005. Eventually, all rulemaking agencies will migrate to the centralized system; however, the schedule is tentative due in part to funding issues.

We  pointed out that the use of information technology could reduce regulatory  burden, improve the transparency of regulatory processes, and, ultimately,  facilitate the accomplishment of regulatory objectives.  We reported on  innovative uses of information technology that representatives of federal or  state agencies and nongovernmental organizations believed could be more  widely used by federal regulatory agencies, and we recommended actions  that could facilitate innovation, avoid duplication of effort, and potentially  result in a broader and more consistent approach across federal agencies.", "The President, through the President\u2019s Management Agenda, has advanced  greater use of information technology across a range of government  functions, including rulemaking.  In July 2001, the President identified the  expansion of e-government as one of the five priorities of his management  agenda.  To support this, OMB has developed an implementation strategy  and identified 25 e-government initiatives, one of which is e-Rulemaking.     In May 2002, the Director of OMB issued a memorandum to the heads of  executive departments and agencies advising them of \u201cour intention to  consolidate redundant IT systems relating to the President\u2019s on-line  rulemaking initiative.\u201d  Citing OMB\u2019s authority under the Clinger-Cohen  Act of 1996, the Director said OMB had identified \u201cseveral potentially  redundant systems across the federal government that relate to the  rulemaking process,\u201d and indicated that consolidation of those systems  could save millions of dollars.  The administration said e-Rulemaking  would \u201cdemocratize an often closed process.\u201d", "In late 2002, the President signed into law the E-Government Act of 2002.

The centralized design uses a minimal number of  governmentwide e-Rulemaking system components in the same location to  provide consistent access and services for citizens and agency staff across  all dockets.  Under this design, the features and functions of the  governmentwide e-Rulemaking system are provided by component-based  application architecture and all standard components are centrally located.   These application components would reside on servers in a single location  for delivery of services to the public and the agencies.  Unlike the tiered  and distributed designs, which are discussed in the next sections, the  centralized design will not support existing agency docket systems nor will  it distribute components of the governmentwide e-Rulemaking system in  agency facilities.", "Tiered design. The tiered design utilizes a centralized governmentwide e- Rulemaking system to deliver all agency and citizen services, but is  different from the centralized design because common hardware and  software components installed in the governmentwide e-Rulemaking  system are also installed at different agency sites to enhance system  performance.  For example, components like the database management or  document management system may be placed on separate servers in the  same or different locations to process information more efficiently to boost  system performance, and the responsibility for the data is dispersed across  multiple entities or agency sites and would be maintained locally at each  site.  Because the tiered design is based on the use of common hardware  and software components, the governmentwide e-Rulemaking system is  not linked to any existing agency specific docket system with its unique  hardware and software. As a result, no customized software interfaces are  needed.", "Distributed design. The distributed design integrates a centralized  governmentwide e-Rulemaking system with existing agency-specific  electronic docket systems while satisfying all governmentwide  e-Rulemaking system requirements.  This design links agencies with  existing docket systems to the governmentwide e-Rulemaking system using  customized software (middleware) to allow interconnectivity between  agencies\u2019 systems and the governmentwide e-Rulemaking system.  This  design provides the public with a means of searching across agency  dockets and establishes the governmentwide e-Rulemaking system as an  access point to the public and agencies for searching, reviewing, and  commenting on dockets that reside on the agencies\u2019 existing docket  systems.

The model  predicted it would take 1 year to deliver the centralized design and almost 3  years to deliver the distributed design.  Also, according to the model, the  complexity of the distributed design would present a high risk of instability  to the overall operation and maintenance of the systems.", "The second assessment used a model that estimates the total cost of  implementing and supporting a specific application within a commercial  enterprise and assesses the expected risk of successful deployment and the  benefit to the organization of adopting the new capability.  Using this  model, the cost to deliver and operate the three designs was $20.1 million  for the centralized design, $22.8 million for the tiered design, and $94.9  million for the distributed design (assuming 10 agencies were integrated  with the centralized governmentwide e-Rulemaking system).  The model  estimated that there was a 50 to 60 percent greater likelihood of  unsuccessful deployment of the distributed design when compared to the  other designs.  The most significant risk factor accounting for this  increased likelihood of failure is system complexity, resulting in major  integration, infrastructure, and change management issues that tend to be  difficult to resolve.", "The third assessment was done by a leading information technology firm  with the intent of predicting the cost, risk, security, and supportability of  the three designs based on industry best practices and the firm\u2019s  experience in assessing similar architectures.  The firm recommended the  centralized design because it provided for a consistent implementation  across the government and was the lowest cost and least risky design.  The  firm rated the tiered design as \u201cfeasible but not recommended\u201d for various  reasons including the following.  First, the firm said it would be difficult to  maintain consistent data quality in a tiered design because the  responsibility for data would be spread across multiple entities.  Second,  consistent security and business continuity policies could not be  implemented because each agency would most likely manage its data  according to its security policies and business continuity models.  Third,  data retrieval could be complex because data would be maintained locally  at each agency.

Using  two cost and risk models and comparing the three designs to industry best  practices was a sound approach to use in order to select which design  should be implemented.  In addition, because there was a lack of published  information about the costs to develop or operate either a paper or  electronic rulemaking system, e-Rulemaking officials used their  professional judgment and own experiences to estimate how much the  centralized e-Rulemaking system could save the federal government.", "E-Rulemaking officials established a governance structure to collaborate  with other agencies to obtain input on developing and implementing the  centralized e-Rulemaking system and its collaboration efforts with other  agencies have been extensive and well-received.  Most of the agencies we  contacted were very satisfied with the collaboration efforts and thought  that e-Rulemaking officials listened to their ideas and used them when  developing and implementing the system.  Officials from a few agencies we  interviewed even said that in terms of the e-government initiatives, the e- Rulemaking initiative was one of the better collaborative efforts in which  they have participated.", "While managing the development of the centralized e-Rulemaking system,  e-Rulemaking officials followed most of the key practices for successfully  managing a project.  E-Rulemaking officials could, however, improve their  management of the e-Rulemaking initiative by including system  performance measures in written agreements with agencies.  Having such  agreements would provide criteria for determining if the e-Rulemaking  initiative is operating in the most effective, efficient, and economic manner  possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["E-Rulemaking officials established a governance structure that allowed it  to successfully collaborate with other agencies about how to develop and  implement the centralized e-Rulemaking system and used most of the key  practices included in this report for managing an initiative.  To learn from  how it managed this initiative and to build on the success of it, we  recommend that the Administrator of EPA, as managing partner of this  initiative, take steps to ensure that the written agreements between EPA  and the participating agencies include performance measures that address  issues such as system performance, maintenance, and cost savings.

As managing partner, EPA heads  the Program Management Office (PMO), which is staffed by officials from  several rulemaking agencies participating in this initiative.  The PMO staff  manages the day-to-day activities of the e-Rulemaking initiative while the e- Rulemaking Initiative Executive Committee makes the final decisions  about the initiative\u2019s strategy, resources, and timetable.  Hereafter, we refer  to PMO officials as e-Rulemaking officials.", "Our first objective was to describe the approach EPA used to identify  alternative designs for the e-Rulemaking system and how the decision to  proceed with a single, centralized system design was made.  To address this  objective, we reviewed the Capital Asset Plan and Business Cases  submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the  Department of Transportation (DOT).  We also reviewed a contractor\u2019s  analysis of the capabilities of current e-Rulemaking systems, a contractor\u2019s  summary of assessments of the three identified alternative designs  including analyses of operational risks and security vulnerabilities, and  documentation related to the basis for e-Rulemaking officials\u2019 and the e- Rulemaking Initiative Executive Committee\u2019s recommendation about  which design alternative to implement.  We also interviewed OMB, e- Rulemaking, and DOT officials involved with developing information about  the design alternatives, the selection of the centralized system design, and  the development of the estimated cost savings associated with the  centralized design alternative.", "Our second objective was to describe how EPA collaborated with other  rulemaking agencies to obtain input about the e-Rulemaking system and  those agencies\u2019 views regarding the collaboration.  To address this  objective, we interviewed e-Rulemaking officials and reviewed  documentation related to collaboration efforts such as those describing the  purpose and composition of various committees and work groups and  written agreements between agencies and EPA regarding funding of the  system.  To acquire agency views on the collaboration that has occurred,  we randomly selected 12 of the 27 agencies that serve on the e-Rulemaking  Initiative Advisory Board and interviewed officials from those agencies  about their experiences with the collaboration efforts.  Included in this set  of selected agencies were (1) agencies that serve on the e-Rulemaking  Executive Committee, (2) agencies that currently have an e-Rulemaking  system, and (3) agencies that are heavily involved in rulemaking.  We  analyzed the agency officials\u2019 responses to our questions on collaboration  and identified those views that were most frequently expressed by officials  from multiple agencies as a means of gauging the overall quality of the  collaboration.", "In addition to the agencies included in the sample, we discussed  collaboration with two additional agencies that serve on the Advisory  Board.  The first was DOT.  Since we contacted DOT officials in relation to  the first objective, we also discussed collaboration issues with them.  We  contacted the second agency, the National Archives and Records  Administration (NARA), because many officials included in the original  sample suggested that we talk to that agency since an official from NARA  was heavily involved in meeting with all agencies to discuss the  development of the e-Rulemaking system.  We also discussed the methods  used to obtain information from the public about the development of the e- Rulemaking system with PMO officials and reviewed related documents.", "Our third objective was to (1) determine whether EPA used key practices  for successfully managing a project when managing the e-Rulemaking  initiative and (2) describe EPA\u2019s future plans for developing and  implementing the centralized e-Rulemaking system.   To determine whether  e-Rulemaking officials followed key practices, we identified key practices  for successfully managing a project by reviewing previous GAO work  related to the e-government initiatives.  The key practices included in prior  GAO reports were based in part on studies done by federal, state, and local  agencies, international agencies, and the private sector and on guidance  provided by the federal government, state, local and international  governments, private research groups, national associations, and  educational institutions.  GAO information technology staff agreed with the  list of key practices we identified.  After developing the list of key  practices, we compared the list to the information we had gathered about  e-Rulemaking officials\u2019 management of the e-Rulemaking initiative.  When  making the comparison, we did not assess how well each key practice was  followed, but rather we determined if the steps they took to manage the e- Rulemaking initiative reflected the presence of the practice.  We did not  attempt to assess the quality or extent of each practice\u2019s implementation.   In order to describe future plans for the initiative, we reviewed documents  that addressed future plans such as the business cases and implementation  schedules and interviewed e-Rulemaking officials.  We did not assess the  quality of these plans.", "Although we report cost and related data from contractor assessments of  the three governmentwide e-Rulemaking system design alternatives, we did  not examine the reliability of that data since our first objective was to  describe how e-Rulemaking officials selected one of the three alternatives  rather than to determine if the appropriate alternative was selected.   We  performed our work from December 2003 through June 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "List of GAO Reports Related to E-Rulemaking", "paragraphs": ["Federal Rulemaking: Agencies\u2019 Use of Information Technology to  Facilitate Public Participation.
