Politically, aspiring NATO members are expected to establish civilian control over their militaries, a new concept for most of the former Warsaw Pact states. More subjectively, applicant nations must demonstrate a commitment to democratic values, as embodied in the NATO treaty. Aspiring members must also strive to peacefully eliminate internal ethnic disputes or territorial disputes with neighbors. Finally, new members must agree not to prevent other aspiring nations from joining NATO.", "Although the study articulated enlargement goals and new member entrance requirements, it did not assess any individual nation\u2019s progress toward NATO membership.

An example of special circumstances could include the provision that no NATO nuclear weapons could be deployed on the country\u2019s territory during peacetime.", "The North Atlantic Council must approve the accession protocol and if it does not, the protocol must be amended until it meets Council approval. If it fails to do so, the process can be stopped and the prospective member\u2019s bid to join NATO is effectively ended.", "Once the protocol is approved, it is signed by the North Atlantic Council and the prospective member. The accession protocol must then by ratified by the governments of all the current members and the prospective member and then enters into force. For example, in the United States, this will require a two-thirds majority in the Senate to amend and ratify the treaty. If the protocol is ratified by all members and the aspiring member, a formal invitation is made to the prospective member to accede to the North Atlantic (or Washington) Treaty. Once the aspiring member signs and gives the treaty to the U.S. government, it is considered a full member of NATO. If the accession protocol is not ratified by all 16 current members, the prospective member may not sign the Washington Treaty.

This funding is provided through the State Department to support transfers of equipment to enhance the interoperability of partner forces with NATO, such as tactical radios, night vision equipment, and command, control, and communications upgrades.

The first two of these initiatives were originally funded from other DOD accounts, but now are consolidated into the PFP assistance program. At this time, DOD officials are uncertain as to what portion of the $40 million will be allocated to each of these programs due to limitations prohibiting these funds from being used to purchase equipment that will be transferred to a foreign country.", "The Regional Airspace Initiative is intended to modernize civilian and military air traffic control, air sovereignty, and airspace management of Central and Eastern European nations.

This means that common funding will be limited for new members, unless NATO removes the ceiling or current members contribute more. According to officials at the U.S. Mission to NATO, most NATO members have generally reduced defense budgets in recent years, and it is unlikely that they would make larger contributions to the infrastructure fund in the near term. However, according to these officials, most of NATO\u2019s commonly funded projects will be completed by the end of 1997. This could allow common funds to be directed to projects in new member states if the budget remained at $800 million.
