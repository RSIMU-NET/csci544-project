To examine the effects on Medicare beneficiaries, GAO compared Medicare claims data for 2011 and 2012 with that for 2010, the year before the round 1 rebid. GAO also examined other information about CMS's efforts to monitor the effects of the CBP, and interviewed DME industry representatives and officials from Medicare beneficiary organizations.

Under the CBP, only competitively selected contract suppliers can furnish certain DME product categories (such as oxygen supplies and hospital beds) at competitively determined prices to Medicare beneficiaries in designated competitive bidding areas. The CBP's round 1 rebid was in effect for a 3-year period, from 2011 through 2013. It included nine DME product categories in nine geographic areas. For CBP monitoring purposes, CMS also selected nine comparator areas that were demographically similar to the rebid areas. GAO's analysis found that in 2012, the second year of the round 1 rebid:", "The number of beneficiaries furnished DME items included in the CBP generally decreased more in the CBP areas than in the comparator areas. For example, the number of beneficiaries furnished oxygen supplies decreased by about 22 percent in the CBP areas and by about 16 percent in the comparator areas. According to CMS, CBP may have reduced inappropriate usage of DME and these decreases do not necessarily reflect beneficiary access issues. Based on its monitoring tools, which include comparing changes in the health outcomes of beneficiaries in the CBP areas to those in the comparator areas, CMS has concluded that beneficiaries have not been affected adversely by the CBP.", "In general, a small number of contract suppliers had a large proportion of the market share in the nine competitive bidding areas. The top four contract suppliers generally accounted for a large proportion of the market in all CBP areas, although the top four suppliers for each product category were not the same in every competitive bidding area. CMS has reported that few contract suppliers had contracts terminated by the agency or voluntarily withdrew from Medicare.", "The total number of DME suppliers and Medicare allowed charges decreased more in the CBP areas than in the comparator areas. For example, the number of suppliers in the CBP areas with Medicare allowed charges of $2,500 or more decreased, on average, 27 percent. In the comparator areas, supplier numbers decreased by 5 percent. The decreases in supplier numbers may reflect other factors, such as CMS's efforts to reduce Medicare DME fraud.", "The round 1 rebid's first 2 years achieved Medicare cost savings of about $400 million as estimated by CMS, and did not appear to have adversely affected beneficiary access to CBP-covered items. However, with CBP's national mail-order diabetic testing supplies program and expansion into an additional 100 bidding areas in July 2013, it will be important for CMS to continue its efforts to monitor the effects of the CBP.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS cited the results of CMS's monitoring of beneficiaries' access to CBP items as evidence that CBP has not adversely affected beneficiaries."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2012, Medicare\u2014a federal health insurance program\u2014spent   $11.4 billion on durable medical equipment (DME), prosthetics, orthotics,  and related supplies for beneficiaries.

We used these data to determine whether the number  of CBP-covered beneficiaries utilizing CBP-covered items and services  increased or decreased in each month of 2011 and 2012 compared to the  same month in 2010 for six of the round 1 rebid\u2019s nine product  categories. We did these analyses for Medicare beneficiaries using  CBP-covered items in both the nine competitive bidding areas and in the  nine areas selected by CMS\u2014referred to as comparator areas\u2014in this  report.

To  ensure that we captured all Medicare total allowed charges submitted by  a distinct contract supplier that may have been doing business in several  locations under different registered names, national provider identifier  numbers, or provider transaction access numbers, we used the unique  bidder number assigned by CMS to each distinct bidding supplier and  combined all Medicare total allowed charges submitted under any other  identifying numbers for each product category and competitive bidding  area.

Some  Medicare total allowed charges were submitted by non-contract suppliers.  We identified distinct non-contract suppliers, to the extent possible, by  summing all the Medicare total allowed charges submitted under any  national provider identifier number or provider transaction access number  that were associated with one tax identification number for each product  category in each competitive bidding area. Medicare total allowed  charges submitted by non-contract suppliers were identified by their tax  identification numbers because unique bidder numbers were not  available.", "To further determine the extent that contract suppliers may have been  affected by the round 1 rebid, we asked CMS for information on how  many CBP contract suppliers have had their CBP contracts terminated;  have voluntarily withdrawn from Medicare, which results in CMS  canceling their CBP contracts; or have acquired or been acquired by  other DME suppliers.

The third quarter of 2010 was the last one before  the round 1 rebid contract suppliers were announced in November 2010  and before the DME marketplace began to adjust to CBP in the fourth  quarter of 2010. For example, CMS officials told us that some suppliers  furnished diabetic beneficiaries with additional testing supplies in late  2010 before the beneficiaries switched to contract suppliers in 2011. For  this analysis, we included suppliers with at least one allowed charge for a  beneficiary residing in any of the 18 areas for any Medicare DMEPOS  fee-for-service HCPCS codes, excluding the prosthetic and orthotic codes  as this category generally represents more individualized items needing  to be fitted to a beneficiary and including the parenteral\u2014intravenous  nutrition\u2014codes.", "To assess the reliability of the data we received from CMS, we reviewed  and identified outliers in the data, and followed up with CMS officials to  clarify and resolve any discrepancies.
