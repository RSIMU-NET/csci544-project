PREA requires that sponsors conduct pediatric studies for certain products unless the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants a waiver or deferral. Sponsors submit studies to FDA in applications for review. BPCA is voluntary for sponsors. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 required that GAO describe the effect of these laws since the 2007 reauthorization. GAO (1) examined how many and what types of products have been studied; (2) described the number and type of labeling changes and FDA's review periods; and (3) described challenges identified by stakeholders to conducting studies. GAO examined data on the studies from the 2007 reauthorization through June 2010, reviewed statutory requirements, and interviewed stakeholders and agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["At least 130 products--80 products under PREA and 50 under BPCA--have been studied for use in children since the 2007 reauthorization. However, FDA cannot be certain how many additional products may have been studied because FDA does not track and aggregate data about applications submitted under PREA that would allow it to manage the review process. FDA was unable to provide information about some applications that had been submitted to the agency that were subject to PREA. Recent improvements to FDA's data system might assist the agency in tracking future applications. Under PREA, FDA has granted most of the study waivers and deferrals requested by sponsors since the 2007 reauthorization. Under BPCA, FDA granted pediatric exclusivity--an additional 6 months of market exclusivity, which generally delays marketing of generic forms of the product--to the sponsors of 44 of the 50 drugs in exchange for conducting pediatric studies. Because BPCA is voluntary, sponsors may decline FDA's request for pediatric studies. Although BPCA includes provisions to encourage the study of drugs when sponsors have declined FDA's request, few drugs have been studied under these provisions. Since the 2007 reauthorization, all of the 130 products with pediatric studies completed and applications reviewed under PREA and BPCA had labeling changes that included important pediatric information. The most commonly implemented labeling change expanded the pediatric age groups for which a product was indicated. The next most common type of labeling change indicated that safety and effectiveness had not been established in pediatric populations and provided a description of the study conducted. Additional labeling changes were recommended for products as a result of FDA's monitoring of adverse events associated with products after they had been approved for marketing. FDA officials said they need to complete their review of the application, including all studies, before they can reach agreement with the sponsor on labeling changes. Stakeholders, including sponsors, pediatricians, and health advocacy organizations, described challenges faced by sponsors that could limit the success of PREA and BPCA. Those challenges included confusion about how to comply with PREA and BPCA due to a lack of guidance from FDA for changes to the laws from the 2007 reauthorization of PREA or BPCA. FDA officials explained that they mitigate this lack of guidance by discussing questions or concerns that sponsors have regarding their pediatric studies with sponsors throughout the process. An additional challenge sponsors described was a lack of economic incentives to study products with no remaining market exclusivity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Commissioner of FDA track applications during its review process and maintain aggregate data on applications subject to PREA. HHS agreed that better tracking of information is needed but disagreed with GAO's finding that it does not track applications.

According to an  article by FDA officials, researchers reported in 1999 that 81 percent of  products used by children lacked sufficient information or labeling  regarding pediatric use. Products not labeled for pediatric use place  children at risk of being exposed to ineffective or harmful treatment or  receiving incorrect dosing. Since the late 1990s, Congress has passed laws  to encourage or require product sponsors, typically the product\u2019s  manufacturer, to conduct pediatric studies, including the Pediatric  Research Equity Act (PREA) and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children  Act (BPCA). As a result of these efforts, prior to the most recent  reauthorizations of PREA and BPCA, pediatric studies resulted in  approximately 250 labeling changes that added or clarified information on  pediatric use of the product.", "In 2007, as a part of the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA),  Congress reauthorized PREA and BPCA in order to increase the number of  products studied for use in children. PREA requires that sponsors conduct  pediatric studies for certain drug and biological products before they are  marketed unless FDA grants a waiver or deferral for some or all pediatric  studies. A waiver removes the requirement that some or all studies be  completed, and a deferral allows the sponsor to conduct a study by a  specified date after the product has been approved for marketing. BPCA,  however, is voluntary for the sponsor; it authorizes FDA to provide an  incentive of an additional 6 months of market exclusivity to product  sponsors that conduct pediatric studies requested by FDA. This market  exclusivity generally delays marketing of generic forms of the product and  is known as pediatric exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity can only be granted  to those products that are \u201con-patent\u201d\u2014that is, those that have patent  protection or market exclusivity. BPCA also includes provisions (1) to  allow for the funding of pediatric studies of on-patent drugs that the  sponsor declined to study by the Foundation for the National Institutes of  Health (FNIH) and (2) to allow for the conduct of studies of \u201coff-patent\u201d  products, which no longer have market exclusivity, through the National  Institutes of Health (NIH).", "The results of pediatric studies conducted under PREA and BPCA are  submitted to FDA in an application. The application includes pediatric  study results and suggested labeling changes, among other things. FDA  reviews the application and works to come to agreement with the sponsor  on labeling changes, which FDA then approves as part of its approval of  the application. PREA and BPCA require that one year after a product\u2019s  labeling change is implemented, any adverse events reported for that  product be reviewed. FDA may require additional labeling changes based  on the adverse events.", "FDAAA required that we describe the effect PREA and BPCA have had on  the study and labeling of drug and biological products for pediatric use.  To respond to the requirement in FDAAA that we report our findings to  you no later than January 1, 2011, we briefed you on our findings on  December 15, 2010. This report contains information we provided during  that briefing as well as additional information in which you expressed  interest. As discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, we (1) examine  how many and what types of drug and biological products have been  studied under PREA and BPCA since their 2007 reauthorization;   (2) describe the number and type of labeling changes and FDA\u2019s review  periods for reaching agreement on these changes for the drug and  biological products for which studies have been completed since the 2007  reauthorization; and (3) describe challenges identified by stakeholders,  including sponsors and other interested parties, to conducting pediatric  studies. FDAAA also required that we describe efforts by FDA and NIH to  encourage studies in neonates, which are children under the age of one  month. We discuss these efforts in appendix I.", "To examine how many and what type of drug and biological products have  been studied under PREA and BPCA since their 2007 reauthorization, we  reviewed FDA and NIH data on products studied in pediatric populations  from the date of the 2007 reauthorization of PREA and BPCA through June  30, 2010, the most recent date for which data were available at the time of  our analysis. Specifically, we examined data on the number of products  for which studies have been completed since the 2007 reauthorization.  These studies were generally initiated prior to the reauthorization. We also  examined data on the number of products for which studies were initiated  since the 2007 reauthorization. These studies are generally still ongoing.  We compared FDA\u2019s procedures for tracking applications submitted under  PREA to the standards described in the Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government. In examining FDA\u2019s procedures for tracking  data, we examined the agency\u2019s ability to locate individual applications  and its ability to track aggregate data about applications that would allow  FDA to manage the review process, including the total number of  applications subject to PREA, whether those applications were complete,  and whether PREA applications included pediatric studies or requests for  waivers or deferrals at the time of submission. We reviewed FDA data in  order to determine the extent to which FDA waived or deferred the  requirement for sponsors to submit studies under PREA. We also reviewed  FDA data on the therapeutic areas, or conditions treated, for the products  studied under PREA and BPCA. In addition, we interviewed officials from  FDA, NIH, and FNIH.", "To describe the number and type of labeling changes and FDA\u2019s review  periods for reaching agreement on these changes for drug and biological  products for which studies have been completed since the 2007  reauthorization, we analyzed FDA data on all pediatric labeling changes  from the date of the 2007 reauthorization of PREA and BPCA through   June 30, 2010, the most recent date for which the data were available at  the time of our analysis. Specifically, we determined the number and  types of labeling changes that have been approved both as a result of  pediatric studies and reported adverse events. In addition, we reviewed  requirements in PREA and BPCA for reaching agreement on labeling  changes and FDA documents on performance goals. We also interviewed  FDA officials.", "To describe challenges identified by stakeholders to conducting pediatric  studies, we interviewed various stakeholders and reviewed articles written  by some of these stakeholders. These stakeholders included  representatives from five drug and biological product sponsors; three  trade groups: the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,  the Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the Generic  Pharmaceutical Association; and several health advocacy organizations,  including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Organization  for Rare Disorders, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the  Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, the Institute for Pediatric  Innovation, and the Pediatric Pharmacy Advocacy Group. In addition, we  interviewed officials from FDA, NIH, and FNIH.", "To assess the reliability of data that FDA and NIH provided, we  interviewed agency officials. FDA and NIH officials described how they  maintained data on pediatric studies conducted under PREA and BPCA,  the resulting labeling changes, and pediatric adverse events. FDA generally  maintained the information in separate files rather than centralized  databases. To the extent possible, we looked for other sources of  information to corroborate or provide perspective on the data FDA  supplied. For example, we looked to data that is posted on FDA\u2019s Web site  and compared it, when possible, to data provided directly by FDA.  Although we found that FDA does not maintain certain data on the  programs, we generally found the data that FDA maintains to be reliable  for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2009 through May  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) established pediatric  exclusivity for sponsors that conducted pediatric studies for drugs.  In  1999, FDA implemented the Pediatric Rule, which required that sponsors  include the results of pediatric studies when submitting certain new drug  or biological product applications. However, in 2002, the Pediatric Rule  was declared invalid by a federal court. In 2002, Congress reauthorized  FDAMA\u2019s pediatric exclusivity provisions in BPCA, and in 2003, Congress  codified much of the Pediatric Rule in PREA, requiring that pediatric  studies be conducted and that the results of those studies be included in  certain new drug or biological product applications. In September 2007,  Congress reauthorized both PREA and BPCA as a part of FDAAA, and in  March 2010, Congress extended pediatric exclusivity and applicable BPCA  provisions to biological products as a part of the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act. PREA and BPCA are both set to expire on   October 1, 2012.", "PREA requires that sponsors submit the results of pediatric studies in  certain drug and biological product applications to FDA. Specifically,  PREA applies to drug and biological product applications for any of the  following: a new active ingredient, a new indication, a new dosage form, a  new dosing regimen, or a new route of administration. In addition, PREA  requires that pediatric studies be conducted for the indications described  in the application\u2014that is, the indications for which the sponsor plans to  market the product\u2014but not for any additional indications.", "The 2007 reauthorization of PREA established the Pediatric Review  Committee (PeRC), an internal FDA committee responsible for providing  assistance in the review of pediatric study results and increasing the  consistency and quality of such reviews across the agency. The PeRC  consists of approximately 40 FDA employees with a range of expertise,  including pediatrics, biopharmacology, statistics, chemistry, legal issues,  pediatric ethics, and others as pertinent to the pediatric product under  review. FDA officials explained that the PeRC is divided into separate  subcommittees for PREA and BPCA.", "When a sponsor completes all of the required studies for a drug or  biological product, it submits an application to FDA. The application  includes these study results and suggested labeling changes based on the  pediatric studies\u2019 findings, among other things. If the pediatric studies  have not been completed, the application must include a request for a  waiver or deferral of the pediatric studies. PREA established certain  criteria under which, at the sponsors\u2019 request, some or all of the required  pediatric studies may either be deferred until a specified date after  approval of the product\u2019s application or waived altogether by FDA. FDA  may also grant a deferral or waiver on its own initiative, under specified  circumstances. For example, a study required under PREA may be  deferred when additional data on the safety and effectiveness of the  product in adults is needed before the product can be studied for use in  children. If the sponsor requests a deferral, the product\u2019s application must  include, among other things, a description of the planned pediatric studies  and a time frame for completion. The study may be waived when it is  determined to be impossible or highly impracticable, such as when the  number of pediatric patients with a disease that may be treated with that  product is too small to study. Sponsors may conduct multiple studies per  product, such as separate studies for subsets of pediatric populations like  infants, children, and adolescents. FDA may grant waivers or deferrals for  only one type of study, such as in one pediatric age group, or FDA may  grant waivers or deferrals for all pediatric studies of the product.", "FDA\u2019s review of an application under PREA is part of the agency\u2019s broader  review of the entire application. Once the sponsor submits its application,  FDA directs the application to the agency\u2019s appropriate division to review  the entire application, including all adult study results, the pediatric study  results, and requests for a waiver or deferral. FDA may determine that the  application is incomplete and more information is necessary from the  sponsor. Generally, when this happens, FDA notifies the sponsor and  waits to finish reviewing the application until the information is received.  According to FDA officials, toward the end of FDA\u2019s review, the division  provides requests for a waiver or a deferral and a summary of the relevant  pediatric data to the PeRC for review. The PeRC provides  recommendations on whether or not the pediatric portion of the  application satisfies PREA requirements and whether to grant or deny a  waiver or deferral. FDA then determines whether or not to approve the  application. As a part of the review process, FDA is required by PREA to  negotiate and reach an agreement with the sponsor on labeling changes  based on pediatric studies within 180 days of the application\u2019s  submission. If FDA and the sponsor are unable to reach an agreement on  labeling changes within 180 days, they are required by PREA to proceed to  a formal dispute resolution process. The 2007 reauthorization of PREA  provided FDA with authority to make labeling changes on its own  initiative when a product has been studied for use in children, including  when a study does not determine that the product is safe or effective in  pediatric populations. Therefore, FDA can impose a labeling change  unilaterally to describe FDA\u2019s determination about the study results in the  event that the agency cannot reach agreement with the sponsor.", "A sponsor can request that a drug or biological product that is required to  be studied under PREA be studied under BPCA as well, to allow the  sponsor of the product to be eligible to receive pediatric exclusivity.  According to FDA officials, the sponsor can make this request through a  proposed pediatric study request (PPSR). If FDA agrees, it issues a formal  written request to the sponsor that outlines, among other things, the  nature of the pediatric studies that the sponsor must conduct in order to  qualify for pediatric exclusivity. (See fig. 1.) According to FDA officials,  the pediatric studies requested under BPCA would generally also fulfill the  PREA requirement; however, even if the sponsor does not complete the  studies outlined in the BPCA written request, it is still required to  complete any studies required under PREA. FDA officials said that  pediatric studies conducted under BPCA are generally more extensive  than those required under PREA. For example, the written request could  include studies for indications in addition to those described by the  sponsor in its application, such as those that are relevant to children.", "Under BPCA, sponsors receive pediatric exclusivity as an incentive to  conduct studies of drug and biological products for use in children. The  BPCA process formally begins when FDA determines that information  related to the use of the product in a pediatric population may produce  health benefits and issues a written request for pediatric studies to the  sponsor of a product. Written requests may be issued for new, not  previously marketed, drug or biological products or to products that are  already on the market but still on-patent. FDA may issue a written request  on its own initiative or after it has received and agreed to a PPSR from a  sponsor to conduct a study under BPCA. The PeRC reviews all written  requests and provides recommendations prior to their issuance to  sponsors. According to FDA officials, in the written request, FDA may ask  for more than one study of a single drug or biological product, such as  studies for multiple indications or separate studies for different age  groups, such as infants, children, and adolescents. BPCA requires that  FDA take into account adequate representation of children of ethnic and  racial minorities when developing written requests. (See app. II for  information on FDA\u2019s efforts to ensure the inclusion of racial and ethnic  minorities in pediatric studies.) The sponsor must respond to FDA within  180 days of receiving the written request indicating whether the sponsor  agrees to the request and, if so, when the pediatric study will be initiated.  If the sponsor does not agree to the request, the sponsor must state the  reasons for declining the request.", "When the pediatric studies are complete, the sponsor submits the results  to FDA in an application, which must include any suggested labeling  changes resulting from the studies\u2019 findings. FDA recommends that the  application be submitted 15 months prior to the end of the sponsor\u2019s  market exclusivity for the product in order to be considered for pediatric  exclusivity. Once the sponsor submits its application, FDA is to review  the sponsor\u2019s application in order to (1) determine whether or not to  approve the application, (2) negotiate and reach an agreement with the  sponsor on pediatric labeling changes, and (3) grant or deny pediatric  exclusivity. FDA is to grant pediatric exclusivity if the study meets the  conditions outlined in the written request, regardless of the study\u2019s  findings. Specifically, in determining whether to grant or deny pediatric  exclusivity, BPCA requires that FDA assess whether the studies fairly  responded to the written request, were conducted in accordance with  commonly accepted scientific principles and protocols, and were properly  submitted.", "During FDA\u2019s review of the application, the PeRC may review a summary  of relevant pediatric data from the application and provide  recommendations to FDA on whether or not to grant pediatric exclusivity.  FDA then determines whether or not to approve the application. In  addition, if FDA and the sponsor are unable to reach an agreement on the  labeling changes within 180 days, they are required by BPCA to proceed to  the same formal dispute resolution process that exists for PREA. The  2007 reauthorization of BPCA provided FDA with authority to make  labeling changes on its own initiative when a product has been studied for  use in children, including when a study does not determine that the  product is safe or effective in pediatric populations. Therefore, FDA can  impose a labeling change unilaterally to describe FDA\u2019s determination  about the study results in the event that the agency cannot reach  agreement with the sponsor.", "BPCA includes provisions for the conduct of pediatric studies even if the  sponsor declines the written request. If a sponsor declines a written  request by FDA to study an on-patent drug or if a sponsor does not  complete studies outlined in an accepted written request, FDA may refer  the written request to FNIH if it determines that there is a continuing need  for information relating to the use of the drug in the pediatric population.  (See fig. 2.) If FNIH is not able to fund all studies, BPCA requires that FDA  consider whether to require the studies described in the written request  under PREA.", "The process under BPCA for off-patent products differs from the process  for on-patent products. To further the study of off-patent products, NIH\u2014 in consultation with FDA and experts in pediatric research\u2014is required to  develop and publish a list of priority needs in pediatric therapeutics,  including products or indications that require study, every 3 years. NIH  publishes this list on its Web site and in the Federal Register. NIH may  submit a PPSR to FDA for the study under BPCA of an indication of an off- patent product that is used for one of the pediatric therapeutic areas  described on the NIH list of priority needs. FDA is then to determine  whether to issue a written request in response to NIH\u2019s PPSR to all  sponsors of the drug or biological product, including the product\u2019s original  sponsor as well as any manufacturers of the generic product. The PeRC  reviews all written requests and provides recommendations prior to their  issuance to sponsors. If a sponsor were to accept the written request, it  would conduct the studies outlined in the request and then submit the  study results and any suggested labeling changes to FDA for review.  However, according to FDA officials, a sponsor has not accepted a written  request to study an off-patent product since the 2007 reauthorization. Off- patent products do not qualify for pediatric exclusivity, so there are few  financial incentives to conduct the studies.", "Under the 2007 reauthorization of BPCA, if the sponsors were to decline or  fail to respond to the written request for an off-patent product within   30 days, FDA can refer the written request to NIH to publish a request for  proposals to conduct the studies. The sponsors of off-patent products are  not required to respond to a written request. If within 30 days of FDA\u2019s  issuance of the written request the sponsors do not accept or decline the  request, FDA considers the request declined. NIH can then award funds\u2014 for example, through grants or contracts\u2014to entities that have the  expertise and ability to conduct the studies described in the written  request. When these studies are complete, the entity that completed the  studies is to submit the study results to NIH and FDA for review. For off- patent studies conducted by a sponsor or funded by NIH, FDA is to  negotiate and reach an agreement with the product\u2019s sponsors on  appropriate labeling changes resulting from the study findings within   180 days. (See fig. 3.)

The PAC is  responsible for reviewing reports of all adverse events reported for drug  and biological products during a one-year period after a labeling change is  made under PREA or BPCA and may review reports of pediatric adverse  events in subsequent years.

FDA does not track and aggregate data about  applications submitted under PREA until the PeRC has completed its  review of information from the application. This generally occurs late in  FDA\u2019s overall review of the application. Therefore, FDA was unable to  provide information about some applications that had been submitted to  the agency that were subject to PREA. For example, FDA officials could  not provide aggregate data about the total number of applications,  whether the applications were complete or incomplete, or whether the  application included pediatric studies or requests for waivers or deferrals.  Therefore, FDA could not be certain how many additional applications for  which it has not yet completed its review under PREA include pediatric  studies or requests for waivers or deferrals. This lack of data during the  review process about applications subject to PREA, hampers FDA\u2019s ability  to manage the review process, including whether FDA is meeting statutory  requirements and whether the sponsor has complied with PREA\u2019s  requirements for pediatric studies.", "FDA officials said that approximately 830 applications submitted to FDA  from September 27, 2007, through June 30, 2010, were subject to PREA,  but could not provide a precise number. The PeRC has completed its  review of information from 449 of these applications, 80 of which  contained the results of pediatric studies. Fifty-nine were drugs and 21  were biological products. FDA could not provide information about the  remaining 381 of the approximately 830 applications. Standards for  internal control in the federal government provide that managers need  certain data to determine whether they are meeting their agencies\u2019  missions, goals, and objectives. This could include whether FDA is  meeting PREA requirements and whether the sponsor has complied with  PREA\u2019s requirements for pediatric studies. FDA officials explained that  these 381 applications were submitted to FDA, and were under  consideration in the relevant FDA division, but had not yet been reviewed  by the PeRC, which advises FDA in its review of pediatric studies or  requests for waivers or deferrals. FDA officials said that they could not  provide any details about these applications without locating each  application individually within the agency and reviewing it to determine  whether it included pediatric studies or requests for waivers or deferrals,  but stated that it is likely that most of the approximately 381 applications  are for products that sponsors plan to market in adult indications and,  therefore, would include a request for a deferral of the pediatric studies  rather than completed pediatric studies. Although FDA officials could not  say how many, they said that some of the approximately 381 applications  may be incomplete and awaiting further review upon the sponsor\u2019s  submission of additional materials, and that some of the applications may  have been withdrawn by the sponsor. However, some of the applications  could include the results of completed pediatric studies.

However, the HHS comments do not state that this data system  update would provide the internal controls necessary to track and  aggregate data about applications that are currently under review, which  would allow FDA to readily retrieve information to manage this program.  In addition, HHS states that FDA does not currently plan to code  applications retrospectively until they have ensured that there are  available resources for such a project. Therefore, unless they do these  things, FDA still will not know the status of the 381 applications, including  whether the applications were complete or incomplete, or whether the  applications included pediatric studies or requests for waivers or  deferrals, until the review of those applications is compete.", "FDA has granted a full or partial waiver or deferral to more than half of the  applications that it has reviewed under PREA. According to FDA officials,  of the 449 applications for which FDA has completed its review, FDA  granted sponsors 237 waivers and 131 deferrals. FDA officials noted that,  generally, most sponsors request deferrals of pediatric studies in the  product\u2019s application rather than conduct the pediatric studies prior to  submitting the product\u2019s application. FDA sometimes granted a full or  partial waiver and a deferral to a single application, therefore a single  application could be included in both totals. FDA officials could not  provide additional information about the remaining 381 applications  submitted to FDA during this period but not reviewed by the PeRC.", "Waivers and deferrals were granted for multiple reasons. The reason most  frequently cited for granting a waiver was that the drug or biological  product studies were found to be impossible or highly impracticable.  Waivers may be granted for this reason because, for example, the number  of patients in that age group is too small.

(See table 2.) In addition,  we previously reported that not all products studied under BPCA had  labeling changes. According to FDA officials, instances in which there  were no labeling changes for products studied prior to the 2007  reauthorization were generally due to study results that did not establish  that the products were safe and/or effective in children. The 2007  reauthorizations of PREA and BPCA provided FDA with authority to make  labeling changes on its own initiative when a product has been studied in  children, including when a study does not determine that the product is  safe or effective in pediatric populations.", "The labeling changes for drug and biological products studied under PREA  and BPCA reflected important pediatric information. FDA categorizes  labeling changes into one or more of nine categories, and each drug or  biological product can have more than one category of labeling change.  These categories illustrate the important pediatric information provided in  labeling changes, ranging from providing new or enhanced safety  information to inserting a boxed warning for pediatric populations. Since  the 2007 reauthorization, the most commonly implemented labeling  change expanded the pediatric age groups for which a product was  indicated. There were 99 instances of this type of labeling change. (See  table 3.) For example, a labeling change for a drug treating  gastroesophageal reflux disease extended the approved indication from  adults only to pediatric patients 5 years of age and older. In addition, 28  labeling changes indicated that, though a study was conducted, safety and  effectiveness had not been established in pediatric populations. For  example, pediatric studies on a drug meant to treat osteogenesis  imperfecta, a genetic disorder commonly known as brittle bone disease,  did not show a reduction in the risk of bone fracture in children.  Therefore, the drug\u2019s labeling was changed to describe the study  conducted and indicate that safety and effectiveness were not established  in pediatric populations.", "Since the 2007 reauthorization, the PAC reviewed the adverse events  reported for 74 drug and biological products and recommended additional  labeling changes for 17 of those 74 products.

According to FDA officials, the agency cannot adequately consider and  agree upon a labeling change until it completes its review of an  application. FDA is required by both PREA and BPCA to negotiate and  reach agreement with the sponsor on labeling changes based on pediatric  study results within 180 days of submission of the application. If FDA is  unable to reach agreement with the sponsor, it is required to enter the  labeling change dispute resolution process.

Under these performance goals, applications are  classified as either priority or standard, depending on the characteristics  of the application, and FDA has committed to completing its review of   90 percent of priority applications within 180 days of submission and   90 percent of standard applications within 300 days of submission. BPCA  requires that applications submitted under BPCA that propose a labeling  change, which are all BPCA applications, receive priority status.  Therefore, all BPCA applications have been subject to 180-day review.  However, according to FDA officials, only a subset of applications subject  to PREA requirements\u2014those that provide major advances in therapy or  new therapies\u2014receive priority status.

However, for PREA applications subject to standard review,  which includes most PREA applications, the goal and required review  period are different. FDA\u2019s goal to complete its review of the application  within 300 days differs from PREA\u2019s requirement to reach agreement on  labeling changes within 180 days. FDA officials acknowledged that the  agency has generally not agreed upon labeling changes within the required  180 days for PREA applications subject to standard review. However, as  noted previously, FDA could not account for 381 applications submitted to  the agency under PREA, making it difficult for FDA to determine whether  it is meeting either the requirements of PREA or the agency\u2019s goals for  these applications.

One challenge stakeholders, including  sponsors, identified was confusion about how to comply with PREA and  BPCA due to a lack of current guidance from FDA. FDA officials  acknowledged that the most recent PREA guidance is draft guidance from  2005 and that the most recent BPCA guidance was revised in 1999. FDA  has not provided guidance for changes to the laws from the 2007  reauthorization for PREA or BPCA. FDA officials stated that they plan to  publish updated guidance on PREA and BPCA. However, they have no  timeline for when they plan to do so. FDA explained that officials can  discuss study timelines and questions or concerns sponsors may have  regarding their study submissions throughout the process.", "Stakeholders said another challenge is that reauthorizations of PREA and  BPCA have led to uncertainty given the time required to conduct studies.  They said that since PREA and BPCA are subject to reauthorization every  5 years, some of the statutory requirements for studies could change while  studies are under way or as they are being planned; therefore, there is  uncertainty as to the requirements that will apply when they conduct  studies. Two sponsors stated this uncertainty makes it difficult to know  what will be involved in developing products for use in children over the  long term, which makes it difficult to plan studies. For the 50 drugs for  which FDA has completed its review since the 2007 reauthorization of  BPCA, the average amount of time from when FDA issued a written  request through when it completed its review of a drug\u2019s study results was  6 years. Based on this experience, PREA and BPCA would be reauthorized  during the course of a drug or biological product study, possibly changing  the requirements with which the sponsors must comply. For example, the  2007 BPCA reauthorization added the requirement that sponsors submit  applications at least 9 months before the end of the product\u2019s market  exclusivity.", "Another challenge identified by stakeholders is complying simultaneously  with the U.S. laws, PREA and BPCA, and the European Union\u2019s (EU)  Paediatric Regulation. (See app. III for a description of the Paediatric  Regulation.) Stakeholders stated that it is common for a sponsor to seek  approval of a drug or biological product in both the EU and the United  States simultaneously, making it necessary for the study to comply with  PREA or BPCA and the Paediatric Regulation if the sponsor wants to  market the drug in the United States and in the EU. For example, in the  EU, the sponsor submits a plan for the study of a product in pediatric  populations that must be approved by the European Medicines Agency  before studies are conducted. Stakeholders stated, in the United States,  sponsors do not have formal contact with FDA regarding their pediatric  study design for studies submitted under PREA until they submit  completed study results to FDA. Therefore, sponsors cannot be certain  that studies done to comply with the Paediatric Regulation will meet FDA  requirements.", "Finally, stakeholders told us that the lack of economic incentives presents  a challenge to sponsors\u2019 willingness to conduct pediatric studies  voluntarily, as under BPCA. Stakeholders, including industry  representatives, told us that sponsors are reluctant to conduct studies for  drug and biological products that are nearing the end of their market  exclusivity or are off-patent because there is no economic benefit  associated with conducting these studies. Once a drug or biological  product is off-patent, the sponsor cannot receive pediatric exclusivity for  conducting pediatric studies. Stakeholders told us that these drug and  biological products are among the least likely to be studied in pediatric  populations. Given the lack of economic incentive, a provision in BPCA  gives NIH the responsibility of awarding funds to entities that have the  expertise and ability to conduct studies of off-patent drug and biological  products.

Even  though an application subject to PREA cannot be considered complete  unless it contains pediatric study results or a request for a waiver or  deferral, FDA has not been tracking whether these are included until  information from the application is reviewed by the PeRC. According to  FDA officials, the PeRC generally reviews information about pediatric  studies submitted as part of the application near the end of FDA\u2019s  application review process. Because of the timing of this review, FDA staff  managing the review process cannot be certain how many applications  that have been submitted to the agency are subject to PREA, how many of  those applications include pediatric studies, or how many applications  include requests for waivers or deferrals, until FDA has almost completed  its review of the entire application.

HHS also agreed that better tracking of pediatric labeling and  other information is needed and expressed the hope that future  improvements in its databases will allow the agency to easily identify all  pediatric studies contained in all applications. HHS acknowledged that  such improvements could permit health care providers, the public, and  other stakeholders to conduct more interactive and thorough searches for  pediatric studies, indications, and other information relevant to pediatric  patients.", "In its comments, HHS disagreed with our finding that FDA does not have a  system to track data about applications under PREA. The comments note  that the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has a specific  code in its Regulatory Management System for Biologics Licensing  Application that allows it to track PREA-filed applications for biological  products. HHS describes the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and  Research\u2019s process for tracking applications using DARRTS and suggests  that DARRTS allows FDA to track the status of any application at any  given time.", "However, our recommendation is not based on FDA\u2019s ability to determine  the status of individual applications, but rather its lack of aggregate data  on applications that are subject to PREA during its review of the  applications so as to be able to better manage its review process. We  clarified our discussion of our findings in this area and the wording of our  recommendation. As discussed in this report, FDA was unable to  determine how many of the applications that had been filed with the  agency since PREA\u2019s 2007 reauthorization were subject to PREA. We had  initially requested this information in an effort to provide context to some  of the other information that we reported about FDA\u2019s implementation of  PREA. FDA was able to report that approximately 830 applications were  subject to PREA, but was unable to provide a precise number. Since this  was considerably more than the 449 applications that had been reviewed  by the PeRC, we sought additional information about the status of these  applications. In response to our request, FDA officials explained that the  agency did not maintain this information and that determining the status  of these applications would require that they engage in a labor intensive  manual process that would require an extensive investment of FDA  resources and would take months to complete. We believe that FDA\u2019s lack  of aggregate data about an important program designed to enhance the  safety of drug and biological products for use in children is inconsistent  with sound internal controls because it does not provide FDA officials  with the information they need to effectively manage the program to  ensure that the review process is being implemented in accordance with  statutory and other requirements until the process is almost complete.", "In its comments, HHS states that in May 2011, FDA made an improvement  to DARRTS that was not in place during the time of our review. HHS states  that the improvement will allow FDA to better track future applications  that are subject to PREA. However, the comments do not state whether  the improvement will allow FDA to determine during its review process  whether applications include studies or requests for waivers or deferrals.  While it remains unclear what data will be readily available to FDA  officials as they manage this program, FDA\u2019s efforts to improve its  tracking of applications are consistent with the goal of our  recommendation and should enable it to better track future applications.  HHS\u2019s comments state that FDA hopes to include enhanced information  about applications in DARRTS retrospectively, but notes that the agency  will have to ensure that there are available resources for such a project.  Therefore, DARRTS will not include this improved data for applications  that are currently undergoing review.", "HHS states that FDA maintains data about completed studies under PREA  on its Web site. However, this data is compiled and placed on FDA\u2019s Web  site after FDA\u2019s review of the applications is complete.

However,  in some instances FDA has requested neonates\u2019 inclusion but not required  it. Since the 2007 reauthorization of BPCA, FDA has issued four written  requests to drug sponsors that have mentioned neonates specifically. FDA  required the inclusion of neonates in the written request for the study of  one of the four drugs. FDA\u2019s written requests for three other drugs asked  for the inclusion of neonates in the study; however, the sponsors of these  products had the option of not including neonates in the studies.

Seven of these studies were submitted under BPCA; two  were submitted under PREA.", "NIH has funded studies under BPCA for five drugs that have included  neonates. These studies were initiated before the 2007 reauthorization, but  are ongoing. Additionally, NIH has conducted several activities under  BPCA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs in neonates,  including neonates that are premature. These activities include the 2009  co-funding of a large scale study of the diagnosis and treatment of  hypotension in premature infants, funding of a study to determine  outcome measures for chronic lung disease in premature infants, and the  development of a small volume sampling technique for neonates with  congenital heart disease.", "FDA officials explained that a limited number of the studies conducted  under PREA have included neonates because PREA only requires that  pediatric studies be conducted for the indication described on the drug  application, which is typically applicable to adults and older pediatric  populations that would not apply to neonates. Additionally, PREA  provides sponsors with the option to request that required pediatric  studies be waived by FDA when there is a valid reason. For some  applications, FDA has agreed to waive studies after it has determined that  including neonates in a drug study may be impossible or highly  impracticable due to safety or ethical concerns.", "FDA and NIH officials explained that they face challenges in increasing the  inclusion of neonates in pediatric studies under BPCA. BPCA authorizes  FDA to provide an incentive of an additional 6 months of market  exclusivity, known as pediatric exclusivity, to product sponsors that  conduct pediatric studies requested by FDA. FDA officials explained that  they have been granting pediatric exclusivity for the study of products in  children older than one month, so it is difficult to have manufacturers go  back and do the study in neonates because it may be difficult for them to  receive additional pediatric exclusivity. FDA officials told us that the  neonate population has diseases that are very different from other  pediatric populations and that there are limited tools that can be used to  study these diseases. FDA and NIH officials told us that there are also  ethical issues that arise when working with this population that create a  barrier. Based on our review of the literature, we found there is an ethical  issue concerning whether neonates are a vulnerable population that  should not be enrolled in trials where there may be increased risk to their  health.", "The physicians that we spoke with as a part of our two panels explained  that they encounter numerous challenges to conducting studies in  neonates. One challenge the panelists described is obtaining informed  consent from the parents, which is required for the neonate to be enrolled  in a study. For example, one panelist stated that because the mother may  be medicated from her delivery it may be difficult to obtain consent from  her. One panelist stated that he encounters families for which English is  their second language and he may need them to review and understand a  complex 10- to 12- page study outline that is written in English. The  panelist explained that while his hospital provides doctors who speak  another language and may communicate in that language for families for  which English is a second language, they may encounter another challenge  if the family is not able to read in their native language.", "The panel explained that there are also scientific challenges to conducting  studies in neonates. One scientific challenge is that the amount of blood in  neonates is extremely limited. However, blood must be drawn to  determine proper dosing of the products being tested, requiring doctors to  do needle pricks to obtain blood from the neonate. These pricks are in  addition to the pricks that must be done to monitor the health of the  neonate and there may not be enough blood to test for both proper dosing  and to monitor the neonate\u2019s health. The panel went on to explain that the  outcomes of the study must be observed in the neonate between 3 to   5 years after the study. This level of monitoring is costly to the sponsor  and can be an economic disincentive to conducting studies in neonates.  The panel also explained that neonates are heterogeneous\u2014there can be a  significant difference in a neonate born at 23 weeks than a neonate that is  40 weeks\u2014and any study designed to include them must account for this,  making it difficult to generalize the study results.", "Panelists said that another challenge to increasing the inclusion of  neonates in studies involves FDA, stating that FDA sometimes seems to be  creating barriers rather than working to include neonates in studies. For  example, they said that FDA has required that a product be proven safe  and effective for adults before it can be studied in neonates; however the  panelists stated that because neonates often have illnesses that are  specific to their age and condition, this requirement does not make sense.  Furthermore, one panelist stated that she believed that FDA did not have  enough neonatologists on staff to assist in preparing written requests. She  also stated that it is important that study designs that include neonates be  reviewed by neonatologists and not general pediatricians because  neonatologists understand the issues that must be confronted in the  neonatal intensive care unit. FDA\u2019s Pediatric Review Committee, which  reviews written requests and determines whether waivers and deferrals  should be granted, has about 40 members. However, FDA officials we  interviewed said that there is only one neonatologist on the Committee.

We previously reported that these  differences may result in a product having adverse or unexpected side  effects for users depending on their race or ethnicity. To examine how  FDA considered the representation of ethnic and racial minority  participants in product studies conducted under BPCA, we reviewed the  37 written requests that FDA issued to sponsors from the time of the 2007  reauthorization of BPCA on September 27, 2007 through June 30, 2010.", "FDA issued guidance in 2005 on the collection of race and ethnicity data in  clinical trials recommending that sponsors use a standardized approach  developed by the Office of Management and Budget to report the race and  ethnicity of study participants. FDA\u2019s 2005 guidance recommends, rather  than requires, that sponsors use the specified categories because  participants\u2019 racial and ethnic data may not be able to be collected in some  instances and because the specified categories may not be sufficient or  appropriate for some studies. For example, when studies are conducted  outside of the United States, the recommended categories may not  adequately describe the racial and ethnic groups in foreign countries.", "FDA has issued 37 written requests to sponsors for the study of on-patent  products under BPCA, since the 2007 reauthorization. In these 37 written  requests, FDA asked that sponsors include information on the  representation of ethnic and racial minorities for all participants using the  standardized categories specified in agency guidance when responding to  written requests. In all but two of the 37 written requests, FDA also  requested that if the sponsor chose to use other categories, the sponsor  obtain FDA\u2019s agreement on the use of alternate categories."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Pediatric Drug and Biological Product Studies in the European Union and the United States", "paragraphs": ["The European Union\u2019s Paediatric Regulation for the development of drug  and biological products in pediatric populations was implemented in  January of 2007 in order to facilitate the development of, and improve the  availability of information on, products for use in children.

PIPs are required to  include the sponsor\u2019s proposed timing and methods for conducting  pediatric studies in all age groups. Sponsors must submit PIPs to the  Paediatric Committee, which was created by the Paediatric Regulation.  Sponsors submit to the Paediatric Committee through the European  Medicines Agency. The Paediatric Committee reviews the PIP and  determines whether to agree or refuse the study plan. The PIP is a binding  agreement between the sponsor and the European Medicines Agency, but  can be modified as necessary. The Paediatric Regulation allows for the  agency to either defer pediatric studies until the product has been studied  in adults or waive the studies altogether in certain circumstances. The  Paediatric Committee is responsible for granting or denying deferrals and  waivers. When studies are deferred, the sponsor must still submit a PIP  that includes details on the pediatric studies that will be conducted and  when those studies will begin, but when studies are waived, the  requirement to submit a PIP is also waived.", "Once a new product is ready to be marketed, the sponsor submits a  marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency  that must include, among other things, the results of pediatric studies  conducted in accordance with the PIP or proof that a waiver or deferral of  the pediatric studies was granted.
