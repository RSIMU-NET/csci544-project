Because PBGC's board is composed of three cabinet secretaries, who have numerous other responsibilities, the board structure does not guarantee that PBGC's board is active and diverse. For example, since 1980, a span of 27 years, there were only 18 official board meetings. Further, the board has not established formal procedures to ensure that PBGC management provides it information on all policy matters nor has it developed standing committees to oversee operations. Instead, the board relies on PBGC's Inspector General and management's oversight committees to ensure that PBGC is operating effectively. However, there are no formal protocols concerning the Inspector General's interaction with the board, and PBGC internal management are not independent and are not required to routinely report all matters to the board. Even though PBGC uses informal channels of communication to inform its board members, the board's oversight may be limited, because it cannot be certain that it is receiving high quality and timely information about all significant matters facing the corporation. PBGC's lack of formal guidelines to articulate the administrative roles and responsibilities among the board, the Secretary of Labor as the board chair, board members' agencies, and the PBGC Director has led, at times, to confusion and inefficiencies. The board has not addressed uncertainty over the extent to which PBGC is a separate and distinct executive agency, a fact that has resulted in confusion over when DOL has the authority to manage PBGC's operations. Further, neither DOL nor PBGC has developed formal policies and procedures to define the board's authorities and responsibilities. Instead, PBGC officials typically react to DOL's periodic written and oral communications, which PBGC officials said sometimes become a part of PBGC's operational framework. For example, PBGC is required to incorporate its budget request with DOL's budget request, and over the years, DOL has taken a more active role in reviewing PBGC's budget. However, PBGC officials believe that DOL has in some cases overstepped its role. For instance, DOL and PBGC officials disagreed over the inclusion of a funding request in PBGC's fiscal year 2007 budget."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures the pensions  of more than 44 million private sector workers and retirees in over 30,000  employer-sponsored pension plans.

In addition, PBGC has  become responsible for a number of large terminated pension plans, which  have brought the corporation record numbers of claims from plan  participants. In fact, between fiscal year 2000 and 2005, the number of  participants to whom PBGC has paid benefits increased from around  243,000 to almost 700,000, with another half million expected to receive  benefits from PBGC when they become eligible to retire. To strengthen  pension plan funding, Congress passed the Pension Protection Act of 2006  (PPA).

PBGC\u2019s  insurance program remains on the high-risk list today. We reviewed  PBGC\u2019s governance and management structure to determine whether  PBGC is well positioned to address current and growing fiscal and  operational challenges. Specifically, this report assesses (1) the extent to  which PBGC\u2019s governance structure provides PBGC management with  policy direction and oversight, and (2) whether the administrative  responsibilities among PBGC\u2019s board, the Department of Labor (DOL), and  PBGC\u2019s management are clearly defined.", "To identify the extent to which PBGC\u2019s governance structure provides  policy direction and oversight, we reviewed the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and PPA to understand the authority  of PBGC\u2019s board of directors as well as the administrative responsibilities  of PBGC\u2019s Director. We examined private sector corporate governance  guidelines and those of similar federal government corporations to  determine the extent to which other corporations have similar policy  mandates, structures, and oversight functions. We selected similar federal  government corporations with similar missions and designations as listed  under the Government Corporation Control Act (GCCA). To determine  the extent to which PBGC\u2019s administrative structure has affected PBGC\u2019s  internal operations, we collected and reviewed documents related to  PBGC\u2019s organizational structure and administrative reporting  requirements, such as its relationship with DOL and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB). In addition, we reviewed the work of  PBGC\u2019s Office of the Inspector General and GAO to determine what  weaknesses or inefficiencies resulted from the corporation\u2019s governance  and organizational structure. We met with officials from PBGC; the  Departments of the Treasury, Labor, and Commerce; and OMB; as well as  with former PBGC executive directors, former general counsels, and  former PBGC staff.

Title IV of ERISA created PBGC to insure plan  participants\u2019 benefits and to encourage the continuation and maintenance  of private sector defined benefit pension plans by providing timely and  uninterrupted payment of pension benefits. Through its two insurance  programs, PBGC covers certain private sector defined benefit plans.  PBGC is funded through insurance premiums from employers that sponsor  insured pension plans as well as investment income and assets from  terminated pension plans.", "ERISA established a governance structure consisting of a board of  directors, with the Secretary of Labor as the Chairman of the Board.  ERISA provided the Secretary of Labor with responsibility for  administering PBGC\u2019s operations, personnel, and budget. The Secretary  delegated the responsibility for administering PBGC to an Executive  Director through a series of chairman\u2019s orders describing the Executive  Director\u2019s responsibilities. For example, one order issued in 1984  authorized the Executive Director to make final decisions addressing legal  matters on behalf of the corporation. In 2006, PPA replaced the Chairman  of the Board as PBGC\u2019s administrator with a Senate-confirmed director.  The PPA established the director position at the same level of the  executive schedule as two of the PBGC board representatives\u2014Under  Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury as well as the heads of other  federal government corporations, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC) and the Export-Import Bank of the United States. In  addition, the corporation is aided by a seven-member Advisory Committee  appointed by the President to represent the interests of labor, employers,  and the general public. This committee has an advisory role but has no  statutory authority to set PBGC policy or conduct formal oversight.", "Under the GCCA, PBGC is a wholly owned government corporation\u2014that  is, the government holds all its assets and liabilities. However, the United  States is not liable for any obligation or liability incurred by the  corporation. (See app. II for a list of selected government corporations).  According to public administration experts, a government corporation is  appropriate for the administration of governmental programs that    are predominately of a business nature,    produce revenue and potentially are self-sustaining,  involve a large number of business-type transaction with the public,  and  require greater budget flexibility than a government department or  agency.", "Under ERISA, PBGC is also empowered to sue and be sued; appoint and  fix the compensation of officers, employees, attorneys, and agents; and  utilize the personnel and facilities of any other agency or department of  the U.S. government with or without reimbursement (with its head\u2019s  consent).

Although the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is intended to strengthen the corporate  governance of private sector entities, certain corporate governance  elements from it may also be relevant to government corporations and  government-sponsored enterprises. For example, corporate governance  practices suggest that corporations headed by boards of directors should  have people in place with the appropriate qualifications, independence,  and resources to conduct their responsibilities effectively. (See table 1 for  examples of corporate governance practices.) Additional information on  corporate governance practices is included in appendix III.", "PBGC\u2019s financial outlook has improved since 2004, when it reported an  accumulated deficit of $23 billion, but PBGC still projects large deficits for  its single-employer program.

In fact, we  found that between 1980 and May 2007, a span of 27 years, there were only  18 board meetings, 10 of which were since 2003. The three-member board  is also not large enough to ensure diverse skills, such as knowledge in  strategic risk assessment and management, are included to direct and  oversee PBGC.

The board is also  responsible for reviewing and approving PBGC\u2019s budget, monitoring  financial performance, approving the corporation\u2019s strategic plan, and  evaluating the effectiveness of its managers, among other responsibilities.  Beyond their roles as heads of executive agencies and sitting on PBGC\u2019s  board, two of the cabinet secretaries are also members of other boards.  For example, the Secretary of the Treasury serves on the boards of the  Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Community Development  Financial Institutions Fund, and is a managing trustee of the Social  Security and Medicare trust funds. The Secretary of Commerce is on the  board of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The Secretary of  Labor is also a trustee of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.", "According to some corporate governance guidelines, boards should have  no fewer than 5 members and no more than 15. With only 3 members,  PBGC\u2019s board may not be large enough to include the knowledge needed  to direct and oversee PBGC, such as expertise in accounting, management,  or strategic risk assessment. According to corporate governance  guidelines, the board of directors should be large enough to provide the  necessary skill sets, but also small enough to promote cohesion, flexibility,  and effective participation. We did not identify any other government  corporations with a similar board size as PBGC. Government corporations\u2019  boards averaged about 7 board members, with one having as many as 15.  For example, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation\u2019s board of  directors consists of 15 members\u20148 from the private sector and 7 from  the federal government, as shown in table 2.", "PBGC\u2019s board structure does not guarantee that the board represents a  diverse set of interests and contains areas of expertise particular to PBGC.  According to corporate governance guidelines published by The  Conference Board, corporate boards should be structured so that the  composition and skill set of a board is linked to the corporation\u2019s  particular challenges and strategic vision, and should include a mix of  knowledge and expertise targeted to the needs of the corporation. Boards  of directors should include certain expertise in accounting and finance,  strategic risk assessment, management, and industry knowledge, among  other factors. PBGC\u2019s board members represent the interests of three  government agencies\u2014DOL and the Treasury share responsibility for  ERISA, and Commerce represents the interests of business and economic  sectors. While having these interests represented on PBGC\u2019s board is  important and the members can draw on the expertise within their  respective agencies, PBGC\u2019s governance structure does not necessarily  guarantee that board members will have a range of diverse expertise  needed to specifically address PBGC\u2019s policy and oversight because the  current structure only consists of members who serve by virtue of their  position in the federal government.", "Our review of other governance structures found that many government  corporations\u2019 boards of directors consist of a variety of individuals  reflecting a mix of knowledge, perspectives, and political affiliations. For  instance, the FDIC board includes a full-time Chairman as well as the  directors of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of  Thrift Supervision, and two other directors with specific banking  expertise, such as state bank supervision. In addition, because PBGC\u2019s  board is composed of cabinet secretaries, PBGC\u2019s board members  typically change with each administration, limiting the board\u2019s institutional  knowledge of the corporation. Other government corporations have  integrated staggered term limits to avoid such gaps. For example, OPIC\u2019s  directors may be appointed for a term of no more than 3 years, and the  terms of no more than 3 of the 15 directors can expire in any 1 year.", "Since PBGC\u2019s inception, the board has met infrequently. While corporate  governance guidelines do not specify either frequency or duration of board  meetings, the literature states that the appropriate number of hours to be  spent by a director on his or her duties and the frequency and length of the  meetings depend largely on the complexity of the corporation and its  operations. Longer meetings may permit directors to explore key issues  in more depth, whereas shorter but more frequent meetings may help the  directors stay up to date on emerging corporate trends and business and  regulatory developments. However, as shown in figure 3, PBGC has only  recently begun to meet regularly. In 2003, after several high-profile  pension plan terminations and with the urging of PBGC\u2019s Executive  Director, PBGC\u2019s board agreed to begin meeting twice a year to discuss  PBGC matters. As a result, between July 2003 and May 2007, the PBGC  board met 10 times. PBGC officials told us that it is a challenge to find a  time when all three cabinet secretaries are able to meet. As a result, the  board members\u2019 representatives officially met in their place 3 of the 10  times. Government corporations\u2019 boards vary in the number of times they  meet, but our review found that on average many government  corporations meet about 5 times per year, with some meeting more often.  For example, we found that the Export-Import Bank of the United States\u2019  board generally met more than twice a month between 2004 and 2006.", "While the PBGC board is now meeting twice a year, it appears that very  little time is spent on addressing PBGC\u2019s strategic and operational issues.  According to corporate governance guidelines, boards should meet  regularly and focus principally on broader issues, such as corporate  philosophy and mission, broad policy, strategic management, oversight  and monitoring of management, and company performance against  business plans. However, our review of the board\u2019s recorded minutes  found that although some meetings devoted a portion of time to certain  strategic and operational issues, such as investment policy, the financial  status of PBGC\u2019s insurance programs, and outside audit reviews, the board  meetings generally only lasted about an hour.", "Since the board members have limited time to direct and oversee PBGC,  they have designated officials and staff within their respective agencies to  conduct much of the work on their behalf. These officials are referred to  as board representatives and act as liaisons between their cabinet  secretaries and PBGC. They hold the rank of assistant secretary or above.  Yet PBGC\u2019s board representatives have no policy-making authority under  ERISA. Under PBGC\u2019s bylaws, however, a representative may represent a  board member at a board meeting, and take action on behalf of the board  member if the board member ratifies the representative\u2019s actions in  writing within a reasonable time.", "PBGC officials told us that the board representatives meet regularly\u2014 several times a year\u2014and generally provide staff with broad policy  direction and oversight on behalf of the cabinet secretaries. They also  receive briefings on emerging issues and matters requiring the board\u2019s  attention. However, we found limited documentation of such meetings. In  fact, we were informed that no formal minutes were kept of these  meetings, and the only documentary evidence we found of the board  representatives\u2019 meeting was when they represented their respective  board members at select board meetings. Each representative has a  dedicated staff person whose assignments include working on PBGC  matters. Although the board representatives can draw on the expertise of  other staff within their respective agencies as needed, these staff persons  have other job responsibilities, which could limit the amount of time they  can dedicate to PBGC.

Further, likely because of its small size, the board has not established  standing oversight committees. As a result, the board may be unaware of  significant PBGC management actions. According to corporate  governance guidelines, corporate boards should have mechanisms to  monitor and review operations, assess progress against performance  measures, and manage risks to the institution, and boards should operate  using committees to assist them. The board has not established formal  policies and procedures describing the types of policy matters that should  be raised to the board\u2019s attention. Rather, the board relies mostly on  PBGC\u2019s management to inform the board of pending issues when  management believes it\u2019s appropriate, which is done through weekly  communications to the board representatives. While officials believe that  this process has generally worked well, in some cases board members  have not received information in a timely manner. For example, in 2005,  PBGC\u2019s Inspector General found that the board members and their  representatives were not told of certain actions taken by PBGC\u2019s  management regarding a large bankruptcy settlement until after the case  had been settled. In response, PBGC drafted a protocol to govern  communications with the board representatives about potential  settlements. At this writing, the board is also revising the PBGC\u2019s bylaws,  which establish board governing procedures. However, since there are no  formal policies and procedures describing what other policy matters  should be elevated to the board\u2019s attention, the board may be unaware of  other significant actions of PBGC\u2019s management.", "The board has not established standing committees, such as audit and  ethics committees, to perform certain oversight and monitoring functions.  A committee structure permits the board to address key areas in more  depth than may be possible in a full board meeting. In prior years, the  board established certain committees\u2014staffed with individuals from  PBGC\u2019s Advisory Committee\u2014to probe specific issues. However, the  board has not used this approach since the early 1990s. Instead, the board  has generally relied on PBGC\u2019s Inspector General and its executive  management to provide oversight of PBGC\u2019s operations.", "As of May 2007, PBGC\u2019s Inspector General reports directly to the board  and conducts reviews of PBGC\u2019s operations and financial condition and  monitors PBGC\u2019s contractors. Even though the current board has required  the Inspector General to brief it at its now semiannual meetings, there are  no formal protocols describing the Inspector General\u2019s interaction with  the board or its representatives and staff. Consequently, if the Inspector  General or the board were to change, it is unclear whether the Inspector  General or the board would be aware of this informal protocol. Further,  the board relies on PBGC\u2019s executive management committees and  working groups for monitoring and reviewing PBGC\u2019s operations.  However, these committees and working groups are not independent of  PBGC\u2019s management and are not required to routinely report to the board.  Some government corporations, such as FDIC, the Export-Import Bank of  the United States, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the  National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), have established  standing committees to conduct certain oversight functions to assist their  boards of directors. For example, FDIC\u2019s board of directors established  standing committees, such as the Case Review Committee and the Audit  Committee, to conduct certain oversight functions.

ERISA established PBGC \u201cwithin the Department  of Labor\u201d and provided the Secretary of Labor administrative authority  over the corporation. As a consequence, the Secretary has been  responsible for overseeing PBGC\u2019s operations, including overall  supervision of PBGC\u2019s personnel, organization, and budget practices. As a  result, DOL officials consider PBGC to be a DOL agency and have required  the corporation to follow its policies and procedures. However, under its  authorities, PBGC has also developed its own policies, procedures,  directives, and systems separate from DOL, and it does not rely on DOL- wide services, such as legal, procurement, and information technology. As  a result, DOL and PBGC disagree over the extent to which PBGC is a  separate and distinct executive agency.", "A November 2005 PBGC memorandum stated that Congress\u2019 intention in  placing PBGC within DOL was to provide PBGC with a physical location  and was not meant in an organizational or operational sense. Some PBGC  managers now view the language as an anachronism. One former PBGC  Executive Director also noted that PBGC could not be just like any other  DOL agency, because if it were, the Secretaries of the Treasury and  Commerce, by a two-vote majority, could theoretically direct policies of  another federal cabinet department. Further, federal agencies, including  DOL, recognize PBGC\u2019s separateness either directly or indirectly through  various types of reporting requirements that are required of PBGC and the  board. For example, PBGC is responsible for representing itself in matters  before other agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, and the Merit Systems  Protection Board. In another instance, DOL\u2019s Office of the Solicitor stated  in a March 2007 letter to the Department of Justice that while PBGC was  \u201cwithin the Department of Labor,\u201d the two agencies have historically  operated with separate administrative structures and should be  considered separate for matters relating to postemployment ethics.", "The uncertainty of PBGC\u2019s status has resulted in confusion over the extent  to which DOL has the authority to manage PBGC\u2019s operations. According  to our internal control standards, agencies should ensure that key areas  of authority and responsibilities are defined and communicated. However,  neither the board, DOL, nor PBGC has developed formal policies and  procedures to define its authorities and responsibilities. Instead, PBGC  officials typically react to DOL\u2019s periodic written and oral  communications, which PBGC officials said sometimes become a part of  PBGC\u2019s operational framework. DOL and PBGC provided us with  memorandums and e-mail correspondence outlining some of these  administrative requirements. The following are examples of the confusion  and disagreement resulting from the uncertainty related to PBGC\u2019s status:  In December 2006, the Office of the Secretary of Labor, without  consulting with officials from the Departments of the Treasury or  Commerce, orally directed PBGC to obtain DOL\u2019s clearance before it  could advertise for or select individuals to fill three vacant executive  management positions, even though DOL had not required this in prior  years. According to PBGC officials, this resulted in hiring delays. DOL  officials stated that this requirement was needed to oversee PBGC\u2019s  hiring activities only while PBGC has an interim director.", "A May 2006 DOL memorandum to all its agency heads, including PBGC,  provided guidance for the preparation and submission of information  technology investments in DOL\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget request.  However, because OMB considers PBGC\u2019s information technology  program independent from DOL\u2019s, there has been confusion not only  between DOL and PBGC officials, but also among DOL officials, over  the role that DOL\u2019s Chief Information Officer has in PBGC\u2019s  information technology program and whether DOL\u2019s guidance is  applicable to PBGC on this issue.", "DOL and PBGC have also disagreed on management approaches to  PBGC\u2019s operations. For example:    During the fiscal year 2007 budget process, DOL and PBGC officials  disagreed over the amount of money included in PBGC\u2019s budget for the  development of a new system for pension plan sponsors to file their  required annual reports to DOL electronically. While PBGC benefits  from these annual reports, PBGC\u2019s Inspector General reviewed PBGC\u2019s  fiscal year 2007 budget request, which included $7 million to cover   these costs. After investigating, the Inspector General concluded that  the requested increase was disproportionate to PBGC\u2019s usage of the  annual reports. However, DOL officials disagreed with the Inspector  General\u2019s findings and said that the Inspector General\u2019s methodology  for determining the percentage usage was flawed. Further, the board  representatives from the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce  were unaware of DOL and PBGC\u2019s actions until they were brought to  their attention by PBGC\u2019s Inspector General. In May 2007, the direction  to transfer funds was enacted by Congress and PBGC is providing $7  million to DOL as part of a fiscal year 2007 supplemental  appropriation.", "In January 2007, DOL officials orally directed PBGC to have no direct  contact with OMB without DOL\u2019s approval, a condition that PBGC  officials believe has strained the relationship between DOL and PBGC  budget offices. In previous years, PBGC\u2019s budget office worked directly  with OMB examiners to resolve matters related to its annual budget  submissions, even though PBGC submitted its budget to OMB through  DOL\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and  Management. DOL now closely monitors PBGC\u2019s interactions with  OMB by attending meetings and participating in telephone calls. DOL  officials said that such action is needed to coordinate with PBGC in  order to provide OMB examiners with a consistent message. OMB  officials said that DOL\u2019s review of PBGC\u2019s budget submission was  useful.", "DOL and PBGC officials have also disagreed over PBGC\u2019s authority to  explore and establish an independent compensation system for its  employees. In the early 1990s, PBGC officials requested approval from  DOL to establish a new compensation system (outside of the federal  government\u2019s \u201cgeneral schedule\u201d pay system and merit pay), arguing  that PBGC employees should be exempt from these pay systems  because their compensation was not wholly from appropriated funds.  In a 1992 memorandum, DOL cited the absence of an explicit exception  for PBGC employees, the legislative history of ERISA, and prior rulings  by the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the United States Court  of Appeals for the District of Columbia to argue against such an  exemption.

Yet, PBGC is still directed and overseen by one of  the smallest and least diverse boards of directors, even though it is  financially one of the largest corporations within the federal government.", "While the current board members recognize PBGC\u2019s importance and are  meeting more frequently than before, the limited amount of time they can  dedicate to PBGC is troubling. In fact, if PBGC\u2019s board of directors were  held to private sector standards, the corporation could be considered  vulnerable to mismanagement. Because the Secretaries change with each  administration, the board may also have limited institutional knowledge.  This could weaken PBGC\u2019s governance further, since the ever-changing  board membership may not understand the corporation\u2019s business or the  vulnerabilities it faces. Even though each agency has a variety of staff who  may be able to fill the gaps in institutional knowledge, each board agency  has only assigned a board representative and one staff person, both of  whom have other job responsibilities, a fact that may limit the time and  attention given to PBGC. As a result, oversight of this $60 billion  corporation that provides pension benefits to over a half a million  participants in terminated pension plans may be limited.", "Because the Secretary of Labor has historically had the authority to  administer PBGC, DOL has, in some ways, filled the void in accountability.  However, the confusion resulting from the lack of clarity over who is  responsible for certain matters has raised additional questions about the  extent to which DOL should be involved in directing PBGC\u2019s activities.  Board representatives from the Departments of Commerce and the  Treasury have often deferred to DOL on administrative matters and not  generally questioned DOL on its actions. Perhaps some aspects of the  relationship between DOL and PBGC could be clarified in the revised  bylaws currently being prepared, but it remains essential that the board  exercise its authority to oversee PBGC and coordinate with DOL and each  other not only on major policy issues, but also on the oversight of PBGC\u2019s  activities. PBGC\u2019s management staff should also work with the board to  ensure that all significant matters are formally elevated to the board\u2019s  attention. This will become even more critical in the coming months as the  new Senate-confirmed Director begins to work with the board to clarify  the Director\u2019s role in administering PBGC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen PBGC\u2019s policy direction and oversight, Congress should  consider expanding PBGC\u2019s board of directors.
