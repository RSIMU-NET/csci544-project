Congress has expanded reservists' and their dependents' eligibility for TRICARE, the Department of Defense's (DOD) health insurance program. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2004 directed GAO to examine the health insurance coverage of reservists and their dependents. This report (1) identifies the extent to which reservists have civilian health insurance, (2) examines DOD's efforts to educate reservists and their dependents about TRICARE, and (3) describes reservists' level of satisfaction with TRICARE and the types of problems reservists and their dependents experienced when using it. To do this, GAO relied on interviews with DOD and DOD's survey data. GAO also administered a survey of TRICARE benefit assistance coordinators."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Eighty percent of mobilized reservists have civilian health insurance--a rate similar to that of the U.S. population between 18 and 64 years old. The number of reservists with civilian health insurance varies among reservists, with older reservists and reservists of higher rank having a greater rate of insurance than younger reservists and reservists of more junior rank, and reservists with dependents being more likely to have insurance than reservists without dependents. Reservists and their dependents obtained coverage through a variety of sources and over half of all reservists kept their civilian health insurance during mobilizations, even though they were eligible to enroll in TRICARE. Many reservists reported that they maintained their civilian coverage to avoid disruptions associated with a change to TRICARE and to ensure that their dependents could continue seeing their current providers who might not accept TRICARE. Increased mobilizations of reservists and successive legislative changes that have increased reservists' and their dependents' eligibility for TRICARE have complicated DOD's efforts to educate reservists about TRICARE. DOD's primary educational tools are the TRICARE briefings provided at mobilization sites and demobilization sites. According to DOD officials, these days of training are often so full of critical information that it is difficult for reservists to absorb all of the details of TRICARE. These briefings also occur at a time when a reservist may have already been eligible for TRICARE for up to 90 days without realizing it. These briefings are supplemented by family support programs, Web sites, toll-free customer assistance numbers, and print materials. DOD officials recognize the need to improve TRICARE education, but do not plan to provide additional TRICARE briefings for reservists and their dependents. When reservists used TRICARE, most reported that they were satisfied with TRICARE, although some reported experiencing difficulties. Over 60 percent of reservists who used TRICARE reported being satisfied. In addition, 70 percent of reservists thought TRICARE was either equal to or better than their civilian health insurance. However, according to DOD's and GAO's surveys, when reservists and their dependents did experience problems with TRICARE, a few of the most frequently reported problems include difficulties understanding TRICARE, establishing TRICARE eligibility, obtaining TRICARE assistance, and finding a health care provider that accepts TRICARE."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Department of Defense  (DOD) has increased its reliance on reservists to support the global war on  terrorism, and particularly Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi  Freedom. This has increased the number of reservists supporting DOD\u2019s  current operations and the duration of reservists\u2019 active-duty service. In  recent years, Congress has increased the health care benefits available to  mobilized reservists and their dependents, which generally include family  members such as spouses and dependent children. Although all active- duty military personnel must enroll in TRICARE, the military health  insurance program, reservists and their dependents have historically been  eligible for TRICARE only while the reservist was serving on active duty  for an extended period of time following mobilization. The National  Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA) for Fiscal Years 2004, 2005, 2006, and  2007 expanded the number of reservists and their dependents who are  eligible for TRICARE, and the duration of their eligibility. These  expansions in eligibility increased the number of reservists that DOD,  working through the reserve components, is required to educate about  TRICARE. Reservists who are mobilized for a period of more than 30 days  become eligible for TRICARE, as do their dependents. Those who have  private health insurance that covers their dependents may choose to  cancel that coverage and switch to TRICARE or continue that coverage.", "The increased dependence on reservists in recent years has raised  questions by some members of Congress as to whether reservists and their  dependents have adequate health insurance when they are not on active  duty and whether they have difficulty using TRICARE when they are  eligible for it. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2004 directed that we study the  health insurance coverage of reservists and their dependents, DOD\u2019s  efforts to provide assistance specifically to reservists and their dependents  to facilitate their access to and use of TRICARE benefits, and reservists\u2019  and their dependents\u2019 experiences using TRICARE. Specifically, as  discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, we (1) identified the extent  to which reservists have civilian health insurance, (2) examined DOD\u2019s  efforts to educate reservists and their dependents about TRICARE, and   (3) described reservists\u2019 level of satisfaction with TRICARE and the types  of problems reservists and their dependents experienced when using  TRICARE.", "To determine the extent to which reservists have civilian health insurance  coverage, we relied on the results of DOD\u2019s 2003 and 2004 Status of Forces  Surveys of Reserve Component Members, the most recent surveys that  include questions about reservists\u2019 insurance coverage. Through our  review of the relevant documentation and our discussion with DOD  officials, we determined that the data presented in the surveys were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We interviewed representatives from  DOD\u2019s Office of Reserve Affairs, the TRICARE Management Activity  (TMA), Defense Manpower Data Center, and each of the seven reserve  components. We also reviewed reports from the Congressional Research  Service and Congressional Budget Office as well as GAO\u2019s prior work on  reservists and defense health care.", "To examine DOD\u2019s efforts to educate reservists and their dependents  about TRICARE and to describe reservists\u2019 level of satisfaction with  TRICARE and the types of problems reservists and their dependents  experienced when using TRICARE, we interviewed over 100 reservists  from the Army National Guard and Navy Reserve. We selected these two  groups because they had large numbers of reservists demobilizing that we  were able to interview during the course of our work. We used these  interviews to validate and update information that we gathered from  DOD\u2019s 2003 and 2004 Status of Forces Surveys of Reserve Component  Members, the 2002 Survey of Spouses of Activated National Guard and  Reserve Component Members, and the 2000 Survey of Reserve Component  Members. We also developed and conducted our own survey of TRICARE  benefit counseling and assistance coordinators (BCAC). With the  assistance of DOD officials, we identified BCACs who had direct  experience providing TRICARE counseling and assistance to reservists  and their dependents. DOD officials said that because BCACs assist  reservists and their dependents with problems using TRICARE, they could  provide us with perspective on the types of problems that reservists  experience.", "For a complete discussion of our scope and methodology, see appendix I.

During the cold war era, the  reserve components were a manpower tool that was rarely tapped. For  example, from 1945 to 1989, reservists were mobilized by the federal  government only four times, an average of less than once per decade.  Since 1990, reservists have been mobilized by the federal government six  times, an average of nearly once every 3 years, and have been used  extensively to support operations in the global war on terrorism. Since  September 11, 2001, about 500,000 reservists have been mobilized,  primarily to support operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. This increased  use of the reserves has led to greater congressional interest in the types of  benefits provided to reservists, including the health insurance provided to  reservists and their dependents under TRICARE. Specifically, advocates  for expanding TRICARE have suggested that increasing reservists\u2019 access  to TRICARE could improve the medical readiness of reservists by  facilitating early detection and treatment of medical conditions which  otherwise might disqualify a reservist from deploying. Additionally,  increased access to TRICARE could smooth the transition to and from  active duty for reservists and their dependents, an important factor given  the increased mobilizations of reservists."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Insurance Protections for Reservists", "paragraphs": ["Reservists\u2019 private health insurance coverage is protected by the  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and the Uniformed Services  Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). Included  in these acts are protections for reinstating and maintaining reservists\u2019  health insurance. Specifically, when a reservist whose individual coverage  was terminated while the reservist was on active duty returns from that  duty, SCRA requires private insurance companies to reinstate coverage at  the premium rate the reservist would have been paying had coverage not  been terminated. It also requires insurance companies to cover most  preexisting conditions after a reservist\u2019s insurance is reinstated. USERRA  allows reservists to elect to keep employer-provided health benefits while  the reservists are absent from employment due to active duty, up to a  maximum period of 24 months. For absences of 30 days or less, the  employer must continue to pay its share of the premium. For absences of  31 days or more, the reservist may elect to continue the civilian coverage,  but the employer may charge the reservist the full premium, including the  employer contributions. In addition, under USERRA, employers must  generally reinstate reservists\u2019 health coverage upon their reemployment  and no waiting period or exclusions may be imposed in connection with  that reinstatement. The protections found in SCRA and USERRA also  apply to the health benefits of a reservist\u2019s dependents, if those  dependents were covered under the reservist\u2019s policy prior to his or her  active-duty service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expanded TRICARE Eligibility for Reservists and Their Dependents", "paragraphs": ["Prior to fiscal year 2004, reservists that were not on active duty had limited  eligibility for TRICARE.

Family members  of reservists had generally not been entitled to use TRICARE, but became  eligible if the reservist was serving on active duty for more than 30 days.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2004, Congress made successive changes to  TRICARE that included several provisions which significantly expanded  access to TRICARE for reservists that are not on active duty, and their  dependents. (For a detailed description of the legislative changes that  expanded the TRICARE eligibility of reservists, see app. II.) The NDAA for  Fiscal Year 2004 included a temporary provision in which Congress  authorized members of the Selected Reserve and the Individual Ready  Reserve to enroll in TRICARE if the reservists were eligible for  unemployment compensation or ineligible for health care coverage from  their civilian employer. Another temporary provision allowed reservists  who had received their active-duty orders to use TRICARE for up to   90 days before their active-duty service began. A third temporary provision  extended the length of time that service members could use TRICARE  under the Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP) to   180 days after they were released from active duty.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2005 indefinitely extended the provisions that  provided up to 90 days of TRICARE coverage to reservists prior to the  beginning of active-duty service and 180 days after. It also authorized the  program that DOD has named TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS), which  makes TRICARE coverage available for purchase by certain reservists  after their TAMP coverage ends. As originally authorized, TRS provided  the option of purchasing TRICARE coverage to members of the Selected  Reserve who were mobilized since September 11, 2001, and who  continuously served on active duty for 90 days or more in support of a  contingency operation. To qualify for TRS, reservists had to enter into an  agreement with their respective reserve components to serve in the  Selected Reserve for the number of years that they wished to participate in  TRS. They could receive 1 year of coverage for each 90-day period of this  qualifying service. Electing to enroll in this TRS program was a one-time  opportunity, and as originally authorized, the program required reservists  to sign the new service agreement and register for TRS before leaving  active duty. Figure 1 describes the various periods of TRICARE eligibility  for mobilized reservists and their dependents.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2006 further expanded the number of  reservists and dependents eligible to participate in the TRS program.  Under the expanded program, which became effective on October 1, 2006,  almost all reservists and dependents\u2014regardless of the reservist\u2019s prior  active-duty service\u2014have the option of purchasing TRICARE coverage.  Similar to the original TRS program, members of the Selected Reserve and  dependents choosing to enroll in the expanded TRS program must pay a  monthly premium to receive TRICARE coverage. The premium paid by  reservists and their dependents for coverage varies based on certain  qualifying conditions that must be met, such as whether the reservist has  access to an employer-sponsored health plan. Those who would have been  eligible under the original TRS program because they have qualifying  service in support of a contingency operation pay the lowest premium. In  addition, those reservists with qualifying service in support of a  contingency operation would now have up to 90 days after leaving active  duty to sign the new service agreement required to be eligible for this  lowest premium tier. Table 1 describes the Selected Reservists who are  eligible to purchase TRS and the associated premiums.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2007 significantly restructured the TRS program  by eliminating the three-tiered premium structure. This law provides that  members of the Selected Reserve will be eligible to purchase TRICARE  coverage for themselves and their dependents at the 28 percent premium  rate regardless of whether they have served on active duty in support of a  contingency operation. In addition, eligibility at the 28 percent premium  rate will not depend on the length of a service agreement entered into  following a period of active-duty service.
