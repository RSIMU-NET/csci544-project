Resignations increased as more Afghan staff began the SIV application process than in the initial years of the program, and as State addressed delays that had previously slowed visa issuances. Afghan staff resignations are likely to be lower in 2015 than in previous years based on the number of current staff that have initiated the SIV process. Based on GAO's assessment of changes to average tenure and grade level of Afghan staff from 2010 until June 2015, and insights from agency officials, the effects of SIV-related resignations on State's and USAID's institutional knowledge is varied. For example, average tenure among both agencies' Afghan workforces decreased slightly. In addition, embassy officials said that local staff attrition may affect some program coordination with the Afghan government. Nonetheless, despite this attrition, agency officials reported that they were successful in identifying qualified replacements to fill positions.", "Agencies have taken a number of actions to mitigate the effects of Afghan staff attrition, including SIV-related resignations. For example, State and USAID temporarily transfer experienced local staff from other diplomatic missions to Afghanistan, and the agencies sometimes fill one position with two employees in anticipation of an SIV-related resignation. In addition, the agencies provide additional administrative support from Washington, D.C., beyond what is generally provided to other U.S. missions, and send U.S. personnel to Afghanistan on a temporary basis to fill staffing gaps caused by attrition.", "State and USAID officials said that these agencies have not evaluated actions taken to mitigate the effects of Afghan staff attrition. Officials said agencies have not conducted such assessments because of resource constraints and the reactive nature of operations in such an unpredictable environment. Key principles of human capital management that GAO identified call for agencies to evaluate the contribution that such activities make toward achieving programmatic goals, including those related to the workforce. Without these assessments, it will be difficult for agencies to have information to determine the costs and benefits of actions taken and handle workforce-related needs in challenging environments in the future."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State and USAID evaluate actions intended to mitigate the effects of Afghan local staff resignations.

Previously, Afghan local staff who had experienced or were  experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a consequence of their  U.S. government employment qualified for the visa. While this  standard still applies, the 2013 amendment to the law allowed credible  sworn statements depicting dangerous country conditions to be a  factor in determining the threat to local staff.

USAID officials noted that it can take several  years for local staff to build effective relationships with Afghan  government officials. When Afghan local staff resign, these contacts are  often lost, a result that may affect operations by slowing down program  coordination with the Afghan government.", "Attrition can also affect program management. For example, State has  reported that experienced staffing in grants management is needed to  ensure accountability and proper oversight. Likewise, USAID officials said  that the ability of American staff to perform some aspects of the agency\u2019s  work, such as program monitoring and evaluation, can be affected by  increased demands on their time caused by local staff attrition. Attrition  can lead to American supervisors\u2019 taking on additional responsibilities that  they would not be expected to perform at other posts. For example, State  and USAID officials said that American personnel spend significant  amounts of time training and bringing replacement staff up to speed on  embassy processes and operations as a result of attrition.

However, the period of highest productivity can  be short because these staff are eligible to apply for an SIV after 1 year of  employment with the U.S. government. For example, according to USAID  officials, the agency invests in the training and certification process for  contracting officer representatives. When these Afghan staff resign,  USAID fills the vacancies and goes through the process of recertifying  replacement staff. Embassy managers have reported hesitation about  investing in training because they may not see an adequate return on  their investment. In July 2014, State\u2019s Office of Inspector General  reported that, at that time, only one Afghan staff member in the  embassy\u2019s Consular Affairs office had received supervisory or advanced  consular training, and none of the Afghan staff in the information  management section had received supervisory training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Reported That They Have Successfully Identified Qualified Afghan Staff to Fill Vacancies", "paragraphs": ["State and USAID reported they were successful in identifying qualified  replacements to fill vacancies for local staff positions.

Further, in  August 2014, State\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) noted that mission  operations may be negatively affected without a programmatic approach  to addressing attrition among Afghan staff. State and USAID officials  have also noted that American personnel\u2019s 1-year tours in Afghanistan  create challenges with institutional knowledge. Evaluations can provide  critical information to enable knowledge transfer among American staff in  Afghanistan and minimize duplication of efforts that have already proven  to be ineffective or resource intensive.", "For example, agencies can measure whether actions such as hiring,  training, and retention have changed the skill level of the workforce or  affected the U.S. mission\u2019s capabilities related to maintaining its overseas  presence in Afghanistan. In its draft proposal to employ TCNs in  Afghanistan, State noted that if the program were to proceed, the agency  would need to demonstrate the benefits associated with the employment  of TCNs and justify increased costs. However, in its proposal, State did  not identify any potential measurements to evaluate the benefits of using  TCNs or the additional costs that would be incurred to attract these  individuals to long-term positions in Afghanistan. USAID identified cost  information that could be utilized to evaluate human capital efforts in its  strategic staffing document for Afghanistan, which outlines a number of  proposals to potentially address staffing challenges there. The document  includes examples of resources required and cost analyses of some of  the proposals to mitigate the effects of attrition, such as the option to  offshore positions that may be vacated by Afghan staff to another  embassy in the region. However, USAID officials also said they were not  aware of any completed evaluations of actions taken related to mitigating  the effects of attrition.", "State and USAID officials noted that agencies operate in a reactive state  and face resource constraints managing a large diplomatic mission in a  dangerous and unpredictable environment such as Afghanistan.  Accordingly, agencies may not fully document or evaluate certain efforts.  Key principles for human capital management note that evaluations of  human capital strategies may help agencies determine if they met human  capital goals and whether those strategies helped or hindered the  agencies from reaching their programmatic goals. While the State OIG  has reported that increased security risks in Afghanistan hinder  employees\u2019 ability to assess programs, inadequacies with such  assessments can impair program performance. Nonetheless, State\u2019s  evaluation policy calls for evaluations to improve programs, projects, and  management processes. USAID\u2019s evaluation policy also notes that  though security concerns can pose challenges to conducting evaluations,  creative approaches can be utilized to measure achievements in such  environments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Local staff are a vital component of the success of U.S. diplomatic  missions overseas. The U.S. mission in Afghanistan faces a number of  uncertainties and challenges that make the presence of its Afghan staff all  the more important, including an unpredictable security situation,  relatively short tours among U.S. personnel, and an evolving diplomatic  presence that relies on the U.S. military for security support. State and  USAID have taken a number of actions to mitigate the effects of Afghan  staff attrition, including SIV-related resignations, such as increasing  recruiting efforts and augmenting staff with experienced local staff from  other U.S. missions overseas. However, State and USAID have not  evaluated their actions to address the effects of Afghan staff attrition to  assess the costs or effectiveness of these actions. Information gained  from such evaluations could inform agencies\u2019 workforce planning efforts,  including strategies related to hiring, training, and staff development and  could improve how agencies manage attrition of Afghan staff in the future,  whether because of SIVs or other reasons. Agencies could also share  information learned from these evaluations with one another, particularly  if an agency conducted evaluations on resource-intensive efforts to  mitigate the effects of attrition. For example, USAID has a program in  which third country nationals from U.S. missions in other countries are  employed for periods of 1 year or longer to help mitigate the effects of  attrition among local staff in Afghanistan\u2014a practice that is more costly  than employing Afghan staff and one that can pose challenges for the  U.S. missions that send them. If USAID had evaluated its program,  USAID could have informed State\u2019s assessment of a similar proposal.  Furthermore, without evaluation of mitigating actions that agencies have  previously undertaken, agencies may be unable to weigh the costs and  benefits of actions being implemented, and may be unable to identify the  strategies that are most effective for handling future workforce-related  needs in challenging environments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better understand the costs and effectiveness of actions to mitigate  the effects of Afghan staff attrition, and to inform future workforce  planning efforts, we recommend that  the Secretary of State evaluate these actions, and  the Administrator of USAID evaluate these actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to State and  USAID. In written comments, summarized below and reproduced in  appendix II and III, respectively, State and USAID agreed with the  recommendation to evaluate actions to mitigate the effects of Afghan staff  attrition.", "In its written comments, State agreed with the recommendation. State  noted that the Afghanistan SIV program has had considerable impact on  mission staffing levels and SIV-related resignations are currently the  largest contributing factor for increased attrition among local staff.   However, State wrote that many elements should be taken into  consideration when looking at sustaining a workforce capable of meeting  U.S. goals and objectives in Afghanistan. Further, State noted that  strategically approaching workforce planning is complicated by, among  other things, the unpredictable nature of events in a dangerous  environment. State said that it evaluates staffing levels as part of its  regular agency-wide review processes, and that a specific analysis of  actions taken to mitigate attrition among Afghan staff would be reactive in  nature and have minimal value added in a more complex staffing picture.   Nevertheless, as we note in this report, an evaluation of the relative costs  and effectiveness of specific actions taken to mitigate effects related to  local staff attrition could help determine if State has effectively filled gaps  in institutional knowledge from attrition among Afghan staff, and enable  knowledge transfer among American staff in Afghanistan.", "In its written comments, USAID agreed with the recommendation. USAID  noted that it proactively tracks staffing levels in Afghanistan, and has  taken steps to develop and implement creative approaches to staffing.   For example, USAID said that, in addition to weekly and monthly staffing  reports, from January to October 2015 it conducted seven ad hoc  analyses regarding locally employed staff for internal and external  audiences. In addition, USAID said it regularly discusses staff retention  and recruitment and staffing mechanisms at strategic management  meetings. According to USAID, these meetings serve as a venue to  discuss, evaluate, and iterate strategies and other efforts to mitigate the  effects of local staff resignations. We will continue to work with USAID in  monitoring the implementation of the recommendation.", "State and USAID also provided technical comments that we incorporated,  as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of State, the Administrator of USAID, and other  interested parties.

We reviewed  background on the SIV program for Afghan nationals, including relevant  legislation and a report from the Congressional Research Service. In  order to provide background information on the SIV program for Afghan  nationals, we also utilized reports published by State and the Department  of Homeland Security on the SIV program for Afghan nationals, primarily  data on visa issuances and general processing times.", "To assess SIV-related resignations, and how, if at all, State\u2019s and  USAID\u2019s workforces in Afghanistan have been affected by the  resignations of SIV recipients in recent years, we obtained and analyzed  data for each calendar year, 2010 through 2014, and for January to June  or August 1, 2015. We performed longitudinal analysis of the data in  order to identify the initial extent of SIV effects, significant trends or  changes over time, and any correlation between variables. We assessed  data on Afghan staff for the following categories: the number of SIV- related resignations at State and USAID, the number of employment  certification letters State and USAID issued to Afghan staff, average  tenure of State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s current staff, and average grade levels of  USAID\u2019s current staff.", "We analyzed data on SIV-related resignations related to the  special category of SIVs created by the Afghan Allies Protection  Act of 2009. State and USAID provided these data, which included  only Afghan staff who departed their positions after receiving an  SIV and did not include those who departed employment for other  reasons. These data were relevant to Afghan local staff but did not  include third country nationals or other staff working in  Afghanistan on a temporary duty basis. Agencies provided data  on start and end dates of employment for those Afghan staff who  resigned after receiving SIVs.", "We utilized data on average tenure and grade level of Afghan  local staff as rough indicators of institutional knowledge. Both  agencies provided start and end dates of employment, from which  we calculated average tenure. While average tenure provides an  overall summary of yearly trends, a relatively small drop in  average tenure can be associated with a relatively larger increase  in the number of newly hired Afghan staff. Agency data  demonstrated this increase in the number of newly hired Afghan  staff. For example, in June 2015, USAID had 92 Afghan staff with  less than a year\u2019s tenure, representing about 46 percent of the  agency\u2019s local staff, compared with 65 in December 2012,  representing about 30 percent of the agency\u2019s local staff. In  addition to calculating averages, we also calculated and examined  yearly median tenure levels and considered the distribution of  length of tenure. USAID provided staff grade levels but State  could not provide similar data for its Afghan staff. We analyzed  average tenure and grade level for a single-month slice of each  year within the scope of our analysis (i.e., May 2015 and  December for all other years). Accordingly, the data do not  represent all Afghan local staff who worked for State or USAID  over the course of any particular year. Average tenure rates were  also affected by local staff separating from mission employment  for reasons other than SIVs, such as retirements or terminations.  The data the agencies provided did not report whether newly hired  local staff had previously been agency employees and may  therefore understate the actual experience these staff brought to  their agencies.", "We also utilized data related to recruitment of local staff from the 2010  through 2014 local compensation questionnaires for Afghanistan. This  annual questionnaire gathers input from all U.S. agencies at an overseas  mission across a range of topics related to the local workforce.", "To assess the reliability of State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s data and responses to the  local compensation questionnaires, we interviewed knowledgeable  human resources officials from State in Kabul and solicited input from  both agencies on their internal controls, potential data vulnerabilities, and  any incidence of missing data. We determined the data to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To assess the actions, if any, State and USAID have taken to mitigate  any effects related to the attrition of Afghan staff, including SIV recipients,  we reviewed agency documents that described these efforts, including  any analyses agencies had undertaken.", "To assess the extent to which State and USAID have evaluated mitigating  actions related to the attrition of Afghan staff, including SIV recipients, we  reviewed criteria for key principles in strategic human capital  management, State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s evaluation policies, and agency  documents that included workforce-related planning and analyses. We  also reviewed State\u2019s August 2014 Office of Inspector General Inspection  of Embassy Kabul, Afghanistan, for the recommendations it made to  address challenges associated with attrition in the Afghan workforce.
