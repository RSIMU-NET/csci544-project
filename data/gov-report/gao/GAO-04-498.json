An increase in material costs accounted for about 67 percent of the total increase and was by far the most significant factor. The Air Force has identified some of the causes of the higher material costs such as aging aircraft, but has yet to complete an effective and comprehensive analysis of material cost increases. As a result, it (1) cannot quantify the extent to which individual causes contributed to higher costs and (2) does not know if it has identified all of the major causes. GAO's analysis of the other four factors showed that (1) the increase in labor costs was due largely to events beyond the group's control, such as annual salary increases, (2) the increase in business operations costs was due partly to costs related to implementing a new accounting system, (3) a surcharge intended to recoup anticipated losses on work carried over from the previous fiscal year may have been unnecessary, and (4) a surcharge intended to generate additional cash in fiscal year 2004 for the Air Force Working Capital Fund was unnecessary. GAO's analysis showed that due in part to these surcharges (1) the Air Force Working Capital Fund, which includes the depot maintenance and several other activity groups, had a $2.5 billion cash balance as of January 31, 2004 and (2) this balance was more than $1.3 billion higher than the maximum level allowed by DOD policy. Either the Office of the Secretary of Defense or the Congress could use this unneeded cash to satisfy other requirements. DOD officials told us that they are exploring options on what to do with the excess cash. GAO's analysis of the group's financial reports showed that prices charged customers were not set high enough to recover about $1.1 billion of the group's reported costs for fiscal years 2000 through 2003. The activity group is required by DOD policy to set prices to recoup the cost of doing work. However, Air Force officials informed us that the prices were artificially constrained to help ensure that the group's customers would be able to get needed work done with the amount of funds provided to them through the budget process. The Air Force changed its sales price development philosophy to bring prices charged customers in fiscal year 2004 more in line with operating costs. In addition, the Air Force allowed out-of-cycle price increases in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to alleviate projected losses. Further, the Air Force Materiel Command has not been successful in its efforts to control costs. Although several promising initiatives are underway, the Command has not (1) developed a successful methodology for analyzing the reasons for the rapid material cost increase and (2) effectively utilized an established data repository for sharing cost-saving ideas among the three air logistics centers on process improvements and to demonstrate whether its cost savings initiatives have been successful."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force depot maintenance activity group supports combat readiness  by providing services necessary to keep Air Force units operating  worldwide.

For example, in fiscal year 2002, the Air Force reported that the depot  maintenance activity group\u2019s three air logistics centers\u2019 in-house operations  performed major modifications on 852 aircraft, overhauled 515 aircraft  engines, and repaired 352,995 inventory items. In doing so, the group  operates under the working capital fund concept, where customers are to  be charged for the anticipated full cost of goods and services.

Because the activity group\u2019s customers are expected to request  about 20.8 million hours of in-house work in fiscal year 2004, this means  that customers will have to pay about $4.9 billion for work that they would  have paid about $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2000.", "As requested and agreed to with your office, this report discusses three  issues related to this large price increase. Our objectives were to determine  (1) what factors were primarily responsible for the price increase, (2) if the  prices charged customers during fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2003  recovered the reported actual costs of performing the work, and (3) if the  Air Force has taken effective steps to improve efficiency and control the  activity group\u2019s costs. Our review was performed from June 2003 through  April 2004 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing  standards. Most of the financial information in this report is budget data  obtained from official Air Force budget documents. The accounting data  used in this report was obtained from official Air Force accounting reports.  Although we did not validate the accuracy of the underlying transactions  that made up the summary level data, the budget and accounting  information is used by the Air Force, the Department of Defense (DOD),  and congressional committees to make decisions regarding the amount of  funds customers receive to purchase goods and services from the depot  maintenance activity group.

DOD  policy requires working capital fund activity groups to (1) establish sales  prices that allow them to recover their expected costs from their customers  and (2) operate on a break-even basis over time\u2014that is, not make a profit  nor incur a loss. DOD policy also requires the activity group to establish its  sales prices prior to the start of each fiscal year and to apply these  predetermined or \u201cstabilized\u201d prices to most orders received during the  year\u2014regardless of when the work is actually accomplished or what costs  are actually incurred. For the depot maintenance activity group, DOD  policy also requires the group to recoup unbudgeted losses of $10 million  or more in the year in which they occurred. In the case of losses that occur  in the fourth quarter, the losses are to be recovered in the first quarter of  the next fiscal year.", "Developing accurate prices is challenging since the process to determine  the prices begins about 2 years in advance of when the work is actually  received and performed. In essence, the activity group\u2019s budget  development has to coincide with the development of its customers\u2019  budgets so that they both use the same set of assumptions. To develop  prices, the activity group estimates (1) labor, material, overhead, and other  costs based on anticipated demand for work as projected by customers,   (2) total direct labor hours for each type of work performed, such as  aircraft, engines, and repairable inventory items, (3) the workforce\u2019s  productivity, and (4) savings due to productivity and other cost avoidance  initiatives. In order for an activity group to operate on a break-even basis, it  is extremely important that the activity group accurately estimate the work  it will perform and the costs of performing the work. Higher-than-expected  costs or lower-than-expected customer demand for goods and services can  cause the activity group to incur losses. Conversely, lower-than-expected  costs or higher-than-expected customer demand for goods and services can  result in profits. With sales prices based on assumptions that are made as  long as 2 years before the prices go into effect, some variance between  expected and actual costs is inevitable."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Activity Group\u2019s Financial Reports Are Not Accurate", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that DOD has had long-standing problems in  preparing accurate working capital fund financial reports. The DOD  Inspector General and/or the Air Force Audit Agency have not been able to  express an opinion on the reliability of the working capital fund\u2019s financial  statements for fiscal years 1993 through 2003. The auditors reported that  the financial information was unreliable and financial systems and  processes, as well as associated internal control structures, were  inadequate to produce reliable financial information. The Air Force  recognized that the existing legacy depot maintenance accounting systems  that were designed in the 1960s and 1970s did not produce usable,  complete, reliable, timely, consistent, and auditable information. According  to the Air Force, among other things, these systems (1) were not  transaction driven, (2) did not capture costs at the task level, and (3) did  not produce accurate financial statements.", "To help improve the depot maintenance activity group\u2019s financial  management operations, in January 1998, the Assistant Secretary of the Air  Force for Financial Management approved the implementation of the  Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System\u2014which includes  an accounting system called the Defense Industrial Financial Management  System (DIFMS) that originally belonged to the Navy\u2014at the depots  located at the air logistics centers.

By far the most significant of these  factors was material costs, which accounted for about 67 percent of the  total increase. Air Force depot maintenance officials have yet to complete  an effective and comprehensive analysis to determine the underlying  causes of the material cost increases. Our analysis of the other four factors  identified a variety of underlying causes, some of which were beyond the  activity group\u2019s control, such as rising health care costs and maintenance  and modernization of equipment and facilities. However, our analysis of the  two factors that involved surcharges determined that the carryover  surcharge (based on anticipated losses on work carried over from the  previous fiscal year) was probably too high for fiscal year 2004 and may  have been unnecessary, while the fiscal year 2004 cash surcharge was  unnecessary and should not have been added to the depot\u2019s composite  hourly sales price. Details on the five factors follow.", "Higher budgeted material costs accounted for about 67 percent of the  total increase in the composite hourly sales price. Air Force depot  maintenance officials provided anecdotal evidence to show that the  higher material costs were caused at least partly by (1) the need to  replace component parts more frequently because of both safety  concerns and the aging of aircraft and engines and (2) increases in the  prices that the depot maintenance activity group must pay its suppliers  for component parts. However, because Air Force depot maintenance  officials have not completed a comprehensive analysis to determine the  underlying causes of why their material costs have increased, they  cannot quantify the impact of the identified causes and are unsure if  they have identified all of the major causes.", "Higher budgeted labor costs accounted for about 10 percent of the  increase in the activity group\u2019s composite hourly sales price. Our  analysis showed that the higher labor costs were caused largely by  factors beyond the activity group\u2019s control, such as annual salary  increases for federal employees and rising health care costs.", "Higher non-labor, non-material overhead costs, which the Air Force  calls business operations costs, accounted for about 8 percent of the  total increase. Our analysis showed that the primary causes were   (1) costs related to the implementation of a new accounting system and  (2) the fact that the fiscal year 2004 budget provided significant  increases in several areas where expenditures had been constrained for  several years, such as the maintenance and modernization of equipment  and facilities.", "An increase in the surcharge included in the composite hourly sales  prices to recoup anticipated losses on work carried over from the  previous fiscal year (carryover surcharge) accounted for about 7  percent of the total increase in the sales price. Our analysis showed that  the fiscal year 2004 carryover surcharge was probably too high and may  have been unnecessary.", "An increase in the surcharge included in the composite hourly sales  prices to generate additional cash (cash surcharge) accounted for about  3 percent of the total increase in the sales price. Our analysis also  showed that the fiscal year 2004 cash surcharge was unnecessary  because the Air Force Working Capital Fund\u2019s $2.5 billion cash balance  as of January 31, 2004, was already more than $1.3 billion higher than  the maximum level allowed by DOD policy. Either the Office of the  Secretary of Defense or the Congress could use this unneeded cash to  satisfy other requirements.", "Table 1 shows the impact these factors had on the group\u2019s composite sales  price. As table 1 also shows, about 5 percent of the price increase was due  to factors we either did not identify or could not quantify."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spiraling Material Costs Are Primary Cause of Price Increases, but Further Analysis Is Needed to Fully Identify Underlying Causes", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 1, although many factors contributed to the increase that  occurred in the composite hourly sales price for fiscal years 2000 through  2004, higher budgeted material costs were, by far, the most significant.  Further, our analysis showed that higher budgeted material costs had an  even greater impact on some workloads. For example, the sales price for  the repair of E-3 airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft  increased from $119.69 per hour in fiscal year 2000 to $330.06 per hour in  fiscal year 2004, about 176 percent, and the price for the repair of F108-100  engines used in the KC-135 aircraft increased from $183,240 per engine in  fiscal year 2000 to $1,214,124 per engine in fiscal year 2004, about 563  percent. Figure 1 shows the activity group\u2019s budgeted and reported actual  material costs per direct labor hour of work accomplished (material  expense rate) for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. While Air Force depot  maintenance officials can provide anecdotal evidence on why the activity  group\u2019s overall material costs have increased, they have yet to complete an  effective and comprehensive analysis to determine why material costs have  increased.", "Air Force depot maintenance officials believe the activity group\u2019s higher  material costs can be attributed, to a large extent, to increased material  usage that has been caused by (1) the aging of the Air Force\u2019s aircraft and  engine inventory and (2) safety concerns. Further, they can provide  anecdotal evidence to support their views. For example:   Material costs related to the F-15 aircraft, which is more than 30 years  old, have increased significantly over the past several years, in part, due  to its age. For example, the Air Force is in the process of replacing the  aircraft\u2019s structural surfaces with a material\u2014called gridlock\u2014that is  more expensive than the material that was used in the past to make  structural repairs. According to Air Force officials at the air logistics  center making the repairs, the new material is not prone to the problems  that plagued the old material. As a result, the new material should allow  for longer intervals between structural surface repairs and reduce  structural repair costs in the future. For fiscal year 2003, the gridlock  material added $24.5 million to the estimated cost of material to be used  to repair the F-15 and $20.47 to the hourly rate charged customers for  maintenance work on the aircraft.", "Due primarily to actions taken in response to safety concerns, the depot  maintenance activity group raised the sales price for the repair of F101- GE-102 high-pressure turbine rotor assemblies from $144,464 in fiscal  year 2003 to $261,872 in fiscal year 2004, an increase of $117,408 or 81  percent. From 1999 through 2002, three F-16 aircraft crashed due to  engine failures caused by metal fatigue on the engine\u2019s high-pressure  turbine rotor. To address this safety problem, the Oklahoma City air  logistics center began replacing the rotors on similar aircraft engines  more frequently and started using more expensive rotors that were  made of a stronger, more heat resistant metal alloy.", "Depot maintenance officials have also determined that another major  cause of their higher material costs is price growth. The activity group pays  various suppliers for component parts that it uses to repair aircraft,  engines, and other items. Depot maintenance officials stated that their  analysis showed that the amount they had to pay for repairable component  parts in fiscal year 2003 was about 9 percent higher than the price they had  to pay for the same component parts in fiscal year 2002. Similarly, the  activity group\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget and, in turn, its fiscal year 2004  prices were based on the assumption that the prices it would have to pay its  suppliers for repairable component parts would increase an additional 14  percent.", "Another major cause of the activity group\u2019s higher material costs relates to  the workloads that were transferred from two closing air logistics centers  (Sacramento and San Antonio) to the three remaining centers (Ogden,  Oklahoma City, and Warner Robins) in the late 1990s. Depot maintenance  officials acknowledged that when workloads were moved from the closing  air logistics centers to the remaining centers in the late 1990s, millions of  dollars of material were also transferred. Officials at one center  acknowledged that this material was never recorded in the center\u2019s  accounting records. When the maintenance shops needed component parts  to accomplish the transferred workloads, they used the transferred  material and did not record an expense in their financial records. This  caused their reported material expenses to be understated in fiscal year  2000. However, since most of the transferred material has now been  consumed, they now have to record the new material being purchased as  expenses in their financial records. Consequently, part of what appears to  be higher material costs is a more accurate reflection of actual costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Efforts to Develop an Effective and Systematic Methodology for Analyzing Material Cost Variances Have Been Ongoing for Several Years", "paragraphs": ["In August 2000, we reported that the Air Force depot maintenance activity  group did not have an effective, systematic process for identifying and  analyzing variances between planned and actual material costs.

The report also pointed out that such an analysis  could be used to validate Air Force officials\u2019 view that increased material  usage is caused by external factors beyond the Air Force Materiel  Command\u2019s control, such as the aging of the Air Force\u2019s aircraft and engine  inventory. The report recommended that the Secretary of the Air Force  direct the Commander, Air Force Materiel Command, to develop a  systematic process to identify and analyze variances between depot  maintenance activities\u2019 planned and actual material usage.

This increase,  which is shown in table 2, was due to both an increase in the budgeted  average cost of civilian labor and a decline in budgeted productivity.", "Although the increase in the labor expense rate was the second most  significant reason for the composite sales price\u2019s increase during this  period, the labor costs\u2019 relative impact on the overall composite sales price  declined significantly during this 5-year period.

Specifically, our analysis showed that about $7.25 of  the $11.86 increase in the budgeted labor expense rate was due to an  increase in the average cost of civilian labor from about $57,434 per work  year per employee in fiscal year 2000 to about $65,132 in fiscal year 2004.  This increase, in turn, was due to two factors: (1) budget estimates for the  average annual cost of employee compensation (for basic salary and such  variables as holiday and overtime pay) increased by $5,649 per work year  per employee, or about 3 percent per year, and (2) budget estimates for the  average annual cost of employee benefits (employer contributions for such  things as health and life insurance) increased by about $2,049, or about 5  percent per year.", "The rest of the increase in the budgeted labor expense rate\u2014about $4.61  per hour\u2014was the result of a 7 percent decline in budget estimates for  worker productivity. Our analysis showed that this decline was not the  result of an actual decline in reported actual worker productivity, but  rather was due to overly optimistic productivity assumptions for fiscal  years 2000 through 2003 and what appears to be an overly pessimistic  productivity assumption for fiscal year 2004.", "Specifically, our analysis showed that (1) the activity group\u2019s reported  actual productivity increased about 4 percent between fiscal year 2000 and  fiscal year 2003, but was consistently less than the budget estimate and   (2) the fiscal year 2004 budget estimate was based on the assumption that  the fiscal year 2004 productivity would be 3 percent less than the reported  actual level for fiscal year 2003.", "When we asked Air Force Materiel Command officials why the activity  group\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget estimate was based on the assumption that  the workforce\u2019s productivity would decline, they acknowledged that the  budget assumption was probably too pessimistic. However, they also stated  that they still believe that several initiatives that the Command is  implementing will cause some decline in reported actual productivity  during fiscal year 2004. For example, they indicated that the workforce\u2019s  overall productivity is likely to decline, at least in the short term, because  they plan to add about 167 overhead positions in order to implement a  more effective process improvement strategy, improve the activity group\u2019s  management of its infrastructure, and develop a methodology and tool to  improve financial forecasting.", "We attempted to review reported actual productivity data for the first part  of fiscal year 2004 to determine if the fiscal year 2004 budget estimate was  based on an overly pessimistic productivity assumption.

Most ($7.99, or 83 percent) of this  increase occurred between the fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 budget  estimates. An Air Force Materiel Command official stated that the large  increase in business operations funding for fiscal year 2004 was due largely  to the Air Force\u2019s realization that infrastructure support and other essential  support services had been budgeted too low for several years and needed  to be a higher priority in fiscal year 2004. For example, Air Force  Headquarters reduced business operations cost projections that were  included in the activity group\u2019s initial fiscal year 2003 budget estimate by  about $92 million because of concern about the projected large price  increase and a desire to hold down costs, if possible. This reduction, in  turn, forced the activity group to cut back on certain requirements, such as  the repair and modernization of facilities and equipment.

Similarly, Air Force depot  maintenance officials stated that the decision to phase out their old legacy  systems is the primary reason why depreciation costs for automated data  systems and equipment increased from about $92.2 million in fiscal year  2000 to about $122.7 million in fiscal year 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Work Carried Over from Previous Fiscal Year Contributed to Price Increase", "paragraphs": ["During periods of increasing costs, the depot maintenance activity group  generally incurs financial losses on work that is carried over from one  fiscal year to the next.

In  other words, the activity group generally incurs financial losses on its  \u201ccarryover\u201d work because (1) the cost of doing the work generally goes up  from one year to the next and (2) the stabilized price policy prevents the  activity group from increasing its prices to cover the higher costs.

However, the activity  group reported a profit of about $80 million for the first quarter. When we  discussed this inconsistency with depot maintenance officials, they agreed  that most of the carryover losses should have occurred in the first quarter,  but they also indicated that they did not know if the reported profit   (1) indicated that the carryover surcharge was unnecessary or (2) was  unreliable due to problems related to the implementation of a new  accounting system which, as discussed later in this report, has adversely  affected the reliability of the activity group\u2019s reported accounting data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Year 2004 Cash Surcharge Will Generate Excess Cash", "paragraphs": ["Working capital funds are required to maintain cash balances that are  sufficient to finance the operations of their activity groups, but are not to  tie up resources.

It is important to note that (1) this  cash requirement applies to the total working capital fund and (2) there is  no requirement for individual activity groups to maintain a specific cash  balance (for example, a cash surplus in one activity group can offset a  deficit in another).", "If projections of cash disbursements and collections indicate that cash  balances will drop below prescribed levels, the Air Force Working Capital  Fund can generate additional cash by adding a surcharge to one or more of  its activity groups\u2019 composite sales prices. Additionally, if for some reason  the cash balance becomes too low and there is a possibility of an Antideficiency Act violation, the working capital funds are required to  generate additional cash. One way to raise cash is by advance billing  customers for work not yet performed. Conversely, if the cash balances are  too high, customer prices can be reduced or possibly either the Office of  the Secretary of Defense or the Congress can transfer the unneeded funds  to other appropriations to either reduce budget requests or finance  additional requirements.", "About $3.55, or 3 percent, of the increase in the depot maintenance activity  group\u2019s composite hourly sales price can be attributed to an increase in the  cash surcharge. Our work showed that Air Force Headquarters decided to  include a cash surcharge in the depot maintenance activity group\u2019s fiscal  year 2004 sales price. Our work also showed that the depot maintenance  activity group\u2019s fiscal year 2004 cash surcharge is unnecessary and, more  importantly, that the Air Force Working Capital Fund will have a  substantial amount of excess cash on hand at the end of fiscal year 2004  unless either the Office of the Secretary of Defense or the Congress uses  this unneeded cash to satisfy other requirements. As noted previously, DOD  policy guidance requires the Air Force Working Capital Fund to maintain a  cash balance of 7 to 10 days of operational costs and 6 months of capital  disbursements, which equates to $924 million and about $1.2 billion. Our  analysis showed that the Air Force Working Capital Fund\u2019s end-of-month  cash balance was at least $2.2 billion for each of the first 4 months of fiscal  year 2004 and was more than $2.5 billion as of January 31, 2004. The   $2.5 billion amount was more than $1.3 billion higher than the maximum  allowed by DOD policy. Most of the excess cash was generated by the work  performed by the U.S. Transportation Command, whose cash is included in  the Air Force Working Capital Fund.", "When we contacted Office of the Secretary of Defense officials in March  2004 about the Air Force Working Capital Fund\u2019s excess cash, in general,  and the depot maintenance activity group\u2019s fiscal year 2004 cash surcharge,  in particular, they stated that they allowed the Air Force to include a cash  surcharge in its depot maintenance activity group\u2019s fiscal year 2004 sales  prices because (1) problems related to ongoing efforts to implement a new  accounting system made the reliability of the activity group\u2019s accounting  data questionable and (2) uncertainty related to ongoing actions to remove  contract depot maintenance operations from the Air Force Working Capital  Fund made it difficult to reliably project future cash collections and  disbursements. However, they also acknowledged that the Air Force  Working Capital Fund has had a substantial amount of excess cash  throughout fiscal year 2004 and stated that they would be exploring  possible uses for the excess cash over the next few months."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Prices Charged Customers Were Not Set High Enough to Recover Costs", "paragraphs": ["Prices that the depot maintenance activity group charged customers were  not set high enough to recover the group\u2019s reported costs of performing the  work. Air Force officials at the three air logistics centers and the Air Force  Materiel Command informed us that the activity group\u2019s prices were not set  high enough because the Air Force artificially constrained the activity  group\u2019s prices for fiscal years 2000 through 2003 by not including all  anticipated costs in the prices. In part, because the sales prices were set  too low during this period, the activity group reported losing about   $1.1 billion, as shown in table 3.", "To help recoup the losses, the activity group billed and collected more than  $1 billion from customers outside the pricing structure. As a result, the  effective prices actually paid by customers were significantly higher during  fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002.", "The Air Force changed its sales price development philosophy in 2002 in an  effort to bring prices charged customers in fiscal year 2004 more in line  with operating costs.

For example, at one center we found that sales prices for  work on inventory items performed by the avionics shop were constrained  by not including all estimated costs of materials to be used in  accomplishing the work. In developing its fiscal year 2003 customer prices,  this shop estimated that its material costs would be about $160 million.  However, because of the pricing constraints levied by the Air Force, the  avionics shop was only allowed to include about $123 million of material  costs in its prices, a difference of about $37 million. However, constraining  prices is contrary to DOD policy (DOD Financial Management Regulation,  7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9) that requires activity groups to set prices  to recover the full cost of providing goods and services to customers so  that the working capital fund activity group would operate on a break-even  basis\u2014that is, not make a profit or incur a loss."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Changed Its Sales Price Development Philosophy", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2002, Air Force headquarters reversed its philosophy of  constraining customer sales prices when it was developing the depot  maintenance activity group\u2019s fiscal year 2004 prices to reduce the risk of  future financial losses.

Specifically, in June 2002, the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force directed the Air Force Materiel  Command to direct each air logistics center to increase the sales (repair)  prices on 20 inventory items that it estimated were going to lose the most  dollars. These price increases were effective beginning July 1, 2002\u2014the  last quarter of fiscal year 2002. Our analysis of data provided by the three  air logistics centers showed that this action increased the activity group\u2019s  revenue by about $23 million, thus avoiding additional losses by this same  amount.", "By authority of the same June 2002 directive, the three air logistics centers  were also directed to increase their fiscal year 2003 sales prices to avoid an  estimated $443 million loss that was being projected for fiscal year 2003 at  that time. This out-of-cycle increase resulted in the prices charged  customers increasing from $179.42 an hour to $199.66 an hour,  approximately $20 per hour. The air logistics centers were not provided  guidance regarding how the price increase was to be applied to their  individual workloads. One center applied the increase \u201cacross the board\u201d to  all workloads. Another center applied the increase primarily to its aircraft  workload. The third center applied the increase primarily to its aircraft  workload and also increased the sales price for one of its engines. As  shown in table 4, how this increase was implemented had a profound  impact on some of the fiscal year 2003 prices charged customers, resulting  in price increases significantly higher than the average $20 per hour. In  some cases the prices increased by more than 50 percent.", "The $20 per hour average sales price increase for fiscal year 2003 was  intended to make the activity group break even at the end of fiscal year  2003 based on projected losses at the time the decision was made to  increase prices. Even though sales prices were increased\u2014significantly in  some cases as shown in table 4\u2014the activity group still reported a financial  loss at the end of the fiscal year. According to an Air Force Materiel  Command official, when the estimated price increase was developed they  did not consider that some of the revenue from the fiscal year 2003 price  increase would be realized in fiscal year 2004 because of work started  and/or accepted in fiscal year 2003 that had to be carried over and  completed in fiscal year 2004.", "Further, we found that the amount of the reported loss at the end of fiscal  year 2003 was questionable. Based on our analysis of the financial data and  discussions with activity group officials, the Air Force\u2019s implementation of  the new accounting system, DIFMS, resulted in wide swings in the group\u2019s  reported net operating results during fiscal year 2003. For example, one air  logistics center\u2019s net operating results went from a $1 million loss to a   $94 million loss over a period of 1 month due to the implementation of  DIFMS. Another center reported a profit throughout most of fiscal year  2003, including a reported profit of $137 million at the end of August 2003.  However, the center ended the fiscal year with a reported loss of   $17 million\u2014a $154 million shift in 1 month\u2014due to the implementation of  the new accounting system.

According to Air Force depot maintenance  documentation, these initiatives are intended to eliminate waste or non- value-added processes for selected business lines, thereby reducing the  number of flow days, improving the usage of available workspace, and  reducing the overtime worked. In implementing these initiatives, Air Force  officials visited over 35 private industry companies to gather information to  improve their processes. For example, officials at the Oklahoma City Air  Logistics Center consulted with Standard Aero (San Antonio), Inc. to  reengineer its constant speed drive repair process. According to the  center\u2019s documentation, this initiative, to date, has reduced flow days by 20,  reduced the part rejection rate by 25 percent, and resulted in an additional  $2.9 million in revenue over pre-2002 levels.

As of October 2003, the data repository contained 108 process  improvement initiatives.", "We found three problems with the implementation of this instruction and  the creation of the Command data repository. First, we found that several  large process improvement initiatives were not included in the data  repository. For example, the process improvement projects that make up  the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center\u2019s initiative to transform the largest  industrial facility in the DOD\u2014its building 3001\u2014into a world class depot  maintenance facility were not included in the Command data repository.  According to Command Depot Maintenance Transformation officials, this  initiative is beyond what they were targeting to document and capture in  the data repository, but they agreed that the individual projects resulting  from this initiative should be included. These officials also acknowledged  that the major projects that currently make up their F-15 Trailblazer  initiative\u2014to evaluate, test, and redefine business processes for repairing  the Air Force\u2019s F-15 aircraft\u2014were not in the data repository. Air Force  Materiel Command officials stated that the projects from these two large  initiatives need to be included in the data repository in order for the  Command to oversee the process improvement initiatives at each of the  centers. The officials added that they plan to add these initiatives to the  data repository as they become better defined. The Command officials also  stated that the data repository has not been as fully used as envisioned and  that not all process improvement initiatives have been entered as required  by the Air Force Materiel Command Instruction 21-137.", "Second, while the Air Force Materiel Command created a data repository  of ongoing initiatives to provide needed oversight of its improvement  initiatives, the information in the data repository has not proved useful  because in many cases the centers failed to fill in the data fields for each  initiative. As a result, we found that some of the required data fields were  missing important information needed to centrally manage the process  improvement initiatives. For example, 51 of the 108 initiatives had no title  clearly describing the initiative. Another important required data field to  identify the root causes of the problem to be corrected or improved was  not completed for 54 of the 108 initiatives. Command officials agreed that  the data repository has not been as useful as envisioned because many of  the initiatives entered have not been fully documented since the centers  have not completed the needed or required data fields.", "Third, the Air Force Materiel Command Instruction 21-137 also requires  that the process improvement results be recorded and tracked in the  Command data repository including the costs and benefits associated with  each initiative. However, the Command\u2019s input guidance to record process  improvements in the data repository does not require that the data fields  for costs, return on investment, and quantifiable results be completed. This  contradicts the Command Instruction 21-137, which requires this  information. As a result, we found the following:  Cost information to implement the initiative was not recorded in the  data repository for 89 of the 108 initiatives. Of the 19 initiatives  containing some cost information, only 10 initiatives had recorded costs  totaling $6,328,000.

Of the 15  initiatives containing some return on investment information, only two  initiatives had recorded a return on investment totaling $828,000. The  remaining 13 initiatives had recorded return on investment information  with no dollar savings identified or as not applicable.", "Quantifiable results information\u2014such as flow days reduced\u2014was not  recorded in the data repository for 64 of the 108 initiatives. We analyzed  the recorded information for the remaining initiatives containing  quantifiable results and found that they did report improvements such  as reducing the number of flow days and man days and improving the  usage of available workspace.", "An official at one air logistics center pointed out that in addition to  reporting their improvement initiatives in the Command data repository,  they maintain their projects on two additional local databases. Since none  of these databases can communicate with one another, each database is  separately maintained and updated by the program managers and the  process improvement office. This is difficult to do in a timely manner and  leads to differences among the databases. The center has approved a  process improvement initiative to standardize these databases.  Additionally, a Command depot maintenance transformation official stated  that in preparing for a presentation to the Command\u2019s depot maintenance  management team he had to contact the three air logistics centers directly  to obtain complete project information for his presentation. He emphasized  that this would not have been necessary if the three centers had been  updating the data repository with complete and useful information as  required.
