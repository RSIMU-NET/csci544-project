Under the act, both the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and federal agencies have responsibilities for managing federal records, including e-mail records. In view of the importance that e-mail plays in documenting government activities, GAO was asked, among other things, to review the extent to which NARA provides oversight of federal records management, describe selected agencies' processes for managing e-mail records, and assess these agencies' e-mail policies and key practices. To do so, GAO examined NARA guidance, regulations, and oversight activities, as well as e-mail policies at four agencies (of contrasting sizes and structures) and the practices of selected officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although NARA has responsibilities for oversight of agencies' records and records management programs and practices, including conducting inspections or surveys, performing studies, and reporting results to the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in recent years NARA's oversight activities have been primarily limited to performing studies. NARA has conducted no inspections of agency records management programs since 2000, because it uses inspections only to address cases of the highest risk, and no recent cases have met its criteria. In addition, NARA has not consistently reported details on records management problems or recommended practices that were discovered as a result of its studies. Without more comprehensive evaluations of agency records management, NARA has limited assurance that agencies are appropriately managing the records in their custody and that important records are not lost. The four agencies reviewed generally managed e-mail records through paper-based processes, rather than using electronic recordkeeping. A transition to electronic recordkeeping was under way at one of the four agencies, and two had long-term plans to use electronic recordkeeping. (The fourth agency had no current plans to make such a transition.) Each of the business units that GAO reviewed (one at each agency) maintained \"case\" files to fulfill its mission and used these for recordkeeping. The practice at the units was to include e-mail printouts in the case files if the e-mail contained information necessary to document the case--that is, record material. These printouts included transmission data and distribution lists, as required. All four agencies had e-mail records management policies that addressed, with a few exceptions, the requirements in NARA's regulations. However, the practices of senior officials at those agencies did not always conform to requirements. Of the 15 senior officials whose practices were reviewed, the e-mail records for 7 (including all 4 at one agency) were managed in compliance with requirements. (One additional official was selected for review but did not use e-mail.) The other 8 officials generally kept e-mail messages, record or nonrecord, in e-mail systems that were not recordkeeping systems. (Among other things, recordkeeping systems allow related records to be categorized according to their business purposes.) If e-mail records are not kept in recordkeeping systems, they may be harder to find and use, as well as being at increased risk of loss from inadvertent or automatic deletion. Factors contributing to noncompliance included insufficient training and oversight as well as the difficulties of managing large volumes of e-mail. Without periodic evaluations of recordkeeping practices or other controls to ensure that staff are trained and carry out their responsibilities, agencies have little assurance that e-mail records are properly identified, stored, and preserved."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies are increasingly using electronic mail (e-mail) for  essential communication, and in doing so, they are potentially creating  messages that have the status of federal records.

Scheduling involves not individual documents or file folders, but  rather broad categories of records. Traditionally, these were record series:  that is, \u201crecords arranged according to a filing system or kept together  because they relate to a particular subject or function, result from the  same activity, document a specific kind of transaction, take a particular  physical form, or have some other relationship arising out of their  creation, receipt, or use, such as restrictions on access and use.\u201d More  recently, NARA introduced flexible scheduling, which allows so-called  \u201cbig bucket\u201d or large aggregation schedules for temporary and permanent  records. Under this approach, the schedule applies not necessarily to  records series, but to all records relating to a work process, group of work  processes, or a broad program area to which the same retention time  would be applied.", "To develop records schedules, agencies identify and inventory records,  and NARA\u2019s appraisal archivists work with agencies to appraise their  value (which includes informational, evidential, and historical value),  determine whether they are temporary or permanent, and determine how  long the temporary records should be kept. NARA then approves the  necessary records schedules. No record may be destroyed unless it has  been scheduled, and for temporary records the schedule is of critical  importance because it provides the authority to dispose of the record after  a specified time period.", "Records schedules may be of two kinds: an agency-specific schedule or a  general records schedule, which covers records common to several or all  agencies. According to NARA, general records schedules cover about a  third of all federal records. For the other two-thirds, NARA and the  agencies must agree upon specific records schedules. Once a schedule has  been approved, the agency is to issue it as a management directive, train  employees in its use, apply its provisions to temporary and permanent  records, and ensure proper implementation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Records Management Must Address Electronic Records, Including E-Mail", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Records Act covers documentary material regardless of  physical form or media, but until the advent of computers, records  management and archiving had been largely focused on handling paper  documents.

Part 1234 that provide  guidance to agencies about the management of electronic records. This  guidance is supplemented by the issuance of periodic NARA bulletins and  other forms of guidance to agencies. To ensure that the management of  agency electronic records is consistent with the Federal Records Act,  NARA requires each agency to maintain an inventory of all agency  information systems that identifies basic facts about each system and the  information it contains, and it requires that agencies schedule the  electronic records in its systems. Like other records, electronic records  must be scheduled either under agency-specific schedules or pursuant to a  general records schedule.", "According to the regulation, agencies are required to establish policies  and procedures that provide for appropriate retention and disposition of  electronic records. In addition to including general provisions on  electronic records, agency procedures must specifically address e-mail  records: that is, the creation, maintenance and use, and disposition of  federal records created by individuals using electronic mail systems. \u201ca document created or received on an electronic mail system including brief notes, more  formal or substantive narrative documents, and any attachments, such as word processing  and other electronic documents, which may be transmitted with the message.\u201d", "The regulation requires e-mail records to be managed as are other  potential federal records with regard to adequacy of documentation,  recordkeeping requirements, agency records management responsibilities,  and records disposition.

Further,  except for a limited category of \u201ctransitory\u201d e-mail records, agencies are  not permitted to store the recordkeeping copy of e-mail records in the e- mail system, unless that system has all the features of a recordkeeping  system; table 1 lists these required features.", "If agency e-mail systems do not have the required recordkeeping features,  either agencies must copy e-mail records to a separate electronic  recordkeeping system, or they must print e-mail messages (including  associated transmission information that is needed for purposes of  context) and file the copies in traditional paper recordkeeping files.", "NARA\u2019s guidance allows agencies to use either paper or electronic  recordkeeping systems for record copies of e-mail messages, depending on  the agencies\u2019 business needs.", "Each of the required features listed in table 1 is important because it helps  ensure that e-mail records remain both accessible and usable during their  useful lives. For example, it is essential to be able to classify records  according to their business purpose so that they can be retrieved in case of  mission need. Further, if records cannot be retrieved easily and quickly, or  they are not retained in a usable format, they do not serve the mission or  historical purpose that led to their being preserved. In many cases, e-mail  systems do not have the features in the table. If e-mail records are retained  in such systems and not in recordkeeping systems, they may be harder to  find and use, as well as being at increased risk of loss from inadvertent or  automatic deletion.", "Agencies must also have procedures that specifically address the  destruction of e-mail records. In particular, e-mail records may not be  deleted or otherwise disposed of without prior authority from NARA.  (Recall that not all e-mail is record material. Agencies may destroy  nonrecord e-mail.)", "Agencies can dispose of e-mail records in three situations: First, agencies  are authorized to dispose of e-mail records with very short-term  (transitory) value that are stored in e-mail systems at the end of their  retention periods (as mentioned earlier). Second, for other records in e- mail systems, NARA authorizes agencies to delete the version in the e-mail  system after the record has been preserved in a recordkeeping system  along with all appropriate transmission data. Finally, agencies are  authorized to dispose of e-mail records in the recordkeeping system in  accordance with the appropriate records schedule. If the records in the  recordkeeping system are not scheduled, the agency must schedule them  before they can be disposed of."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management of E-Mail Records Poses Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Because of its nature, e-mail can present particular challenges to records  management. First, the information contained in e-mail records is not  uniform. This is in contrast to many information systems, particularly  those in computer centers engaged in large-scale data processing, which  contain structured data that generally can be categorized into a relatively  limited set of logical groupings. The information in e-mail systems, on the  other hand, is not structured in this way: it may concern any subject or  function and document various types of transactions. As a result, in many  cases, decisions on which e-mail messages are records must be made  individually.", "The kinds of considerations that may go into determining the record status  of an e-mail message are illustrated in figure 1. As shown by the decision  tree in the figure (developed at Sandia National Laboratories), agency staff  have to be aware of the defining features of a record in order to make  these decisions.", "Second, the transmission data associated with an e-mail record\u2014including  information about the senders and receivers of messages, the date the  message was sent, and any attachments to the messages\u2014provide context  that may be crucial to understanding the message. Thus, as NARA\u2019s e-mail  regulations and guidance reflect, transmission data must be retained, and  attachments are defined as part of the e-mail record.", "Third, a given message may be part of an exchange of messages between  two or more people within or outside an agency, or even of a string  (sometimes branching) of many messages sent and received on a given  topic. In such cases, agency staff need to decide which message or  messages should be considered records and who is responsible for storing  them in a recordkeeping system.", "Finally, the large number of federal e-mail users and high volume of e- mails increase the management challenge. According to NARA, the use of  e-mail results in more records being created than in the past, as it often  replaces phone conversations and face-to-face meetings that might not  have been otherwise recorded. E-mail may also replace other types of  written communications, such as letters and memorandums.", "Whether agencies use paper-based or electronic recordkeeping systems,  individual users generally make decisions (based on considerations such  as those in the figure) on what messages they judge to be records. In  paper-based systems, users then print and file e-mail records\u2014with  appropriate transmission data\u2014in the appropriate file structure (generally  corresponding to record series or schedule). In electronic systems, the  particular steps to file the record would vary depending on the particular  type of system and its degree of integration with the agency\u2019s other  information systems. Although details vary, an electronic recordkeeping  system, like a paper-based system, requires that a filing structure has been  established by which records can be associated with the appropriate  series.", "The advantages of using a paper-based system for record copies of e-mails  are that this approach takes advantage of the recordkeeping system  already in place for the agency\u2019s paper files and requires little or no  technological investment. The disadvantages are that a paper-based  approach depends on manual processes and requires electronic material  to be converted to paper, potentially losing some features of the electronic  original; these processes may be especially burdensome if the volume of e- mail records is large.", "The advantage of using an electronic recordkeeping system, besides  avoiding the need to manage paper, is that it can be designed to capture  certain required data (such as e-mail transmission data) automatically.", "Electronic recordkeeping systems also make searches for records on  particular topics much more efficient. In addition, electronic systems that  are integrated with other applications may have features that make it  easier for the user to identify records and that potentially could provide  automatic or partially automatic classification functions. However, as  with other information technology investments, acquiring an electronic  recordkeeping system requires careful planning and analysis of agency  requirements and business processes; in addition, electronic  recordkeeping raises the issue of maintaining electronic information in an  accessible form throughout its useful life. Finally, like paper-based  systems, electronic recordkeeping systems must be used properly by  employees to be effective.", "These challenges have been recognized by NARA and the records  management community in numerous studies and articles. A 2001 survey  of federal recordkeeping practices conducted by a contractor\u2014SRA  International\u2014for NARA concluded, among other things, that managing e- mail was a major records management problem and that the quality of  recordkeeping varied considerably across agencies. The authors also  commented on features of agency missions that lead to strong  recordkeeping practices: \u201cWhen agencies have a strong business need for  good recordkeeping, such as the threat of litigation or an agency mission  that revolves around maintaining \u2018case\u2019 files, then recordkeeping practices  tend to be relatively strong with regard to the records involved.\u201d In  addition, the study concluded that for many federal employees, the  concept of a \u201crecord\u201d and what should be scheduled and preserved was  not clear.", "A 2005 survey of federal agencies\u2019 policy and practices for electronic  records management, funded in part by NARA, concluded that procedures  for managing e-mail were underdeveloped. The study found that most of  the surveyed offices had not developed electronic recordkeeping systems,  but were instead maintaining recordkeeping copies of e-mail and other  electronic documents in paper format. However, all of the offices also  maintained electronic records (frequently electronic duplicates of paper  records). According to the study team, agencies did not establish  electronic recordkeeping systems partly because of a lack of support and  resources, and the complexity of implementing such systems increased  with the size of the agency. As a result, organizations were maintaining  unsynchronized parallel paper and electronic systems, resulting in extra  work, confusion regarding which is the recordkeeping copy, and retention  of many records beyond their disposition date. The study team also  concluded that disposition of electronic records was too cumbersome and  uncertain. According to the report, employees delete electronic records,  such as e-mails, one at a time, a cumbersome process which may result in  retention of too many records for too long or premature disposition that is  inconsistent with approved retention schedules. (This is in contrast to  records disposition in a recordkeeping system, in which categories of  temporary records may be disposed of at the end of their retention  periods.) The report also discussed NARA\u2019s role in promoting agencies\u2019  adoption of electronic recordkeeping systems.", "Commenting on these points, NARA expressed the view that for agencies  that maintain paper as the record copy, the early destruction of electronic  copies was not a significant problem because such copies generally have  very short term retentions, and no information is lost. It considered that  the overly long retention of electronic copies did raise concerns regarding  legal discovery and compliance with requests under the Freedom of  Information Act or the Privacy Act. In these circumstances, agencies are  required to search for all information, not just information in  recordkeeping systems; thus, maintaining large volumes of nonrecord  material increases this burden.", "Most recently, a NARA study team examined in 2007 the experiences of  five federal agencies (including itself) with electronic records management  applications, with a particular emphasis on how these organizations used  these applications to manage e-mail. The purpose of the study was to  gather information on the strategies that organizations are using that may  be useful to others. Among the major conclusions from the survey was  that implementing an electronic records management application requires  considerable effort in planning, testing, and implementation, and that  although the functionality of the software product itself is important, other  factors are also crucial, such as agency culture and the quality of the  records management system in place. With regard to e-mail in particular,  the survey concluded that for some agencies, the volume of e-mail  messages created and received may be too overwhelming to be managed  at the desktop by thousands of employees across many sites using a  records management application alone, and that e-mail messages can  constitute the most voluminous type of record that is filed into these  applications. Finally, further study was recommended of technologies that  are being used to manage e-mail and what federal agencies are doing with  their record e-mail messages.", "NARA is planning to perform such a study in 2008. According to NARA, the  study will take a close look at how selected agencies are implementing  electronic recordkeeping for their program records, including those e-mail  messages that need to be retained and managed as federal records. The  study will look at electronic recordkeeping projects that have a records  management application in place as well as other solutions that provide  recordkeeping functionality. In both cases, NARA plans to explore how e- mail messages in particular are identified and managed as records.  According to NARA officials, they have begun planning for the study and  identifying agencies to be included; they expect to have the report  completed by the end of September 2008.", "Such a study could provide useful information to help NARA develop  additional guidance to agencies looking for electronic solutions for  records management of e-mail and other electronic records. As the earlier  studies suggest, implementing such solutions is not a simple or easy  process. Although NARA has referred to the decision to move to electronic  recordkeeping as inevitable, it emphasizes that the timing of the decision  depends on an agency\u2019s specific mission and circumstances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NARA Has Taken Action to Address Management of Electronic Records, Including E-Mail", "paragraphs": ["For the last several years, NARA\u2019s records management program has  increasingly reflected the importance of electronic records and  recordkeeping. For example, NARA has undertaken a redesign of its  records management activities, including (among other things) the  following three activities, which are significant for management of  electronic records, including e-mail:    NARA established flexible scheduling (the so-called \u201cbig bucket\u201d approach  described earlier), under which agencies can schedule records at any level  of aggregation that meets their business needs. By simplifying disposition  instructions, \u201cbig bucket\u201d schedules have advantages for electronic  records management; filing e-mail records under a \u201cbig bucket\u201d system, for  example, is simplified because users can be presented with fewer filing  categories.", "NARA developed e-mail regulations that eliminated the previous  requirement to file transitory e-mail dealing with routine matters in a  formal agency recordkeeping system. According to NARA, this change  would allow agencies to focus their resources on managing e-mail that is  important for long-term documentation of agency business. The change  was reflected in a revision to General Records Schedule 23 that explicitly  included very short-term temporary e-mail messages. The final rule  became effective on March 23, 2006.", "NARA developed regulations and guidance to make retention schedules  media neutral. According to NARA, its objective was to eliminate routine  rescheduling work so that agencies and NARA could focus their  resources on high records management priorities. Under its revised  regulations, in effect as of December 2007, new records schedules would  be media neutral unless otherwise specified. At the same time, NARA  revised General Records Schedule 20 (which provides disposition  authorities for electronic records) to expand agencies\u2019 authority to apply  previously approved schedules to electronic records and to dispose of  hard copy records that have been converted to an electronic format,  among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Prior Work Has Addressed Electronic Records Management", "paragraphs": ["In July 1999, we reported that NARA and federal agencies were facing the  substantial challenge of managing and preserving electronic records in an  era of rapidly changing technology.

We also noted that  NARA did not have governmentwide data on the records management  capabilities and programs of all federal agencies. As a result, we  recommended that NARA conduct a governmentwide survey of agencies\u2019  electronic records management programs and use the information as input  to its efforts to reengineer its business processes.", "NARA subsequently undertook efforts to assess governmentwide records  management practices and study the redesign of its business processes. As  mentioned earlier, in 2001 NARA completed an assessment of  governmentwide records management practices, as we had recommended.  NARA\u2019s assessment of the federal recordkeeping environment concluded  that although agencies were creating and maintaining records  appropriately, most electronic records remained unscheduled, and records  of historical value were not being identified and provided to NARA for  archiving.", "In 2002, we reported that factors contributing to the problems of managing  and preserving electronic records included records management guidance  that was inadequate in the current technological environment, the low  priority often given to records management programs, and the lack of  technology tools to manage electronic records. In addition, NARA did not  perform systematic inspections of agency records management, so that it  did not have comprehensive information on implementation issues and  areas where guidance needed strengthening. Although NARA had plans to  improve its guidance and address technology issues, these did not address  the low priority generally given to records management programs nor the  inspection issue.", "With regard to inspections, we noted that in 2000, NARA had replaced  agency evaluations (inspections) with a new approach\u2014targeted  assistance\u2014because it considered that its previous approach to  evaluations had been flawed: it reached only a few agencies, it was often  perceived negatively, and it resulted in a list of records management  problems that agencies then had to resolve on their own. Under targeted  assistance, NARA entered into partnerships with federal agencies to  provide them with guidance, assistance, or training in any area of records  management. Despite the possible benefits of such assistance to the  targeted agencies, however, we concluded that it was not a substitute for  systematic inspections. Only agencies requesting assistance were  evaluated, and the scope and focus of the assistance were determined not  by NARA but by the requesting agency. Thus, it did not provide systematic  and comprehensive information for assessing progress over time.", "To address the low priority generally given to records management  programs, we recommended that NARA develop a strategy for raising  agency senior management awareness of and commitment to records  management. To address the inspection issue, we recommended that  NARA develop a strategy for conducting systematic inspections of agency  records management programs to (1) periodically assess agency progress  in improving records management programs and (2) evaluate the efficacy  of NARA\u2019s governmentwide guidance.", "In response to our recommendations, NARA devised a strategy for raising  awareness among senior agency management of the importance of good  federal records management, as well as a comprehensive approach to  improving agency records management that included inspections and  identification of risks and priorities. NARA also took steps to improve  federal records management programs by updating its guidance to reflect  new types of electronic records. In 2003, we testified that the plan for  improving agency records management did not include provisions for  using inspections to evaluate the efficacy of its governmentwide guidance,  and an implementation plan for the approach had not yet been  established. NARA later addressed these shortcomings by developing an  implementation plan that included using agency inspections to evaluate  the efficacy of its guidance, with such inspections to be undertaken based  on a risk-based model, government studies, or media reports.

In particular, the reports are to include evaluations of  responses by agencies to any recommendations resulting from inspections  or studies that NARA conducts and, to the extent practicable, estimates of  costs to the government if agencies do not implement such  recommendations.", "According to NARA, it planned to carry out its oversight responsibilities  using inspections, studies, and reporting. Specifically, in 2003, NARA  stated that it would    perform inspections of agency records and records management    conduct studies that focus on cross-government issues, analyze and  identify best practices, and use the results to develop governmentwide  recommendations and guidance; and  report to the Congress and OMB on problems and recommended  practices discovered as part of inspections, studies, and targeted  assistance projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NARA No Longer Performs Inspections of Agency Records Management Programs", "paragraphs": ["Although inspections were included in NARA\u2019s oversight plans in 2003,  NARA has not conducted any since 2000. NARA laid out a strategy for  performing inspections and studies in 2003 as part of its records  management redesign efforts. According to this strategy, NARA  anticipated undertaking inspections only under what it termed exceptional  circumstances: that is, if (1) agencies have high-level records management  problems that put at risk federal records that protect rights, assure  accountability, or document the national experience, and (2) agencies  refuse targeted assistance from NARA and fail to mitigate or otherwise  effectively deal with such risks. In other words, NARA considered  inspections its tool of last resort: to be used when the risk to records was  deemed high and other tools (such as targeted assistance and training)  failed to mitigate the risk to records.", "Under this strategy, NARA planned to determine when to undertake  inspections based on its risk-based resource allocation model (or when it  learned through other means of a clear and egregious records  management problem in an agency or line of business). Using this model,  developed in 2003, NARA\u2019s Resource Allocation Project performed a  governmentwide assessment in 2004 of high-priority federal records and  records programs. After reviewing program areas and work processes of  the government (as opposed to organizational units), the project  identified the business processes, subfunctions, and agency activities that  were likely to generate the majority of high-priority records. Based on  input and assessments from NARA staff with expertise in the subfunctions  and associated agencies, the project then rated the subfunctions according  to three criteria for establishing resource priorities:  the risk to records (based on such factors as whether the subfunctions  or associated agencies had experienced major scheduling issues or  known problems, such as allegations of unauthorized destruction of  records),  the level of significance of the records to rights and accountability, and  the likelihood that the subfunction would generate permanent records  (and if so, their volume and significance).", "According to the final report on the project, this assessment showed that  the risks to records were being addressed and managed by the Archives\u2019  own records management activities and those of the agencies. As a result,  the Resource Allocation Project did not lead to the identification of  records management risks that met the new inspection criteria. Instead,  NARA applied its resources to other activities that it considered more  effective and less resource-intensive than the inspections it undertook in  the past. These include regular contacts between appraisal archivists and  agencies, updated guidance information, and training.", "However, the Resource Allocation Project was primarily based on NARA\u2019s  in-house information sources and expertise. Although this information and  expertise may be considerable and collecting and assessing it potentially  valuable, it is not a substitute for examinations of agency programs,  surveys of practices, agency self-assessments, or other external sources of  information. Further, although the final report on the 2004 project  included important lessons learned for improving future assessments,  NARA did not set up a process for continuing the effort and applying the  lessons learned to updating the assessment or validating its results.", "Officials had also stated that targeted assistance was a tool that NARA  would use in preference to inspections to solve urgent records  management problems and that the results of the Resource Allocation  Project were also to be used in determining where to use this tool.  However, NARA\u2019s use of targeted assistance has declined significantly  over the past 5 years. (NARA reported that in 2002, 77 projects were  opened and 76 completed; in contrast, 4 were opened and none  completed in 2007.) Officials ascribed the reduced emphasis on targeted  assistance projects to various factors, including competing demands (such  as work on the development of its advanced electronic records archive  and on helping agencies to schedule electronic records), the difficulty of  getting agencies to devote resources to the projects, and the removal of  numerical targets for targeted assistance projects, which occurred when  NARA revised performance metrics to emphasize results rather than  quantity. According to NARA, it also works with agencies to address  critical records management issues outside formal targeted assistance  arrangements. In addition, it identifies and investigates allegations of  unauthorized destruction of federal records.", "Thus, neither inspections nor targeted assistance have made significant  contributions to NARA\u2019s oversight of agency records management.

This preferred approach is consistent with NARA\u2019s  reasons (as we noted in 2003) for replacing agency evaluations  (inspections) with targeted assistance: among these reasons was that  inspections were perceived negatively by agencies. NARA officials have  said that they prefer to use \u201ccarrots, rather than sticks.\u201d NARA officials  added that full-scale inspections were resource intensive and took several  years to complete, and that agencies took years to address NARA\u2019s  recommendations.", "Although, as described earlier, NARA regularly works with agencies on  scheduling and disposition of records (activities related to the end of the  records life cycle), officials agreed that these activities provide limited  insight into records management at earlier stages\u2014that is, creation,  maintenance, and use. The officials also agreed that their work with  agencies on scheduling records does not fulfill the Archivist\u2019s  responsibility under the Federal Records Act to conduct inspections or  surveys of agency records and records management programs and  practices. Further, by giving the Archivist the responsibility to report to  the Congress and OMB on records management issues, the Federal  Records Act provides NARA with a tool for holding agencies accountable,  a key aspect of oversight. However, NARA has been reluctant to use this  tool, limiting its ability to determine whether federal agencies are carrying  out their records management responsibilities. Without more specific and  comprehensive information about how agencies are managing their  records and without the means to hold agencies accountable for  shortcomings, NARA\u2019s ability to identify and address common records  management problems is impaired.

The staff of one of the officials who managed his own  e-mail had access to the official\u2019s e-mail account, but the staff reviewed or  accessed these only if instructed to do so by the official. The department  said that the third official\u2019s office administrator had access to calendar  functions only.", "According to one of these senior officials, storing e-mails on the computer  is convenient for searching and retrieving. It was this official\u2019s opinion that  this approach was safe from a legal standpoint because no e-mails were  deleted. Nonetheless, using an e-mail system to retain all e-mails  indefinitely increases the difficulty of performing searches based on  categories of records; in contrast, such searches are facilitated by a true  recordkeeping system. Further, if e-mail records are not stored in an  appropriate recordkeeping system (paper or electronic), there is reduced  assurance that they are useful and accessible to the agency as needed, or  that they will be retained for the appropriate period.", "EPA: At EPA, the e-mail records of two of the four senior officials were  being managed in accordance with key requirements reviewed. For these  two senior officials, one of whom was the agency head, e-mail records  were stored in paper-based recordkeeping systems.", "The EPA Administrator had two EPA e-mail accounts, one intended for  messages from the public and one for communicating with select senior  EPA officials (not intended for use by the public). In the paper-based  recordkeeping system, of 25 e-mail records inspected, all included  transmission data and distribution lists, as required. For the nonpublic  account, staff provided eight e-mail records for inspection, all of which  also included transmission data and distribution lists. According to EPA  officials, the nonpublic account generated few records because the  Administrator receives most of his information from other sources,  including face-to-face briefings and meetings.", "For the second senior official, administrative staff told us that the official  reviewed e-mail personally and forwarded records to the staff for printing  and filing in a paper-based recordkeeping system that followed the  agency\u2019s records schedules. We selected 20 e-mails from the official\u2019s files  for examination. These files were associated with four EPA records  schedules. All of the e-mails included transmission data and distribution  lists as required.", "The e-mail records of two other senior officials were not being managed in  compliance with requirements, because e-mail records were not being  stored in appropriate recordkeeping systems, but rather in the e-mail  system:    One of these officials was in the process of migrating e-mail records from  the e-mail system to ECMS. This official had been storing e-mail records in  e-mail system folders since January 2006, in anticipation of the rollout of  the ECMS, and had not been using a paper-based recordkeeping system in  the interim. The e-mail system\u2019s folders were organized according to the  agency\u2019s records schedules to facilitate the transfer, which was ongoing.  Because this senior official did not store e-mail records in a paper-based  recordkeeping system during this transition, the official\u2019s e-mail account  was being used as a recordkeeping system, which is contrary to regulation.  However, when the transition to the electronic recordkeeping system is  complete, the new system should provide the opportunity for this official\u2019s  recordkeeping practices to be brought into compliance with requirements.", "The second official was also saving all e-mail in the e-mail system. EPA  officials stated that most of the senior official\u2019s e-mail was sent to an  administrative assistant, who was responsible for identifying and  maintaining the records received and filing them accordingly. However,  the administrative assistant for this official stated that although she had  been briefed on maintaining and preserving the senior official\u2019s calendar in  a recordkeeping system, she had not received guidance or training in how  to preserve or categorize the official\u2019s e-mail for recordkeeping purposes.  In addition, the assistant stated that all e-mails remained stored in the e- mail system where they could be retrieved if necessary.", "FTC: The four senior officials at FTC were managing e-mail in compliance  with key requirements reviewed. These officials were the Chairman and  three Commissioners. According to an FTC official, the Commissioners  do not discuss substantive issues in e-mails to one another because of the  possibility that such group e-mails could be construed as meetings subject  to the Sunshine Act, which must be open to the public. FTC staff told us  that the then-Chairman and two Commissioners delegated part or all of the  responsibility for e-mail management; the remaining Commissioner  personally managed e-mails. E-mails with record status were to be printed  and filed in the commission\u2019s paper-based recordkeeping systems. The  FTC recordkeeping systems contained e-mail records of the four officials;  of the 155 e-mail records inspected, all included the required distribution  lists and transmission data.", "HUD: One of the four senior officials at HUD was managing e-mail in  compliance with key requirements, but for the other three officials, e-mail  records were not stored in appropriate recordkeeping systems.", "The e-mail records for the agency head were being managed in accordance  with key requirements. According to HUD officials, management of e-mails  for the agency head was delegated to staff: that is, the agency head\u2019s e- mails were forwarded by his administrative assistant to the Office of the  Executive Secretariat, where they were reviewed for record status and  preserved as necessary in paper files. Staff from the Office of the  Executive Secretariat flagged 10 e-mail records using the department\u2019s  correspondence tracking system, which were then retrieved from the  paper-based recordkeeping system for inspection; all of these files  included the required distribution lists and transmission data.", "The practices of the three other senior officials varied, except that for all  three, they or their staff stated that the officials retained e-mail messages  in the e-mail system. One senior official told us that he read his own e- mail and forwarded messages to staff to determine record status. Another  official\u2019s staff stated that the staff was responsible for managing e-mail,  but that the official would determine what should be printed and filed. The  third official\u2019s staff stated that the official did not review e-mails for record  status but forwarded all program-related e-mails to staff, who would  decide which e-mails should be included in the program files as records.  Neither the three senior officials nor several of their staff had received  records management training.", "HUD provided copies of e-mail messages from one senior official for  review, but there was no evidence that the messages were stored in an  appropriate recordkeeping system, and HUD officials stated that the  provided e-mails were not records. They offered to provide similar  nonrecord messages for the two other officials, but we declined to review  them because the messages would not have addressed the question of  whether the officials were storing e-mail records in appropriate  recordkeeping systems. Thus, for these three officials the department did  not provide examples of printed e-mail records that had been stored in  appropriate recordkeeping files.", "According to department officials, this situation is explained by HUD\u2019s  practice of not using e-mail for business matters that would produce  records. According to department officials, official business is conducted  through paper processes, some electronic processes (such as Web-based  systems), but rarely through e-mail.", "Nonetheless, although e-mail may rarely rise to the level of a record under  paper-based processes, it does not follow that no e-mail records are ever  created or received, as shown by the e-mail records maintained by the  department\u2019s Executive Secretariat and the Office of Healthy Homes and  Lead Hazard Control. The weakness in HUD\u2019s policy regarding  responsibility for determining which e-mails are records, combined with  the lack of training in e-mail records management, reduces the  department\u2019s assurance that those e-mail messages that are records are  being appropriately identified.", "Factors contributing to the inconsistent practices at the three agencies  include inadequate training and oversight, as well as the difficulties of  managing large volumes of e-mail with the tools and resources available,  which in most cases do not include electronic recordkeeping systems.", "The regulations require agencies to develop adequate training to ensure  that staff implement agency policies. All four agencies have issued  guidance and developed training materials, and all state that they  performed records management training. For example, according to DHS  officials, all three senior officials and staff had received records  management training as new employees. However, DHS and HUD had no  documentation to indicate that employees had received such training,  and our review of practices found instances in which staff did not  understand their recordkeeping responsibilities for e-mail and stated that  they had not been informed of them or received training. For example,  three senior HUD officials had not received training on records  management. Staff explained that formal briefings had last taken place at  that time.", "Agencies must also periodically evaluate their records management  programs, including periodic monitoring of staff determinations of the  record status of materials. However, the three agencies have not fully  developed and implemented oversight mechanisms, and do not determine  the extent to which senior officials or other staff are following applicable  requirements for e-mail records. According to DHS, it has initiated  oversight and review activities, but these are not yet at the pilot stage  because of other demands on records management staff, such as  completion of records scheduling. EPA has developed an oversight plan  and has pilot-tested a records management survey tool, but it has not yet  begun agencywide reviews. It plans to fully deploy this tool when ECMS is  fully implemented. HUD had not initiated oversight and review activities,  according to officials, because of its practice of not using e-mail for  matters that would necessitate the creation of official records. These  officials stated that when the department\u2019s modernized system for records  and document management is in place, the department\u2019s e-mail policies  will be updated and appropriate oversight and review activities put in  place.", "Unless agencies train staff adequately in records management and perform  periodic evaluations or establish other controls to ensure that staff receive  training and are carrying out their responsibilities, agencies have little  assurance that e-mail records are appropriately identified, stored, and  preserved. Further, keeping large numbers of record and nonrecord  messages in e-mail systems potentially increases the time and effort  needed to search for information in response to a business need or an  outside inquiry, such as a Freedom of Information Act request.", "The volume of e-mail is also described as contributing to e-mail records  management shortcomings. Agency officials and staff referred to the  difficulty of managing large volumes of e-mail, suggesting that limited  resources contributed to their inability to fully comply with records  management and preservation policies. To help ensure that e-mail records  are managed appropriately, it is helpful to incorporate recordkeeping into  the process by which agency staff create and respond to mission-related e- mail. Because this process is electronic, the most straightforward  approach is to perform e-mail recordkeeping electronically. All four  agencies, however, still rely either entirely or primarily on paper for their  recordkeeping systems, even for \u201cborn digital\u201d records like e-mail.", "Weaknesses in the processes in place at three of the four agencies  reviewed raise questions about the appropriateness of paper  recordkeeping processes for their e-mail records. Simply devoting more  resources to paper records management may be neither efficient nor cost- effective, and the agencies have recognized that this is not a tenable long- term solution. EPA is beginning a transition to electronic recordkeeping,  and HUD and DHS have plans focused on future enterprisewide  transitions.", "Managing electronic documents, including e-mail, in electronic  recordkeeping systems would potentially provide the efficiencies of  automation and avoid the expenditure of resources on duplicative manual  processes and storage. It is important to recognize, however, that moving  to electronic recordkeeping has proved not to be a simple or easy process  and that projects at large agencies have presented the most significant  challenges. For projects of all sizes, agencies must balance the potential  benefits of electronic recordkeeping against the costs of redesigning  business processes and investing in technology. NARA has called the  decision to move to electronic recordkeeping inevitable. Nonetheless,  like other information technology investments, such a move requires  careful planning in the context of the specific agency\u2019s circumstances, in  addition to well-managed implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NARA\u2019s limited performance of its oversight responsibilities leaves it with  little assurance that agencies are effectively managing records, including e- mail records, throughout their life cycle. NARA has an organizational  preference for partnering with and supporting agencies\u2019 records  management activities, which is appropriate for many of its guidance and  assistance responsibilities. However, this preference has led NARA to  avoid performing oversight activities that it judged to be perceived  negatively\u2014the full-scale inspections/evaluations that it performed in  previous years. Although it has performed studies that provide it with  insights into records management issues and it has taken action in  response to the findings, it has not developed means to evaluate the state  of federal records management programs and practices. As a result,  NARA\u2019s oversight of federal records management programs, including  management of e-mail, has been limited. Further, NARA\u2019s limited reporting  on problems and solutions identified at individual agencies reduces its  own ability to hold agencies accountable for addressing identified  problems, as well as reducing the ability of agencies to learn from the  experience of others.", "At the four agencies reviewed, e-mail records management policies were  generally compliant with NARA regulations, with some exceptions. If  policies do not fully conform to regulatory requirements, it increases the  likelihood that those requirements will not be met in practice.", "Senior officials at three of the four agencies stored e-mail records in e-mail  systems, rather than in recordkeeping systems, which is not in accordance  with NARA\u2019s regulations. Factors contributing to this noncompliance  generally included insufficient training and oversight regarding  recordkeeping practices, as well as the onerousness of handling large  volumes of e-mail. Providing adequate training and oversight is a  prerequisite for improvement, but real improvements in e-mail  recordkeeping may require replacing the paper-based recordkeeping  processes currently in place. Properly implemented, the transition to  electronic recordkeeping of e-mail has the potential not only to reduce the  burden of e-mail management but also to provide positive benefits in  improving the usefulness and accessibility of records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that federal records, including those that originated as e- mail messages, are appropriately identified, retained, and archived, we  recommend that the Archivist of the United States    develop and implement an approach to oversight of agency records  management programs that provides adequate assurance that agencies  are following NARA guidance, including    developing various types of inspections, surveys, and other means  to evaluate the state of agency records and records management  programs;    developing criteria for using these means of assessment that ensure  that they are regularly performed; and  regularly report to the Congress and OMB on the findings,  recommendations, and agency responses to its oversight activities,  as required by law.", "In addition, we recommend that the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency  revise the agency\u2019s policies to ensure that they appropriately reflect  NARA\u2019s requirement on instructing staff on the management and  preservation of e-mail messages sent or received from  nongovernmental e-mail systems and    develop and apply oversight practices, such as reviews and monitoring  of records management training and practices, that are adequate to  ensure that policies are effective and that staff are adequately trained  and are implementing policies appropriately.", "We further recommend that the Chairman of the Federal Trade  Commission revise the commission\u2019s policies to ensure that they  appropriately reflect NARA\u2019s requirement to instruct staff on the  management and preservation of e-mail messages sent or received from  nongovernmental e-mail systems.", "We further recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security  revise the department\u2019s policies to ensure that they appropriately  reflect NARA\u2019s requirement to state that draft documents circulated on  e-mail systems are potential federal records and    develop and apply oversight practices, such as reviews and monitoring  of records management training and practices, that are adequate to  ensure that policies are effective and that staff are adequately trained  and are implementing policies appropriately.", "Finally, we recommend that the Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development  revise the department\u2019s policies to ensure that they appropriately  reflect NARA\u2019s requirements to ensure that staff is capable of  identifying federal records and to state that e-mail systems must not be  used to store recordkeeping copies of e-mail records (other than those  exceptions provided in the regulation) and that e-mail system backup  tapes should not be used for recordkeeping purposes, and    develop and apply oversight practices, such as reviews and monitoring  of records management training and practices, that are adequate to  ensure that policies are effective and that staff are adequately trained  and are implementing policies appropriately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NARA, DHS, EPA, FTC, and HUD for  review and comment.
