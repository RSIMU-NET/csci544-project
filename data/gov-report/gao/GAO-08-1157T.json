They also highlight that we need to be vigilant against individuals and groups with malicious intent, such as criminals, terrorists, and nation-states perpetuating these attacks. Federal law and policy established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the focal point for coordinating cybersecurity, including making it responsible for protecting systems that support critical infrastructures, a practice commonly referred to as cyber critical infrastructure protection. Since 2005, GAO has reported on the responsibilities and progress DHS has made in its cybersecurity efforts. GAO was asked to summarize its key reports and their associated recommendations aimed at securing our nation's cyber critical infrastructure. To do so, GAO relied on previous reports, as well as two reports being released today, and analyzed information about the status of recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO has reported over the last several years that DHS has yet to fully satisfy its cybersecurity responsibilities. To address these shortfalls, GAO has made about 30 recommendations in the following key areas. Specifically, examples of what GAO reported and recommended are as follows: (1) Cyber analysis and warning--In July 2008, GAO reported that DHS's United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) did not fully address 15 key cyber analysis and warning attributes. For example, US-CERT provided warnings by developing and distributing a wide array of notifications; however, these notifications were not consistently actionable or timely. Consequently, GAO recommended that DHS address these attribute shortfalls. (2) Cyber exercises--In September 2008, GAO reported that since conducting a cyber attack exercise in 2006, DHS demonstrated progress in addressing eight lessons it learned from this effort. However, its actions to address the lessons had not been fully implemented. GAO recommended that the department schedule and complete all identified corrective activities. (3) Control systems--In a September 2007 report and October 2007 testimony, GAO identified that DHS was sponsoring multiple efforts to improve control system cybersecurity using vulnerability evaluation and response tools. However, the department had not established a strategy to coordinate this and other efforts across federal agencies and the private sector, and it did not effectively share control system vulnerabilities with others. Accordingly, GAO recommended that DHS develop a strategy to guide efforts for securing such systems and establish a process for sharing vulnerability information. While DHS has developed and implemented capabilities to address aspects of these areas, it still has not fully satisfied any of them. Until these and other areas are effectively addressed, our nation's cyber critical infrastructure is at risk of increasing threats posed by terrorists, nation-states, and others."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to join in today\u2019s hearing to discuss  efforts in protecting our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures from  cybersecurity threats. The recent computer-based, or cyber, attacks  against nation-states and others demonstrate the potentially  devastating impact these pose to systems and the operations and  critical infrastructures that they support. They also highlight the  need to be vigilant against individuals and groups with malicious  intent, such as criminals, terrorists, and nation-states perpetuating  these attacks.", "Today, I will discuss the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS)  progress in fulfilling its responsibilities to protect systems that  support critical infrastructures\u2014a practice referred to as cyber  critical infrastructure protection or cyber CIP\u2014as well as its  progress in addressing our related recommendations. Due to  concerns about DHS\u2019s efforts to fully implement its CIP  responsibilities as well as known security risks to critical  infrastructure systems, we added cyber CIP as part of our federal  information technology systems security high-risk area in 2003 and  have continued to report on its status since that time.", "As requested, my testimony will summarize our key reports\u2014two of  which are being released today at this hearing\u2014and their associated  recommendations aimed at securing our nation\u2019s cyber critical  infrastructure. Specifically, these reports and recommendations  focus on (1) providing cyber analysis and warning capabilities, (2)  being effectively organized to plan for and respond to disruptions on  converged voice and data networks, (3) conducting and  coordinating cyber attack exercises, (4) developing cyber-related  sector-specific critical infrastructure plans, (5) securing control  systems\u2014computer-based systems that monitor and control  sensitive processes and physical functions, and (6) coordinating  public/private planning for Internet recovery from a major  disruption.", "In preparing for this testimony, we relied on our previous reports on  department efforts to fulfilling its cyber CIP responsibilities. These  reports contain detailed overviews of the scope and methodology  we used. We also obtained and analyzed information about the  implementation status of our recommendations. We conducted our  work, in support of this testimony, from August 2008 through  September 2008, in the Washington, D.C. area. The work on which  this testimony is based was performed in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The same speed and accessibility that create the enormous benefits  of the computer age can, if not properly controlled, allow  individuals and organizations to inexpensively eavesdrop on or  interfere with computer operations from remote locations for  mischievous or malicious purposes, including fraud or sabotage. In  recent years, the sophistication and effectiveness of cyberattacks  have steadily advanced.", "Government officials are increasingly concerned about attacks from  individuals and groups with malicious intent, such as criminals,  terrorists, and nation-states. As we reported in June 2007,  cybercrime has significant economic impacts and threatens U.S.  national security interests. Various studies and experts estimate the  direct economic impact from cybercrime to be in the billions of  dollars annually. In addition, there is continued concern about the  threat that our adversaries, including nation-states and terrorists,  pose to our national security. For example, intelligence officials  have stated that nation-states and terrorists could conduct a  coordinated cyber attack to seriously disrupt electric power  distribution, air traffic control, and financial sectors. In May 2007,  Estonia was the reported target of a denial-of-service cyber attack  with national consequences. The coordinated attack created mass  outages of its government and commercial Web sites.", "To address threats posed against the nation\u2019s computer-reliant  infrastructures, federal law and policy establishes DHS as the focal  point for cyber CIP. For example, within DHS, the Assistant  Secretary of Cyber Security and Communications is responsible for  being the focal point for national cyber CIP efforts. Under the  Assistant Secretary is NCSD which interacts on a day-to-day basis  with federal and nonfederal agencies and organizations (e.g., state  and local governments, private-sector companies) regarding, among  other things, cyber-related analysis, warning, information sharing,  major incident response, and national-level recovery efforts.  Consequently, DHS has multiple cybersecurity-related roles and  responsibilities. In May 2005, we identified, and reported on, 13 key  cybersecurity responsibilities called for in law and policy. These    responsibilities are described in appendix I.", "Since then, we have performed detailed work and made  recommendations on DHS\u2019s progress in fulfilling specific aspects of  the responsibilities, as discussed in more detail later in this  statement.", "In addition to DHS efforts to fulfill its cybersecurity responsibilities,  the President in January 2008 issued HSPD 23\u2014also referred to as  National Security Presidential Directive 54 and the President\u2019s  \u201cCyber Initiative\u201d\u2014to improve DHS and the other federal agencies\u2019  cybersecurity efforts, including protecting against intrusion  attempts and better anticipating future threats. While the directive  has not been made public, DHS officials stated that the initiative  includes steps to enhance cyber analysis related efforts, such as  requiring federal agencies to implement a centralized network  monitoring tool and reduce the number of connections to the  Internet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Needs to Address Several Key Areas Associated with Its Cybersecurity Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Over the last several years, we have reported that DHS has yet to  comprehensively satisfy its key cybersecurity responsibilities. These  reports included about 30 recommendations that we summarized  into the following key areas that are essential for DHS to address in  order to fully implement its cybersecurity responsibilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Bolstering Cyber Analysis and Warning Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["In July 2008, we identified that cyber analysis and warning  capabilities included (1) monitoring network activity to detect  anomalies, (2) analyzing information and investigating anomalies to  determine whether they are threats, (3) warning appropriate  officials with timely and actionable threat and mitigation  information, and (4) responding to the threat. These four  capabilities are comprised of 15 key attributes, which are detailed in  appendix II.", "We concluded that while US-CERT demonstrated aspects of each of  the key attributes, it did not fully incorporate all of them. For  example, as part of its monitoring, US-CERT obtained information  from numerous external information sources; however, it had not  established a baseline of our nation\u2019s critical network assets and  operations. In addition, while it investigated if identified anomalies  constitute actual cyber threats or attacks as part of its analysis, it  did not integrate its work into predictive analyses of broader  implications or potential future attacks, nor does it have the  analytical or technical resources to analyze multiple, simultaneous  cyber incidents. The organization also provided warnings by  developing and distributing a wide array of attack and other  notifications; however, these notifications were not consistently  actionable or timely\u2014providing the right information to the right  persons or groups as early as possible to give them time to take  appropriate action. Further, while it responded to a limited number  of affected entities in their efforts to contain and mitigate an attack,  recover from damages, and remediate vulnerabilities, the  organization did not possess the resources to handle multiple events  across the nation.", "We also concluded that without the key attributes, US-CERT did not  have the full complement of cyber analysis and warning capabilities  essential to effectively perform its national mission. As a result, we  made 10 recommendations to the department to address shortfalls  associated with the 15 attributes in order to fully establish a national  cyber analysis and warning capability. DHS concurred with 9 of our  10 recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing Organizational Inefficiencies", "paragraphs": ["In June 2008, we reported on the status of DHS\u2019s efforts to  establish an integrated operations center that it agreed to adopt per  recommendations from a DHS-commissioned expert task force. The  two operations centers that were to be integrated were within the  department\u2019s National Communication System and National Cyber  Security Division. We determined that DHS had taken the first of  three steps towards integrating the operations centers\u2014called the  National Coordination Center Watch and US-CERT\u2014it uses to plan  for and monitor voice and data network disruptions. While DHS  completed the first integration step by locating the two centers in  adjacent space, it had yet to implement the remaining two steps.  Specifically, although called for in the task force\u2019s  recommendations, the department had not organizationally merged  the two centers or involved key private sector critical infrastructure  officials in the planning, monitoring, and other activities of the  proposed joint operations center. In addition, the department lacked  a strategic plan and related guidance that provides overall direction  in this area and has not developed specific tasks and milestones for  achieving the two remaining integration steps.", "We concluded that until the two centers were fully integrated, DHS  was at risk of being unable to efficiently plan for and respond to  disruptions to communications infrastructure and the data and  applications that travel on this infrastructure, increasing the  probability that communications will be unavailable or limited in  times of need. As a result, we recommended that the department  complete its strategic plan and define tasks and milestones for  completing remaining integration steps so that we are better  prepared to provide an integrated response to disruptions to the  communications infrastructure. DHS concurred with our first  recommendation and stated that it would address the second  recommendation as part of finalizing its strategic plan.", "DHS has recently made organizational changes to bolster its  cybersecurity focus. For example, in response to the President\u2019s  January 2008 Cyber Initiative, the department established a National  Cybersecurity Center to ensure coordination among cyber-related  efforts across the federal government. DHS placed the center at a  higher organizational level than the Assistant Secretary of Cyber  Security and Communications. As we previously reported, this  placement raises questions about, and may in fact, diminish the  Assistant Secretary\u2019s authority as the focal point for the federal  government\u2019s cyber CIP efforts. It also raises similar questions about  NCSD\u2019s role as the primary federal cyber analysis and warning  organization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Completing Corrective Actions Identified During A Cyber Exercise", "paragraphs": ["In September 2008, we reported on a 2006 major DHS-coordinated  cyber attack exercise, called Cyber Storm, that included large scale  simulations of multiple concurrent attacks involving the federal  government, states, foreign governments, and private industry. We  determined that DHS had identified eight lessons learned from this  exercise, such as the need to improve interagency coordination  groups and the exercise program. We also concluded that while DHS  had demonstrated progress in addressing the lessons learned, more  needed to be done. Specifically, while the department completed 42  of the 66 activities identified to address the lessons learned, it  identified 16 activities as ongoing and 7 as planned for the future.  In addition, DHS provided no timetable for the completion dates of  the ongoing activities. We noted that until DHS scheduled and  completed its remaining activities, it was at risk of conducting  subsequent exercises that repeated the lessons learned during the  first exercise. Consequently, we recommended that DHS schedule  and complete the identified corrective activities so that its cyber  exercises can help both public and private sector participants  coordinate their responses to significant cyber incidents. DHS  agreed with the recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing Sector-Specific Plans That Fully Address All of the Cyber-Related Criteria", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, we reported and testified on the cybersecurity aspects of  CIP plans for 17 critical infrastructure sectors, referred to as sector- specific plans. Specifically, we found that none of the plans fully  addressed the 30 key cybersecurity-related criteria described in DHS  guidance. We also determined that while several sectors\u2019 plans fully  addressed many of the criteria, others were less comprehensive. In  addition to the variations in the extent to which the plans covered  aspects of cybersecurity, there was also variance among the plans in  the extent to which certain criteria were addressed. For example,  fewer than half of the plans fully addressed describing (1) a process  to identify potential consequences of cyber attack or (2) any  incentives used to encourage voluntary performance of risk  assessments. We noted that without complete and comprehensive  plans, stakeholders within the infrastructure sectors may not  adequately identify, prioritize, and protect their critical assets.  Consequently, we recommended that DHS request that the lead  federal agencies, referred to as sector-specific agencies, that are  responsible for the development of CIP plans for their sectors fully  address all cyber-related criteria by September 2008 so that  stakeholders within the infrastructure sectors will effectively  identify, prioritize, and protect the cyber aspects of their CIP efforts.

For example, DHS was sponsoring multiple control  systems security initiatives, including efforts to (1) improve control  systems cybersecurity using vulnerability evaluation and response  tools and (2) build relationships with control systems vendors and  infrastructure asset owners. However, the department had not  established a strategy to coordinate the various control systems  activities across federal agencies and the private sector. Further, it  lacked processes needed to address specific weaknesses in sharing  information on control system vulnerabilities. We concluded that  until public and private sector security efforts are coordinated by an  overarching strategy and specific information sharing shortfalls are  addressed, there was an increased risk that multiple organizations  would conduct duplicative work and miss opportunities to fulfill  their critical missions.", "Consequently, we recommended that DHS develop a strategy to  guide efforts for securing control systems and establish a rapid and  secure process for sharing sensitive control system vulnerability  information to improve federal government efforts to secure control  systems governing critical infrastructure. In response, DHS officials  took our recommendations under advisement and more recently  have begun developing a Federal Coordinating Strategy to Secure  Control Systems, which is still a work in process.

However, we determined that these efforts were not comprehensive  or complete.  As such, we recommended that DHS implement nine  actions to improve the department\u2019s ability to facilitate  public/private efforts to recover the Internet in case of a major  disruption.", "In October 2007, we testified that the department had made  progress in implementing our recommendations; however, seven of  the nine have not been completed. For example, it revised key plans  in coordination with private industry infrastructure stakeholders,  coordinated various Internet recovery-related activities, and  addressed key challenges to Internet recovery planning. However, it  had not, among other things, finalized recovery plans and defined  the interdependencies among DHS\u2019s various working groups and  initiatives. In other words, it has not completed an integrated  private/public plan for Internet recovery. As a result, we concluded  that the nation lacked direction from the department on how to  respond in such a contingency. We also noted that these incomplete  efforts indicated DHS and the nation were not fully prepared to  respond to a major Internet disruption.", "In summary, DHS has developed and implemented capabilities to  satisfy aspects of key cybersecurity responsibilities. However, it still  needs to take further action to fulfill all of these responsibilities. In  particular, it needs to fully address the key areas identified in our  recent reports. Specifically, it will have to bolster cyber analysis and  warning capabilities, address organizational inefficiencies by  integrating voice and data operations centers, enhance cyber  exercises by completing the identified activities associated with the  lessons learned, ensure that cyber-related sector-specific critical  infrastructure plans are completed, improve efforts to address the  cybersecurity of infrastructure control systems by completing a  comprehensive strategy and ensuring adequate mechanisms for  sharing sensitive information, and strengthen its ability to help  recover from Internet disruptions by finalizing recovery plans and  defining interdependencies.
