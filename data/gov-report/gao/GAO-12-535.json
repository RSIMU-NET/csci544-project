TANF is overseen at the federal level by HHS, and administered by states. Most states disburse TANF cash assistance through electronic benefit cards, which can be used to withdraw money or make purchases. Media coverage highlighted cases of cardholders accessing benefits at casinos and other locations that were considered inconsistent with the purpose of TANF.

Restrictions are based on selected states\u0092 laws, executive orders, and other regulations, and generally cover certain locations or certain types of purchases such as alcohol. In some cases, states\u0092 restrictions are broader than the new federal requirements. These restrictions vary in their degree and means of implementation, including widespread disabling of Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) access at automated teller machines located at certain locations across a state, such as at casinos. The other 4 states had no restrictions because no laws, executive orders, or other regulations prohibited certain transactions based on the location of the transactions or the nature of the goods or services purchased. These states did not implement restrictions due to concerns about cost-effectiveness or technical limitations, according to state officials.", "Challenges experienced by states in implementing their current restrictions could inhibit future restriction efforts, including those intended to address new federal requirements. These challenges included difficulties with identifying certain locations that could be prohibited and limitations in available data. For example, the transaction data states receive do not contain information that is accurate or detailed enough for them to identify locations that can potentially be prohibited or restricted. State officials suggested that improvements in the completeness and accuracy of transaction data might better enable them to prevent such transactions. In its assessment of the EBT transaction data from 4 states, GAO found that the data are insufficient for systematic monitoring. To effectively conduct systematic monitoring, including the identification of locations that could be blocked from TANF access, data should be complete and accurate. However, addressing the limitations that GAO found in the transaction data\u0097such as requiring accurate merchant category codes for retailers\u0097could involve significant resources. States that prohibit certain types of purchases generally do not have ways to track what items recipients buy with their cards, partially due to the lack of information in transaction data on specific goods or services purchased. States were also challenged in attempting to track the spending of cash withdrawn with cards. With no controls on how or where individuals spend withdrawn cash, a recipient could withdraw money at an authorized location and use it at certain locations or for certain purchases restricted by some states.", "As of July 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was at the beginning of its rulemaking process and did not yet know what form its regulations would take. Until HHS issues regulations or provides further guidance as to what policies and practices are sufficient to comply with new federal requirements, it is unclear to what extent the various restrictions implemented by states would be in compliance. States\u0092 restrictions could help inform HHS\u0092s oversight efforts, especially any information on the cost-effectiveness and success rates for various state restrictions. Restriction methods that do not rely on flawed transaction data may be the most practical.", "We provided HHS with a draft of our report for comment.

HHS oversees the program at the federal level and distributes  $16.5 billion in annual federal block grants to states to provide benefits  and services to recipients. As a federal block-grant program, TANF allows  states broad flexibility in designing and implementing their programs. To  purchase goods and services, TANF recipients receive cash assistance,  which in most states they can access at automated teller machines  (ATM), banks, or retailers, using Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards.  Cash assistance may be used for goods and services, and the amount of  cash assistance received can vary by state. The EBT cards are similar to  debit or stored-value cards, but do not carry a line of credit, and the  purchases or withdrawals made with these cards cannot exceed the  amount of recipients\u2019 TANF benefits as determined by each state\u2019s TANF  program.", "Until February 2012, there were no nationwide federal requirements for  states to take steps aimed at preventing access to TANF cash assistance  at certain locations.

The EBT program was devised in the 1980s  originally to meet the needs of the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA)  Food Stamp Program, in which federal benefits were electronically  disbursed to eligible recipients. These cards are not tied to a consumer  asset account, and generally the account structures and processing  requirements differ from other payment cards. EBT cards can be used to  deliver benefits to banked and unbanked recipients and can be used to  deliver multiple benefits using a single card. The cost savings in the Food  Stamp Program (now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program or SNAP) from using electronic payments to distribute benefits  prompted states to use EBT cards to also distribute TANF benefits  electronically, leveraging the existent EBT system designed for SNAP.  Electronic benefit distribution methods also include Electronic Payment  Cards (EPC). Some EPC cards are prepaid or debit cards that are  branded with a MasterCard, American Express, Discover, or Visa logo,  which allows cardholders to conduct signature-based transactions  anywhere that those brands are accepted as well as at ATM and point-of- sale (POS) machines.", "Electronic benefit cards\u2014both EBT and EPC\u2014generally can be used like  traditional debit or credit cards, in that recipients can use them at ATMs to  withdraw cash, or at retailers\u2019 POS terminals for purchases or to receive  cash by selecting a cash-back option. However, there are some key  differences between the electronic benefit card and commercial credit  cards. The main difference is that electronic benefit cards do not carry a  credit line, and the purchases or withdrawals made with these cards  cannot exceed the amount of recipients\u2019 TANF benefits. With commercial  credit cards, cardholders borrow to make a purchase and then pay the  money back later. Electronic benefit cards are more like debit or stored- value cards and provide an alternative to cash\u2014each time that a  cardholder uses his or her electronic benefit card, the money spent or  withdrawn is deducted from the cardholder\u2019s TANF benefits account.", "States consider various factors when implementing EBT or EPC  programs, including potential financial burden to recipients, such as  transaction fees at ATMs that charge a surcharge for each transaction;  recipient characteristics, such as disabilities; implementation costs; and  fraud and security risks. States also take into account how readily  recipients can access cash assistance. For example, in some rural areas  or low-income neighborhoods the only access point for cash assistance  benefits may be a location such as a grocery store, single depository  institution, or even a liquor store. Some of the benefits to recipients from  states choosing EBT or EPC programs include quicker disbursement of  benefits, the elimination of lost or undelivered paper checks, access to  benefits without an established bank account, and no need to locate  check-cashing venues in order to access benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent TANF Legislative Changes", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 2012, states were not required under federal law to take steps  aimed at preventing specific TANF transactions at certain locations.

Specifically, the Act requires that each state receiving a TANF block grant   maintain policies and practices as necessary to prevent TANF assistance  from being used in any \u201celectronic benefit transfer transaction\u201d in any liquor store; any casino, gambling casino, or gaming establishment; or any retail establishment that provides adult-oriented entertainment in  which performers disrobe or perform in an unclothed state for  entertainment.", "The Act calls for HHS to determine whether states have implemented and  maintained policies and practices to prevent such transactions, within 2  years of the Act\u2019s enactment.

However, HHS may reduce the amount of this  penalty on the basis of the degree of noncompliance of the state in  question.
