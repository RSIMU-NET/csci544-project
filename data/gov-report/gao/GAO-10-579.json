Of the total amount, $62 million was expended for, among other things, project planning, management support, a development environment, and equipment. In addition, the department paid an estimated $65 million to the contractor selected to develop the replacement scheduling application. However, the application software had a large number of defects that VA and the contractor could not resolve. As a result, the department terminated the contract, determined that the system could not be deployed, and officially ended the Scheduling Replacement Project on September 30, 2009. VA began a new initiative that it refers to as HealtheVet Scheduling on October 1, 2009. As of April 2010, the department's efforts on this new initiative had largely consisted of evaluating whether to buy or custom build a new scheduling application. VA's efforts to successfully complete the Scheduling Replacement Project were hindered by weaknesses in several key project management disciplines and a lack of effective oversight that, if not addressed, could undermine the department's second effort to replace its scheduling system: (1) VA did not adequately plan its acquisition of the scheduling application and did not obtain the benefits of competition. (2) VA did not ensure requirements were complete and sufficiently detailed to guide development of the scheduling system. (3) VA performed system tests concurrently, increasing the risk that the system would not perform as intended, and did not always follow its own guidance, leading to software passing through the testing process with unaddressed critical defects. (4) VA's project progress and status reports were not reliable, and included data that provided inconsistent views of project performance. (5) VA did not effectively identify, mitigate, and communicate project risks due to, among other things, staff members' reluctance to raise issues to the department's leadership. (6) VA's various oversight boards had responsibility for overseeing the Scheduling Replacement Project; however, they did not take corrective actions despite the department becoming aware of significant issues. The impact of the scheduling project on the HealtheVet initiative cannot yet be determined because VA has not developed a comprehensive plan for HealtheVet that, among other things, documents the dependencies among the projects that comprise the initiative. VA officials stated that the department plans to document the interdependencies, project milestones, and deliverables in an integrated master schedule as part of a project management plan that is expected to be completed by June 2010. In the absence of such a plan, the impact of the scheduling project's failure on the HealtheVet program is uncertain. Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Chief Information Officer to take six actions to improve key processes, including acquisition management, system testing, and progress reporting, which are essential to the department's second outpatient scheduling system effort. In written comments on a draft of this report, VA generally concurred with GAO's recommendations and described actions to address them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for providing a  variety of services to veterans, including medical care, disability  compensation, and vocational rehabilitation.

In  January 2001, VHA selected VISNs 16 and 17, representing Texas and the  south-central United States, respectively, to perform these tasks.  Additionally, the Muskogee, Oklahoma medical center, part of VISN 16,  was the planned location for the initial deployment of the new scheduling  system.", "The VISNs used a pre-existing Cooperative Administrative Support Units  (CASU) contract to obtain the services of the Southwest Research  Institute (SwRI) to support the project. The statement of work included  tasks to develop business information flow models and information  system technical documents, and to select a COTS product to integrate  into the system. However, according to project officials, in April 2002,  VHA\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) determined that using a COTS  solution would result in excessive costs and make the department  dependent on a vendor for a core business function. Thus, the CIO  directed the VISNs to redirect their efforts and funding to develop a  scheduling application instead of purchasing a COTS application. VA  issued a new statement of work for SwRI to design, build, and test the  scheduling application. The department planned to deliver the new  outpatient scheduling system first to the location in Muskogee, referred to  as the alpha deployment, by December 2004. Once successfully tested and  deployed at this location, the system was to be deployed within VISN 16  and 17 for testing, then nationally to all VHA facilities.", "In 2004, issues integrating the application with HealtheVet components  and funding reductions led to a delay in the alpha deployment date,  pushing it back to October 2006. In an effort to meet the new date, VA  decided in April 2005 to descope the alpha version of the scheduling  application by removing certain planned capabilities. Simultaneously, the  department and SwRI began treating a separate version that was to retain  all planned capabilities as a distinct development effort, referred to as the  beta version. Nevertheless, delays in correcting defects, conducting tests,  and changing the code in response to infrastructure modifications,  resulted in six more extensions of the target alpha deployment date (over  2 \u00bd years beyond the October 2006 planned date).", "Further, in an attempt to expedite the project, in September 2008, the  Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Health directed the project team to  focus its efforts on a national deployment of the new scheduling system by  the end of 2009, rather than on the single-site alpha deployment. However,  in January 2009, the project team determined that the product that had  been developed for alpha deployment would not be suitable for national  deployment by the end of 2009; thus, in February 2009, the department  terminated its contract for the replacement scheduling application.

We noted that the eight major software  development projects comprising the initiative (which included the  Scheduling Replacement Project) were in various stages of development,  and that none had yet been completed. We noted that while VA had  established interim dates for completing the component projects, it had  not developed a detailed schedule or approach for completing the overall  HealtheVet initiative. Further, the department had not yet implemented a  complete governance structure; several key leadership positions within  the development organization had not been filled or were filled with acting  personnel; and the departmental governance boards had not scheduled  critical reviews of HealtheVet projects. We concluded that, without all  elements of governance and oversight in place, the risk to the success of  the HealtheVet initiative and, therefore, its component initiatives (such as  the Scheduling Replacement Project) was increased. Accordingly, we  recommended that VA develop a comprehensive project management plan  and schedule, as well as a governance structure, to guide the development  and integration of the many projects under this complex initiative.  Subsequent to our 2008 report, VA reported that it had begun to formulate  a project management plan, an integrated schedule of projects, and a  governance plan for the HealtheVet initiative.", "Further, in reporting on the development of the replacement scheduling  application in August 2009, the Office of Inspector General noted, among  other things, that VA did not have staff with the necessary expertise to  execute large-scale IT projects. The report also noted that there was  minimal oversight of the contracting processes on the project and that the  department had made no attempt to find a contracting officer with  experience for this multi-year, complex project. The Inspector General  suggested that VA develop effective oversight processes, develop in-house  staff with the expertise to manage and execute complex integrated IT  programs, and expand the number of contracting officers with experience  on large projects.

Further,  VA did not promote competition in contracting for its scheduling system.  Specifically, rather than performing activities that are intended to promote  competition (e.g., announcing the requirement, issuing a solicitation, and  evaluating proposals), VA issued task orders against an existing CASU  contract that the department had in place for acquiring services such as  printing, computer maintenance, and data entry.

For example, defects categorized as  critical, major, and average severity that are identified in testing stage one  (performed within the development team) are to be resolved before testing  in stage two (performed by the testing services organization) is begun.", "Nonetheless, VA took a high-risk approach to testing the scheduling  system by performing tests concurrently rather than incrementally. Based  on information provided by project officials, the department began stage  two testing on all 12 versions of the scheduling application before stage  one testing had been completed. On average, stage two testing began 78  days before stage one testing of the same version had been completed. In  two of these cases, stage two testing started before stage one testing had  begun.

While stage  two testing was ongoing, VA made efforts to reduce the number of defects  by issuing additional task orders for defect repair to its contractor and by  hiring an additional contractor whose role was to assist in defect  resolution.

Identification and reporting of variances and analysis of their causes help  program managers determine the need for corrective actions. In addition,  the cost performance index (CPI) and schedule performance index (SPI)  are indicators of whether work is being performed more or less efficiently  than planned. Like the variances, reporting of CPI and SPI can provide  early warning of potential problems that need correcting to avoid adverse  results. For a complete view of program status and an indication of where  problems exist, performance data should be reported for both current  (generally the most recent month) and cumulative periods. In addition,  federal policy requires that systems used to collect and process EVM data  be compliant with the industry standard developed by the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Electronic Industries Alliance  (EIA), ANSI/EIA Standard 748.

Although department officials asserted that this EVM system was  compliant with ANSI/EIA Standard 748, the department could not provide  documentation of such compliance. Because VA had not demonstrated  compliance with the standard, it could not ensure that the data resulting  from its EVM system and used for progress reporting were reliable.", "Regarding EVM reporting, in January 2006, the scheduling project  management office began providing monthly reports to the department\u2019s  CIO that were based on EVM data. However, in addition to being based on  data from EVM systems that had not been assessed for compliance with  the applicable standard, the progress reports also included contradictory  information about project performance. Specifically, the reports featured  stoplight (i.e., green for \u201cin control,\u201d yellow for \u201ccaution,\u201d or red for \u201cout of  control\u201d) indicators, based on the cumulative CPI and SPI. These  indicators frequently provided a view of project performance that was  inconsistent with the reports\u2019 narrative comments. For example, the  September 2006 report identified cost and schedule performance as green,  even though supporting narrative comments stated that the project  schedule was to be extended by 9 months due to a delay in performing  testing and the need for additional time to repair system defects. The June  2007 report also identified project cost and schedule performance as  green, despite the report noting that the project budget was being  increased by $3 million so that the development contract could be  extended to accommodate schedule delays. Further, the December 2007  report identified cost and schedule performance as green, while at the  same time stating that the development contract was to be extended again  and that a cost variance would be reported in the near future. This pattern  of inconsistent progress reporting continued until October 2008, when the  report for that month and all others through August 2009 showed cost and  schedule performance as red, which was consistent with the actual state  of the project.", "In discussing this matter, the former program manager stated that the  Scheduling Replacement Project complied with the department\u2019s EVM  policies, but noted that the department performed EVM for the scheduling  project only to fulfill the OMB requirement and that the data were not used  as the basis for decision making because doing so was not a part of the  department\u2019s culture. Because VA\u2019s scheduling project was not managed  in accordance with EVM methods that could provide a widely recognized  means of reliably determining and reporting cost and schedule  performance, the department was not positioned to detect performance  shortfalls and initiate timely corrective actions that might have prevented  the project\u2019s failure.

To be effective, risk management activities  should include identifying and prioritizing risks as to their probability of  occurrence and impact, documenting them in an inventory, and developing  and implementing appropriate risk mitigation strategies. By performing  these activities, potential problems can be avoided before they become  actual cost, schedule, and performance shortfalls.", "VA established a process for managing the scheduling project\u2019s risks that  was consistent with relevant best practices. Specifically, project officials  developed a risk management plan for managing risks to the scheduling  project. The plan defined five phases of the risk management process\u2014 risk identification, risk analysis, risk response planning, risk monitoring  and control, and risk review. The plan also defined risk-related roles and  responsibilities for the scheduling project staff and tools to be used to  capture identified risks, track their status, and communicate them. In  addition, project officials captured identified risks to the scheduling  project in an automated tracking tool. Examples of risks identified in the  tool included the risk that hardware at sites where the system was to be  deployed was incompatible with the new application and another related  to SwRI\u2019s failure to meet deliverable dates.", "However, while the department had established a process for managing  risks to the scheduling project, it did not have a comprehensive list of  risks because it did not take key project risks into account. As previously  discussed, we identified problems in VA\u2019s approach to managing the  project in four major areas\u2014acquisition management, requirements  management, system testing, and earned value management. Nevertheless,  VA did not identify as risks its weaknesses in the following three project  management practices: (1) using a noncompetitive acquisition approach,  (2) conducting concurrent testing and initiation of stage two testing with  significant defects, and (3) reporting unreliable project cost and schedule  performance information. Any one of these risks alone had the potential to  adversely impact the outcome of the project. The three of them together  dramatically increased the likelihood that the project would not succeed.  Since these project management weaknesses were not identified as risks,  VA was unable to estimate the significance of their occurrence and decide  what steps should be taken to best manage them.", "Senior project officials indicated that staff members were often reluctant  to raise risks or issues to leadership in the Office of Enterprise  Development due to the emphasis on keeping the project on schedule.  Further, the scheduling program manager recognized that the project  management office was inadequately staffed to implement a disciplined  risk management process and stated that, in September 2008, a full-time  risk manager was added to the staff.", "As VA continues with its latest scheduling effort, it will be critical that the  department identify a comprehensive list of risks so that threats to the  project can be detected and mitigated in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Did Not Conduct Oversight of the Scheduling Replacement Project for 2 Years after Major Problems Occurred", "paragraphs": ["GAO and OMB guidance call for the use of institutional management  processes to control and oversee IT investments. Critical to these  processes are activities to track progress of IT projects, such as milestone  reviews that include mechanisms to identify underperforming projects, so  that timely steps can be taken to address deficiencies. These reviews  should track project performance and progress toward predefined cost  and schedule goals, as well as monitor project benefits and exposure to  risks. Moreover, these activities should be conducted by a department- level investment review board (or comparable entity) composed of senior  executives from the IT office and business units with appropriate authority  to address issues when projects are not meeting cost, schedule, and  performance goals.", "VA\u2019s Enterprise Information Board was established in February 2003 to  provide oversight of IT projects through in-process reviews when projects  experience problems or variances outside of tolerance levels. Similarly,  the Programming and Long-Term Issues Board, established in June 2007 as  a result of the IT realignment, is responsible for performing milestone  reviews and program management reviews of projects. However, between  June 2006 and May 2008, the department did not provide oversight of the  Scheduling Replacement Project, even though the department had become  aware of significant issues indicating that the project was having difficulty  meeting its schedule and performance goals. Specifically, in June 2006,  the project team found that a delivery of software from SwRI included  over 350 defects, leading the office to delay the system deployment by 9  months, from October 2006 to July 2007, to mitigate the defects. A May  2007 report from an independent contractor stated that VA\u2019s project  management team did not have a clear understanding of the status of the  project in terms of progress being made on those defects. Further, a July  2007 review by the Software Engineering Institute found that a test  environment had not been developed and that the schedule for testing did  not include sufficient time to identify and correct all infrastructure issues.  Based on the results of these reviews, the project management office  recommended the project be stopped and reevaluated before moving  forward.", "Despite indications of problems with the project, neither the Enterprise  Information Board nor the Programming and Long-Term Issues Board  conducted reviews between June 2006 and May 2008 that could have  identified corrective actions for the Scheduling Replacement Project. In  June 2008, the Director of the Office of Enterprise Development requested  an operational test readiness review of the replacement scheduling  application by the Programming and Long-Term Issues Board to determine  if the application was ready for deployment. That review identified issues,  including significant critical defects in the application and a lapse in a  contract to resolve defects. According to the chairman of the  Programming and Long-Term Issues Board, it did not conduct reviews of  the scheduling project prior to June 2008 because it was focused on  developing the department\u2019s IT budget strategy.", "In June 2009, VA\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology,  who serves as the department\u2019s CIO, began establishing a new process for  planning and managing its IT projects\u2014the Program Management  Accountability System (PMAS). According to the CIO, this process is  intended to promote near-term visibility into troubled programs, allowing  the department to take corrective actions earlier and avoid long-term  project failures. PMAS is expected to improve oversight of IT projects  through strict adherence to project milestones and imposing strong  corrective measures if a project misses multiple milestones.", "According to the CIO, under PMAS, projects will be expected to deliver  smaller, more frequent releases of new functionality to customers. In  addition, specific program resources and documentation are to be in place  before development begins, and approved processes are to be used during  the system development life cycle. This approach is intended to ensure  that customers, project members, and vendors working on a project are  aligned, accountable, and have access to the resources necessary to  succeed before work begins. For a program to be approved for investment  under PMAS, the program must have, among other things, an established  customer sponsor, a qualified incremental program plan, requirements for  three delivery milestones, and documented success criteria.", "According to the HealtheVet Scheduling program manager, the department  expects to develop plans for the new scheduling initiative, required under  PMAS, once a strategy for the initiative is selected. However, the  department has not yet demonstrated that it can sustain the wholesale  change in management of IT projects that PMAS represents or that this  new approach will be sufficiently robust to prevent or correct weaknesses  such as those that contributed to the Scheduling Replacement Project\u2019s  failure.

Additionally, in defining and managing system requirements, the  department did not perform critically important activities such as ensuring  that the requirements were complete and sufficiently detailed. Further, the  department\u2019s decision to concurrently conduct tests contributed to an  increased risk that the application would not perform as intended, and its  earned value management data did not serve as a reliable indicator of  project performance. Moreover, even though the department had a plan  and process for managing project risks, it did not identify key risks  mentioned or take steps to mitigate them.
