In response to a congressional request, GAO examined CBP traveler inspection efforts, the progress made and the challenges that remain in staffing and training at ports of entry, and the progress CBP has made in developing strategic plans and performance measures for its traveler inspection program. This is a public version of a For Official Use Only report GAO issued on October 5, 2007. To conduct its work, GAO reviewed and analyzed CBP data and documents related to inspections, staffing, and training, interviewed managers and officers, observed inspections at eight major air and land ports of entry, and tested inspection controls at eight small land ports of entry.

In fiscal year 2006, CBP turned away over 200,000 inadmissible aliens and interdicted other violators. Although CBP's goal is to interdict all violators, CBP estimated that several thousand inadmissible aliens and other violators entered the country though ports of entry in fiscal year 2006. Weaknesses in 2006 inspection procedures, such as not verifying the nationality and admissibility of each traveler, contribute to failed inspections. Although CBP took actions to address these weaknesses, subsequent follow up work conducted by GAO months after CBP's actions found that weaknesses such as those described above still existed. In July 2007, CBP issued detailed procedures for conducting inspections including requiring field office managers to assess compliance with these procedures. However, CBP has not established an internal control to ensure field office managers share their assessments with CBP headquarters to help ensure that the new procedures are consistently implemented across all ports of entry and reduce the risk of failed traveler inspections. CBP developed a staffing model that estimates it needs up to several thousand more staff. Field office managers said that staffing shortages affected their ability to carry out anti-terrorism programs and created other vulnerabilities in the inspections process. CBP recognizes that officer attrition has impaired its ability to attain budgeted staffing levels and is in the process of developing a strategy to help curb attrition. CBP has made progress in developing training programs, yet it does not measure the extent to which it provides training to all who need it and whether new officers demonstrate proficiency in required skills. CPB issued a strategic plan for operations at its ports of entry and has collected performance data that can be used to measure its progress in achieving its strategic goals. However, current performance measures do not gauge CBP effectiveness in apprehending inadmissible aliens and other violators, a key strategic goal."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\u2014a major component within  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014is the lead federal agency  in charge of inspecting travelers seeking to enter the United States at air,  land, and sea ports of entry.CBP officers, who number about 17,600 at  these ports of entry, play a critical role in carrying out this responsibility.  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, their role has involved  increased emphasis on countering threats posed by terrorists and others  attempting to enter the country with fraudulent or altered travel  documents. Intelligence officials believe that the United States will face a  persistent and evolving terrorist threat and that the terrorist group al  Qaeda will intensify its efforts to put operatives here. There is also a  growing concern that terrorists with no criminal record may use legitimate  travel documents when they attempt to enter the country through ports of  entry.", "In addition to its homeland security responsibilities, CBP is responsible for  preventing inadmissible aliens, criminals, and inadmissible goods from  entering the country. Doing so is a difficult task given the high volume of  travelers and goods that enter the country. For example, officers  frequently carry out their responsibilities with little time to make decisions  about admitting individuals into the country because they also face  pressure to facilitate the cross-border movement of millions of legitimate  travelers and billions of dollars in international trade.", "When CBP was created in March 2003, it represented a merger of  components from three departments\u2014the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S.  Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Animal and Plant Health  Inspection Service. As part of the merger, CBP moved forward with an  approach that was to allow a CBP officer, with the proper cross-training,  to carry out homeland security as well as traditional customs and  immigration responsibilities. For example, former customs inspectors  would be trained and work on tasks traditionally done by immigration  inspectors and vice versa. The CBP officer would also be capable of  referring agricultural violations to agricultural specialists. By training  officers from legacy agencies to perform both the customs and  immigration functions, CBP aimed to have a well-trained and well- integrated workforce to carry out the range of the agency\u2019s missions.", "In July 2003, we reported on vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in traveler  inspections. Given the critical role that CBP plays in homeland security,  you asked us to review the progress CBP has made in strengthening its  ability to inspect travelers arriving at the nation\u2019s international airports  and land borders.  In response, on October 5, 2007, we issued a For  Official Use Only report that addressed the following questions:    What success and challenges has CBP had in interdicting inadmissible  aliens and other violators at its ports of entry?", "What progress has CBP made in improving staffing and training at its  ports of entry and how successful has it been in carrying out these  workforce programs?", "What progress and problems has CBP encountered in setting goals and  performance measures for its traveler inspection program?", "As our October 2007 report contained information that DHS considered  law enforcement sensitive, this version of the report omits sensitive  information about CBP\u2019s traveler inspection efforts, including information  on the techniques used to carry out inspections, data on the number of  inadmissible aliens and other violators that enter the country each year,  and data on staffing at ports of entry.  In addition, at DHS\u2019s request, we  have redacted the specific locations that we visited.", "The overall methodology used for our initial report is relevant to this  version of the report since the information in this product is derived from  our first report.  To address the questions above, we analyzed information  and data on CBP\u2019s traveler inspections, staffing, and training at ports of  entry. We reviewed CBP policies and procedures for the traveler  inspection program as well as other documents related to traveler  inspection efforts. We interviewed CBP officials on the status of CBP  efforts to develop a staffing model, train staff, carry out traveler  inspections, and develop performance measures. For information that  would provide an overall picture of CBP\u2019s efforts, we reviewed and  analyzed several nationwide databases, including data on staffing, training,  attrition, resource requests from CBP\u2019s 20 field offices  and one pre- clearance headquarters office, and apprehension of inadmissible aliens  and other violators at major airp and land ports of entry. We assessed the  reliability of CBP\u2019s data from CBP\u2019s random selection program of travelers  and staffing and training data by, among other things, meeting with  knowledgeable officials about these data, reviewing relevant  documentation, and performing electronic testing. We concluded that data  from CBP databases, with the exception of the data on training as we  discuss later in our report, were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our review. Although we discussed the staffing model and its results with  CBP officials responsible for the model, validating the model and its  results was outside the scope of our review.", "To supplement our analyses of CBP\u2019s nationwide data, we visited eight  ports of entry. While we cannot generalize our work from our visits to all  ports of entry, we chose these ports of entry to provide examples of  operations at air and land ports of entry. At each site, we held discussion  groups with CBP officers and met with management to discuss, among  other things, staffing and training programs. In addition, GAO investigators  visited other ports of entry to test the traveler inspection process.  Although we cannot generalize our investigator\u2019s work at these locations  to all ports of entry, we selected these ports of entry to provide examples  of traveler inspections.  Our investigators did their work in accordance  with quality standards for investigations as set forth by the President\u2019s  Council on Integrity and Efficiency. Unless we specify that the work was  done by our investigators, all referrals to our visits to ports of entry pertain  to the eight ports of entry cited above. In addition, we analyzed the 2004  and 2006 Office of Personnel Management Federal Human Capital Surveys  of staff at 36 federal agencies, including the results from CBP, that dealt  with the views of federal employees on training and staffing in the  workplace. We reviewed standards for internal control in the federal  government and compared the standards for information and  communications and monitoring with CBP\u2019s policies and procedures for  traveler inspections. Finally, we reviewed prior GAO reports on best  practices for developing strategic plans and performance measures and  compared the best practices with CBP\u2019s plans and measures for its  operations at its ports of entry.

CBP has three  main components that have border security responsibilities. First, CBP\u2019s  Office of Field Operations is responsible for processing the flow of people  and goods that enter the country through air, land, and sea ports of entry  where CBP officers inspect travelers and goods to determine whether they  may be legally admitted into the country. Second, CBP\u2019s Border Patrol  works to prevent the illegal entry of persons and contraband into the  United States between the ports of entry. The Border Patrol is responsible  for controlling nearly 7,000 miles of the nation\u2019s land borders between  ports of entry and 95,000 miles of maritime border in partnership with the  United States Coast Guard. Third, CBP\u2019s Office of Air and Marine helps to  protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure through the coordinated use of  an integrated force of air and marine resources and provides mission  support to the other CBP components. For fiscal year 2007, CBP had a $9.3  billion budget, of which $2.5 billion was for border security and trade  facilitation at ports of entry.", "In carrying out its responsibilities, CBP operates 326 official ports of entry,  composed of airports, seaports, and designated land ports of entry along  the northern and southern borders. Ports of entry vary considerably in  size and volume, including diverse locations such as major airports like  New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy (JFK) International Airport, and the busiest  land crossing in the United States at San Ysidro, California, which  processes over 17 million vehicles a year (see fig. 1); small ports in remote  rural locations along the Canadian border that process only a few  thousand vehicles every year; and seaports like the Port of Miami where  cruise ships transport more than 3 million travelers into and out of the  country each year. Most ports of entry are land border crossings located  along the northern border with Canada or the southern border with  Mexico. The four largest land border ports of entry by traveler volume  are at San Ysidro, Calexico, and Otay Mesa in California, and the Bridge of  Americas in El Paso, Texas. In total, these four ports process about 27  percent of all travelers who enter the country by land.", "CBP annually processes over 400 million passenger and pedestrian  entries, 20 million containers, and 130 million conveyances through  ports of entry. In fiscal year 2005, the most recent year for which traveler  data are available by mode of entry, land border crossings were by far the  busiest for processing people, with about three out of four entries into the  country occurring through a land port of entry (see fig. 2)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Process for Inspecting Travelers Differs between Air and Land Ports of Entry", "paragraphs": ["The process for inspecting travelers at airports is significantly different  than the process at land ports of entry. Prior to departure from foreign  airports, airline carriers electronically submit passenger manifest  information to CBP. CBP officers cross-check passengers against a wide  range of law enforcement databases before travelers enter the country.  Upon arrival in the United States, international airline passengers are first  subject to immigration inspections that check visas, passports, and  biometric data (see fig. 3). Generally, international passengers arriving by  air must present a U.S. passport, permanent resident card, foreign  passport, or a foreign passport containing a visa issued by the Department  of State. CBP officers may also inspect the luggage of travelers.", "CBP faces a much greater challenge to identify and screen individuals at  land ports of entry, in part because of the lack of advance traveler  information and the high volume of traffic at many locations. Unlike  travelers who enter the country at airports, travelers entering through land  ports of entry can arrive at virtually any time and may present thousands  of different forms of documentation, ranging from oral declarations of U.S.  or Canadian citizenship, driver\u2019s licenses, birth certificates, passports,  visas, permanent resident cards, or U.S. military identity cards. Travelers  entering the country by bus or rail must provide documentation and may  be subject to further inspection.

The first requirement is  for the CBP officer to determine if the person is a U.S. citizen or an alien,  and if an alien, establish whether the person meets the criteria for  admission into the country. Current documentation requirements for entry  into the country vary depending on the nationality of the traveler and the  mode of entry. For example, U.S. citizens arriving at land ports of entry  currently may seek to establish citizenship to a CBP officer through an  oral declaration of citizenship. In general, nonimmigrant aliens arriving at  land and air ports of entry must present a valid, unexpired passport as well  as, depending on country of origin and intended length of stay in the  United States, a valid, unexpired visa issued by a U.S. embassy or  consulate for entry into the country. As most travelers attempting to enter  the country through ports of entry have a legal basis for doing so, a  streamlined screening procedure referred to as a primary inspection is  used to process those individuals who can be readily identified as  admissible. Persons whose admissibility cannot be readily determined and  persons selected as part of a random selection process are subjected to a  more detailed review called a secondary inspection. This involves a closer  inspection of travel documents and possessions, additional questioning by  CBP officers, and cross references through multiple law enforcement  databases to verify the traveler\u2019s identity, background, purpose for  entering the country, and other corroborating information.

As part of its actions to  address these concerns, in March 2003, DHS created CBP by merging  employees from the three legacy agencies previously responsible for  border security. Among other considerations, DHS formed CBP to  establish a unified command structure that was intended to reduce  duplication of efforts while improving the sharing of information. For  operations at ports of entry, in September 2003 CBP issued its plan for  consolidating the inspection functions formerly performed by separate  inspectors from the three legacy agencies. The plan, referred to as \u201cOne  Face at the Border,\u201d called for unifying and integrating the legacy  inspectors into two new positions\u2014a CBP officer and a CBP agricultural  specialist. The new CBP officer would serve as the frontline officer  responsible for carrying out the priority anti-terrorism mission as well as  the traditional customs and immigration inspection functions, while also  identifying and referring goods in need of a more extensive agricultural  inspection to the agricultural specialist. CBP anticipated that having a  well-trained and well-integrated workforce that could carry out the  complete range of inspection functions involving the processing of  individuals and goods would allow it to utilize its inspection resources  more effectively and enable it to better target potentially high-risk  travelers. Together, CBP envisioned the result to be more effective  inspections and enhanced security at ports of entry while also accelerating  the processing of legitimate trade and travel.", "While it has been about 4 years since the formation of DHS and CBP, our  prior work on mergers and acquisitions found that it generally takes 5 to 7  years to successfully complete such a transformation. For example, GAO  designated DHS\u2019s overall transformation as a high-risk area in 2003 based  on three factors. First, DHS faced a formidable task in implementing a  transformation process that would effectively combine 22 disparate  agencies with an estimated 170,000 employees into one department.  Second, many of these agencies were facing their own challenges in  management areas such as strategic human capital, information  technology, and financial management; thus, DHS inherited a host of  operational and management challenges from the beginning. Third, DHS\u2019s  national security mission is critically important and failure to effectively  address its management challenges and program risks could have serious  consequences for national security as well as have major economic  impacts. CBP, as part of DHS, faces many similar challenges in its efforts  to unify three agencies into one and in transforming the role of its officers.  For example, with over 40,000 employees, CBP represented the largest  merger of people and functions within DHS. Additionally, our prior work  on the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs  Service, two of the primary agencies involved in the merger, showed that  these agencies experienced many management challenges before their  merger into CBP.

CBP officers also intercepted 40,362 fraudulent documents  used in attempts to enter the country illegally in fiscal year 2006. Over half  (21,292) of the fraudulent documents intercepted by CBP involved the  alteration or improper use of travel documents issued by the U.S  Department of State. About 80 percent of these documents involved  impostors\u2014that is, people using authentic, unaltered documents that had  been validly issued to another person.

They include the following:    New cargo inspection technology.  According to CBP, it has  installed nonintrusive inspection technologies at ports of entry that  enable officers to rapidly inspect vehicles and truck containers for  inadmissible aliens and other violators, nuclear or radiological  weapons, or other contraband (see fig. 4). Other nonintrusive  technologies, such as radiation detectors, allow CBP to inspect  containerized truck and sea cargo without having to perform a time- intensive manual search or other intrusive examinations of the  contents.", "Additional requirements for screening passengers. To improve its  ability to target high-risk individuals that are on international flights  bound for the United States, CBP in fiscal year 2007, issued a ruling  that requires airlines provide passenger manifest information prior to  departure.

As part of CBP  efforts to facilitate legitimate trade and travel, CBP has implemented  several initiatives to increase enrollment in its trusted traveler  programs, such as the Secure Electronic Network for Travelers\u2019 Rapid  Inspection (SENTRI) program on the southern border and the NEXUS  program on the northern border. These programs allow registered  border residents and frequent cross-border travelers identified as low- risk individuals access to dedicated lanes and expedited processing  with minimal inspection (see fig. 5). Participants undergo a thorough  background check, a fingerprint law enforcement check, and a  personal interview with a CBP officer. Enrollment in these two  programs totaled nearly 260,000 members in fiscal year 2007. In  addition, as part of an initiative among the United States, Canada, and  Mexico, CBP operates a trusted traveler program called the Free and  Secure Trade (FAST) program, for truck companies involved in  transporting cargo through land ports of entry.

At our  request, CBP officials showed us a 15-minute video that CBP had prepared  that documented noncompliance with inspection requirements. The  following were examples of weaknesses that were on the video:  In one instance, officers waved vehicles into the United States without  stopping the vehicle or interviewing the driver or its passengers as  required. In another instance, motorcycles passed through inspection  lanes without stopping and making any contact with an officer. In a  third instance, during \u201clane switches\u201d when CBP officers were relieved  of their duty and replaced by other officers, officers waved traffic  through the lane while the officer logged into the computer.

For example, after CBP headquarters issued directives,  held musters, and issued memorandums to field office and port managers  that emphasized the importance of carrying out improved traveler  inspections in July 2006, many of the same weaknesses they attempted to  deal with continued to exist at ports of entry we visited. In October 2006  and January 2007, or as much as 5 months after managers informed  officers of the need to carry out traveler inspections in a more rigorous  way by interviewing travelers and examining their travel documents, our  investigators identified weaknesses in traveler inspections that were  similar to those identified in CBP\u2019s 15-minute video.  At several ports of  entry, our investigators found that a CBP officer was not staffing the booth  when they arrived for inspection.  At other locations, CBP officers did not  ask for travel documents from our investigators. For example, at one port,  when our investigators arrived at the port of entry, one of them called over  to three officers who were seated at desks behind a counter about ten feet  away.  One of the officers asked our investigator if he was a U.S. citizen  and the investigator said \u201cyes.\u201d  The CBP officers did not get up from their  desks to ask for any identification, asked no other question, and allowed  our investigator to enter the country. At another port of entry, a CBP  officer was not present at the primary inspection booth when our  investigator arrived for inspection and he had to wait approximately 3 to 4  minutes before an officer arrived.", "While CBP\u2019s new policies and procedures are a step in the right direction,  ensuring their proper implementation will be key to overcoming  weaknesses in traveler inspections. An effective internal control  environment is a key method to help agency managers achieve program  objectives and enhance their ability to address identified weaknesses. CBP  is taking positive steps to implement some control requirements. For  example, one of the standards for internal control in the federal  government involves monitoring to assess the quality of performance over  time. To monitor how traveler inspections are conducted at ports of entry,  CBP headquarters has developed a program to covertly test the integrity of  existing security measures at ports of entry, including the work carried out  by CBP officers. In addition, CBP headquarters officials are called on to  conduct compliance reviews. Last, CBP\u2019s new policies and procedures on  traveler inspections call on field office directors to ensure compliance  with the new inspection procedures at all ports of entry by conducting  audits and assessments. Internal control standards state that information  should be communicated to management to enable it to carry out its  program responsibilities. However, CBP does not require that field offices  share the results of their audits and assessments with CBP headquarters  management. Without obtaining and receiving the results of field office  audits and assessments, CBP management may be hindered in its ability to  efficiently use the information to overcome weaknesses in traveler  inspections and identify best practices that may occur during  implementation of its new policies and procedures.", "Querying all travelers arriving at land ports of entry against CBP law  enforcement databases represents a major challenge for CBP. As  discussed earlier in this report, CBP\u2019s new policies and procedures require  officers, to the extent feasible, to query travel documents of all travelers  who arrive at primary inspection at land ports of entry. In contrast, CBP  officers at airports generally handle and query documents of all travelers.  Taking the time to enter information into CBP\u2019s law enforcement database  for the several hundred million travelers arriving at primary inspection  could hinder CBP\u2019s ability to facilitate the movement of legitimate travel  and commerce.", "DHS\u2019s planned Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, when implemented  at land ports of entry, may allow CBP to query more travelers against law  enforcement databases and could improve CBP\u2019s ability to identify  inadmissible aliens and other violators without harming commerce and  travel. The initiative generally requires travelers to have a passport or  passport-like document to enter the United States from Canada, Mexico,  and other countries in the western hemisphere that is machine-readable  and therefore can be more quickly and accurately checked against CBP\u2019s  law enforcement database than currently acceptable documents. CBP has  already implemented the initiative at air ports of entry, but has yet to do so  at land ports of entry. When the initiative is implemented at land ports of  entry, CBP officers may be able to query more documents because DHS  estimates that processing a traveler at primary inspection will be reduced  by 15 to 25 seconds because all travelers will have documents that will be  machine readable."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Problems with Physical Infrastructure Increase the Risk That Vehicles Could Bypass Land Ports of Entry", "paragraphs": ["CBP\u2019s effectiveness at securing the nation\u2019s borders depends not only on  the quality of traveler inspections, but also on the degree to which physical  infrastructure is in place to reduce the risk that inadmissible aliens and  other violators could bypass inspection points and enter the country.

CBP\u2019s Office of Finance has compiled resource assessments for  163 land crossings and has prioritized the ports with the greatest need.

For example, these senior CBP officials noted that they do not have the  discretion to make infrastructure improvements on their own, such as  installing barriers and bollards, when they do not own the property and  therefore need to coordinate their efforts with other entities, such as  private bridge commissions or state highway departments. For capital  improvements at ports of entry, such as building new vehicle lanes or  secondary inspection facilities, the CBP officials said the lead time for  making such improvements was long. For example, according to these  CBP officials, for the 96 ports of entry that are owned by the General  Services Administration (GSA), GSA approves and prioritizes capital  improvement projects. The process of submitting a request for an  infrastructure improvement and completion of the project is  approximately 7 years from start to finish, according to a GSA official. For  the 23 ports of entry that are privately owned and leased by GSA, CBP  officials noted that coordinating with privately owned companies on  infrastructure improvements is a difficult process because the private  owner\u2019s interest in facilitating commerce must be balanced with CBP\u2019s  interest in national security. According to CBP officials, the degree to  which improvements will be made at land ports of entry and how long it  will take depend on available funding and the results of discussions with  various stakeholders, such as GSA and private port owners. Each year,  depending upon funding availability, CBP submits its proposed capital  improvement projects based upon the prioritized list it has developed.

In  responding to language in the conference report for the fiscal year 2007  DHS appropriations and the SAFE Port Act of 2006, CBP developed a  staffing model for its land, air, and sea ports of entry. The conference  report directed CBP to develop the staffing model in a way that would  align officer resources with threats, vulnerabilities, and workload. This  directive stemmed, in part, from concern about CBP\u2019s ability to effectively  manage its growing workload, minimize wait times, and ensure that CBP  officers receive adequate training in all relevant inspection functions. The  staffing model is designed to determine the optimum number of CBP  officers that each port of entry needs in order to accomplish its mission  responsibilities. According to CBP staff involved in developing the staffing  model, it is primarily driven by traveler volume and inspection processing  times. The staffing model also incorporates assumptions for training, anti- terrorism activities, and staffing for special equipment, such as radiation  portal monitors. According to CBP officials, the model\u2019s assumptions will  be recalculated each fiscal year in order to account for changes caused by  new requirements, procedures, or changes in workload. For example,  when the new inspection requirements come into effect under the Western  Hemisphere Travel Initiative, CBP can adjust the processing times in the  staffing model, which may result in changes in the number of staff  needed, according to CBP officials. CBP plans to use the staffing model  to help management decide on the number of staff needed and where they  should be deployed.", "In July 2007, CBP provided us with the results for the staffing model.

CBP used the quarterly  resource assessment reports to help determine the number of officers to  allocate to each office, but the majority of the requests went unfilled due,  in part, to budget constraints. In January 2007, 19 of CBP\u2019s 21 offices  identified a need for additional officers to accomplish their anti-terrorism  responsibilities through special operations and anti-terrorism teams;  operate new equipment, such as radiation portal monitors and non- intrusive inspection technologies, both of which are relatively new  additions to CBP\u2019s mission responsibilities; and to deal with increased  workload from increased traveler volume and the expansion of primary  inspection lanes and other facilities.", "Managers, supervisors, and officers at seven of the eight ports of entry that  we visited provided examples of how insufficient staffing affects their  ability to carry out primary and secondary inspections:  Anti-terrorism and other traveler inspection programs are not fully  carried out.

During this  time, CBP officers said they apprehended 96 criminals, inadmissible aliens,  and other violators who were in line for primary inspection.", "Double shifts can result in officer fatigue. Due to staffing shortages, ports  of entry rely on overtime to accomplish their inspection responsibilities.  Officers at six of the eight ports of entry we visited indicated that officer  fatigue caused by excessive overtime negatively affected inspections at  their ports of entry.

According to CBP officials at headquarters and the ports of  entry we visited, the gap between the budgeted staffing level and the  number of officers onboard is attributable in part to high attrition, with  ports of entry losing officers faster than they can hire replacements.  Through March 2007, CBP data show that, on average, 52 CBP officers left  the agency each 2-week pay period in fiscal year 2007, up from 34 officers  in fiscal year 2005.

Using data from its COMPEX program, CBP uses a  measure\u2014called the compliance rate\u2014which showed that in fiscal year  2006 about 99 percent of travelers who seek to enter the United States  through 19 major airports and by vehicle at 25 major land ports were in  compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.", "We have reported that linking performance to strategic goals and  objectives and publicly reporting this information are important so that  Congress and agency management have better information about agency  performance and help to ensure accountability. CBP\u2019s current  performance measure, the compliance rate, shows the extent to which  travelers arriving at ports of entry meet the legal requirements for entering  the country. CBP does not use data that measure the extent to which it is  intercepting inadmissible aliens and other violators, one of CBP\u2019s key  strategic objectives. As discussed earlier in our report, CBP calculates a  measure known as the apprehension rate as part of its COMPEX program,  which provides an estimate of the agency\u2019s effectiveness in apprehending  travelers seeking to enter the country illegally or in violation of other laws.  The COMPEX program was originally developed by the former U.S.  Customs Service to comply with the Government Performance and Results  Act, which requires federal agencies to develop outcome-based  performance goals and measures, when possible, as a way to assess the  effectiveness and efficiency of their programs.", "During the course of our review, we discussed with CBP officials the  potential of using the apprehension rate as one way of measuring the  effectiveness of CBP interdiction efforts.

As CBP matures as an  organization, having effective inspection procedures, retaining its officer  corps, and developing the necessary skills in its officer corps are essential  given the critical role that CBP plays in national security. Although CBP  developed new inspection procedures that require CBP field office  directors to monitor and assess compliance with the new procedures, a  key internal control requiring field office directors to communicate with  CBP management the results of their monitoring and assessment efforts is  not in place. As a result, CBP management may not get information that  would identify weaknesses in the traveler inspections process that need to  be addressed. The initial set of actions that CBP has taken for dealing with  challenges in training at ports of entry is a positive start, but it has not  established a mechanism to know whether officers who need specific  cross-training have received it and whether new CBP officers have  experience in the necessary job tasks and are proficient in them. This  means that some officers may be called on to perform certain inspection  tasks without having the knowledge and skills to do them.", "It is also important to have performance measures in place to permit  agency management to gauge progress in achieving program goals and, if  not, to take corrective action. In regard to traveler inspections, CBP is  missing an important performance measure that shows what results are  achieved in apprehending inadmissible aliens and other violators. CBP has  apprehension rate data that could be used to develop such a performance  measure.

In addition, CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations (OFO) will evaluate how the  Border Patrol is implementing its on-the-job training program and analyze  its compatibility to OFO.  If effectively implemented, these actions should  help address the intent of our recommendations.", "CBP took issue with an example we used in our draft report describing a  situation where two GAO investigators who tested the traveler inspection  process at land port of entry were not asked for any identification.  We  stated that as our investigators attempted to enter at the port, the CBP  officer\u2014who was seated behind a desk about 10 feet away\u2014only asked  our investigators if they were U.S. citizens and the investigators said \u201cyes.\u201d   DHS stated that under current statute and regulation, a person claiming to  be a United States citizen arriving at a port of entry is not required to  provide identity documents as long as the subject can establish, to the  satisfaction of the inspecting officer, citizenship.  DHS stated that because  CBP officers were satisfied with the citizenship of the two investigators at  the time of inspection, identity documents were not required.", "We agree that an identity document is not required for U.S. citizens at land  ports of entry.  However, this example is meant to convey that some  inspections were not meeting the intent of CBP\u2019s July 2006 management  guidance calling for more thorough inspections through traveler  interviews and document review.  Asking a traveler one question about  citizenship when seated at a desk about 10 feet away does not seem to be  consistent with the more thorough inspections called for in CBP\u2019s  management guidance.

(2) What progress has CBP made in  improving staffing and training at its ports of entry and how successful has  it been in carrying out these workforce programs? (3) What progress and  problems CBP has encountered in setting goals and performance  measures for its traveler inspection program?", "On October 5, 2007, we issued a report that answered the above questions,  but it contained information that DHS considered law enforcement  sensitive.  This version of the report omits sensitive information about  CBP\u2019s traveler inspection efforts, including information on the techniques  used to carry out inspections, data on the number of inadmissible aliens  and other violators that enter the country each year, and data on staffing at  ports of entry.  In addition, at DHS\u2019s request, we have redacted the specific  locations that we visited.", "The overall methodology used for our initial report is relevant to this  version of the report since the information in this product is derived from  our first report.  Specifically, we, performed our work at the Department  of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) CBP offices, based in Washington, D.C. We  also conducted work at 8 ports of entry\u2014three airports and five land  crossings.  While we cannot generalize our work from our visits to all  ports of entry, we chose these ports of entry to provide examples of  operations at ports of entry.  At each location, we held group sessions with  CBP officers and supervisors. We also interviewed port management and  staff involved in training. In addition, our investigators conducted  vulnerability assessments of inspection procedures at 8 additional ports of  entry. Our investigators conducted covert operations to evaluate screening  procedures at small ports of entry.  Although we cannot generalize our  investigators\u2018 work at these locations to all ports of entry, we selected  these ports of entry to provide examples of traveler inspections at small  ports of entry. Our investigators did their work in accordance with quality  standards for investigations as set forth by the President\u2019s Council on  Integrity and Efficiency. In assessing the adequacy of internal controls, we  used the criteria in GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, GAO/AIMD 00-21.3.1, dated November 1999.  These  standards, issued pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Managers'  Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), provide the overall framework for  establishing and maintaining internal control in the federal government.   Also pursuant to FMFIA, the Office of Management and Budget issued  Circular A-123, revised December 21, 2004, to provide the specific  requirements for assessing the reporting on internal controls.  Internal  control standards and the definition of internal control in Circular A-123  are based on the GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government.", "To determine what success and challenges CBP has had in interdicting  inadmissible aliens and other violators at its ports of entry, we interviewed  CBP headquarters officials, such as officials from the Offices of Field  Operations, Policy and Planning, Finance, and Training and Development.  We obtained and analyzed available DHS documents on traveler  inspections, more specifically on COMPEX data (a compliance  measurement to determine an overall estimated rate of compliance for  travelers), and port infrastructure assessments. For example, we  examined COMPEX data that estimate the total number of inadmissible  aliens and other violators that seek to enter the country, and compared  their compliance and apprehension rates. We assessed the reliability of the  COMPEX data by (1) talking with knowledgeable officials about how  COMPEX inspections are conducted, documented, and how the  apprehension rate estimates are generated; (2) reviewing relevant  documentation; and (3) replicating the calculations for the apprehension  rates that were provided in the COMPEX reports. We determined the  COMPEX estimates were sufficiently reliable for illustrating apprehension  rates for the ports of entry the COMPEX program covers. Additionally, we  also analyzed CBP\u2019s Strategic Resource Assessment, an evaluation and  planning tool designed to identify a port\u2019s infrastructure needs and  operational impact on traveler inspections. We also evaluated the CBP  Inspector\u2019s Field Manual to determine inspections-related requirements.  During our eight site visits, we met with and interviewed field office  directors and senior port management staff. During our interviews, we (1)  discussed CBP\u2019s success in interdicting inadmissible aliens and other  violators and the vulnerabilities in the inspections procedures and  concerns related to physical infrastructure and (2) obtained available  documentation regarding traveler-related inspections policies and  procedures. At each port of entry we visited, we observed both primary  and secondary screening procedures and conducted discussion group  sessions with officers and supervisors. At each port of entry we visited, we  obtained a list of CBP officers scheduled to work during our site visit and  from that list we randomly selected officers and supervisors to participate  in our sessions at six of the eight ports we visited. We organized the  discussion groups by whether they were from legacy organizations or  became CBP officers after the merger. At two ports of entry, local  management selected officers who would attend the discussion groups  and interviews. The group discussions covered a variety of discussion  topics, particularly officers\u2019 perceptions and experiences with the \u201cOne  Face at the Border\u201d initiative and associated challenges in conducting  inspections at ports of entry. Over 200 CBP officers participated in our  discussion group sessions. In addition to the discussion groups, we also  conducted meetings (usually groups of two to four) with CBP chiefs, line  supervisors, and specialists (e.g., officers assigned to the intelligence or  canine units). These meetings were designed to collect perceptions from  CBP middle management and specialists. Additionally, we reviewed a  videotape prepared by CBP that documented noncompliance with  inspection requirements.  Finally, we reviewed CBP\u2019s new policies and  procedures for traveler inspections at land ports of entry.", "To examine what progress CBP has made in improving staffing and  training at its ports of entry and how successful has it been in carrying out  these workforce programs, we interviewed CBP headquarters officials,  including those from the Offices of Field Operations, Policy and Planning,  Human Resource Management, and Training and Development. We  obtained and analyzed available CBP reports on staffing and training data.  For example, we analyzed staffing data from CBP\u2019s Quarterly Resource  Assessment, an allocation tool used by field offices to identify the port\u2019s  need for additional resources (e.g., request for additional officers). We  also collected and analyzed data from CBP\u2019s National Training Plan, a  comprehensive guide that documents recommended training guidelines  for CBP officers. At each major port we visited, we met with field office  directors and senior port management. During our meetings we discussed  staffing and training challenges that affected port operations. Follow-up  meetings with CBP headquarters officials resulted in receiving staffing  numbers from the Quarterly Resource Assessment\u2014an assessment tool  used by CBP to identify field office needs and resources\u2014that  documented field offices\u2019 request for additional officers. We reviewed  headquarters guidance on the on-the-job training program, then met with  field office directors and training coordinators. We assessed the reliability  of the staffing data by (1) talking with knowledgeable officials about  staffing resources, (2) reviewing relevant documentation, and (3)  comparing budgeted staffing numbers to officers currently onboard.  Although CBP provided us with the results of the staffing model and not  the model itself, we reviewed the model with knowledgeable officials,  including the assumptions that were used to produce the estimated  staffing needs. We understand that the staffing requirements the model  produces will vary depending on the assumptions used and we present the  key assumptions in the text of our report. Although we discussed the  staffing model and its results with CBP officials responsible for the model,  validating the model and its results was outside the scope of our review.   During the course of our review, we analyzed November 2006 training data  from ports of entry that showed the number of officers that had taken  cross-training modules as well as the number of officers that local port  management had identified as still needing to take a certain module.  However, when we compared July 2007 training data with the November  2006 data from ports of entry, we identified inconsistencies with the data.  For example, the July 2007 data showed that 120 fewer officers had taken  training in a module when compared with the November 2006 data.  Because of inconsistencies such as these, we did not use these data in our  report. We also reviewed the Border Patrol\u2019s on-the-job training program  to identify best practices. Finally, we assessed nonsupervisory CBP  employees\u2019 perceptions of the effectiveness of CBP\u2019s workforce  management in areas such as job satisfaction, performance evaluation,  providing employees sufficient resources to do their jobs, and meeting  training needs by analyzing results from the 2004 and 2006 Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) Federal Human Capital Survey.  In  addition, we discussed CBP\u2019s training program with officers during  discussion groups at the eight ports of entry we visited.  To get a  perspective on how these results ranked against other federal agencies, we  compared the results of our analysis for nonsupervisory CBP employees  with responses from nonsupervisory staff in the other DHS component  agencies as well as the responses from the other 36 federal agencies  included in the survey.", "To examine what progress CBP has made in setting goals and performance  measures for its traveler inspection program, we interviewed and  corresponded with officials in CBP\u2019s Offices of Field Operations, Policy  and Planning, and Human Resources Management. In addition, to identify  CBP\u2019s strategic goals and performance measures for inspecting travelers,  we reviewed agency documents such as CBP\u2019s Strategic Plan for 2005 to  2010, CBP Performance and Accountability Reports for fiscal years 2005  and 2006, and OFO\u2019s strategic plan, Securing America\u2019s Borders at Ports of  Entry (FY 2007- 2011).", "We conducted our work from August 2006 through September 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: CBP\u2019s Strengths and Challenges, According to OPM Surveys", "paragraphs": ["To gain a broader view of CBP nonsupervisory staff perspectives on  workforce issues, we analyzed results from the 2004 and 2006 OPM  Federal Human Capital Survey of 36 federal departments or agencies.

For staffing, we estimate  that CBP staff gave low marks to CBP for (1) the adequacy of sufficient  resources to get the job done and (2) their work unit being able to recruit  people with the right skills. With respect to training, less than half of CBP\u2019s  staff were reportedly satisfied with (1) the quality of the training received,  (2) CBP\u2019s assessment of their training needs, and (3) supervisory support  for employee development (see table 3).", "CBP acknowledges that it needs to improve its workforce management,  particularly focusing on raising employees\u2019 perceptions of CBP leadership,  enhancing training and career development, and attitudes toward the  performance culture at CBP. CBP has formulated a business plan that  outlines a variety of corrective actions and initiatives it will take to achieve  results in each of these areas. From a strategic standpoint, CBP will  establish a Human Capital Advisory Board, composed of senior field  leadership from the major CBP offices, that will serve as the central  contact point for all program offices, advise and assist with implementing  the initiatives outlined in the business plan, and asses the potential for  forming an Employee Action Team Advisory Board. To facilitate  communication with CBP employees about management actions, the plan  sets forth a variety of potential actions, such as creating a Web site on the  CBP intranet where CBP supervisors and employees can review the  current workforce issues being addressed or results from actions taken,  adding a link to CBP\u2019s Web site where the public can access information to  learn how CBP is addressing the survey results, and holding town hall  meetings at key locations with the Commissioner and other high-level  management.

To  accomplish these goals, CBP plans to create a leadership development  checklist to make sure supervisors are addressing critical areas identified  through the employee focus groups, and intends to increase the marketing  of its recently implemented training course for incumbent supervisors as  well as continue the development of training for supervisors newly  promoted into management positions. These courses cover integrity,  communication, conflict management, and holding effective roundtable  discussions. Within the performance culture initiative, CBP wants to find  better ways of recognizing employees\u2019 performance that will improve their  perceptions about the fairness of CBP\u2019s performance recognition while  also supporting a balance between work and family life, which employees  also rated poorly. CBP\u2019s plan includes, among other things, a call for  improving the channels of communication used to inform supervisors and  managers about the type and scope of discretionary performance awards  they have at their disposal to issue throughout the year. It also suggests  encouraging management at all levels of CBP to have more frequent  employee recognition events, to publish award recipients and best  practices, and to make awards management a component of performance  standards for supervisory personnel. Finally, within the talent  management initiative, the plan calls for Human Resources to complete its  competency, skills, and needs assessment by the third quarter of fiscal  year 2007, and for the Office of Training and Development to implement an  automated development and career path system that will guide employees  in their career development by providing occupational \u201croad maps\u201d and  recommending training based on the occupations they intend to pursue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Richard M.
