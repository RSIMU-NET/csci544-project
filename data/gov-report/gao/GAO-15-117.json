The objective for this work was to determine the extent to which selected, previously identified vulnerabilities continued to exist on VA computer systems. To do this, GAO reviewed VA actions taken to address previously identified vulnerabilities, including a significant network intrusion, vulnerabilities in two key web-based applications, and security weaknesses on devices connected to VA's network.

However, VA could not produce a report of its forensic analysis of the incident or the digital evidence collected during this analysis to show that the response had been effective. VA's procedures do not require all evidence related to security incidents to be kept for at least 3 years, as called for by federal guidance. As a result, VA cannot demonstrate the effectiveness of its incident response and may be hindered in assisting in related law enforcement activities.", "VA has not addressed an underlying vulnerability that allowed the incident to occur. Specifically, the department has taken some steps to limit access to the affected system, but, at the time of GAO's review, VA had not fully implemented a solution for correcting the associated weakness. Without fully addressing the weakness or applying compensating controls, increased risk exists that such an incident could recur.", "Further, VA's policies did not provide the NSOC with sufficient authority to access activity logs on VA's networks, hindering its ability to determine if incidents have been adequately addressed. In an April 2014 report, GAO recommended that VA revise its incident response policies to ensure the incident response team had adequate authority, and VA concurred.", "Further, VA's actions to address vulnerabilities identified in two key web applications were insufficient. The NSOC identified vulnerabilities in these applications through testing conducted as part of the system authorization process, but VA did not develop plans of action and milestones for correcting the vulnerabilities, resulting in less assurance that these weaknesses would be corrected in a timely and effective manner.", "Finally, vulnerabilities identified in VA's workstations (e.g., laptop computers) had not been corrected. Specifically, 10 critical software patches had been available for periods ranging from 4 to 31 months without being applied to workstations, even though VA policy requires critical patches to be applied within 30 days. There were multiple occurrences of each missing patch, ranging from about 9,200 to 286,700, and each patch was to address an average of 30 security vulnerabilities. VA decided not to apply 3 of the 10 patches until it could test their impact on its applications; however, it did not document compensating controls or plans to migrate to systems that support up-to-date security features. While the department has established an organization to improve its vulnerability remediation, it has yet to identify specific actions and milestones for carrying out related responsibilities.

Each of the medical centers, which are  located around the country, uses local computer systems to run these  standard applications.

These threats can be unintentional or intentional.  Unintentional threats can be caused by software upgrades or defective  equipment that inadvertently disrupt systems, as well as user error.  Intentional threats can come from sources both internal and external to  the organization. Internal threats include fraudulent or malevolent acts by  employees or contractors. External threats include the ever-growing  number of cyber-based attacks that can come from hackers, criminals,  foreign nations, and other sources. These threat sources can exploit  vulnerabilities such as those resulting from flaws in software code that  could cause a program to malfunction.", "Reports of incidents affecting VA\u2019s systems and information highlight the  serious impact that inadequate information security can have on, among  other things, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of veterans\u2019  personal information.

For this particular  incident at VA, staff could not locate the associated forensic analysis  report or other key materials. Officials explained that digital evidence was  only maintained for 30 days due to storage space constraints.

However, this decision was not timely. The decision  memorandum was dated April 2014, even though the patches covered by  the decision had been available from 3 to 10 months, exceeding the 30- day period for critical patches.

For the other patches, VA  did not provide any documentation of decisions not to apply them. At the  end of our audit, VA officials told us they had implemented compensating  controls, but did not provide sufficient detail for us to evaluate their  effectiveness.

The OIG found that VA had unsecure web  application servers, excessive permissions on database platforms, a  significant number of outdated and vulnerable third-party applications and  operating system software, and a lack of common platform security  standards across the department. To address these issues, the OIG  recommended that VA implement a patch and vulnerability management  program. In its response to the report, VA stated that in February 2013 it  had implemented vulnerability scanning and continued to build on and  improve its patch and vulnerability program and that the OIG\u2019s  recommendation should therefore be closed.

Specifically, we reviewed the details of a  critical incident that NSOC had detected in which VA\u2019s network had been  compromised and the department\u2019s efforts to respond to it. We selected  this incident because it was highlighted in a June 2013 testimony by VA\u2019s  former Chief Information Security Officer. We reviewed a detailed  investigation report prepared by NSOC and interviewed center officials  regarding actions taken to detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, and  recover from this incident. We also reviewed an internal memorandum  related to an underlying vulnerability that contributed to this incident. We  compared VA\u2019s efforts to address this incident to National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance on security controls and  incident handling. We also reviewed VA\u2019s standard operating procedure  for forensics analysis and compared it to guidance issued by the National  Archives and Records Administration. We also reviewed a prior GAO  report on agencies\u2019 (including VA\u2019s) incident response practices. Further,  we interviewed NSOC officials to determine what initiatives the  department has planned or under way to further improve incident  response capabilities.", "We also reviewed vulnerabilities NSOC had identified in two key VA web  applications. We selected these applications based on their processing of  veterans\u2019 sensitive personally identifiable information. For these web  applications, we reviewed the results of NSOC testing, particularly  findings that the testers had categorized as critical or high risk, and  compared the dates the vulnerabilities were identified and the dates  corrective actions were validated. We also met with VA information  security officials and web application developers to determine (1) if plans  of actions and milestones had been developed for uncorrected  vulnerabilities and (2) the extent to which the department was using tools  to conduct software code reviews in order to identify root causes of  software vulnerabilities. We evaluated VA actions in accordance with  NIST guidance on security testing, developing plans of actions and  milestones, and vulnerability analysis and VA\u2019s policy on testing  applications prior to authorization.", "NIST, Special Publication 800-53, rev. 4.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2014 to November  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit  objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Jeffrey Knott, Lon Chin, Harold  Lewis, and Chris Warweg (assistant directors); Jennifer R.
