DOD established the PDHRA program to identify and address servicemembers' health concerns that emerge over time following deployments. This report is the second in response to a Senate Armed Services Committee report directing the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review DOD's administration of the PDHRA, and to additional congressional requests. In this report, GAO examined (1) the extent to which DOD's central repository contains PDHRA questionnaires for active and Reserve component servicemembers who returned from deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan and (2) how DOD monitors the administration of the PDHRA to Reserve component servicemembers. To conduct this review, GAO performed a quantitative analysis using DOD deployment and PDHRA data, reviewed relevant PDHRA policies, and interviewed DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD policy requires that the military services electronically submit PDHRA questionnaires to DOD's central repository. Based on two separate queries to this repository in 2009, GAO did not find PDHRA questionnaires for a substantial percentage of the 319,000 active and Reserve component servicemembers who returned from deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan between January 1, 2007, and May 31, 2008. GAO's first query on April 15, 2009, showed that only 77 percent of this population of interest had questionnaires in the central repository, leaving approximately 74,000 servicemembers without questionnaires in the repository. On September 4, 2009, GAO queried DOD's central repository again to update its April 2009 data and found that DOD's central repository was still missing PDHRA questionnaires for about 72,000 servicemembers, or 23 percent of the servicemembers in GAO's original population of interest. When PDHRA questionnaires are not in DOD's central repository, DOD does not have reasonable assurance that servicemembers to whom the PDHRA requirement applies were given the opportunity to fill out the questionnaire and identify and address health concerns that could emerge over time following deployment. DOD uses four methods to monitor the contractor, Logistics Health, Inc. (LHI), that administers the PDHRA to Reserve component servicemembers. The four monitoring methods are: (1) reviews of periodic reports from LHI; (2) inspections of LHI's administration of the PDHRA; (3) feedback on LHI's administration of the PDHRA from military service officials; and (4) weekly telephone discussions with LHI staff. These methods are used to help ensure that the objective of the PDHRA program is being met for Reserve component servicemembers. Through these methods, DOD identified a number of potential problems that may pose risks to the PDHRA program objective and to the welfare and safety of Reserve component servicemembers. However, GAO found that when monitoring the administration of the PDHRA to Reserve component servicemembers, DOD does not maintain clear documentation that is consistent with federal internal control standards. GAO found that the documentation generated by DOD generally did not clearly describe the potential problems, the actions taken to address the problems, and whether these actions had resolved the problems. Overall, this lack of clear documentation does not allow DOD to have reasonable assurance that potential problems related to the administration of the PDHRA to Reserve component servicemembers have been addressed and resolved."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since September 2001, the Department of Defense (DOD) has relied on  almost 2 million servicemembers to support ongoing contingency  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Servicemembers deployed to Iraq and  Afghanistan have engaged in intense and prolonged combat, placing them  at risk for developing various physical and mental health conditions, such  as post-traumatic stress disorder. In many cases, mental health conditions  do not emerge until months after servicemembers return from  deployment. As a result, in 2005, DOD implemented the post-deployment  health reassessment (PDHRA), which is required to be administered 90 to  180 days after servicemembers return from deployment.", "The PDHRA is one of three deployment health assessments that DOD uses  to assess the physical and mental health condition of servicemembers  before and after their overseas deployments to such locations as Iraq and  Afghanistan. DOD established the PDHRA to identify servicemembers\u2019  health concerns, including mental health concerns, that may surface  several months following their return from deployment and to assess  whether servicemembers need referrals for a further evaluation to address  these health concerns. The PDHRA questionnaire consists of a  demographic section to be filled out by the servicemember, a medical  section for self-reported medical information from the servicemember,  and a third section for a health care provider to fill out and sign.", "A recent study found that latent mental health concerns may  disproportionately affect Army Reserve and Army National Guard soldiers  over their active component counterparts. This 2007 study on  servicemembers deployed to Iraq found that when the PDHRA was  administered 90 to 180 days following deployment, Army Reserve and  Army National Guard servicemembers reported higher rates of mental  health concerns and were referred at substantially higher rates than their  active component counterparts. Researchers noted that Army Reserve  and Army National Guard servicemembers, unlike their active component  peers, typically transition back to civilian life after their deployments.  They may be particularly at risk for developing mental health conditions,  due to their lack of interaction with fellow servicemembers following their  return from deployment and the added stress of transitioning back to  civilian life.", "DOD\u2019s military services administer the PDHRA to active component  servicemembers, and DOD contracts with Logistics Health, Inc. (LHI) to  administer the PDHRA to servicemembers in the Reserve component.  While filling out the entire PDHRA questionnaire is encouraged, part of it  is voluntary. The military services require active and Reserve component  servicemembers to fill out only the demographic section of the  questionnaire; servicemembers are not required to answer questions  concerning their physical and mental health. The PDHRA questionnaire is  filled out electronically and DOD requires that the military services  electronically submit the questionnaires for both active and Reserve  component servicemembers to DOD\u2019s central repository. For Reserve  component servicemembers who fill out the PDHRA questionnaire  through LHI, LHI staff are responsible for verifying that the questionnaires  are transferred to the appropriate military service so that the military  service can submit them to DOD\u2019s central repository. The central  repository contains information from various health assessments and is  used for many purposes, including health surveillance.", "We previously identified problems with DOD\u2019s oversight of the PDHRA. In  2008, we reported that DOD\u2019s deployment health quality assurance  program, which DOD established to assess compliance with DOD\u2019s various  deployment health assessments, lacked data that would allow the  program\u2014and therefore DOD\u2014to accurately assess whether the military  services ensure that servicemembers fill out the PDHRA questionnaire.  DOD\u2019s quality assurance program uses data from DOD\u2019s central repository  to monitor the extent to which active and Reserve component  servicemembers fill out the PDHRA questionnaire and other DOD  deployment health assessments, as required. However, DOD\u2019s quality  assurance program does not monitor LHI\u2019s administration of the PDHRA  to Reserve component servicemembers, and we did not include this in our  2008 report. The program also does not monitor whether separated  servicemembers fill out the PDHRA questionnaire.", "In its report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2008, the Senate Committee on Armed Services directed us to  review DOD\u2019s implementation of the PDHRA to active component,  Reserve component, and separated servicemembers. The House  Committee on Armed Services and eight senators also expressed interest  in this work. In this report, we examine: (1) the extent to which DOD\u2019s  central repository contains PDHRA questionnaires for active and Reserve  component servicemembers who returned from deployment to Iraq or  Afghanistan and (2) how DOD monitors the administration of the PDHRA  to Reserve component servicemembers.", "To determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s central repository contains  PDHRA questionnaires for active and Reserve component servicemembers  who returned from deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan, we conducted a  quantitative analysis using DOD deployment and PDHRA data and  reviewed our prior work on DOD\u2019s deployment health quality assurance  program. We conducted our quantitative analysis using DOD data from  two sources\u2014the Defense Manpower Data Center\u2019s (DMDC) Contingency  Tracking System (CTS) and the Armed Forces Health Surveillance  Center\u2019s (AFHSC) Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS). DMDC\u2019s  CTS contains data on servicemembers deployed in support of the Overseas  Contingency Operations including servicemembers\u2019 deployment dates and  location of deployment. AFHSC\u2019s DMSS is DOD\u2019s central repository for  various health assessments and other health surveillance data, including  PDHRA questionnaires. We used CTS data to identify a population of  interest: active component, Reserve, and National Guard servicemembers  who had returned from deployments of greater than 30 days to Iraq or  Afghanistan from January 1, 2007, through May 31, 2008. (See fig. 1.)", "We determined the extent to which servicemembers in our population of  interest had PDHRA questionnaires in DOD\u2019s central repository, AFHSC\u2019s  DMSS, by asking AFHSC officials to query DMSS on two occasions\u2014April  2009 and September 2009. We made our second query to account for any  PDHRA questionnaires incorporated into DMSS after our initial analysis.  On both occasions, AFHSC officials matched PDHRA questionnaires to  CTS data using servicemembers\u2019 personal identifying information and the  beginning and end deployment dates of a servicemember\u2019s most recent  return from deployment during our time period.", "If a PDHRA questionnaire could not be identified in AFHSC\u2019s DMSS for a  servicemember in our population of interest during our April 2009 query,  we asked officials from the military services to query their own databases  to identify PDHRA questionnaires for these servicemembers, as the  military services collect PDHRA questionnaires in their own databases  before transmitting them to DOD\u2019s central repository. Specifically, for this  group of servicemembers, we asked military service officials to send us  information from any questionnaires that they considered ready for  transmission to DMSS that were filled out after the servicemember\u2019s end  deployment date in CTS. We received these data from the military  in late May and June 2009. Next, using servicemembers\u2019 personal  identifying information and end deployment dates, we matched the  information from the PDHRA questionnaires the military services  identified in their databases to our population of interest from CTS.  Finally, we reviewed DOD policies, as well as those of the Army, Air  Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, for submitting PDHRA questionnaires to  DOD\u2019s central repository and interviewed DOD and military service  officials knowledgeable about this process.", "We conducted data reliability assessments for each DOD and milita service data source we used by reviewing related documentation,  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and performing electronic  data testing for missing data, outliers, and obvious errors. We determine that these data sources were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  determined only the extent to which PDHRA questionnaires could be  identified in AFHSC\u2019s DMSS or the military services\u2019 databases for our  population of interest, and not the extent to which the servicemembers  may have actually filled out a PDHRA questionnaire.", "To determine how DOD monitors the administration of the PDHRA to  Reserve component servicemembers, we reviewed DOD\u2019s policies for  monitoring its contract with LHI and interviewed DOD and military se officials responsible for the administration of the PDHRA to Reserve  component servicemembers. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s contract with LHI  and obtained and analyzed required reports and other documentation on LHI\u2019s performance related to the PDHRA portion of DOD\u2019s contract with LHI. We visited LHI\u2019s headquarters in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where w interviewed LHI staff to confirm our understanding of how LHI staff  administers the PDHRA to Reserve component servicemembers. Wereviewed DOD\u2019s monitoring of the administration of the PDHRA to  Reserve component servicemembers to determine the extent to whic these monitoring efforts were consistent with GAO\u2019s Standards for  h  Internal Control in the Federal Government. Internal controls include  components of an organization\u2019s management that provide reasonable  assurance that program objectives are being achieved.", "To obtain more in-depth information on how DOD documents the  information it obtains through its monitoring efforts, we examined  documentation maintained by DOD\u2019s Reserve Health Readiness Program  (RHRP) office, which is responsible for monitoring DOD\u2019s contract with  LHI. Specifically, from among the potential problems that the RHRP office  had identified as possibly posing a risk to the objective of the PDHRA  program, we judgmentally selected 15 to review in detail and obtained all  readily available RHRP documentation on those problems. We selected  these 15 potential problems because the subject of each of these may have  involved welfare and safety concerns for Reserve component  servicemembers. Our findings related to the documentation of the 15  potential problems are for illustrative purposes only and are not  generalizable to other RHRP office documentation.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2008 to October 2009  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

However, there is no mechanism in place to offer  separated servicemembers the opportunity to fill out the PDHRA  questionnaire. Once these servicemembers have separated from military  service, they have no further obligation to the military services and  accordingly, cannot be required to fill out the PDHRA questionnaire. It can  also be difficult to locate and contact servicemembers after they separate.  Instead, the military services, with the exception of the Air Force,  implemented policies to administer the PDHRA to active and Reserve  component servicemembers as part of the separation process from the  military. Although the Army formally implemented its policy to  administer the PDHRA to servicemembers before they separate in April  2008, the practice had been in effect as early as January 2006.

The demographic section asks for servicemembers to provide information  such as date of birth, gender, and marital status. The medical section of  the questionnaire asks servicemembers to self-report information on their  current physical and mental health condition and concerns.

According to these standards, internal control  activities such as monitoring should be clearly documented in a manner  that is accurate, timely, and helps provide reasonable assurance that  program objectives are being achieved. Further, such documentation  should be properly managed and maintained so that it is readily accessible  and should allow someone other than the assigned officials to understand  the identified potential problem, the actions taken to address the problem,  and whether these actions have resolved the problem.", "Instead of adopting an approach that generated documentation consistent  with management practices outlined in federal internal control standards,  the RHRP office created an unsystematic, improvised approach for  documenting potential problems that were identified through review of  periodic reports, inspections, and feedback from military service officials  and LHI staff. These problems may pose a risk to the PDHRA program  objective. The RHRP office\u2019s approach solely relies on agendas and e-mail  correspondence to document these potential problems and the actions  taken to resolve them.", "Weekly agendas with related notes. Prior to the weekly discussions with  LHI staff, a typed agenda is prepared for discussion that lists the potential  problems identified through monitoring activities. During these  discussions, annotated brief handwritten notes are made on an agenda  item and these notes are used to indicate that certain actions need to be  taken by DOD officials or LHI staff to address an identified problem. When  it appears that problems have been resolved, instead of documenting how  the problem was resolved, the problem is not included on the agenda for  the next week\u2019s discussion. A hard copy of the agenda is retained and  filed in the RHRP office after each weekly discussion with LHI staff.", "E-mail correspondence. The RHRP office receives and generates e-mail  correspondence with LHI staff and military service officials that discusses  potential problems identified through monitoring the administration of the  PDHRA to Reserve component servicemembers.", "We found that the RHRP office\u2019s sole reliance on these agendas and e-mail  correspondence did not always result in clear documentation\u2014that is,  documentation that is understandable and readily accessible to others  outside the RHRP office. In particular, the agendas and e-mail  correspondence we reviewed did not always clearly describe the decisions  made and the actions taken to address identified problems in a manner  that provides reasonable assurance that the problems have been  resolved. An RHRP official acknowledged that he could not consistently  rely on the agendas and e-mail correspondence to reconstruct information  obtained through the office\u2019s internal control responsibility to monitor and  address problems associated with the administration of the PDHRA to  Reserve component servicemembers. Instead, this official relies on  memory to recall such information.", "In our review of the documentation related to 15 potential problems we  selected, we found that the RHRP office\u2019s documentation generally did not  clearly describe the problem, the actions taken to address the problem,  and whether these actions have resolved the problem. For example, on  two September 2008 agendas for the weekly discussions with LHI staff, the  agendas include a potential problem identified by DOD officials that 25 to  30 percent of servicemembers were not responding to questions on the  PDHRA questionnaire about the number of alcoholic drinks they  consumed on a typical day, and 18 percent were not responding to the  questions about whether they were depressed. The RHRP office asked LHI  staff if they were finding similar nonresponses to these questions from  Reserve component servicemembers. However, the subsequent agendas\u2014 which the RHRP office relies on to track problems\u2014do not contain any  additional information about how this potential problem was resolved.  There is no further information, including any related e-mail  correspondence, on how this potential problem was addressed. This  example raises questions about whether Reserve component  servicemembers\u2019 mental health concerns\u2014specifically those related to  alcohol use and depression\u2014are being consistently identified or whether  any follow-up actions are needed to address this problem.", "We also reviewed e-mail correspondence related to the 15 selected  potential problems, dated between March 4, 2008, and May 19, 2009, and  found that it often contained vague information about the identified  problems and the actions taken to resolve them. Some of these problems  relate to the welfare and safety of servicemembers and require more  information than is present in the available documentation to understand  whether or how the problems were resolved. For example, we asked about  an instance in which a military service official reported that an LHI health  care provider failed to document on a Reserve component  servicemember\u2019s PDHRA questionnaire why the servicemember with  reported suicidal ideations did not get an immediate referral. The e-mail  correspondence about this potential problem had gaps. For instance, while  the e-mail correspondence indicates that the RHRP office asked LHI staff  to look into the incident and contains a reply from LHI staff stating that  they would investigate further, the e-mail correspondence does not  document the final results of the LHI staff\u2019s investigation, including  whether or how this potential problem was resolved. Although this  potential problem is listed on several agendas, the agendas do not provide  any more information about the problem or how it was resolved. Instead,  an RHRP official told us that he relied on his memory to explain to us what  happened and how it was resolved. This official told us he requested that  LHI staff remind its health care providers to fully document the results of  their physical and mental health assessments on Reserve component  servicemembers\u2019 PDHRA questionnaires in the future. However, there is  no documentation of this request to LHI staff or any documentation of  plans to follow up to ensure that LHI staff carried out the request. (For  more information on the documentation related to the 15 potential  problems, see app. IV.)", "In addition to being generally incomplete and unclear, the e-mail  correspondence related to the potential problems is not readily accessible.  E-mail correspondence about identified problems is placed into labeled  folders within the office\u2019s e-mail system, but the labels are general and e- mail correspondence could appropriately be placed in a number of folders.  An official told us that, as a result, he struggles in remembering into which  folder a specific e-mail was placed. For example, e-mail correspondence  about an identified problem about an Army Reserve servicemember\u2019s  PDHRA questionnaire may be placed in either an Army PDHRA folder, a  PDHRA complaints folder, or a standard operating procedures folder. Not  having documentation that is readily accessible hinders the RHRP office\u2019s  ability to promptly ensure that identified problems have been properly  addressed. In addition, should LHI\u2019s performance diminish\u2014for example,  if LHI was not resolving identified problems\u2014the lack of readily available  documentation could compromise DOD\u2019s ability to take appropriate  action."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD established the PDHRA program in order to identify and address  servicemembers\u2019 health concerns\u2014including mental health concerns\u2014 that emerge over time following deployments. The PDHRA questionnaire  is a key tool in DOD\u2019s efforts to assess the physical and mental health  condition of servicemembers who have returned from deployments to Iraq  and Afghanistan, where exposure to intense combat can place  servicemembers at risk for developing conditions, such as post-traumatic  stress disorder. DOD\u2019s deployment health quality assurance program  assesses the military services\u2019 compliance with the requirement to  administer the PDHRA to active and Reserve component servicemembers  to help ensure that servicemembers have the opportunity to have their  health concerns identified and addressed through the PDHRA.", "However, our current findings show that the concerns we previously  raised about DOD\u2019s quality assurance program remain. Specifically, the  absence of PDHRA questionnaires in DOD\u2019s central repository for  thousands of eligible active and Reserve component servicemembers  continues to hinder the program\u2019s ability to assess the extent to which  these servicemembers fill out the PDHRA questionnaire and have the  opportunity to identify any health concerns that emerge over time  following deployments. DOD officials have identified the presence of  questionnaires in the central repository as important for the efforts of  DOD\u2019s quality assurance program. Without this information, the program  may not be able to accurately determine completion rates among the  military services and thus provide reasonable assurance to DOD or to  Congress that one of DOD\u2019s key health assessments is being administered  as required.", "Ensuring that Reserve component servicemembers fill out the PDHRA  questionnaire may be particularly important, as some evidence suggests  that these servicemembers may be more likely to develop mental health  conditions after returning from deployment when compared with their  active component counterparts. Although DOD monitors the  administration of the PDHRA to Reserve component servicemembers,  documentation associated with this monitoring needs to be strengthened.  The RHRP office has not always clearly documented\u2014in a way that is  consistent with federal internal control standards\u2014information related to  problems that may pose risks to the objective of the PDHRA program.  Some of these potential problems also involve Reserve component  servicemembers\u2019 welfare and safety.

DMDC\u2019s CTS contains data  on servicemembers deployed in support of the Overseas Contingency  Operations\u2014including data on servicemembers\u2019 deployment dates and  location of deployment. We used CTS data to identify a selected  population of interest: active component, Reserve, and National Guard  servicemembers who had returned from deployments of greater than 30  days to Iraq or Afghanistan between January 1, 2007, and May 31, 2008.", "DMDC officials identified this population for us using servicemembers\u2019  deployment dates and locations. If a servicemember had multiple  deployments during this period, we received data on a servicemember\u2019s  most recent return from deployment during this time period. Although  DOD initiated the PDHRA program in March 2005, the military services  implemented the program at different times, with full implementation  across all services in late 2006. In addition, servicemembers are not  eligible to fill out a PDHRA questionnaire until 90 to 180 days after they  have returned from deployment. Thus, when we requested data from  DMDC in late fall 2008, we needed to focus on a population of  servicemembers who had returned from deployment at least 180 days  prior to our data request. Therefore, we focused our analysis on  servicemembers who returned from deployment on or after January 1,  2007, and on or before May 31, 2008. As a secondary check that this  population of interest had, in fact, deployed, we sent our population of  interest to AFHSC officials, who compared our population to two other  deployment rosters. The results of this match identified our final  population of interest of approximately 319,000 servicemembers.", "AFHSC\u2019s DMSS is DOD\u2019s central repository for PDHRA questionnaires and  the military services are required to submit questionnaires to this central  repository. To determine the extent to which servicemembers in our  population of interest had PDHRA questionnaires in DOD\u2019s central  repository, we sent personal identifying information and beginning and  end deployment dates from CTS for the servicemembers in our population  of interest to AFHSC. AFHSC officials matched our population of interest  to the PDHRA questionnaires in DMSS using a servicemember\u2019s personal  identifying information and the beginning and end deployment dates as  recorded in CTS and as reported by the servicemember on the PDHRA  questionnaire. AFHSC officials then sent us data from identified  questionnaires that had been incorporated into DMSS as of April 15, 2009.", "As the military services collect PDHRA questionnaires in their own  databases before transmitting them to AFHSC\u2019s DMSS, we then asked  officials from the military services to query their own databases to identify  PDHRA questionnaires for servicemembers in our population of interest  for which a PDHRA questionnaire could not be identified in DMSS. We  provided the military services with a servicemember\u2019s personal identifying  information and deployment end date from CTS and asked them to query  their databases for any questionnaires that they would consider to be  ready to transmit to AFHSC that were filled out after the deployment end  date listed in CTS. The military services then queried their own databases  and, for each servicemember that we sent to them for which they could  identify a PDHRA questionnaire, returned to us the end deployment date  listed on the PDHRA questionnaire and date of questionnaire completion.  If a servicemember filled out multiple PDHRA questionnaires after the  deployment end date listed in CTS, we received information from each of  these questionnaires. We received these data from the military services in  late May and June 2009. We then matched our population of interest to the  information from the PDHRA questionnaires received from the military  services\u2019 databases using a servicemember\u2019s personal identifying  information and the end deployment date as recorded in CTS and as  reported by the servicemember on the PDHRA questionnaire.", "Finally, in September 2009, we obtained additional data from AFHSC to  update our April 2009 data. AFHSC officials matched information from the  servicemembers in our population of interest without a questionnaire in  DMSS as of April 15, 2009, to the PDHRA questionnaires in DMSS as of  September 4, 2009, using a servicemember\u2019s personal identifying  information and the beginning and end deployment dates as recorded in  CTS and as reported by the servicemember on the PDHRA questionnaire.  AFHSC officials then sent us data from identified questionnaires that had  been incorporated into DMSS as of September 4, 2009.", "We conducted data reliability assessments for each DOD and military  service data source we used by reviewing related documentation,  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and performing electronic  data testing for missing data, outliers, and obvious errors.

We reviewed DOD\u2019s  contract with LHI and obtained and analyzed contractually required  reports and other documentation on LHI\u2019s performance related to the  PDHRA portion of DOD\u2019s contract with LHI. We visited LHI\u2019s  headquarters in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where we interviewed LHI staff to  confirm our understanding of how LHI staff administers the PDHRA to  Reserve component servicemembers. We additionally interviewed officials  with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, which provides  support to DOD for the contract with LHI. We reviewed DOD\u2019s monitoring  of the administration of the PDHRA to Reserve component  servicemembers to determine the extent to which these monitoring efforts  met or were consistent with GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government.

We selected the PDHRA monthly activity and the call center  access reports to review because the RHRP office told us that these  reports provide information that is needed to monitor LHI\u2019s activities in  administering the PDHRA to Reserve component servicemembers. The  PDHRA monthly activity report provides aggregate information on LHI\u2019s  PDHRA administration, such as the number of Reserve component  servicemembers administered the PDHRA, referred for a further  evaluation, and contacted by LHI 30 days after receiving referrals. The call  center access report provides information on LHI\u2019s performance in  operating its call center. In addition, we selected the data entry and  PDHRA customer satisfaction survey reports to review because both  reports provide information on performance standards associated with the  PDHRA that LHI must meet to comply with the contract. The data entry  report provides information on LHI\u2019s performance in entering PDHRA data  into military services\u2019 databases, and the PDHRA customer satisfaction  survey report provides information on whether LHI meets a performance  standard associated with servicemember feedback on LHI\u2019s administration  of the PDHRA.
