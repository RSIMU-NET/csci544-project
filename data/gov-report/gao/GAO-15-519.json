Because it processes cases in calendar-year groups, State delays providing a report to the committees until it has resolved all concerns and determined whether to impose sanctions for each transfer in the group. It begins preparing a new report every December, regardless of whether it has completed all previous reports, with the result that State officials sometimes work on several reports simultaneously and may delay work on one report to work on another. State required nearly 3 years to prepare its December 2014 report on transfers that first came to its attention in 2011. Officials told GAO that negotiations and relations with countries can delay the process and assessing transfers in annual groups reduces prospects for confusion among the parties involved in the process (see figure).", "By not complying with INKSA's 6-month reporting cycle, State may have limited its ability to minimize delays in choosing to impose INKSNA sanctions. INKSNA requires State to identify foreign persons in a report before opting to impose sanctions on them. As a result, State did not impose INKSNA sanctions on 23 persons for 2011 transfers until December 2014, when it provided its report addressing 2011 transfers.

Because State does not have a  process enabling it to provide INKSNA reports every 6 months as  required, it cannot impose INKSNA sanctions on foreign persons within  the time frames established by INKSNA. Those time frames would allow  State to impose sanctions on a foreign person between 6 and 12 months  after it first obtained credible information of the person\u2019s involvement in a  reportable transfer. For example, in any given year in which State  decided to sanction a person for a reported transfer or acquisition, the  sanction would be effective no later than December if State had learned  about the transfer between January 1 and June 30 of that year, if it had  identified that person in a report provided to the committees in September  as required by INKSNA.", "However, State\u2019s delay in providing its reports to congressional  committees between 2006 and 2014 may undermine its ability to impose  potential INKSNA sanctions in accordance within the time frames defined  in INKSNA.

They stated that at various times in the reporting  cycle, State may use the information it is compiling to meet the INKSNA  reporting requirement to notify foreign governments about suspected  transfers taking place within their jurisdictions and request that they take  appropriate action. This use is in accordance with provisions in INKSNA  that (1) encourage State to contact foreign governments with jurisdiction  over the person, in order to afford the government the opportunity to  provide explanatory, exculpatory, or additional information with respect to  the transfer, and (2) exempt foreign persons from INKSNA sanctions if  the foreign government has imposed meaningful penalties on that person.

ISN/MBC receives a corrected package from the Intelligence  Community, sends it out to the federal departments involved in the  interagency process ( the Departments of Defense, Energy, and  Commerce), and the National Security Council (NSC) calls for a sub- Interagency Policy Committee (IPC) meeting to be scheduled to  discuss the transfers.  5.  Sub-IPC discusses each transaction. Attendees provide advice on  whether each transfer is reportable under INKSNA and whether it  should result in sanctions.  6.  ISN/MBC sends the package of transfers, along with the results of the  sub-IPC meeting, to other relevant State regional and functional  bureaus to obtain their views and approval.  7.  ISN/MBC compiles a draft action memo that contains the  recommended outcome for each transfer. The memo also contains  the views of the attendees from the sub-IPC meeting. ISN and other  relevant management levels clear the memo.  8.  ISN sends the action memo to the Office of the Deputy Secretary (D)  to review the transfers and the recommended actions and conduct  iterative rounds of questions and consultations on certain transfers  with other State offices before the memo is ready for the Deputy  Secretary of State.  9.  The Deputy Secretary of State approves the action memo once he or  she makes a decision on every transfer for the given calendar year,  and D sends it back to ISN/MBC.  10. ISN/MBC prepares (1) the final INKSNA report for the committees,  and (2) the draft Federal Register notice. It then sends them to the  State Bureau of Legislative Affairs (H).  11. H adds a cover letter and provides the report to the clerks/security  officers of recipient committees: the House Committee on Foreign  Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.  12. Within days, the Federal Register publishes the notice announcing the  names of the foreign persons who have been sanctioned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comment", "paragraphs": ["Comment 1:  The scope of INKSNA, as currently written, has not  changed since 2006, which was the start time for GAO\u2019s analysis. The  report shows that the time State requires to produce the reports for  Congress has increased since 2006, despite no additional changes to the  scope of the law. While INSKNA\u2019s six month reporting deadlines may be  tight, the report demonstrates that the State Department should consider  more efficient processes for meeting those deadlines. For example,  State\u2019s practice of reporting transfers in entire groups could allow a single  problematic transfer to delay the reporting of other transfers that State  may have already investigated and vetted.", "Comment 2: We recognize State\u2019s need to carefully prepare and  thoroughly vet each INKSNA report.  We also recognize that some  transfers that are reportable under INKSNA may require several years to  investigate and vet prior to being included in an INKSNA report. However,  our review found that State\u2019s process could allow a single such  problematic transfer to delay State\u2019s reporting to Congress of other  transfers that State may have already investigated and vetted.", "Comment 3: The report highlights the fact that State has opted to submit  annual reports instead of the six-month reports required by law.   However, it does not assume that State\u2019s decision to do so is the key  driver of the current backlog. The report instead calls attention to State\u2019s  current process that could allow a single problematic case in a group to  delay its reporting on other transfers within that group.  We also note the  report demonstrates that the backlog is growing and is not, as State  suggests, being eliminated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact:", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments:", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Pierre Toureille (Assistant  Director), B.
