Human activities\u2014including the burning of fossil fuels,  cement production, deforestation, and agriculture\u2014release carbon  dioxide into the atmosphere. Since the 1700s, atmospheric carbon  dioxide concentrations have risen from approximately 280 parts per  million to approximately 400 parts per million (see fig. 1). As the carbon  dioxide concentration in the atmosphere increases, more carbon dioxide  is absorbed by the oceans, where it reacts with water to form carbonic  acid, most of which separates to form a hydrogen ion and a bicarbonate  ion.the pH of the water.", "The resulting increase in hydrogen ion concentration is what lowers  Since the 1700s, the average surface ocean pH has decreased from  about 8.2 to 8.1, a change representing an approximately 26 percent  increase in ocean acidity. At the current rate of carbon dioxide  emissions, scientists project that, by 2100, the average pH of the ocean  surface will drop to between 7.9 and 7.7. Such a drop would correspond  to a rise in acidity of approximately 100 percent to 200 percent over  preindustrial levels. Moreover, the current rate of acidification is believed  to be faster than at any point in at least the last 20 million years.", "In addition to increasing acidity, the higher levels of carbon dioxide in the  oceans also cause chemical reactions that reduce what is known as the  \u201csaturation state\u201d of calcium carbonate minerals such as aragonite and  calcite. As the saturation state of these carbonate minerals decreases,  some marine organisms will need to use more energy to acquire the  carbonate ions needed to build shells or skeletons. In addition, when the  saturation state drops below 1 (i.e., undersaturated), then structures such  as animal shells that are made of carbonate minerals may begin to  dissolve. As the oceans absorb more carbon dioxide, scientific models  predict that the saturation state of many surface waters, including areas  supporting rich fisheries, will continue to decline (see fig. 2).", "The carbonate mineral saturation state is affected by several other factors  in addition to carbon dioxide. For example, the temperature, pressure,  and salinity of the ocean water at a particular location affects the  saturation state. As a result, the latitude of a particular ocean location, the  depth of the water there, and the extent to which it receives freshwater  input from rivers all play a role in determining the saturation state. In  general, saturation state is highest in warm, shallow, saline waters.  Therefore, the Arctic Ocean, which has colder water and receives large  amounts of fresh water from rivers and melting ice, and deepwater  environments generally have naturally lower saturation states.", "Biological processes also affect the pH and saturation state of the  oceans. During the day, marine plants, including phytoplankton and  seagrasses, use sunlight and carbon dioxide to create and store energy,  a process known as photosynthesis.dioxide levels, thus increasing the pH and carbonate mineral saturation  states of the upper reaches of the ocean. Conversely, as organic (i.e.,   This activity reduces carbon  carbon-based) matter decomposes, carbon dioxide is released back into  the water, thus decreasing pH. Some of the decomposing organic matter  sinks into deeper water, which, over time, has contributed to deeper  waters naturally being lower in pH and having lower saturation states with  respect to calcium carbonate minerals.", "The effect of biological processes on ocean chemistry also means that pH  and saturation states vary more widely in coastal and estuarine waters  than in the open ocean. Coastal and estuarine areas have high  concentrations of plant life and receive freshwater inputs from rivers,  factors that influence ocean chemistry. The resulting variation may occur  both daily, because of the effect of photosynthesis, and seasonally, due  to changes in the amount of available solar energy and of river flows.", "Although the primary cause of ocean acidification is the increase in global  atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions, other factors also contribute to  acidification, particularly in coastal and estuarine areas. In particular,  increased nutrient pollution (e.g., of nitrate, phosphate, and iron) from  agricultural fertilizers and from septic systems and sewage treatment  plants results in higher than normal levels of biological growth, a condition  known as \u201ceutrophication.\u201d In the short run, the faster growth of plants  such as phytoplankton may raise the pH of coastal and estuarine waters  by consuming carbon dioxide in the water and releasing oxygen. In the  long run, however, when plants die, the decomposition process releases  carbon dioxide and may lower the pH, sometimes substantially.addition, local sources of air pollution may also contribute to acidification  in coastal and estuarine areas. For example, in addition to releasing  carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the burning of fossil fuels releases  other gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides that can be   In  deposited on coastal and estuarine waters, or on streams and rivers  flowing into coastal waters, lowering the pH."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Scope and Severity of Ocean Acidification\u2019s Effects Are Potentially Significant but Not Fully Known", "paragraphs": ["Ocean acidification could have a variety of potentially significant effects  on marine species, ecosystems, and coastal communities, according to  the six summary reports we reviewed.

Ocean acidification could negatively affect the survival  and growth of some mollusks\u2014including bivalve species such as  oysters and mussels\u2014by making calcification more difficult, according  to the summary reports we reviewed. Among bivalve species that  have displayed a negative response to ocean acidification, larval and  juvenile bivalves may be more susceptible to harm than adult  bivalves. For example, according to a 2013 study of Pacific oyster  (Crassostrea gigas) larvae, during the period of initial shell formation  in the early days of an oyster\u2019s life, oyster larvae rely primarily on the  energy derived from their egg reserves to build their shells because  the oysters have not yet developed their primary feeding organ.  When exposed to an environment with a lower carbonate ion  concentration, however, the larvae have to expend more energy to  build their shells. This increased energy expenditure during the period  of initial shell formation makes it more difficult for the oysters to  develop their feeding organs and reduces the probability that the  oysters will survive.", "Figure 3 compares Pacific oyster larvae raised in acidified conditions  (characterized by reduced pH levels and carbonate mineral saturation  states) with those raised under more favorable ocean conditions. The  figure shows that the Pacific oyster larvae raised under acidified  conditions experienced impaired shell development, and their shells  had various deformities compared with the larvae raised under more  favorable conditions. Even in instances where oysters are able to  survive their larval stage under acidified conditions, the greater energy  required to produce their shells could contribute to decreased growth  in later life stages. For example, a 2012 study examined the effects of  ocean acidification on the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) and found  that larvae raised in water with a low pH (7.8) exhibited a slower shell  growth rate that continued even once the oysters became juveniles.", "Not all mollusk species have responded negatively to ocean  acidification conditions in research experiments, according to the  reports we reviewed. One of the reports noted that roughly half of the  mollusk species examined have displayed no effects from ocean  acidification, and that a few mollusk species have displayed positive  effects. For example, one study cited in the report found that  mortality rates declined for juveniles of one clam species (Ruditapes  decussatus) kept in seawater with artificially lowered pH levels compared with juveniles kept in seawater at higher pH levels.", "Corals. Corals were also identified in the summary reports we  reviewed as being among the calcifying species most at risk for harm  from ocean acidification. Ocean acidification may make it more  difficult for some corals to grow their skeletons due to the reduced  carbonate ion concentration and may affect coral reproduction. In  addition, ocean acidification could potentially increase the rate at  which coral skeletons dissolve and erode. However, not all coral  species are expected to be negatively affected by ocean acidification,  according to the reports we reviewed. and  Reduced pH: Variable Responses to Ocean Acidification at Local Scales?\u201d Journal of  Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, vol. 396 (2011). could cause behavioral changes in some fish species by interfering with  the functioning of sensory systems, such as the ability to smell. Such  changes in sensory systems could, in turn, produce behavioral changes  that alter predator-prey interactions, among other things. For example,  one study cited in two of the summary reports we reviewed found that  clownfish larvae raised in an elevated carbon dioxide environment  became attracted to the scent of predators rather than avoiding this odor,  whereas clownfish larvae raised under carbon dioxide conditions similar  to the current environment exhibited a strong avoidance to the odor of  predators. Similarly, another study found that juvenile damselfish and  cardinalfish living in ocean waters with naturally high carbon dioxide  levels\u2014caused by nearby volcanic vents that emit carbon dioxide and  lower the pH of surrounding waters\u2014were attracted to predators\u2019 odors  and exhibited bolder behavior than fish from ocean waters that were  unaffected by the volcanic vents.behavioral changes cause species to be at a higher risk from predators,  such changes could potentially lead to increased mortality rates for  affected species. However, according to the reports we reviewed, the  extent to which other fish species\u2014including commercially important fish  such as salmon\u2014are vulnerable to behavioral effects caused by changes  in the functioning of sensory systems due to ocean acidification is  unclear.", "To the extent these types of  Another way in which ocean acidification could affect marine species is by  enhancing photosynthetic processes in ocean waters with elevated  carbon dioxide concentrations. In particular, the possibility that some  marine plant species, such as certain seagrasses, could experience  increased photosynthesis and growth was highlighted by the summary  reports we reviewed as a primary example of the potential for ocean  acidification to benefit some species. However, this type of beneficial  effect appears to be variable among photosynthetic species, and the net  effect of ocean acidification on some marine photosynthetic species could  be negative. For example, the reports we reviewed noted that marine  macroalgae (seaweeds) are expected to display a diverse response to  ocean acidification, in part because macroalgae include a mix of  calcifying and noncalcifying species. Since ocean acidification may  reduce calcification abilities, the growth of calcifying macroalgae may be  compromised under future ocean acidification conditions even if these  species experience increased photosynthesis, whereas the growth of  noncalcifying macroalgae is more likely to be enhanced. For instance, in  a study cited in one of the reports we reviewed, researchers examined  the abundance of calcifying versus noncalcifying species of macroalgae  near volcanic vents in the ocean and found that the abundance of  noncalcifying macroalgae increased as the pH declined, whereas the  abundance of calcifying macroalgae decreased.", "The presence of other stressors in the marine environment\u2014such as  warming ocean temperatures, hypoxia, and pollution\u2014were highlighted in  the summary reports we reviewed as factors that make it difficult to  determine how ocean acidification will affect different species. Knowledge  about the simultaneous effects of ocean acidification and these other  stressors on species is incomplete, but these stressors could potentially  exacerbate the effects of ocean acidification. For example, a recent study  found that the combined effects of hypoxia and ocean acidification were  more severe on early life stage bivalves than would be expected for either  stressor on its own. reviewed stated that ocean acidification may compromise the resiliency of  corals to the other threats they face, such as increased ocean  temperatures, by, for example, causing some coral species to be more  susceptible to coral bleaching.", "Hypoxia is a condition where waters have low dissolved oxygen concentrations.

In this context, adaptation refers to the  ability of a species to evolve over successive generations to become  better suited to its habitat, which in the case of ocean acidification would  mean a reduced carbonate ion, lower pH ocean environment. If species  are successful in adapting genetically to these changing conditions, it  could be possible for them to avoid some of the negative effects that  might otherwise occur from ocean acidification. For example, one of the  summary reports we reviewed noted that it might be possible for some  coral species to evolve a mechanism that would enable them to calcify at  normal rates even in waters with lower carbonate ion concentrations,  although this type of adaptation has not been documented in corals.  Moreover, since the changes to ocean chemistry currently taking place  are occurring rapidly on evolutionary timescales, the reports we reviewed  stated that it is unknown whether species will be able to adapt to the  expected rate and magnitude of ocean acidification\u2019s changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ocean Acidification May Pose Risks to Food Webs or Otherwise Disrupt Marine Ecosystems", "paragraphs": ["The potential for ocean acidification to alter marine food webs was  identified in the reports we reviewed as one of the most significant  ecosystem-level effects that could result from ocean acidification.difficult to predict exactly how a change to a species in one part of a food  web will affect other species, but if ocean acidification were to negatively  affect species at lower levels in a food web, it is possible those negative  effects could lead to broader ecosystem effects involving species at  higher levels.

Shellfish harvest is the most  valuable sector of the commercial fishing industry in the United  States, accounting for 53 percent of U.S. commercial fishing landings  and valued at approximately $2.7 billion in 2012, according to  NOAA.  In addition, NOAA reported that the approximate value of  shellfish produced by aquaculture in the United States in 2011 was  $422.0 million. Potential declines in the health of shellfish  populations from ocean acidification could negatively affect both  shellfish harvest and aquaculture. Oyster aquaculture has already  experienced significant disruption in the Pacific Northwest. The  Washington State Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification reported  that, between 2005 and 2009, acidified conditions killed billions of  oyster larvae at two of the three primary hatcheries that provide  Pacific oysters to growers in the Northwest, disrupting the industry  throughout the region.

Nonetheless, both the hatchery and  agency officials we spoke with expressed concern that future ocean  conditions could exceed the hatcheries\u2019 ability to adapt. Similarly, crab  harvest constitutes an important component of the fishing industry in  Alaska, and recent research suggests that some juvenile crab species  are less able to survive in lower pH waters, which could lead to  declines in an industry that, in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands,  harvested crabs valued at approximately $245 million annually, on  average, from 2008 through 2012.", "Finfish harvest.
