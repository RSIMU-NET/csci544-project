The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) staff were to provide quality assurance that INS\u2019 judgments were unbiased by reviewing a sample of the cases reviewed by INS.

To achieve our objectives, we (1) discussed INS\u2019 review of aliens who may have been improperly naturalized during this period with INS, JMD, EOIR,and KPMG officials in Washington, D.C., and with INS and KPMG officials in INS\u2019 Lincoln Service Center in Nebraska and (2) reviewed INS and KPMG records and reports regarding the review, including KMPG\u2019s report to JMD. In March 1997, we visited the Lincoln Service Center to observe the review process. At the time of our visit, EOIR staff were not present. However, we subsequently discussed with all of the participating EOIR staff members the process that they followed in their review of the INS alien case files.", "To assess KPMG\u2019s approach, we determined if KPMG used accepted social science standards, which include (1) the use of unbiased selection procedures, reliability checks and assessments (e.g., training and rules for documenting the results), and procedures to ensure the quality of the data used; (2) full disclosure of study procedures and limitations; and (3) appropriate generalization on the basis of the data gathered and analyzed.", "We conducted our review from February 1997 to January 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

During this period, INS initiated a number of efforts, under a program called \u201cCitizenship USA,\u201d to accelerate and streamline its process for naturalizing citizens. In its December report, KPMG stated that while INS\u2019 efforts greatly increased the volume of applicants who were processed and approved, the potential for error also increased during this period. In an effort to determine if past naturalization efforts were adjudicated correctly, INS reviewed selected naturalization cases approved between August 31, 1995, and September 30, 1996. EOIR was to provide quality assurance assistance for INS\u2019 review. KPMG, under contract with JMD, monitored and validated INS\u2019 review.", "A primary naturalization criterion is that applicants must be able to establish good moral character to become naturalized citizens. Under certain circumstances, applicants who fail to reveal their criminal histories or who have been convicted of certain crimes, such as crimes involving moral turpitude (e.g., certain felonies and certain misdemeanors), cannot, by statute, establish good moral character. To judge if any citizenship applicants have failed to establish good moral character, INS, with assistance from the FBI, was to identify those applicants who have criminal histories.", "Previously, to identify these applicants, INS required that aliens submit fingerprint cards with their applications for naturalization. Each fingerprint card was to include a complete set of fingerprints and other identifying information, such as the alien\u2019s name and date of birth. INS was to send each fingerprint card to the FBI for it to determine if an alien had a criminal history record on file. Part of the naturalization process was to include an interview between an INS adjudicator and the applicant. The interview, which is done under oath, was to include a discussion about any criminal history of the applicant\u2014that is, arrests or convictions\u2014which should be available at the time of the interview."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Review Process INS Used to Judge If Aliens Were Adjudicated Correctly", "paragraphs": ["To judge if naturalization cases that were processed between August 31, 1995, and September 30, 1996, were adjudicated correctly and if the naturalization process had adequate controls, INS reviewed selected cases to judge, on the basis of the information in the files, if the naturalized citizens were of good moral character. INS, with the FBI\u2019s assistance, identified 80,856 criminal histories for applicants believed to be naturalized during this period with records that included felonies, misdemeanors, or INS administrative arrests or convictions. An aspect of this review was to identify aliens who may not have revealed their arrests or convictions.", "After reviewing criminal histories provided by the FBI, INS identified 17,257 applicants who were naturalized between August 31, 1995, and September 30, 1996, with criminal history records of arrests for felonies or other potentially disqualifying crimes. To conduct the review, INS requested the 17,257 case files from its field offices. Only 16,858 of the requested case files were reviewed because INS field units could not locate 399 case files. Accordingly, INS reviewed 16,858 criminal histories and corresponding case files in an attempt to judge if these aliens should have been naturalized.", "Under KPMG\u2019s monitoring, INS activities included (1) collecting the appropriate criminal history records from the FBI, (2) sorting and categorizing these records, (3) matching (and filing) these records with the appropriate INS case file for the naturalized alien, (4) assigning case files to review adjudicators, and (5) ensuring that the case files were consistently reviewed and contained a standardized worksheet summarizing the results of the adjudicator\u2019s review. Using a standardized worksheet, INS adjudicators reviewed the case files of these aliens and made independent judgments about the initial adjudication decisions. KPMG monitored the review adjudicators\u2019 work.", "In addition to the 399 alien case files that INS could not locate, another estimated 300 criminal history records were not available for review and therefore were not included with the 80,856 criminal histories. The 300 criminal history records apparently had been in transit between the FBI and INS and were received too late to be included in the INS review. KPMG reported that INS\u2019 preliminary assessment of the approximately 300 alien criminal history records was that most of these aliens had only old administrative arrests or were never naturalized.

The review results were based only on the data in the case files at the time of the adjudicators\u2019 reviews. In some cases, data may have been removed from or added to the INS case files after the initial decisions were made and before the files were reviewed. Also, although the adjudicators who made the initial decisions to approve the aliens\u2019 naturalization applications had the benefit of discussing the naturalization applications with the aliens, the review adjudicators did not meet with the applicants.", "As shown in table 1, in its review of these 16,858 case files, INS designated each case as either \u201cproper,\u201d \u201crequires further action,\u201d or \u201cpresumptively ineligible.\u201d According to INS officials, a case was designated as proper if the data in the case file supported the initial decision to naturalize the individual. A case was designated as requires further action if the data in the case file were insufficient to support a proper decision yet did not appear to indicate that the individual was barred from being naturalized. For example, some case files did not contain data about the dispositions of arrests that may have affected the individuals\u2019 eligibility for naturalization. Cases involving a failure to disclose an individual\u2019s criminal history were also classified as requires further action because the determination of whether the failure to reveal the criminal history affected the individual\u2019s eligibility for naturalization required a legal determination that went beyond the scope of the INS review. A case was designated as presumptively ineligible if the data in the case file or the criminal history appeared to indicate that the alien should have been barred from being naturalized.", "INS is reviewing, for potential revocation, the 369 cases of those aliens who were judged to be presumptively ineligible as well as the 5,954 cases requiring further action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EOIR Efforts to Provide Quality Assurance to the INS Review", "paragraphs": ["EOIR independently reviewed case files of previously naturalized aliens to provide quality assurance that INS\u2019 decisions during the review were unbiased.

EOIR\u2019s review was done separately from the INS adjudicators\u2019 review.", "In conducting the review, EOIR teams of two staff each reviewed the alien case files at the Lincoln Service Center. The initial EOIR team received an orientation regarding the mechanics of properly completing the standardized worksheet. The lead EOIR staff member returned to the service center to provide the orientation to each subsequent team.", "The EOIR reviewers and the INS review adjudicators had the same decisions in 439 of the 557 cases (or 79 percent).

Therefore, according to KPMG, it was highly improbable that the reviewers would reach full agreement on all of the cases. KPMG stated that the major contributing factor to differences in INS\u2019 and EOIR\u2019s judgments was the interpretation of case file documentation regarding the applicants\u2019 acknowledgment of prior criminal histories. KPMG added that, in many cases, EOIR and INS reviewers had to make subjective decisions as to whether sufficient case file documentation existed to justify their decisions. KPMG concluded that a 79-percent agreement rate between EOIR and INS reviewers was the most that could be reasonably expected when considering that the two groups worked independently, had varied backgrounds, and had to make many subjective analyses. KPMG provided no basis or analysis in its December report to support its conclusion that a 79-percent agreement rate was reasonable."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Our Analysis of the INS and EOIR Review Results", "paragraphs": ["We recognize the subjective nature of the reviews by the INS and EOIR reviewers (i.e., the reviewers had to interpret the data in the case files). We agree with the need to separate the two groups of reviewers to help enhance EOIR\u2019s quality assurance role. However, consistent with accepted social science standards regarding training, it would have been helpful in reviewing and interpreting the results of their reviews if the two groups had received similar training. For example, before reviewing the case files, the INS review adjudicators received training on the standardized worksheet that they were to complete and received a training manual to help them complete the standardized worksheet. On the standardized worksheet, adjudicators were required to summarize the data in the aliens\u2019 case files (e.g., arrest and conviction information) and evaluate the naturalization decision to be made regarding the alien\u2014that is, proper, presumptively ineligible, or further action is required. The initial EOIR team was provided with an orientation and the lead EOIR staff member was responsible for providing the orientation to the other teams. However, the EOIR staff did not receive the same training provided to the INS review adjudicators even though they had to review the same files and complete the same standardized worksheet. Thus, the lack of such training may have contributed to some of the disagreement on the case files.", "For the 21 percent of the cases where INS and EOIR reviewers disagreed, the results were divided regarding which reviewer was more likely to judge that a particular naturalization was proper. For example, in 68 cases that INS judged were proper, EOIR judged that further action was required; in 36 other cases, EOIR judged them to be proper, but INS judged that further action was required. Although in these examples more of the INS judgments were in agreement with the initial adjudication, we could not conclude that a statistically significant difference existed between the INS and EOIR decisions. The agencies\u2019 overall judgments produced generally similar conclusions about the percentage of the naturalization decisions that had been made properly. For example, INS and EOIR judged that 65 percent (360 divided by 557) and 58 percent (325 divided by 557) of the cases were proper, respectively, and both INS and EOIR judged that 2 percent (10 divided by 557 and 12 divided by 557, respectively) of the cases were presumptively ineligible.", "As previously discussed, INS is reviewing the 6,323 cases\u2014that is, the 5,954 cases that INS judged as requiring further action and the 369 cases that INS judged the aliens to be presumptively ineligible\u2014for potential revocation. However, INS initially did not plan any additional action regarding the 72 cases in which EOIR disagreed with INS\u2019 judgment that the initial INS adjudicators\u2019 decisions were proper, which left unresolved questions about the soundness of INS\u2019 decisions in these cases. According to the INS attorney involved with the review of the 6,323 cases for potential revocation, INS did not know about the 72 cases. After we questioned what was being done with these cases, the attorney said that the 72 cases would be included with the 6,323 cases being reviewed.
