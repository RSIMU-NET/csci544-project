For example, CMS officials  indicated that they began incorporating additional Medicare claims data  into IDR in September 2011 and as of November 2011, had trained over  200 analysts who were using One PI. CMS officials reported having  provided additional training in 2012. However, as of April 2012, CMS had  not fully addressed our recommendations\u2014for example, the agency had  not finalized plans for adding Medicaid data into IDR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Robust Process to Address Identified Vulnerabilities Could Help Reduce Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["Having mechanisms in place to resolve vulnerabilities that lead to  improper payments is critical to effective program management, but our  work has shown weaknesses in CMS\u2019s processes to address such   Our March 2010 report on the RAC demonstration  vulnerabilities.program found that CMS had not established an adequate process during  the demonstration or in planning for the national program to ensure  prompt resolution of identified vulnerabilities in Medicare. Further, most  vulnerabilities identified during the demonstration were not addressed.  We therefore recommended that CMS develop and implement a  corrective action process that includes policies and procedures to ensure  the agency promptly (1) evaluates findings of RAC audits, (2) decides on  the appropriate response and a time frame for taking action based on  established criteria, and (3) acts to correct the vulnerabilities identified.  In December 2011, the HHS-OIG found that CMS had not resolved or  taken significant action to resolve 48 of 62 vulnerabilities reported in 2009  by CMS contractors specifically charged with addressing fraud. The  HHS-OIG made several recommendations, including that CMS have  written procedures and time frames to assure that vulnerabilities were  resolved. CMS has indicated that it is now tracking vulnerabilities  identified from several types of contractors through a single vulnerability  tracking process, and the agency has developed some written guidance  on the process. We are currently examining aspects of CMS\u2019s  vulnerability tracking process and will be reporting on it soon."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["CMS and the states must continue and improve their efforts to reduce  improper payments. Identifying the nature, extent, and underlying causes  of improper payments, and developing adequate corrective action  processes to address vulnerabilities, is an essential prerequisite to  reducing them. Although Medicaid presents different challenges, we  believe that many of the lessons learned from our Medicare work could  be applied to strengthen Medicaid program integrity. These lessons can  be applied as CMS and the states begin to use the additional tools to  identify and recoup Medicaid improper payments provided through recent  legislation. As CMS and the states implement these PPACA and Small  Business Jobs Act provisions, additional evaluation and oversight will  help determine whether the provisions are implemented as intended and  have the desired effect on better ensuring proper payments. Moreover,  we are continuing to monitor CMS and state efforts as the implementation  process proceeds. Notably, we have work under way assessing CMS\u2019s  efforts to support and strengthen Medicaid program integrity through its  Medicaid Integrity Program. We are also examining the effectiveness of  different types of prepayment edits in Medicare, including CMS\u2019s  oversight of its contractors in implementing those edits, and CMS\u2019s  implementation of predictive analytics through FPS. The level of  importance placed on effectively implementing our recommendations and  the provisions of recent laws will be critical to reducing improper  payments in the Medicaid and Medicare programs, and ensuring that  federal funds are used efficiently and for their intended purposes.", "Chairman Platts, Ranking Member Towns, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes our prepared statement.
