The 21st Century Cures Act included provisions that NIH coordinate policies and programs to promote early research independence and enhance the diversity of the scientific workforce.", "The act also contained a provision that GAO examine NIH's efforts. GAO reviewed the actions NIH has taken to support (1) investigators beginning their biomedical careers; and (2) investigators from underrepresented groups and women. GAO analyzed NIH data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 on grant funding for investigators by career phase and demographic status.

While it employs investigators in its intramural research program, over 80 percent of its budget supports its extramural program, primarily through grant funding to investigators at other research institutions. Given this, NIH has a vested interest in supporting a robust national biomedical workforce, but the agency has acknowledged that the environment is highly competitive and many investigators find that it takes years to obtain the type and amount of funding that typically spurs research independence. GAO's analysis found that extramural investigators who had received at least one large NIH research grant during fiscal years 2013 through 2017 were more likely to receive such grants in subsequent application cycles than investigators who had not yet received such grants. In response to the 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, NIH introduced an initiative to prioritize these grants for (1) early stage investigators, who are beginning their careers and have never received a large research grant, and (2) intermediate stage investigators, who are within 10 years of receiving their first large grant as an early stage investigator. However, it is too early to assess this new initiative, which was introduced in August 2017. NIH is currently considering revising the program to include investigators whose careers are more advanced.", "NIH implemented recommendations made by internal advisory bodies to support investigators from racial and ethnic groups considered by NIH to be underrepresented in biomedical research. GAO's analysis shows disparities for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and for female investigators, from 2013 through 2017. For example, in 2017, about 17 percent of investigators from underrepresented racial groups\u2014African Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders combined\u2014who applied for large grants received them. In contrast, about 24 percent of Hispanic or Latino applicants, an underrepresented ethnic group, received such grants. Asians and whites\u2014well represented groups\u2014were successful in receiving large grants about 24 and 27 percent of the time, respectively. Though women represent about half of all doctorates in biological science, GAO found that women investigators employed by NIH in its intramural program comprised about one-quarter of tenured investigators. NIH has taken positive steps such as establishing the position of Chief Officer of Scientific Workforce Diversity, who in turn created a strategic workforce diversity plan, which applies to both extramural and intramural investigators. The plan includes five broad goals for expanding and supporting these investigators. However, NIH has not developed quantitative metrics, evaluation details, or specific time frames by which it could measure the agency's progress against these goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Director of NIH should develop quantitative metrics, evaluation details, and time frames to assess NIH's efforts to diversify its scientific workforce against its diversity strategic plan goals, and take action as needed.

Its mission is to advance scientific knowledge and  innovation that enhances health, lengthens life, and reduces illness and  disability. The agency plays a prominent role in researching life processes  and many diseases and conditions, including those that are among the  leading causes of death both in the United States and globally. In fiscal  year 2018, NIH invested over $37 billion in medical research. NIH relies,  in part, on biomedical scientists, known as \u201cinvestigators,\u201d who are  employed by the agency in its intramural research program. However,  most of the agency\u2019s budget\u2014over 80 percent\u2014is devoted to funding  research that supports investigators and research personnel working at  universities, medical schools, and other research institutions in its  extramural research program. Given NIH\u2019s prominent role in biomedical  research, its success depends on its ability to attract, retain, develop, and  otherwise support a robust national biomedical workforce, at the agency  as well as in the overall biomedical field. Through its research grants NIH  provides a significant source of financial support for investigators participating in its extramural research program. In addition, the agency  provides certain incentives, such as its Loan Repayment Program (LRP),  which, according to NIH, offers educational loan repayment benefits to  qualifying intramural or extramural investigators conducting research in  NIH mission-critical research areas.", "However, over the past several decades, NIH and its stakeholder  community have been concerned about the long-term growth and stability  of the nation\u2019s biomedical research workforce. For example, some have  reported on the challenges extramural investigators face when beginning  careers in this field. NIH has acknowledged that the environment is highly  competitive and many investigators may find that it takes years to obtain  the type and amount of funding that typically spurs research  independence. A review of NIH\u2019s research grants going back to 1982  has shown a steady drop in the number of investigators younger than age  46, despite a period when funding for NIH almost tripled. Even with long- standing congressional support for early research independence and NIH  funding, investigators at the early stages of their careers find it  increasingly difficult to obtain their first large NIH research grant, and  retain that support in subsequent years, according to NIH.", "Reports have shown that increasing the number of investigators from  diverse backgrounds can help maintain a stable U.S. biomedical research  workforce and contributes greatly to scientific innovation; however, some  have reported that achieving a diverse scientific workforce has been a  challenge. Though women have seen gains in some scientific fields, they  continue to lag behind men in academic and professional advancement.  Further, the representation of some racial and ethnic minority groups in  the biomedical sciences remains at low levels despite public and private  initiatives to increase the diversity of the nation\u2019s biomedical research  workforce. Certain racial groups have been found by research institutions  and government agencies to be underrepresented in the biomedical  research workforce. For example, the number of American Indians and  Alaska Natives, African Americans or blacks, and Native Hawaiian and  Pacific Islanders working in the biomedical sciences was reported by the  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to be  disproportionately low relative to their representation in the general  population. Hispanics and Latinos were also reported by the National  Academies to be an underrepresented ethnic group in biomedical  research. NIH considers the following racial groups to be  underrepresented in biomedical research: Blacks or African Americans,  American Indians or Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians and other  Pacific Islanders. NIH considers Hispanics and Latinos to be an ethnic  group underrepresented in biomedical research. For this report, we use  the same definitions.", "The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), which was enacted in December  2016, included provisions that NIH coordinate efforts to promote and  provide opportunities for investigators beginning their biomedical research  careers through the Next Generation Researchers Initiative (NGRI).

The institutes and centers accomplish their missions  primarily through extramural research programs. Most extramural  research funding is provided for investigator-initiated research projects for  which researchers, through their institutions, submit applications in  response to NIH announcements. In addition to these announcements,  the institutes and centers may issue more narrowly scoped solicitations,  through request for proposals, for research targeting specific areas.", "All extramural research project applications are to follow NIH\u2019s process of  peer review, which includes two sequential levels of review. The first level  involves non-governmental experts assessing the scientific merit of the  proposed applications and assigning them a priority score. The second  level involves advisory councils at the institute or center associated with  the grant application, that, in addition to scientific merit, consider the  institutes\u2019 and centers\u2019 missions and strategic plan goals and public  health needs.

NIH awards large renewable research project grants:  R01 and R01-equivalent (R01e) grants. According to NIH, in fiscal  year 2016, the average size of large grants was typically in excess of  $460,000 total. R01and R01e grants are NIH\u2019s most common type of  grant, according to NIH. They are generally the largest type of grant  available to investigators beginning their careers and, for purposes of  this report, are therefore referred to as \u201clarge\u201d grants. Large grants  provide 3 to 5 years of financial support for discrete, specified  research projects. According to NIH, it is generally expected that  within that period a project can be completed, results published, and  sufficient time will remain for the investigator to prepare a subsequent  application for a renewal or new award before funding ends.", "Smaller grants. While some non-R01 equivalent (non-R01e) grants  may match or exceed the amount of some R01e grants, they are  generally of a lesser amount and, for purposes of this report, are  therefore referred to as \u201csmaller\u201d grants. According to NIH, in fiscal  year 2016, smaller grants were, on average, amounts that ranged  from about $61,000 to about $1.1 million total. These grants provide  limited funding for a relatively short period of time to support a variety  of exploratory or developmental projects, including pilot or feasibility  studies, collection of preliminary data, and secondary analysis of  existing data.", "Career development grants. Also known as K-series grants, these  grants are intended to provide mentored research opportunities and  career enhancement experiences to support investigators or  postdoctoral fellows at various stages of their research careers.

Typically, investigators devote between 6 months to 1 year to  write their first large NIH grant application. Most of these grants, with a  funding period of over 3 years, require significant preliminary data to  support the proposed hypothesis contained in the application. In addition,  the median average time elapsed for applicants to learn whether they  have been awarded a grant is 270 days, or 9 months.

For example, a recent National Academies report pointed out that  between 1998 and 2003, the NIH budget grew from $13 billion to $27  billion, but the percentage of grants awarded to investigators who were in  the early stages of their careers steadily declined. Many in the field have  reported on the need to support investigators who are researching varied  biomedical issues in order to maximize the number of new discoveries.  Further, stakeholders within the scientific research community have  reported on the uncertain path that investigators may encounter early in  their careers and the prospect that they will ultimately pursue other career  options.", "Several reports have found that certain racial and ethnic groups are  underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce and in science.  These reports have also provided data on gender workforce disparities.  For example, a 2011 publication by the National Academies of Sciences,  Engineering, and Medicine showed that, in 2006, underrepresented  minorities made up about 29 percent of the U.S. population, but, in 2007,  were awarded about 5 percent of science and engineering doctorates.  Other studies have shown significant research funding disparities for  investigators from underrepresented groups that apply to NIH for large  research grants, such as R01 grants. In 2011, NIH funded a study that  examined the association between grant recipients and the applicants\u2019  race and ethnicity. The study found that R01 applicants that self-identified  as African American were 13 percentage points less likely than white  applicants to receive these grants. After controlling for other variables\u2014 including educational background, training, previous research grants, and  publication record\u2014African American applicants were 10 percentage  points less likely to be awarded such a grant than a white applicant.  Further, while women comprise about half of the postdoctoral graduates  for the biological sciences in the United States, studies have shown a  disparity in the number of female investigators in senior science research  positions at universities. This disparity may result in a smaller number of  female investigators among NIH grant applicants and may further  contribute to their underrepresentation in certain facets of science.  However, we previously reported that once female investigators apply for  NIH grants, their likelihood of receiving NIH grants is the same as their  male counterparts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NIH Has Promoted Efforts to Support Early and Intermediate Stage Investigators, but Those Who Have Not Yet Received a Large NIH Research Grant Remain Less Competitive", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NIH Has Promoted Programs and Policies to Support Early and Intermediate Stage Extramural Investigators, but It Is Too Early to Assess Its Most Recent Initiative", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 10 years, NIH has introduced programs and policies to  support extramural investigators competing for their first large NIH  research grant that leads to research independence.

During this period,  8,186 extramural investigators applied for initial LRP payments  and 3,206 received them; 5,131 extramural investigators applied  for renewal payments and 3,426 received them. Therefore, the  funding rates were 39 percent for initial applicants and 67 percent  for renewal applicants. Early stage and intermediate stage  investigators had similar funding rates in receiving LRP payments  during the 5-year period, though there was some variation each  year. Early stage and intermediate stage investigators seeking  initial LRP payments had funding rates of about 40 percent and 35  percent, respectively. Both of these categories of investigators  seeking renewal LRP payments had a funding rate of 67 percent.", "LRP payments to intramural investigators: The LRP funding  rate (awardees/applicants) for intramural investigators applying for total (both initial and renewal) LRP payments from fiscal years  2013 through 2017 was about 87 percent; 397 intramural  investigators applied for both initial and renewal LRP payments,  and NIH funded 345 of the applicants. The funding rate for  applicants seeking initial LRP payments during this 5-year period  was about 83 percent, whereas the funding rate for those applying  to renewal LRP payments was 90 percent.", "NIH also implemented policies to improve opportunities for early and  intermediate stage extramural investigators. For example, to address the  concerns about established investigators receiving a disproportionate  share of research funds, NIH established its Early Stage Investigator  Priority Policy in 2008. The policy specified that early stage investigator  status would be considered a factor when applications were being  selected for award. Studies have shown that under the Early Stage  Investigator Priority Policy, grants being awarded to early stage  investigators stopped declining and remained flat for several years. They  also showed that the field of biomedical research continued to be very  competitive for early stage investigators.", "However, some have expressed concern that these accomplishments are  not sufficient. For example, according to a recent report by the National  Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, a variety of steps  have been taken over the years to address the challenges facing early  and intermediate stage investigators, but these efforts have not resolved  the underlying problems that make it difficult for them to establish their  careers.", "More recently, the Cures Act required that NIH implement the NGRI,  which the agency established in August 2017. NIH\u2019s Office of the  Director, which oversees the initiative and its implementation, directed the  NIH institutes and centers to reprioritize large NIH research grant support  for early stage and intermediate stage investigators. The policy\u2019s stated  goal for fiscal year 2017 was to increase the number of large NIH  research grants provided to both early stage investigators and  intermediate stage investigators by 200 grants each compared to the  number that were awarded in fiscal year 2016. These 400 grants would  redirect approximately $210 million from NIH\u2019s base budget to support  additional early career investigators in the first year of NGRI\u2019s  implementation. However, with only one month to implement the policy,  NIH did not meet this goal. From fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017, the  number of large NIH research grants awarded increased by 57 for early  stage investigators and decreased by 2 for intermediate stage  investigators. Similarly, the goal to increase funding for the additional 400  grants was not met; funding increased by about $107 million during this  period. Given that this initiative is in the early stages and its goals were  set late in fiscal year 2017, it is too early to fully assess the impact of this  effort.", "According to NIH officials, the agency is in the process of reevaluating  which investigators should be the focus of the NGRI initiative and may  revise the program to include investigators whose careers are more  advanced. NIH officials stated that the NGRI policy\u2019s intention to direct  more research funding to early stage investigators will remain in place.  However, NIH\u2019s NGRI Working Group no longer designates intermediate  stage investigators\u2014or what it calls \u201cearly established investigators\u201d\u2014as  a distinct group. NIH\u2019s current definition\u2014that of being within 10 years of  receiving a first large NIH research grant as an early stage investigator\u2014 includes investigators who could have completed their graduate level  education (i.e., research doctorate or clinical doctorate), postdoctoral  research, or medical residency between 15 and 20 years ago. According  to NIH officials, NIH\u2019s working group is considering broadening this  definition even further. It is concerned that intermediate stage  investigators, facing increasing pressure to secure additional sources of  research funding to prevent the closure of their laboratories if their first  large NIH research grant is not renewed, could lose all NIH support and  become likely to leave the biomedical research workforce. Therefore, the  working group is considering a different approach for all established  investigators, with a focus on all meritorious investigators (regardless of  career stage) who are doing high quality research, yet are still at risk for  losing all NIH funding. Specifically, NIH officials said the working group  plans to reevaluate ways that it can provide additional, prioritized support  to these investigators in order to further their career trajectories. The  working group may recommend to NIH that the NGRI be expanded to  also target support for certain investigators whose careers are in more  advanced stages, rather than just those in the early stages of their  careers.", "In addition, NIH has not yet implemented the expansion of its LRP as  directed by the Cures Act. The Cures Act amended the LRP by  increasing the eligible annual loan repayment amount from a maximum of  $35,000 to a maximum of $50,000. The act also gave the NIH Director  the discretion to amend the research categories that are eligible for  intramural or extramural loan repayment based on emerging scientific  priorities or workforce needs.

For  example, in response to recommendations made by the Diversity in the  Biomedical Research Workforce advisory group, the agency hired a Chief  Officer of Scientific Workforce Diversity in 2014; implemented the three- tiered Diversity Program Consortium, which includes the Building  Infrastructure Leading to Diversity program, the National Research  Mentoring Network, and the Coordination and Evaluation Center; and  established a permanent advisory group on diversity. NIH also  developed a \u201ctoolkit\u201d that includes training modules to educate intramural  investigator search committee members on biases that can lead to a less  diverse workforce, among other things. In fiscal year 2017, NIH created  an Equity Committee to address recommendations made by the  Addressing Gender Inequality in the NIH Intramural Research Program  Action Task Force to further examine concerns about parity between  male and female intramural investigators and other diversity issues.", "Other NIH-wide policies and programs may also help to attract, retain,  and develop investigators from underrepresented groups. The 24 NIH  institutes and centers that fund research and the Office of the Director  provide funds for its investigators, called research supplements, to recruit  graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and others from  underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, as well as those with  disabilities and from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. These  funds provide graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and others an  opportunity to conduct research and be mentored by an investigator  supported by the specific NIH institute or center or office. Some  stakeholders we interviewed said that the agency\u2019s LRP also may help to  retain investigators from underrepresented groups, noting that the student  loan debt for African American or black graduate students is higher than  that of white graduate students. Physicians from a professional  organization we interviewed said that the LRP helps to attract physician  scientists from underrepresented groups into research careers.  Physicians we interviewed stressed the importance of the LRP to attract  physician scientists into research careers, because these scientists often  have significant medical school debt. Our analysis of extramural LRP data  showed that, in 2017, African Americans or black, non-Hispanics had a  funding rate of about 34 percent for receiving an LRP payment. White,  non-Hispanic applicants had a funding rate for receiving an LRP payment  of about 52 percent. More recently, the National Academies of  Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that NIH make the  LRP available to all individuals pursuing biomedical physician-scientist  researcher careers, regardless of their research area or clinical specialty.  They also suggested NIH increase the monetary value of loan repayment  to reflect the debt burden of current medical trainees. Some  stakeholders said that NIH\u2019s family friendly policies, such as  reimbursement for child care expenses and parental leave, may also help  address work-life balance issues for female investigators that may  otherwise forego some research duties to care for young children.", "Additionally, many\u2014at least 17 of 27\u2014of NIH\u2019s institutes and centers  have established their own policies and programs to attract, retain, and  develop investigators from underrepresented groups. For example, the  National Cancer Institute initiated the Continuing Umbrella of Research  Experiences program to provide training and career development  opportunities to enhance and increase diversity in the cancer research  workforce.

However, from 2013 through 2017, women represented less  than one-quarter of all tenured NIH intramural investigators. For  example, in 2017, 191, (23 percent) of NIH\u2019s 822 intramural tenured  investigators were women. In addition, in 2017, 79, (37 percent), of NIH\u2019s  211 tenure-track intramural investigators were women. Further, in fiscal  years 2013 through 2017, nearly one-third of all extramural investigators  that applied for large grants were women. (See table 4.) Nearly one-third  of all applicants for smaller research grants, and close to half of all  applicants for NIH career development grants, were women.

Attrition of biomedical science doctoral students and early career  investigators from these groups is one explanation. Some stakeholders  said that, while in graduate school, students from these groups may be  discouraged from pursuing a biomedical research career as a result of  implicit bias that they encountered with their mentors. Some stakeholders  said lower numbers among women investigators is the result of decisions  of some to start a family in the early stages of their careers, and further  noted the difficulty in re-entering the biomedical research workforce. In  addition, some stakeholders said that students from underrepresented  groups may lack exposure to a sufficiently rigorous education in  mathematics or the sciences prior to entering college, resulting in the low  numbers of biomedical researchers from these groups. Others said the  low numbers of investigators from these groups makes studying this issue  difficult due to a small sample size. Additional administrative demands  placed on individuals who pursue careers as investigators also affect the  number of applicants. For example, some stakeholders said that once  investigators from an underrepresented group attain faculty positions\u2014 particularly if there are few faculty members from such groups\u2014they are  frequently tasked with additional administrative duties. We were told that,  often, they are selected because they may be one of a handful of  members of underrepresented groups at some institutions. Their  additional duties include participation on institutional committees as well  as mentoring, particularly undergraduate or graduate students from  underrepresented groups. In addition, representatives of one stakeholder  group said that some research faculty from underrepresented groups feel  additional pressure to participate in such activities, because their absence  would be more apparent and they worry that this may adversely affect  them. Stakeholders also told us that additional duties are time consuming  and leave less time to devote to applying for grant funding. They said that  some biomedical graduate students from underrepresented groups  decide to pursue other fields, because of the competing demands  associated with being an academic, such as grant writing and teaching  responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIH Research Grant Applicant Funding Rates", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of NIH data from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 also shows  that the funding rate for applicants from underrepresented racial groups  applying for large and small NIH grants lags behind that of white  applicants.

(See app. III for information on the applicant funding rates for  smaller grants and career development grants by gender.)", "Many stakeholders attributed the underrepresented groups\u2019 lower funding  rates to two factors. First, many stakeholders cited a perceived implicit  bias within the peer review process, which they said may affect the  funding rates for investigators from underrepresented racial and ethnic  groups. They stressed that, many times, peer reviewers approve grants  for investigators from top tier institutions that they are familiar with and  are reluctant to provide high scores to grant applications from other  institutions. Some stakeholders advocated for anonymizing grant  applications to some extent to address this issue. NIH\u2019s Center for  Scientific Review\u2014the center responsible for organizing peer reviews for  grants\u2014is conducting a study that anonymizes certain large grant  applications, and a training module on implicit bias is currently being  offered to NIH peer reviewers.

Lower grant application priority scores and  application resubmission rates among African American or black  applicants were among their findings. The working group is also pursuing  a randomized control trial to assess the effect of mentoring and coaching  on R01 resubmissions and award rates. Second, some stakeholders told  us that only a very small percentage of biomedical science professors at  top tier research schools are from underrepresented racial or ethnic  groups. Some stakeholders suggested that many investigators from  underrepresented groups seeking grants are affiliated with institutions  outside of the top tier that may lack the infrastructure, grant writing  support, and mentoring opportunities, which could help ensure their  success.

During the course of our audit work, NIH updated this plan to describe  progress made on each of its diversity goals, which are to: expand scientific workforce diversity as a field of inquiry, build and implement evidence related to diversity outcomes, understand the role of sociocultural factors in biomedical recruitment  sustain nationwide workforce diversity with seamless career  transitions, and promote the value of scientific workforce diversity.", "NIH officials provided us with performance measures that its scientific  workforce diversity office will use to gauge the agency\u2019s progress in  achieving each of its five strategic plan\u2019s goals.

For example, for the first scientific workforce diversity goal  \u201cexpand scientific workforce diversity as a field of inquiry\u201d one of the  performance measures is \u201cnumber of publications stored in the scientific  workforce diversity office\u2019s online database.\u201d Neither the strategic plan  nor the additional documentation that NIH provided specifies a  quantitative metric for the number of publications to be stored in its  database and the time frame for doing so. Similarly, for the second  scientific workforce diversity goal, to \u201cbuild and implement evidence  related to diversity outcomes\u201d one of the performance measures identified  by NIH is to compare the large grants awarded to African American or  black scientists to those received by scientists who are white or from  other racial and ethnic groups.
