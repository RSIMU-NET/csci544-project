GAO determined the prevalence of privately managed public schools and what could be learned about student achievement in these schools from publicly available sources. To do so, GAO examined existing data on the number and location of privately managed schools and reviewed a variety of reports on student achievement. In addition, GAO compared standardized test scores of students attending privately managed public schools with scores of students attending similar traditional public schools. GAO identified privately managed schools that had been in operation for four years or more in 6 large cities and matched these schools with a group of traditional schools serving similar students. GAO then analyzed student scores on state reading and math tests at selected grade levels, controlling for differences in student populations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of public schools managed by private companies has tripled in the last 5 years according to data compiled by university researchers, although such schools comprise less than 0.5 percent of all public schools. In the 2002-03 school year, nearly 50 private companies managed over 400 public schools nationwide. These companies managed schools in 25 states and the District of Columbia, with about one-half of the schools located in Arizona and Michigan. Information on student achievement at these schools was available in the form of state- or district-issued school report cards and annual reports issued by the management companies. Although these reports provided valuable descriptive information, they were generally not designed to answer research questions about the relative effectiveness of privately managed schools compared with traditional schools in raising student achievement. Consequently, GAO conducted test score analyses that provide further insight into student achievement in these schools. GAO's analyses of student test scores in 6 cities yielded mixed results. Scores for 5th grade students in Denver and San Francisco were significantly higher in both reading and math in two privately managed schools when compared with traditional schools serving similar students. However, 4th grade scores in reading and math were significantly lower in a privately managed public school in Cleveland, as were 5th grade scores in two privately managed schools in St. Paul. In Detroit, where eight privately managed schools were studied, reading and math scores of 5th graders in privately managed schools were generally lower. In Phoenix, GAO found no significant differences. GAO's results are limited to the schools and grade levels examined and may not be indicative of performance at other schools."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the last decade, reports of failing schools and low student achievement  have given rise to a variety of educational reforms that have expanded  opportunities for private companies to play a role in public education.

The accountability requirements of the No Child  Left Behind Act (NCLBA) of 2001 may further increase such arrangements  because schools that continuously fail to make adequate yearly progress  toward meeting state proficiency goals may be eventually subject to  fundamental restructuring by the state, including turning the operation of the school over to a private management company.", "As the role of private companies in the management of public schools has  developed, interest in students\u2019 academic performance at these schools  has grown. In light of the expanding role for private companies in public  education, we agreed with your office to determine the prevalence of  public schools managed by private companies and to report on what can  be learned about student achievement in these schools from publicly  available information sources. In addition, we agreed to compare student  achievement in elementary schools operated by private companies in large  urban areas with student achievement in similar traditional elementary  schools.", "To determine the prevalence of privately managed schools, we obtained information from research organizations on the number and location of  public schools that have both instructional and noninstructional services  provided by private companies. We relied primarily on a 2002-03 annual  report compiled by Arizona State University that tracks nationwide growth of for-profit educational management companies, the only such report of  its kind we found. We selectively verified data in that report with  information compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics, the  Center for Education Reform, the National Association of Charter School  Authorizers, and university researchers in Michigan and New Jersey. To  locate publicly available information on student achievement in privately  managed schools, we examined a variety of Internet Web sites, including  state, district, and the larger private management company sites. We also  reviewed studies conducted by the companies and by other researchers, as  well as performance reports issued by state and district school officials to  learn what has been reported about achievement at these schools.", "To compare student achievement in public elementary schools operated  by private companies with that at similar traditional schools, we analyzed  individual student performance in specific grades on mandatory state tests  of reading and mathematics. We identified 14 public elementary schools in  larger urban areas across the country that had been continuously managed  by private companies since the 1998-99 school year. These schools,  managed by six private companies, were located in six cities: Cleveland,  Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul,  Minnesota; and San Francisco, California. We matched each of the  14 schools with a set of 2 or more traditional public schools in the same  city that were similar in terms of grade span, enrollment, student race and  ethnicity, and the percentage of students with limited-English proficiency,  disabilities, and eligibility for the federally subsidized free and reduced- price school lunch program. (See app. I for details on the procedures used  to match schools.) Using test scores for the school years 2000-01 and  2001-02, we compared student scores in reading and math at one grade  level in each of the 14 privately managed schools with scores of students  in the same grade at the set of similar traditional schools. We also analyzed  changes in individual students\u2019 test scores over time in the three cities  where such data were available\u2014Denver, Phoenix, and San Francisco.", "Our analyses controlled for differences in characteristics of students  attending the privately managed and traditional schools by using  demographic characteristics\u2014such as those used in selecting similar  traditional schools\u2014and student mobility to the extent that these data  were available for individual students. We use the word significant\u2014as in  significantly higher or lower\u2014throughout this report to mean statistical  significance at a 95-percent confidence level, not to refer to the  importance of the difference. Our study is constrained to varying degrees  by incomplete data for some locations and by the lack of information on  the reasons that individual students enrolled in these schools. In addition,  our findings about student performance are limited to the particular  grades in the privately managed and traditional schools we studied and  may not be indicative of other grades or schools. For this reason, we do  not identify the specific schools or the associated management companies  in our study by name. A detailed explanation of our methodology, study  limitations, and data verification procedures are found in appendix I. We  conducted our work from January to October 2003 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The role of for-profit private companies in managing public schools is a  fairly recent phenomenon. Until the early 1990\u2019s, school districts  contracted with private companies largely to provide noninstructional  services, such as transportation, building maintenance, or school lunches.  By the 1994-95 school year, however, the role of private companies had  expanded to include instructional services in four school districts, as we  reported in a 1996 GAO study. These early decisions by school districts to  contract with private companies often followed years of frustration with  low student achievement in these schools. Since that time, the growth of  private for-profit educational management companies has been aided by  financial support from the business community and by the opportunities  states have offered for greater flexibility in the provision of education  services.", "Private for-profit management companies supply a wide array of  educational and management services that may include providing the  curriculum, educational materials, and key staff as well as payroll  processing, busing, and building maintenance. The range and type of  services vary by company, and to some extent by school within the  company, as some companies have adapted their educational programs to  the needs and interests of local areas. According to a study of for-profit  educational management companies by Arizona State University, three- quarters of schools operated by private for-profit management companies  in school year 2002-03 served elementary grade students in kindergarten  through fifth grade and in some cases continued to serve students in  higher grades. The size of schools operated by private management  companies varied from an enrollment of fewer than 100 students to more  than 1,000 students, but averaged about 450. Several of the major  companies reportedly served a predominantly low-income, urban, and  minority student population.", "Private companies operate both traditional public schools and public  charter schools. Some states or districts contract with companies to  manage traditional public schools\u2014often poorly performing public  schools. These schools are generally subject to the same set of  requirements that govern traditional schools within the district. More  commonly, companies manage charter schools \u2014public schools that  operate under agreements that exempt them from some state and district  regulations but hold them accountable for improving pupil outcomes.  Enrollment in charter schools generally is not limited to defined  neighborhoods, but may draw from larger geographic areas than is the  case for most traditional schools and must be open to all, without  discrimination, up to enrollment limits. Like traditional public schools,  charter schools receive public funds and may not charge tuition for regular  school programs and services, but may charge for before- and after-school  services, extended day kindergarten, or pre-kindergarten classes.", "Public schools operated by private management companies, both  traditional and charter, are subject to requirements of the NCLBA,  including expanded testing requirements. Under this law, states must  establish standards for student achievement and goals for schools\u2019  performance. Results must be measured every year by testing all students  in each of elementary grades three through five and middle school grades  six through eight, starting in school year 2005-06, and by assessing how  schools have progressed in terms of improving the performance of their  students. Information from these tests must be made available in annual  reports that include the performance of specific student subgroups, as  defined by certain demographic and other characteristics. During the  school years covered in our study, states were only required to test  students in one elementary, one middle school, and one high school grade.  Table 1 identifies the different state testing schedules and instruments for  the elementary grades in school year 2001-2002 in the cities where we  made test score comparisons.", "Infrequent state testing is one of several factors that have hampered  efforts to evaluate the impact of privately managed public schools on  student achievement. To assess the impact of school management,  researchers must isolate the effects of private management from the  effects of other factors that could influence students\u2019 test scores, such as  school resources or student ability. Ideally, this would be accomplished by  randomly assigning students to either a privately managed school or a  traditionally managed school, resulting in two groups of students generally  equivalent except for the type of school assigned. However, random  assignment is rarely practical, and researchers usually employ less  scientifically rigorous methods to find a generally equivalent comparison  group. For instance, in some cases, schools may be matched on  schoolwide student demographic characteristics such as race or  socioeconomic status. When such characteristics can be obtained for  individual students in the study, validity is improved. In addition, validity  is further improved when the progress of students can be followed over  several years. However, if the data on individual student characteristics  are unreliable or unavailable, as has often been the case, researchers  experience difficulties developing valid comparison groups. Similarly, if  individual test scores are available only for one grade rather than  successive grades, researchers cannot reliably track the progress of  student groups over time and compare the gains made by the two groups.  In our 2002 report that examined research on schools managed by some of  the largest education management companies, we found that insufficient  rigorous research existed to clearly address the question of their impact  on student achievement. Part of the reason that so few rigorous studies  are available may stem from the difficulties inherent in this research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Schools Managed by Education Management Companies Is Increasing; Descriptive Information on Achievement Widely Available", "paragraphs": ["Although the number of public schools operated by private, for-profit  management companies has risen rapidly in recent years, these schools  still comprise a very small proportion of all public schools nationwide.  Largely charter schools, the 417 privately managed schools were located in  25 states and the District of Columbia in school year 2002-03, with about  one-half in Arizona and Michigan. These schools were operated by  47 private management companies. Descriptive information about  achievement in these schools was widely available in the form of  individual school report cards that often provided comparisons with state  or district averages, but often not with similar traditional schools. Three  management company reports summarized achievement gains over time  for all their schools in one or more states, using various methodologies to  illustrate student performance.

This figure was three times greater than the  number of schools operated by private management companies just  4 years earlier, when there were only 135 schools, as shown in  figure 1. Over three-quarters of the 417 schools were charter schools, and  they comprised about 12 percent of charter schools nationwide. Despite  the sharp rise in the number of public schools operated by management  companies, they represented a small proportion of all charter and  traditional schools in 2002-03. About one-half of 1 percent of all schools  nationwide were privately managed schools.", "Over the same 5 years, public schools operated by private management  companies have also become more geographically widespread, according  to data from the Arizona State University study. Figure 2 shows that in  school year 1998-99, private management companies operated public  schools in 15 states. By school year 2002-03, the companies had schools in  25 states and the District of Columbia, with about 48 percent of the  privately managed schools in Arizona and Michigan. Florida, Ohio, and  Pennsylvania also had large numbers of schools as indicated by the map in  figure 2, which shows the location of public schools operated by private  management companies in school year 2002-03.", "The number of private management companies identified by the Arizona  State University researchers also increased over the same period, but the  companies varied greatly in terms of the number of schools they operated.  As shown in figure 3, the number of companies increased from 13 in  school year 1998-99 to 47 in school year 2002-03. Most of these companies  were founded in the decade of the 1990\u2019s, but since their founding, some  companies have been consolidated or have gone out of business and have  been succeeded by newly formed companies. In school year 2002-03, most  of the companies were small, operating 15 or fewer schools each. Five  medium-sized companies\u2014Chancellor Beacon Academies; The Leona  Group; Mosaica Education, Inc.; National Heritage Academies; and White  Hat Management\u2014operated from 21 to 44 schools each. The single largest  company, Edison Schools, operated 116 schools.", "According to the Arizona Sate University report, 43 of the 47 companies  operating in school year 2002-03 managed only charter schools. Charter  schools have greater autonomy and decision-making ability in such areas  as purchasing and hiring compared with traditional schools that are  generally subject to district requirements, including labor agreements.  Arizona researchers noted that state charter school laws have provided  opportunities for private management that were not present earlier, and  Western Michigan University researchers indicated that the growth of  private educational management companies occurred soon after charter  schools reforms were enacted in that state. They explained that some  charter holders started their own private management companies and  other charter holders sought the acumen and financial resources of  management companies already established in the business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individual School Reports Describe Achievement Levels, and Some Company Reports Describe Gains Compared to State or District Averages", "paragraphs": ["Two kinds of reports available to the public \u2014school reports and company  reports \u2014 described student achievement at privately managed schools  relative to national, state, or district averages in school year 2002-03.  Referred to as school report cards, the detailed individual school reports  generally provided a snapshot of how well students attending the school  did in meeting state achievement standards for the year. These report  cards were issued by states, school districts, and by some of the larger  companies, like the Leona Group for its schools in Michigan. Often  available through the Internet, the report cards for individual schools  generally described results of state tests in terms of the proficiency levels  or achievement scores for the school overall, by grade level, subject  matter, or in some cases, minority group or other subgroup. Some report  cards also provided historical information on the school\u2019s performance  over several preceding years. School characteristics, such as the size,  demographics, staffing, and finances, were included in many cases along  with the proficiency levels or achievement scores. Figure 4 is an example  of the test score section of Colorado\u2019s school report card for a  hypothetical school.", "As in Colorado, many school report cards compared results to the average  in the state or school district, which allowed parents to see how well their  children\u2019s school was doing\u2014not just in relation to state standards but  also in relation to the performance of all other public schools in the state  or district. However, these report cards were primarily designed to  provide descriptive information for parents and to give an indication of  school performance, not to evaluate the relative effectiveness of one  school versus another. Report cards usually did not directly compare the  performance of one school against other similar schools, and when they  did, the comparison schools selected were, by necessity, matched at the  school level, rather than the individual student level. Thus, differences in  school performance at any particular grade might be due to differences in  the students in that grade, as the reports released by the Leona Group  warned, rather than due to factors related to the management or  educational strategies of the school. For this reason, report cards, while  useful to parents, are not the best source of information if the goal is to  evaluate the effectiveness of one school compared with another.", "Company reports, a second source of school performance information,  tended to provide a summary of how well students at all the company\u2019s  schools in one or more states were doing over a period of several years.  Generally available through the Internet, reports from three companies\u2014  Mosaica Education, Inc.; the National Heritage Academies; and Edison  Schools \u2013 emphasized broad patterns, such as gains in achievement test  scores or proficiency levels that were averaged across schools, grades, and  subjects tested. Our descriptions of the companies\u2019 findings are based on  their public reports and not on our independent review of their  methodologies or conclusions.", "Both the Mosaica and National Heritage Academies reports compared  student performance to national norms or state averages. The Mosaica  Education, Inc., report summarized student gains on tests administered  from the fall of school year 1999-2000 through the spring of 2001-02 at its  18 schools in 5 states and the District of Columbia. According to the  report, there was sustained growth in average achievement scores over  time, with an increase in the proportion of Mosaica students scoring as  well or better than the average student on a nationally normed test and a  commensurate decrease in the proportion scoring at or below the  25th percentile. On the basis of these test results, the report stated that  about a third of Mosaica\u2019s students ranked in the top one-half of the  nation\u2019s students in school year 2001-02.", "The National Heritage Academies report used individual student  performance on the state\u2019s achievement tests to compare two groups of  students attending the company\u2019s 22 schools in Michigan in school year  2000-01\u2014veteran students who took the test at least 2 years after they  applied to the school and newcomers who took the test less than 2 years  after they applied. The study found a relationship between time  associated with the company\u2019s schools and higher performance, with  veteran students outperforming newcomers across all subjects and grades  tested and also outperforming state averages on 8 out of 10 tests. The  report cautioned, however, that such evidence is not proof of causation  and that some other factors not accounted for in the study might be  responsible for the results.", "The Mosaica and National Heritage Academies reports both provided a  broad view of overall company performance that, along with school report  cards, could give parents more information on which to base their  decisions about their children\u2019s schooling. However, like school report  cards, these two company studies were not designed to more directly  assess school effectiveness. Neither company report included  comparisons with students at similar traditional schools or addressed the  question of whether the patterns of achievement that they identified might  also be found in other schools as well.", "Edison\u2019s annual report for 2001-02 used a methodology that went further  toward assessing school effectiveness than other company reports we  examined. In addition to providing a summary of how well its students  were doing over time, Edison compared some of its schools with  traditional schools. Generally, the report summarized trends in  performance at 94 of Edison\u2019s 112 school sites in multiple states over  several years, compared to state and district averages. According to the  report, most schools had low levels of achievement at the time Edison  assumed management, but achievement levels subsequently increased at  most of its school sites. Trends were also provided for several subsets of  its schools, including a comparison of 66 of the 94 Edison schools that  could be matched with 1,102 traditional schools on two demographic  variables. Traditional schools selected as matches were those considered  similar in terms of the percentages of students who were African- American and/or Hispanic and who were eligible for the free and reduced- price school lunch program, an indicator of low income. Edison  compared the average scores of students in Edison schools with average  scores of students in the traditional schools and found that its schools  averaged gains that were about 2 percentage points or 3 percentiles higher  per year than those of traditional schools and that about 40 of its  66 schools outperformed the traditional schools.", "However, the Edison analysis was limited by the fact that it was conducted  using aggregated, school-level data and did not control for differences in  the individual students being compared. Edison noted that it has taken  steps to strengthen the way it evaluates the progress of its students and  schools by commissioning a study by RAND, a nonprofit research  organization that has evaluated educational reforms. The study began in  2000 and is scheduled for release in the summer of 2004.

Such information can be useful to parents in making school choices by  providing a variety of information about schools, including how they are  performing in terms of students meeting state achievement standards or  relative to statewide averages.", "However, educators and policymakers often want to know not only how  well schools are performing but also the factors that contribute to their  high or low performance so that successful strategies can be emulated.  Answering this kind of evaluative question requires a different kind of  methodology and more complex analyses to isolate the effects of the  particular strategies of interest\u2014educational practices, management  techniques, and so on\u2014 from the many other factors that could affect  student achievement. Although not a comprehensive impact evaluation,  our study investigates the effect of school management by comparing  traditional and privately managed schools and by controlling for  differences in the characteristics of students attending the schools. In this  way, our study provides a different type of information than that typically  found in school report cards.", "While our study explores the role of school management, it has certain  important limitations, as discussed earlier and in appendix I. Among these  are data issues commonly encountered by educational researchers, for  instance, lack of test score data for successive years and unreliable  demographic data for individual students in some sites. However, with the  implementation of NCLBA, more rigorous studies should be possible, as  annual testing of all grades is phased in and with expected improvements  in the quality of demographic data resulting from requirements to report  progress for various subpopulations of students, based on such  characteristics as race and low-income status.", "Finally, our mixed results may be evidence of the complexity of the factor  under study. Our study analyzed differences between 2 categories of  schools, grouped by whether they were traditional, district-managed  schools or managed by a private company. However, these schools may  have differed in other ways not included in our study\u2014for example  curricula, staff composition and qualifications, and funding levels\u2014and  these factors may also have affected student achievement. Any of these  factors or combination of factors could account for the differences we  found or may have masked the effects of differences we otherwise would  have found."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education for  review and comment.

To  confirm the reasonableness of the matches, we spoke with principals in all  of the privately managed schools in our study and visited most of the  schools. We also spoke with principals and visited many of the traditional  schools selected. For selected grade levels, we compared the individual  student scores of students attending the privately managed schools with  those of students in the similar traditional public schools. We also  compared changes in individual student performance over time where  such data were available. This appendix describes the scope and school  selection, outcome measures and analytic methods, and the limitations of  the analysis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope and School Selection", "paragraphs": ["Using available public information, we attempted to identify all privately  managed public elementary schools in large urban areas that had been in  continuous operation by the same management company since the  1998-99 school year. We defined a large urban area for this study as a  central city with a population of at least 400,000 in a standard metropolitan  statistical area with a population of at least 2,000,000. We identified  17 public elementary schools managed by private companies meeting  these criteria. The 17 schools were located in Cleveland, Ohio; Denver,  Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; and  San Francisco, California.", "We matched each of these privately managed schools with 2-4 similar  traditional public schools in the district where the privately managed  school was located. To select similar traditional public schools, we  employed a \u201ctotal deviation\u201d score procedure. For each public elementary  school in the defined public school district and the privately managed  school, we determined the following school characteristics: (1) racial and  ethnic percentages, (2) percent special education, (3) percent eligible for  free and reduced lunch, (4) percent limited-English proficient, and  (5) student enrollment. We calculated z-scores (the statistic that indicates  how far and in what direction the value deviates from its distribution\u2019s  mean, expressed in units of its distribution\u2019s standard deviation) for each  characteristic, and then calculated the absolute value of the difference  between the z-score of the privately managed school and the z-score of  each traditional public school on that characteristic. For each school, we  summed the absolute difference in z-scores into a total deviation score.  The total deviation score represents the sum of the differences between  the privately managed public school and the candidate traditional public  schools.", "Traditional public schools were considered a close match if the total  deviation score divided by the number of characteristics for which we  computed z-scores was less than or equal to 1.0. A score less than or equal  to 1.0 indicates that the traditional school did not deviate from the  privately managed school by more than 1 standard deviation when  averaging across all variables considered in the match. For example, if  8 variables were used to calculate the total deviation score and the total  deviation score was 7.8, the amount that the candidate school deviated  from the privately managed school would be, on average, less than  1 standard deviation. All comparison schools selected for our analyses met  this criterion for a close match.", "After mathematically selecting close matches, we consulted with public  school district officials about the schools selected. These considerations  led to adjustments to our final selection of matches as follows. In St. Paul,  traditional public schools closely matching the privately managed schools  included magnet schools and neighborhood, that is, attendance-zone,  schools. The two \u201cbest\u201d matching magnet schools and the two \u201cbest\u201d  neighborhood schools were selected as matches for the analysis. Similarly  in Cleveland, traditional public schools closely matching the privately  managed schools included former magnet schools and traditional  neighborhood schools. For balance in matching, the two \u201cbest\u201d matching  former magnet schools and two \u201cbest\u201d matching neighborhood schools  were selected as matches for the analysis. In Denver, the five closest  matching schools were all located in a distinct neighborhood,  geographically distant from the privately managed school. In consultation  with local school district personnel, the two \u201cbest\u201d matching schools from  this area and the two \u201cbest\u201d matching schools from outside this area were  selected for the analysis. In San Francisco, one of the three traditional  school matches was discarded because it had a special teacher training  program, resulting in only two matches with the privately managed school.  In Detroit, the best three matching traditional schools were selected  except in one instance where one of the matching schools was discarded  because a subsequent site visit determined that the school had selection  criteria for attendance based upon prior achievement. In Phoenix, there  were 21 elementary school districts located in the city, and 13 of these  districts comprise the Unified Phoenix High School District. Since the  privately managed schools were located within the Unified Phoenix High  School District, we selected matches from among the 13 school districts in  the Unified Phoenix High School District using the \u201cbest\u201d matching school  of each elementary school district as a pool from which we selected the  best four matches, each from a different school district.", "Two privately managed schools in Phoenix and one privately managed  school in Cleveland were dropped from the analysis because no matching  traditional schools were found using our methodology. This resulted in a  total of 14 privately managed schools included in the study, 8 of which  were located in Detroit.

At the time of  our study, the most recent data available were for school year 2001-2002.  Test scores and student characteristic data were obtained from either the  school district or state education agency. We used a variety of approaches  to verify the accuracy of these data. In most cases, we verified data by  comparing a sample of the data received against school records examined  at the school site. In Detroit, data verification indicated student low- income, special education, and mobility data provided by the state were  unreliable, and we decided not to use these data in our final analyses. In  Phoenix, data verification indicated that student limited-English  proficiency and special education data provided by the state for the  privately managed school were unreliable and this was confirmed with  diagnostic analysis. Therefore, we were unable to include these control  variables in our final analyses.", "For each privately managed school and its set of matched, comparison  schools, we selected the highest elementary grade for which test scores  were available. We collected test score information for 2 school years,  2000-01 and 2001-02, except in Detroit where only 2001-02 scores were  used due to difficulties obtaining data and changes in the test given. For  each site, we compared reading and math student scores in the privately  managed school(s) with the scores of same-grade students in the set of  matched, comparison schools. The scores for the 2000-01 and 2001-02  school years were combined in the analysis.

In Denver, 2 of our matched  schools were in a distinct neighborhood that school district personnel  believed might be atypical; in Cleveland and St. Paul several of the  matched schools were magnet or former magnet schools. We re-analyzed  the data in each of these cities using these groupings as factors. The  overall results were unchanged, with the exception that in Denver, reading  scores were not significantly different when the privately managed school  was compared with the 2 schools not in the distinct neighborhood.", "In conducting these analyses, we performed certain diagnostic and  analytic tests to confirm both the appropriateness of aggregating  categories in our analyses and the reasonableness of assumptions  pertaining to normality and homogeneity of variance. In addition, we  determined the extent of missing data and performed sensitivity analyses  to assess the effect on our results. We determined that missing case level  data had a negligible effect on our results.", "To illustrate the magnitude of differences found, we computed effect sizes  based on standardized mean differences. Using the OLS regression results,  we divided the unstandardized coefficient associated with school type by  the pooled standard deviation to obtain z-scores for average students in  the privately managed and traditional schools. The reported percentile  was the area of the normal curve associated with the z-scores.", "Tables 5-12 in appendix II list the regression results and independent  variables included in our analyses. The size and significance of the  differences we report were derived from OLS regression models. We  obtained results that were almost identical to the OLS results when we  used robust estimation procedures to calculate the standard errors  associated with the estimated differences. We also considered robust  regression models that allowed for the clustering, and lack of  independence, of students within schools. These models yielded  somewhat fewer differences that were statistically significant at the  95-percent confidence level. We do not focus our reporting on the results  of the models that account for clustering, however, since the statistical  properties and validity of such models when applied to data with a very  small number of clusters (in this case, 3 to 5 schools) is questionable.However, changes to significance levels of the school type coefficients due  to robust standard errors and robust standard errors with clustering are  noted in appendix II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Analysis", "paragraphs": ["The findings in this study are subject to typical limitations found in quasi- experimental designs. We examined the highest elementary grades tested  for school years 2000-01 and 2001-02, and student achievement in these  grades and years may not be indicative of student achievement in other  grades and years in those schools. In addition, our matching process may  not have produced equivalent groups for comparison. We mitigated this  potential problem by using individual student characteristics in our  analyses. However, reliable and complete student demographic data were  not available in all sites, which resulted in the elimination of important  factors from the model in several sites. In addition, other factors such as  student ability, prior achievement, operating environment, reasons  students enrolled in privately managed schools, and parental involvement,  may be related to student achievement and are not accounted for in the  study. Finally, our examination of student performance over time, that is,  changes in achievement between grades, also has some limitations. First,  the data allowed a study of achievement over time in only 3 of the 6 sites.  In addition, the analyses included only students who continuously  attended the school over the time period studied, and this in some cases  eliminated more than half of the subjects from the analyses.
