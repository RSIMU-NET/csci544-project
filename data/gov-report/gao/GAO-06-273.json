As public use of the Internet grew from the mid-1990s onward, Internet access became a potential target for state and local taxation. In 1998, Congress imposed a moratorium temporarily preventing state and local governments from imposing new taxes on Internet access. Existing state and local taxes were grandfathered. In amending the moratorium in 2004, Congress required GAO to study its impact on state and local government revenues. This report's objectives are to determine the scope of the moratorium and its impact, if any, on state and local revenues. For this report, GAO reviewed the moratorium's language, its legislative history, and associated legal issues; examined studies of revenue impact; interviewed people knowledgeable about access services; and collected information about eight case study states not intended to be representative of other states. GAO chose the states considering such factors as whether they had taxes grandfathered for different forms of access services and covered different urban and rural parts of the country."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Internet tax moratorium bars taxes on Internet access services provided to end users. GAO's interpretation of the law is that the bar on taxes includes whatever an access provider reasonably bundles to consumers, including e-mail and digital subscriber line (DSL) services. The moratorium does not bar taxes on acquired services, such as high-speed communications capacity over fiber, acquired by Internet service providers (ISP) and used to deliver Internet access. However, some states and providers have construed the moratorium as barring taxation of acquired services. Some officials told us their states would stop collecting such taxes as early as November 1, 2005, the date they assumed that taxes on acquired services would lose their grandfathered protection. According to GAO's reading of the law, these taxes are not barred since a tax on acquired services is not a tax on Internet access. In comments, telecommunications industry officials continued to view acquired services as subject to the moratorium and exempt from taxation. As noted above, GAO disagrees. In addition, Federation of Tax Administrators officials expressed concern that some might have a broader view of what could be included in Internet access bundles. However, GAO's view is that what is included must be reasonably related to providing Internet access. The revenue impact of eliminating grandfathering in states studied by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) would be small, but the moratorium's total revenue impact has been unclear and any future impact would vary by state. In 2003, when CBO reported how much states and localities would lose annually by 2007 if certain grandfathered taxes were eliminated, its estimate for states with grandfathered taxes in 1998 was about 0.1 percent of those states' 2004 tax revenues. Because it is hard to know what states would have done to tax access services if no moratorium had existed, the total revenue implications of the moratorium are unclear. In general, any future moratorium-related impact will differ by state. Tax law details and tax rates varied among states. For instance, North Dakota taxed access service delivered to retail consumers, and Kansas taxed communications services acquired by ISPs to support their customers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to one study, at the end of 2004 some 70 million U.S. adults  logged on to the Internet during a typical day.

Concerned about the impact of such taxes,  Congress extensively debated whether state and local governments should  be allowed to tax Internet access.  The debate resulted in legislation setting  national policy on state and local taxation of access.", "In 1998, Congress enacted the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which imposed a  moratorium temporarily preventing state and local governments from  imposing new taxes on Internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes  on electronic commerce.  Existing state and local taxes were  \u201cgrandfathered,\u201d allowing them to continue to be collected.  Since its  enactment, the moratorium has been amended twice, most recently in  2004, when Congress included language requiring that we study the impact  of the moratorium on state and local government revenues and on the  deployment and adoption of broadband technologies.  Such technologies  permit communications over high-speed, high-capacity media, such as that provided by cable modem service or by a telephone technology known as  digital subscriber line (DSL).", "This report focuses on the moratorium\u2019s impact on state and local  government revenues.  Its objectives are to determine (1) the scope of the  moratorium and (2) the impact of the moratorium, if any, on state and local  revenues.  In determining any impact on revenues, the report explores what  would happen if grandfathering of access taxes on dial-up and DSL services  were eliminated, what might have happened in the absence of the  moratorium, and how the impact of the moratorium might differ from state  to state.  This report does not focus on taxing the sale of items over the  Internet.  A future report will discuss the impact that various factors,  including taxes, have on broadband deployment and adoption.", "To prepare this report, we reviewed the language of the moratorium, its  legislative history, and associated legal issues; examined studies of revenue  impact done by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and others;  interviewed representatives of companies and associations involved with  Internet access services; and collected information through case studies of  eight states.  We chose the states to get a mixture of those that did or did  not have taxes grandfathered for different forms of access services, did or  did not have local jurisdictions that taxed access services, had high and low  state tax revenue dollars per household and business entity with Internet  presence, had high and low percentages of households online, and covered  different urban and rural parts of the country.  We did not intend the eight  states to represent any other states.  In the course of our case studies, state  officials told us how they made the estimates they gave us of tax revenues  collected related to Internet access and how firm these estimates were.

Typically, ISPs market a  package of services that provide homes and businesses with a pathway, or  \u201con-ramp,\u201d to the Internet along with services such as e-mail and instant  messaging.   The ISP sends the user\u2019s Internet traffic forward to a backbone  network where the traffic can be connected to other backbone networks  and carried over long distances.  By contrast, large businesses often  maintain their own internal networks and may buy capacity from access  providers that connect their networks directly to an Internet backbone  network.  We are using the term access providers to include ISPs as well as  providers who sell access to large businesses and other users.  Nonlocal  traffic from both large businesses and ISPs connects to a backbone  provider\u2019s network at a \u201cpoint of presence\u201d (POP).

Ideas for taxation ranged from those that merely extended  existing sales or gross receipts taxes to so-called \u201cbit taxes,\u201d which would  measure Internet usage and tax in proportion to use.  Some state and local  governments raised additional tax revenues and applied existing taxes to  Internet transactions.  Owing to the Internet\u2019s inherently interstate nature  and to issues related to taxing Internet-related activities, concern arose in  Congress as to what impact state and local taxation might have on the  Internet\u2019s growth, and thus, on electronic commerce.  Congress addressed  this concern when, in 1998, it adopted the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which  bars state and local taxes on Internet access, as well as multiple or  discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.", "Internet usage grew rapidly in the years following 1998, and the technology  to access the Internet changed markedly.  Today a significant portion of  users, including home users, access the Internet over broadband  communications services using cable modem, DSL, or wireless  technologies.  Fewer and fewer users rely on dial-up connections through  which they connect to their ISP by dialing a telephone number.  By 2004,  some state tax authorities were taxing DSL service, which they considered  to be a telecommunications service, creating a distinction between DSL  and services offered through other technologies, such as cable modem, that  were not taxed.", "Originally designed to postpone the addition of any new taxes while the  Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce studied the tax issue and  reported to Congress, the moratorium was extended in 2001 for 2 years  and again in 2004, retroactively, to remain in force until November 1, 2007.   The 2001 extension made no other changes to the original act, but the 2004  act included clarifying amendments.  The 2004 act amended language that  had exempted telecommunications services from the moratorium.", "Recognizing state and local concerns about their ability to tax voice  services provided over the Internet, it also contained language allowing  taxation of telephone service using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

First, we reviewed studies of revenue impact done by  CBO, FTA, and the staff of the Multistate Tax Commission and discussed  relevant issues with federal representatives, state and local government  and industry associations, and companies providing Internet access  services.  Then, we used structured interviews to do case studies in eight  states that we chose as described earlier.

The fact that these estimates  represented a small fraction of state tax revenues is consistent with other  information we obtained.  In addition, the enacted legislation was narrower  than what CBO reviewed, meaning that CBO\u2019s stated concerns about VoIP  and taxing providers\u2019 income and assets would have dissipated.", "CBO provided two estimates in 2003 that, when totaled, showed that no  longer allowing grandfathered dial-up and DSL service taxes would cause  state and local governments to lose from more than $160 million to more  than $200 million annually by 2008.  According to a CBO staff member, this  estimate included some amounts for what we are calling acquired services  that, as discussed in the previous section, would not have to be lost.  CBO  provided no estimates of revenues involved for governments not already  assessing the taxes and said it could not estimate the size of any additional  impacts on state and local revenues of the change in the definition of  Internet access.  Further, according to a CBO staff member, CBO\u2019s  estimates did not include any lost revenues from taxes on cable modem  services.  In October 2003, around the time of CBO\u2019s estimates, the number  of cable home Internet connections was 12.6 million, compared to 9.3  million home DSL connections and 38.6 million home dial-up connections.", "CBO first estimated that as many as 10 states and several local  governments would lose $80 million to $120 million annually, beginning in  2007, if the 1998 grandfather clause were repealed.   Its second estimate  showed that, by 2008, state and local governments would likely lose more  than $80 million per year from taxes on DSL service.", "CBO\u2019s estimates resulted from systematic, detailed analyses of information  from state and national sources and involved assumptions to deal with  uncertainties.  In arriving at these estimates, CBO asked each state with  grandfathered taxes for information on how much it collected in taxes  related to access services.  In addition, it estimated each state\u2019s access  service-related taxes by using such data as the number of Internet users in  the state, the average fees that users paid to providers, applicable state tax  rates, expected amounts of dial-up versus broadband usage, and estimates  of possible noncompliance with tax assessments.  See appendix II for  further information on the CBO methodology and associated limitations.   Rather than again doing what CBO had done and gathering information on  all 50 states, we tried to supplement what we learned from CBO by  exploring more in-depth information in case studies of eight states.", "The CBO numbers are a small fraction of total state tax revenue amounts.   For example, the $80 million to $120 million estimate for the states with  originally grandfathered taxes for 2007 was about 0.1 percent of tax  revenues in those states for 2004\u20143 years earlier.", "The fact that CBO estimates are a small part of state tax revenues is  consistent with information we obtained from our state case studies and  interviews with providers.  For instance, after telling us whether various  access-related services, including cable modem service, were subject to  taxation in their jurisdictions, the states collecting taxes gave us rough  estimates of how much access service-related tax revenues they collected  for 2004 for themselves and their localities, if applicable.  (See table 2.)  All  except two collected $10 million or less.  Even the largest state tax amount  reportedly collected in 2004 for Internet access revenues, excluding  collections for localities\u2014$50 million in Texas\u2014was only about one-sixth  of 1 percent of the state\u2019s tax revenues for that year; the largest percentage  for any of our case study states was about 0.2 percent.", "The states made their estimates by assuming, for instance, that access  service-related tax revenues were a certain percentage of state  telecommunications sales tax revenues, by reviewing providers\u2019 returns, or  by making various calculations starting with census data.  Most estimates  provided us were more ballpark approximations than precise  computations, and CBO staff expressed a healthy skepticism toward some  state estimates they received.  They said that the supplemental state-by- state information they developed sometimes produced lower estimates  than the states provided.  According to others knowledgeable in the area,  estimates provided us were imprecise because when companies filed sales  or gross receipts tax returns with states, they did not have to specifically  identify the amount of taxes they received from providing Internet access- related services to retail consumers or to other providers.  As discussed  earlier, sales to other providers remain subject to taxation, depending on  state law.  Some providers told us they did not keep records in such a way  as to be able to readily provide that kind of information.  Also, although  states reviewed tax compliance by auditing taxpayers, they could not audit  all providers.", "The dollar amounts in table 2 include amounts, where provided, for local  governments within the states.  For instance, Kansas\u2019s total includes about  $2 million for localities and North Dakota\u2019s about $400,000 for localities.  In  these states as well as in others we studied, local jurisdictions were  piggybacking on the state taxes, although the local tax rates could differ  from each other.  For example, according to a state official, in Kansas the  state tax was 5.3 percent, and the state collected an average of another 1.3  percent for local jurisdictions.  While we did encounter localities outside  our case study states that taxed access services under their own authority,  almost all the collections for local jurisdictions that we came across were  amounts collected by the states that were sent back to the localities.", "State tax officials from our case study states who commented to us on the  impacts of the revenue amounts did not consider them significant.   Similarly, state officials voiced concerns but did not cite nondollar specifics  when describing any possible impact on their state finances arising from no  longer taxing Internet access services.  However, one noted that taking  away Internet access as a source of revenue was another step in the  erosion of the state\u2019s tax base.  Other state and local officials observed  that if taxation of Internet access were eliminated, the state or locality  would have to act somehow to continue meeting its requirement for a  balanced budget.  At the local level, officials told us that a revenue decrease  would reduce the amount of road maintenance that could be done or could  adversely affect the number of employees available for providing  government services.", "Because of the provisions in the enacted 2004 law, some unquantified  revenue losses noted by CBO in its 2003 study that could have grown to be  large no longer seem to pose the threat that some feared.  For example,  CBO mentioned the possibility of state and local governments being unable  to tax customers\u2019 telephone calls over the Internet.  However, as enacted,  the 2004 amendments differed from the version reviewed by CBO and  contained language excluding Internet-based telephone service, known as  VoIP, from the moratorium.", "In addition, CBO expressed concern that providers could bundle products  containing content, such as books and movies, call the product Internet  access, and have the whole bundle be exempt from taxes.  Although some  people we interviewed still feared bundled content and information might  become tax free, they and others indicated they were aware of no court  cases in which this argument has been asserted.", "The 2004 amendments also included a provision specifically allowing states  to tax Internet providers\u2019 net income, capital stock, net worth, or property  value, addressing another concern raised by some parties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Timing of Moratorium Might Have Precluded Many States from Taxing Access Services, with Unclear Revenue Implications", "paragraphs": ["Because it is difficult to predict what states would have done to tax  Internet access services had Congress not intervened when it did, it is hard  to estimate the amount of revenue that was not raised because of the  moratorium.   For instance, at the time the first moratorium was being  considered in 1998, the Department of Commerce reported Internet  connections for less than a fifth of U.S. households, much less than the half  of U.S. households reported 6 years later.  Access was typically dial-up.  As  states and localities saw the level of Internet connections rising and other  technologies becoming available, they might have taxed access services if  no moratorium had been in place.  Taxes could have taken different forms.   For example, jurisdictions might have even adopted bit taxes based on the  volume of digital information transmitted.", "The number of states collecting taxes on access services when the first  moratorium was being considered in early 1998 was relatively small, with  13 states and the District of Columbia collecting these taxes, according to  the Congressional Research Service.  Five of those jurisdictions later  eliminated or chose not to enforce their tax.  In addition, not all 37 other  states would have taxed access services related to the Internet even if they  could have.  For example, California had already passed its own Internet  tax moratorium in August 1998.", "Still, after the moratorium began, other states showed an interest in taxing  Internet access services.  Although the 1998 act precluded those  jurisdictions from taxing Internet access, it included language stating that  access services did not include telecommunications services.  States  seeking to take advantage of this provision taxed parts of DSL service they  considered a telecommunications service and not an Internet access  service.  If taxing DSL service shows a desire to tax access services in  general, many states not taxing dial-up or cable modem service might  have done so but for the moratorium.", "Given that some states never taxed access services while relatively few  Internet connections existed, that some stopped taxing access services,  and that others taxed DSL service, it is unclear what jurisdictions would  have done if no moratorium had existed.

The tax used might  be generally applicable to a variety of goods and services, as in Kansas,  which did not impose a separate tax on communications services.  There,  the state\u2019s general sales tax applied to the purchase of communications  services by access providers at an average rate of 6.6 percent, combining  state and average local tax rates.  As another example, North Dakota  imposed a sales tax on retail consumers\u2019 communications services,  including Internet access services, at an average state and local combined  rate of 6 percent.  Rhode Island charged a 5 percent tax on companies\u2019  telecommunications gross receipts.", "Our case study states showed little consistency in the base they taxed in  taxing services related to Internet access.  States imposed taxes on  different transactions and populations.  North Dakota and Texas taxed only  services delivered to retail consumers.  In a type of transaction which, as  discussed earlier, we do not view as subject to the moratorium, Kansas and  Mississippi taxed acquired communications services purchased by access  providers.  Ohio and Rhode Island taxed both the provision of access  services and acquired services, and California and Virginia officials told us  their states taxed neither.  States also provided various exemptions from  their taxes.  Ohio exempted residential consumers, but not businesses,  from its tax on access services, and Texas exempted the first $25 of  monthly Internet access service charges from taxation.", "Some state and local officials and company representatives held different  opinions about whether certain taxes were grandfathered and about  whether the moratorium applied in various circumstances.  For example,  some providers\u2019 officials questioned whether taxes in North Dakota,  Wisconsin, and certain cities in Colorado were grandfathered, and whether  those jurisdictions were permitted to continue taxing.  Providers disagreed  among themselves about how to comply with the tax law of states whose  taxes may or may not have been grandfathered.  Some providers told us  they collected and remitted taxes to the states even when they were  uncertain whether these actions were necessary; however, they told us of  others that did not make payments to the taxing states in similarly  uncertain situations.  In its 2003 work, CBO had said that some companies  challenged the applicability of Internet access taxes to the service they  provided and thus might not have been collecting or remitting them even  though the states believed they should.", "Because of all these state-by-state differences and uncertainties, the impact  of future changes related to the moratorium would vary by state.

A broader view of what could be  included in Internet access bundles would result in potential revenue  losses much greater than we indicated.  However, as explained in appendix  I, we believe that what is bundled must be reasonably related to accessing  and using the Internet.  FTA officials were also concerned that our reading  of the 1998 law regarding the taxation of DSL services is debatable and  suggests that states overreached by taxing them.

Parties seeking to carve  out exceptions that could be taxed had sought to break out and treat DSL  services as telecommunications services, claiming the services were  exempt from the moratorium even though they were bundled as part of an  Internet access package.  State and local tax authorities began taxing DSL  service, creating a distinction between DSL and services offered using  other technologies, such as cable modem service, a competing method of  providing Internet access that was not to be taxed.  The 2004 amendment  was aimed at making sure that DSL service bundled with access could not  be taxed.

E.g.  Hartford Underwriter Insurance Co. v. Union Planers Bank, N.A., 530  U.S. 1 (2000); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  Singer, 2A  Sutherland Statutory Construction, \u00a7\u00a7 46:1, 48A:11, 15-16.  Thus, under the  plain meaning rule, the primary means for Congress to express its intent is  the words it enacts into law and interpretations of the statute should rely  upon and flow from the language of the statute. \u201cThe term \u2018Internet access\u2019 means a service that enables users to access content,  information, electronic mail, or other services offered over the Internet\u2026.The term  \u201cInternet access\u201d does not include telecommunications services, except to the extent such  services are purchased, used, or sold by a provider of Internet access to provide internet  access.\u201d  Section 1105(5).", "The language added in 2004--exempting from \u201ctelecommunications  services\u201d those services that are \u201cpurchased, used, or sold\u201d by a provider in  offering Internet access--has been read by some as expanding the \u201cInternet  access\u201d to which the tax moratorium applies, by barring taxes on \u201cacquired  services.\u201d   Those who would read the moratorium expansively take the  view that everything acquired by Internet service providers (ISP)  (everything on the left side of figure 3) as well as everything furnished by  them (everything in the middle of figure 3) is exempt from tax.", "In our view, the language and structure of the statute do not permit the  expansive reading noted above.  \u201cInternet access\u201d was originally defined  and continues to be defined for purposes of the moratorium as the service  of providing Internet access to a user.  Section 1105(5).  It is this  transaction, between the Internet provider and the end user, which is  nontaxable under the terms of the moratorium.  The portion of the  definition that was amended in 2004 was the exception:  that is,  telecommunication services are excluded from nontaxable \u201cInternet  access,\u201d except to the extent such services are \u201cpurchased, used, or sold by  a provider of Internet access to provide Internet access.\u201d  Thus, we  conclude that the fact that services are \u201cpurchased, used, or sold\u201d by an  Internet provider has meaning only in determining whether these services  can still qualify for the moratorium notwithstanding that they are  \u201ctelecommunications services;\u201d it does not mean that such services are  independently nontaxable irrespective of whether they are part of the  service an Internet provider offers to an end user.  Rather, a service that is  \u201cpurchased, used, or sold\u201d to provide Internet access is not taxable only if it  is part of providing the service of Internet access to the end user.  Such  services can be part of the provision of Internet access by a provider who,  for example, \u201cpurchases\u201d a service for the purpose of bundling it as part of  an Internet access offering; \u201cuses\u201d a service it owns or has acquired for that  purpose; or simply \u201csells\u201d owned or acquired services as part of its Internet  access bundle.", "In addition, we read the amended exception as applying only to services  that are classified as telecommunications services under the 1998 act as  amended.  In fact, the moratorium defines the term \u201ctelecommunications  services\u201d with reference to its definition in the Communications Act of  1934, under which DSL and cable modem service are no longer classified  as telecommunications services.  Moreover, under the Communications  Act, the term telecommunications services applies to the delivery of  services to the end user who determines the content to be communicated;  it does not apply to communications services delivered to access service  providers by others in the chain of facilities through which Internet traffic  may pass.  Thus, since broadband services are not telecommunications  services, the exception in the 1998 act does not apply to them, and they are  not affected by the exception.", "The best evidence of statutory intent is the text of the statute itself.  While  legislative history can be useful in shedding light on the intent of the statute  or to resolve ambiguities, it is not to be used to inject ambiguity into the  statutory language or to rewrite the statute.  E.g., Shannon v. United States  512 U.S. 573, 583 (1994).  In our view, the definition of Internet access is  unambiguous, and, therefore, it is unnecessary to look beyond the statute  to discern its meaning from legislative history.  We note, however, that  consistent with our interpretation of the statute, the overarching thrust of  changes made by the 2004 amendments to the definition of Internet access  was to take remedial correction to assure that broadband services such as  DSL were not taxable when bundled with an ISP\u2019s offering.  While there are  some references in the legislative history to \u201cwholesale\u201d services,  backbone, and broadband, many of these pertained to earlier versions of  the bill containing language different from that which was ultimately  enacted.  The language that was enacted, using the phrase \u201cpurchased,  used, or sold by a provider of Internet access\u201d was added through the  adoption of a substitute offered by Senator McCain, 150 Cong. Rec. S4402,  which was adopted following cloture and agreement to several  amendments designed to narrow differences between proponents and  opponents of the bill.  Changes to legislative language during the  consideration of a bill may support an inference that in enacting the final  language, Congress intended to reject or work a compromise with respect  to earlier versions of the bill.  Statements made about earlier versions carry  little weight.  Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 255-56 (1994).    Singer, 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction, \u00a7 48:4.

First, it collected information directly from the states.

It then reduced the state loss estimates by  various percentages to get a sense of the ranges possible by assuming, for  instance, that providers were not always paying the taxes states thought  they should pay.", "To estimate from a second direction, CBO compiled its own state-by-state  information.  It multiplied the number of Internet users by state times an  average access fee for each user times the state\u2019s applicable tax rate.  It  then discounted each state total based on assumptions about  noncompliance with tax assessments.", "To arrive at the number of users, according to CBO staff, CBO consulted  the Department of Commerce, the Federal Communications Commission,  and studies of Internet usage.  From these sources, it obtained historical  numbers of users and trends that it could project showing the number of  users growing over time, and how usage was changing between dial-up and  high-speed.", "Finally, according to the staff members, CBO gathered the other  information for its state-by-state estimate from other sources.  It obtained  state tax rates from Council on State Taxation information and computed a  weighted average access fee after calling access providers about their  current rates.  It assumed that any change in revenues brought on by  changes in technology and markets would offset each other.  It estimated  noncompliance to cover both tax avoidance and nexus issues by using  indications it had of certain Internet service providers not paying an access  tax, considering their market share, and assuming various percentages of  tax not being paid.", "CBO considered information from both the approaches it was using to get a  range for each state.  It used these estimates to produce the part of its  analysis that it could quantify--the nationwide range of $80 million to   $120 million beginning in 2007 for states with originally grandfathered  taxes and more than $80 million per year by 2008 for the states taxing DSL.   CBO did not give point estimates or ranges for specific states, an  appropriate choice given the uncertainties in the methodologies used.
