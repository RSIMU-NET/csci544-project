This report examines the extent to which EM (1) tracks the milestones in cleanup agreements for EM's cleanup sites; (2) has met, missed, or postponed cleanup-related milestones at selected sites and how EM reports information; and (3) has analyzed why milestones are missed or postponed and how EM considers those reasons when renegotiating milestones.", "GAO reviewed agreements and milestones at EM's 16 cleanup sites and compared information tracked by EM headquarters and these sites; interviewed officials from four selected sites (chosen for variation in location and scope of cleanup, among other factors); and reviewed EM guidance related to milestone negotiations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The cleanup process at the 16 sites overseen by the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) is governed by 72 agreements and hundreds of milestones specifying actions EM is to take as it carries out its cleanup work. However, EM headquarters and site officials do not consistently track data on the milestones. EM headquarters and site officials provided GAO with different totals on the number of milestones in place at the four sites GAO selected for review. These discrepancies result from how headquarters and selected sites define and track milestones. First, not all sites make the same distinction between major (i.e., related to on-the-ground cleanup) and non-major milestones and, as a result, are not consistently reporting the same milestones to EM headquarters. Second, sites do not consistently provide EM headquarters with the most up-to-date information on the status of milestones at each site. These inconsistencies limit EM's ability to use milestones to manage the cleanup mission and monitor its progress.", "EM does not accurately track met, missed, or postponed cleanup-related milestones at the four selected sites, and EM's milestone reporting to Congress is incomplete. EM sites renegotiate milestone dates before they are missed, and EM does not track the history of these changes. This is because once milestones change, sites are not required to maintain or track the original milestone dates. GAO has previously found that without a documented and consistently-applied schedule change control process, program staff may continually revise the schedule to match performance, hindering management's insight into the true performance of the project. Further, since 2011, EM has not consistently reported to Congress on the status of the milestones each year, as required, and the information it has reported is incomplete. EM reports the most recently renegotiated milestone dates with no indication of whether or how often those milestones have been missed or postponed. Since neither EM headquarters nor the sites track renegotiated milestones and their baseline dates at the sites, milestones do not provide a reliable measure of program performance.", "EM officials at headquarters and selected sites have not conducted root cause analyses on missed or postponed milestones; thus, such analyses are not part of milestone negotiations. Specifically, EM has not done a complex-wide analysis of the reasons for missed or postponed milestones. Similarly, officials GAO interviewed at the four selected sites said that they were not aware of any site-wide review of why milestones were missed or postponed. Best practices for project and program management outlined in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide note the importance of identifying root causes of problems that lead to schedule delays. Additionally, in a 2015 directive, DOE emphasized the importance of conducting such analysis. Analyzing the root causes of missed or postponed milestones would better position EM to address systemic problems and consider those problems when renegotiating milestones with regulators. Without such analysis, EM and its cleanup regulators lack information to set more realistic and achievable milestones and, as a result, future milestones are likely to continue to be pushed back, further delaying the cleanup work. As GAO has reported previously, these delays lead to increases in the overall cost of the cleanup."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that EM establish a standard definition of milestones across the cleanup sites, track and report original and renegotiated milestone dates, and identify the root causes of why milestones are missed or postponed.

These liabilities have grown  substantially despite DOE spending roughly $6 billion annually on its  cleanup program. The waste is primarily a result of decades of producing  material for the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program and can pose risks to  human health and the environment. The waste consists of millions of  gallons of radioactive waste in underground storage tanks, thousands of  tons of spent (used) nuclear fuel and special nuclear material, large  volumes of transuranic and mixed low level waste, and huge quantities of  contaminated soil and water. At many of its sites, DOE has had difficulty  making significant progress on the cleanup, particularly for the most  dangerous wastes and at sites with the most challenging cleanup work.  Because of the large and expanding estimated costs of cleaning up these  sites, in 2017, we designated the federal government\u2019s environmental  liabilities\u2014more than 80 percent of which pertain to DOE\u2014as a new high- risk area. In January 2019, we noted that the estimated cost to complete  the cleanup was likely to increase.", "DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management (EM) is responsible for  managing DOE\u2019s cleanup program and overseeing the contractors that  carry out the cleanup work at EM\u2019s sites.

EM\u2019s cleanup work  has been implemented under cleanup agreements negotiated between  DOE sites and federal and state regulatory agencies, such as the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state environmental  protection agencies. EM uses milestones\u2014dates by which certain tasks  are to be completed\u2014as a tool for managing and tracking progress on  site cleanup, along with earned value management systems and  performance metrics. EM also reports to Congress on the status of these  milestones and bases its annual request for cleanup funding in part on  the need to meet site milestones. However, in 1995 and 2002, for  example, we reported that milestones, as developed and used by DOE,  were not a good measure of EM\u2019s cleanup progress and recommended  that DOE set national cleanup priorities and renegotiate milestones based  on those priorities. In 2015, an independent review found that the use of  cleanup agreements negotiated by individual EM sites, rather than a more  centralized approach, sometimes caused EM to focus its scarce  resources on outdated milestones and lower-priority risks to human  health and the environment.", "You asked us to review EM\u2019s cleanup agreements that set requirements  and milestones for EM\u2019s cleanup approach at its 16 sites and how EM  has performed in meeting those milestones historically.

We selected these sites to ensure  diversity in (1) geographic location, (2) the responsible DOE agency (EM  is responsible for the cleanup at the 16 sites, but the National Nuclear  Security Administration oversees five of the sites), (3) the size of the  annual cleanup budget (selecting both large and small budgets), and (4)  the size of the total environmental liability (selecting both large and small  liabilities). Findings from these sites cannot be generalized to sites that  we did not include in our review. From each of the selected sites, we collected EM\u2019s public reports on historical and current data on the number  and status of milestones and reviewed, analyzed, and summarized this  information. We reviewed DOE\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy and associated  policies and procedures and met with officials from each of the sites in the  sample to find out more about site efforts to track how often milestones  had been met, missed, or postponed. To evaluate how EM reported this  information, we compared DOE\u2019s 2012 and 2017 reports to Congress and  EM\u2019s internal milestone reporting systems at headquarters and the sites.  We also compared EM\u2019s reporting against the requirement to report to  Congress and best practices for project schedules.", "To evaluate the extent to which EM has analyzed why milestones are  missed or postponed, we interviewed EM headquarters and site officials.

In  1989, EM began carrying out activities around the complex to clean up,  contain, safely store, and dispose of these materials. Starting at about  the same time, DOE documents indicate that EM and state and federal  regulators entered into numerous cleanup agreements that defined the  scope of cleanup work and established dates for coming into compliance  with applicable environmental laws. EM has spent more than $170 billion  since it began its cleanup program, but its most challenging and costly  cleanup work remains, according to EM documents.", "The processes that govern the cleanup at EM\u2019s nuclear waste sites are  complicated, involving multiple laws, agencies, and administrative steps.  EM\u2019s cleanup responsibilities derive from different laws, including  CERCLA, RCRA, the Atomic Energy Act, and state hazardous waste  laws. Federal facility agreements, compliance orders, and other  compliance agreements also govern this cleanup.", "Federal facility agreements are generally enforceable agreements that  DOE enters into with EPA and affected states under CERCLA and  applicable state laws. For each federal facility listed on the National  Priorities List, EPA\u2019s list of seriously contaminated sites, section 120 of  CERCLA requires the relevant federal agency to enter into an interagency  agreement with EPA for the completion of all necessary cleanup actions  at the facility. The interagency agreement must include, among other  things, the selection of the cleanup action and schedule for its completion.  Interagency agreement provisions can be renegotiated, as necessary, to  incorporate new information, adjust schedules, and address changing  conditions.", "States generally issue federal facility compliance orders to DOE under  RCRA and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act. RCRA prohibits the  treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste without a permit from  EPA or a state that EPA has authorized to implement and enforce a  hazardous waste management program. Under the Federal Facilities  Compliance Act, federal agencies are subject to state hazardous waste  laws and state enforcement actions, including compliance orders. RCRA  regulations establish detailed and often waste-specific requirements for  the management and disposal of hazardous wastes, including the  hazardous waste component of mixed waste. Tri-party agreements  among DOE, EPA, and the relevant state often serve as both a federal  facility agreement and a compliance order.", "In addition to federal facility agreements, other types of agreements  governing cleanup at specific sites may also be in place, including  administrative compliance orders, court-ordered agreements, and  settlement agreements. Administrative compliance orders are orders from  state agencies enforcing state hazardous waste management laws.  Court-ordered agreements result from lawsuits initiated primarily by  states. Settlement agreements are agreements between parties that end  a legal dispute.", "These agreements may include milestones\u2014dates by which DOE  commits to plan and carry out its cleanup work at the sites. DOE has  identified two different types of milestones: enforceable and planning  milestones. Generally, an enforceable milestone has a fixed, mandatory  due date, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, whereas a  planning milestone is not enforceable and usually represents a  placeholder or shorter term of work. In this report, we are examining any  enforceable milestone that derives from either federal facility agreements  or other compliance agreements.", "EM manages its cleanup program based on internal guidance, on  milestone commitments to regulators, and in consultation with a variety of  stakeholders.

However,  milestone information that EM headquarters and site officials shared with  us was not consistent. For example, for milestones due in fiscal years  2018 through 2020, officials at EM headquarters identified 135  enforceable cleanup milestones at the four selected sites, which was less  than half of the number of such milestones officials at those sites reported  to us (see table 2).", "These discrepancies result from how headquarters and selected sites  define and track milestones.", "Milestone definitions. EM headquarters officials said that they are  primarily concerned with milestones related to on-the-ground cleanup;  that is, cleanup activities that actually result in waste being removed,  treated, or disposed of. EM officials said they consider these to be  major milestones.

For example, officials at the Savannah River Site track  milestones in a federal facility agreement that lists 79 milestones due  in fiscal years 2018 through 2020. This agreement makes no  distinction between major and non-major milestones and includes  administrative activities, such as revisions to cleanup reports, in its  milestone totals. EM headquarters officials, on the other hand, do not  include these activities as major milestones and list only 43  milestones due in the same time frame.

Sites do not consistently  provide EM headquarters with the most up-to-date information on the  status of milestones at each site. This is because EM requirements  governing the submission of milestone information do not specify  when or how often sites are to update this information, so sites have  the discretion to choose when to send updated milestone data to  headquarters. As a result, the information on the list of milestones  used to track cleanup performance by EM headquarters may differ  from the more up-to-date information kept by the sites. For example,  officials at each of the four sites we examined stated that they try to  send updated information on the status of milestones to headquarters  on an annual basis, though they sometimes send it less frequently.  Officials at EM headquarters acknowledged that their list of  milestones is not always up-to-date because of the lag between when  a milestone changes at the site and when sites update that  information in the EM headquarters\u2019 database.", "In addition to inconsistencies in tracking and defining milestones, lists of  milestones maintained by EM headquarters and the four selected sites  may not include all cleanup milestones governing the cleanup work at the  site. We found two cases in which permits at two sites included  milestones that neither EM headquarters nor site officials included in their  list of sites\u2019 cleanup milestones. For example, milestones related to a  major construction project at one of the selected sites we reviewed\u2014 Savannah River\u2014are not listed in either EM headquarters\u2019 or the  Savannah River Site\u2019s list of enforceable milestones. According to South  Carolina state environmental officials, milestones associated with this  project are part of a separate permit and dispute resolution agreement not  connected to the federal facility agreement or one of the sites\u2019 compliance  agreements. Recently, DOE acknowledged in its fiscal year 2019 budget  request that this project has faced technical challenges, and officials  noted that the previously agreed-upon start date for operating this project  would be delayed. However, this milestone and its delay are not included  in either EM headquarters\u2019 or Savannah River\u2019s list of milestones.  Similarly, officials at the Hanford Site said that some milestones  governing Hanford\u2019s cleanup are part of the site wide RCRA permit  issued by the state, which is separate from its federal facility agreement,  and, as a result, officials do not track this information in the same Hanford  milestone tracking system and do not report it to EM headquarters.", "EM does not have a standard definition of milestones for either sites or  headquarters to use for reporting and monitoring cleanup milestones or  guidance on how often sites should update the status of milestones. EM  headquarters officials cited guidance that sites can refer to when entering  their milestone data into the headquarters-managed database. This  guidance addresses how to submit milestone data but does not include a  definition of milestones or specify how often sites should update the  information. EM headquarters officials noted that sites have the  discretion to input milestones as they choose. EM\u2019s lack of a standard  definition of milestones limits management\u2019s ability to use milestones to  manage EM\u2019s cleanup mission and monitor its progress. We have  previously found that poorly defined, incomplete, or missing requirements  make it difficult to hold projects accountable, result in programs or  projects that do not meet user needs, and can result in cost and schedule  growth. In addition, according to Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, information and communication are vital for an  entity to achieve its objectives.  According to these standards, the first  principle of information and communication is that management should  define the information requirements at the relevant level and the requisite  specificity for appropriate personnel.

For example, at the Savannah River Site, both DOE and  South Carolina officials said they could not recall any missed milestones  among the thousands of milestones completed since the cleanup began.  Similarly, Hanford officials told us that since the beginning of the cleanup  effort in 1989, more than 1,300 milestones had been completed and only  62 had actually been missed because, in most cases, whenever  milestones were at risk of being missed, they were renegotiated.  However, officials at these sites could not provide us with the exact  number of times milestones had been renegotiated. This is because once  milestones are changed, sites are not required to maintain or track the  original milestones.

First, the plans contain no indication of whether  each milestone date reported is the original date for that milestone or  whether or how many times the milestones listed have been missed  or postponed. Instead, the plans report the latest (and most recently  renegotiated) dates for the milestones without listing the original dates  or acknowledging that some of the milestones have been delayed, in  some cases by several years, beyond their original agreed-upon  completion dates. For example, we found that at least 14 milestones  from the 2012 plan were repeated in the 2017 plan with new  forecasted completion dates, but the 2017 plan gave no indication that  these milestones had been postponed (see table 3). The milestones\u2019  due dates had been pushed back by as many as 6 years without any  indication in the 2017 report that they were delayed. As noted above,  EM headquarters does not track changes to milestones and EM  officials at both headquarters and the sites said that they have not  historically kept a record of the original baseline dates for renegotiated  milestones they change.

The benefits of doing  so include developing a better understanding of the factors that caused  milestones to be missed and providing agencies with information to more  effectively address those factors in the future. In addition, DOE has  recently emphasized the importance of doing this kind of analysis. In  2015, DOE issued a directive requiring sites to do a root cause analysis  when the project team, program office, or independent oversight offices  determine that a project has breached its cost or schedule thresholds.

However, as previously noted in this report,  missing or postponing milestones is a systemic problem across the  cleanup complex that makes it difficult for DOE to accurately identify  cleanup performance shortcomings. Because EM has not analyzed why it  has missed or postponed milestones, EM cannot address these systemic  problems and consider those problems when renegotiating milestones  with regulators. Without such analysis, EM and its cleanup regulators  lack information to set more realistic and achievable milestones and, as a  result, future milestones are likely to continue to be pushed back, further  delaying the cleanup work. As we have reported previously, these delays  lead to increases in the overall cost of the cleanup."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government faces a large and growing future environmental  liability, the vast majority of which is related to the cleanup of radioactive  and hazardous waste at DOE\u2019s 16 sites around the country. EM has  responsibility for addressing the human health and environmental risks  presented by this contamination in the most cost-effective way. However,  most of EM\u2019s largest projects are significantly delayed and over budget,  and state regulators for nearly all of EM\u2019s cleanup sites have responded  by initiating enforcement actions, often leading to additional agreements,  including administrative orders and court settlements, in addition to initial  federal facility agreements to ensure those risks are addressed.", "EM relies on cleanup milestones, among other metrics, to measure the  overall performance of its operations activities, and EM reports that very  few of its cleanup milestones over the past 2 decades have been missed.  However, EM\u2019s self-reported performance in achieving milestones does  not provide an accurate view of actual progress in cleaning up sites. EM  has not established clear definitions for tracking and reporting milestones  and does not have any requirements governing the way sites are to  update milestone information. As a result, EM\u2019s internal tracking of these  milestones has inconsistencies. Additionally, since the requirement to  annually report on the status of milestones was set in 2011, EM has  produced only two reports to Congress, and these were inaccurate and  incomplete. Without a clear and consistent approach to collecting and  reporting this data, including the history of milestone changes, EM cannot  accurately use milestones for managing and measuring the performance  of its cleanup program. The absence of reliable and complete information  on the progress of EM\u2019s cleanup mission also limits EM\u2019s and Congress\u2019s  ability to oversee the cleanup work. In addition, without a root cause  analysis of why milestones are missed or postponed, EM and its cleanup  regulators lack information to set more realistic and achievable  milestones. As a result, future milestones are likely to continue to be  pushed back, further delaying the cleanup work, which will likely increase  cleanup costs and risks to human health and the environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to DOE:  The Assistant Secretary of DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management  should update EM\u2019s policies and procedures to establish a standard  definition of milestones and specify requirements for both including and  updating information on milestones across the complex.

DOE stated that these policy-driven reforms can  improve the efficiency of milestone tracking.", "Regarding the recommendation that DOE track changes to cleanup  milestones, the agency agreed with the recommendation. DOE stated  that EM currently monitors milestone status, including changes as the  need for changes are identified and as part of its ongoing  communication with field offices, and therefore DOE considers the  recommendation to be closed. However, as we noted in the report,  neither EM headquarters nor the sites track the original baseline  schedule for renegotiated milestone dates. We adjusted the language  of the recommendation to make clear that the EM Assistant Secretary  should track original milestone dates as well as changes to cleanup  milestones. DOE stated in its written comments that EM does not  believe that tracking original and changed milestones will strengthen  EM's ability to use milestones to manage and measure the  performance of its cleanup program. However, as we noted in this  report, according to best practices identified in GAO's schedule  assessment guide, agencies should formally establish a baseline  schedule against which performance can be measured. We have  found that, without a documented and consistently-applied schedule  change control process, program staff may continually revise the  schedule to match performance, hindering management's insight into  the true performance of the project. In addition, DOE's internal project  management policies call for steps to maintain a change control  process, including setting a baseline schedule for completing certain  activities and maintaining a record of any subsequent deviations from  that baseline.", "Regarding our recommendation that DOE comply with the  requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act by reporting  annually to Congress on the status of its cleanup milestones and  including a complete list of cleanup milestones for all sites required by  the act, the agency partially agreed with the recommendation. DOE  stated that additional budget and clarification of purpose and scope  would be required to fulfill this recommendation. As we point out in our  report, DOE has not fully complied with requirements established by  the act, including not submitting all required annual reports and, even  when DOE did submit these reports, its reporting omitted information  about some sites. DOE stated that EM is reviewing options to address  this recommendation.", "Regarding our recommendation that DOE conduct root cause  analyses of performance shortcomings that lead to missed or  postponed milestones, the agency agreed with the recommendation  and stated that EM is evaluating options to implement it. However,  DOE stated that there may be multiple reasons why milestones are  changed, and not all of the changes are due to DOE performance.

We agree, and the report states that it is  common for regulators and sites to renegotiate milestones before sites  miss them. DOE also disagreed with the draft report\u2019s characterization of  the coordination between EM sites and headquarters in tracking  milestones. In particular, DOE\u2019s written comments state that site-specific  databases include all regulatory compliance milestones drawn from  applicable agreements, while the headquarters database tracks major  enforceable milestones. However, as our report notes, because not all  sites make the same distinction between major and non-major  milestones, sites are not consistently reporting the same types of  milestones to EM headquarters. In addition, DOE\u2019s written comments  state that EM sites and headquarters routinely collaborate and discuss  the status of milestones via meetings and EM periodically requests that  sites verify the data in the EM headquarters database. Nevertheless, as  our report notes, EM requirements governing the submission of milestone  information do not specify when or how often sites are to update this  information.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Energy, and other interested parties.
