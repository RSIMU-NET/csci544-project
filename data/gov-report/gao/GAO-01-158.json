GAO identified several opportunities for improvement. In some areas, such as with the volunteer assistance programs and the assistance provided by IRS' walk-in sites and area distribution centers, the opportunities centered around performance measures. In those areas, it was not easy to assess the agency's performance because either IRS lacked good measures or there were problems with the data behind the measures. Other improvement opportunities centered around management oversight-the kind of oversight that would enhance the level of service provided by better ensuring that (1) training materials and computer equipment were delivered to the volunteer assistance sites on time and in working condition and (2) data being entered on the website by various IRS offices are current and consistent."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to your request, this report assesses IRS\u2019 performance during the 2000 tax filing season.

At the time that we prepared our June report, IRS had identified four system-related problems that affected relatively few individual taxpayers. IRS officials said that they had (1) corrected the four problems, (2) taken or were taking action to mitigate the effects on taxpayers, and (3) notified individuals affected by two of the four problems. One reason IRS officials cited for not always notifying affected individuals was that IRS could not quickly generate correspondence to address the problem. In preparing this report, we followed up with IRS officials about the potential impact of systems modernization on IRS\u2019 ability to more quickly notify taxpayers. They told us that systems modernization may enable IRS to more quickly develop customized taxpayer correspondence to address specific problems but may not reduce the time involved in identifying taxpayers affected by the problems because IRS still would need to develop unique software programs for that purpose.", "After we completed our audit work for the June 2000 report, IRS officials told us of a fifth system-related problem.

Some of the decline was attributed to (1) IRS\u2019 unrealistic assumptions about the implementation and impact of its changes and (2) other problems it had in managing staff training and scheduling and implementing new technology. As shown in table 4, IRS improved its level of service in 2000 by answering 28.2 million of the 45.7 million call attempts that taxpayers made from January 1 to April 29, 2000\u2014a 62-percent level of service.

However, three factors adversely affected the usefulness of the timeliness data.", "First, even though IRS required that timeliness data be reported to the National Office, it did not specify what percentage of the time sites were to meet the 15- and 30-minute wait-time goals. The Southeast Region established its own goal, which called for districts in that region to meet the wait-time goals 90 percent of the time. According to Southeast regional analysts we talked with during the filing season, most of the nine districts in that region were meeting or exceeding the 90-percent goal. The analysts said that some districts were experiencing problems meeting the wait-time goals because of an unanticipated increase in the number of taxpayers visiting the walk-in sites for return preparation.", "Second, wait times at most walk-in sites were computed manually, which made the results more prone to error. To enable more accurate tracking of wait times, IRS has installed an automated wait-time tracking system known as Q-Matic at some walk-in sites. During the 2000 filing season, 76 (or 18 percent) of IRS\u2019 417 walk-in sites had that system. As customers arrive at walk-in sites with the Q-Matic system, they are to obtain a numbered ticket from the Q-Matic ticket printer. The ticket reflects the estimated wait time for the service, and the system automatically \u201ccalls\u201d the customer when it is his or her turn. The system records the time that a customer received a ticket and the time that an assistor started helping the customer. Non-Q-Matic sites used manual systems to record wait times. At some of those sites, a greeter or receptionist was to record on a taxpayer contact card the time that the taxpayer arrived, and an assistor was to record on the same card the time that he or she started to fill out a sign-in sheet. Other non-Q-Matic sites relied on greeters or taxpayers to fill out a sign-in sheet.", "A third factor that affected the usefulness of wait-time data reported by the regional offices, according to a cognizant IRS official, was the use of different reporting formats by the regions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Did Not Adequately Measure Customer Satisfaction at Walk-In Sites", "paragraphs": ["IRS conducted a customer satisfaction survey at all walk-in sites in January 2000 and every fifth week thereafter, which amounted to 1 week during each month of the filing season.

However, the latter measure does not provide a reliable basis for judging how well IRS met its 10-day goal because the measure (1) does not track order-filling time from when IRS received the order, only from when an order was assigned a \u201cpicking\u201d number for processing, and (2) reflects turnaround time only for inventory on hand and not for forms or publications that were out of stock and, thus, had to be backordered. Regarding backorders, there were several significant stockouts during the 2000 filing season, involving such documents as Form W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement) and Publication 596 (Earned Income Credit).", "IRS data for January through April, 2000, also indicated that taxpayers had an easier time accessing the toll-free forms-ordering telephone line than they did accessing the three customer service-related telephone lines previously discussed.

The 5.3 million call attempts represented a significant decrease from the 7.0 million call attempts during the same 4 months in 1999. The decrease in call attempts, like the decrease in orders filled shown in table 5, could indicate that more taxpayers are using other sources, such as IRS\u2019 Web site, to obtain needed forms and publications.", "On a related matter, a recent IRS study found that when taxpayers called the toll-free forms-ordering telephone number, they were not told how long it could take to receive the form or publication until after the order was placed. The study concluded that this procedure could cause wasted IRS effort and increased taxpayer burden if taxpayers, after placing their order on the telephone and being told the delivery time, decided to go to a walk-in site to get the material rather than wait for the material to be sent by mail. The study recommended that IRS rearrange its forms telephone menu and advise its assistors to tell taxpayers at the beginning of the call how long it generally takes to receive IRS forms ordered over the telephone. Doing so would allow taxpayers to terminate the call immediately if the wait time is unacceptable to meet their needs. When we asked whether they had implemented this recommendation, cognizant IRS officials said that they had not. They explained that providing the information at the beginning of the call could be very awkward because assistors do not know (1) what the call is about and (2) what the taxpayer is ordering. The officials stated that, depending on the product and time of the year, the order time may change (e.g., due to products not being available or being on backorder).", "However, between April 1 and 15, IRS officials did institute two automated messages on the forms-ordering line that were to come on when a caller was put on hold because all of the assistors were occupied. The messages stated that it could take up to 10 days for the caller to receive his or her order, and that the caller may want to ask the assistor for alternate ways of obtaining forms. However, these messages were operational only when the forms operators were on duty, which was 7 days a week, 12 hours a day.

Except for a few relatively minor glitches, which were not unexpected given the enormity of IRS\u2019 processing task, the processing systems worked well. On the other hand, although taxpayers were better able to reach IRS over the telephone compared to 1999, IRS\u2019 performance was still well below the level achieved in 1998. Our forthcoming reports on IRS\u2019 toll-free telephone service will contain recommendations directed at helping IRS improve its performance.", "In addition to telephone service, IRS provides other forms of assistance that are used by tens of millions of taxpayers.

In some respects, such as with the volunteer assistance programs and the assistance provided by IRS\u2019 walk-in sites and area distribution centers, the opportunities centered around performance measures. In those areas, unlike the situation with respect to IRS\u2019 telephone service, it was not easy to assess IRS\u2019 performance because either IRS did not have good measures or there were problems with the data behind the measures.

While agreeing generally with our recommendations, the Commissioner disagreed with parts of two recommendations (although, in one case, IRS\u2019 plans are consistent with our recommendation) and provided additional perspective that led to a rewording of one recommendation. The Commissioner also expressed some concern about one aspect of our assessment of IRS\u2019 telephone service.", "The Commissioner agreed that IRS should provide a standard format for field offices to use in reporting wait-time data for walk-in sites. However, he did not agree that IRS should specify the percentage of time that walk- in sites are to meet established wait-time goals because doing so might pressure IRS staff to serve taxpayers too quickly and, thus, negatively affect service quality. We believe that just measuring average wait time can mask a circumstance in which many taxpayers are waiting more than the length of time specified in IRS\u2019 goal (i.e., 30 minutes for return preparation and 15 minutes for all other services) even though the average wait time is below IRS\u2019 goal. Concern about staff working too fast and thus providing poor quality service should be offset by the influence of other measures (i.e., quality and customer satisfaction) on employee behavior.", "The Commissioner agreed that goals and measures are needed for volunteer sites and noted that one aspect of their performance\u2014quality\u2014 is being measured. We revised this report to make that clear. The Commissioner said that IRS will discuss with its largest partner in providing volunteer assistance the possibility of developing a timeliness measure. We believe that any such discussion should also include a measure of customer satisfaction. The Commissioner cautioned that IRS cannot require that its partner adopt any measure. We recognize that collaboration is required and revised our recommendation accordingly.", "The Commissioner agreed with the need to improve the process of ordering and delivering supplies and materials to volunteer assistance sites and said that actions have been taken to address that issue. The Commissioner did not comment on our recommendation that IRS identify the underlying causes of inadequate district review of site operations and take necessary corrective action.", "The Commissioner agreed that area distribution centers should track orders for forms and publications from the day an order is received, but he did not agree that tracking should continue until all backorders associated with an order have been shipped. However, the tracking plans described by the Commissioner include plans to measure overall elapsed time to fill an order, including associated backorders. That is fully consistent with our recommendation.", "The Commissioner agreed with our recommendation regarding IRS\u2019 Web site and said that steps have already been taken to assign clear responsibility for ensuring accurate, useful, and timely information.", "The Commissioner also commented on our discussion of IRS\u2019 performance in providing telephone service. While agreeing that IRS can improve its delivery of telephone service, the Commissioner did not believe that we should compare IRS\u2019 performance to 1998 because IRS had significantly changed its telephone service operating environment after 1998. We agree, and have acknowledged in this report, that there were major changes after 1998, but we do not agree that those changes make it inappropriate to compare IRS\u2019 performance in 1998 to its performance in 1999 and 2000. To the contrary, we believe that such a comparison is essential. The changes made after 1998 were intended to improve IRS\u2019 telephone service.

IRS data indicate that taxpayers and tax return preparers had fewer problems with the Child Tax Credit in 2000. As of June 2, 2000, according to IRS, the number of Child Tax Credit errors by taxpayers and preparers was 37 percent lower than at the same time in 1999. This decrease is even more significant considering that, according to IRS\u2019 Statistics of Income Division, more taxpayers claimed the Child Tax Credit in 2000 than in 1999.", "The fewer errors in 2000 can be attributed, at least in part, to changes IRS made to the Child Tax Credit worksheet, which, in our opinion, reduced the chance for error. Before the revision, taxpayers were required to complete an 11-line worksheet that incorporated the criteria for eligibility along with the calculations for the credit. IRS simplified the worksheet by presenting the criteria in the form of questions to which the taxpayer was to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d If taxpayers plainly met the criteria, they were directed to complete a simple five-line worksheet to calculate the credit. Taxpayers who did not plainly meet the criteria were directed to use a separate publication to determine if they were entitled to any part of the credit. Our review of the revision and the conditions that require use of the separate publication indicated that most taxpayers would have been able to use the simple five-line worksheet and avoid the publication."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criteria for Filing Schedule D Revised", "paragraphs": ["As we discussed in our report on the 1998 filing season, IRS\u2019 implementation of a legislative change relating to capital gains led to additional burdens for IRS and taxpayers. In 1998, if Schedule D, which is used to report capital gains, was missing from a return, IRS would stop processing the return and write the taxpayer asking for a Schedule D. For the 1999 filing season, IRS changed that procedure to correspond with the taxpayer only if the capital gain reported on the return was over a certain amount. For the 2000 filing season, IRS raised that amount and dropped the requirement for a Schedule D if the only capital gain was from a mutual fund distribution. Consistent with those changes, IRS data indicate that (1) about 17 percent of the individual income tax returns that were received as of May 5, 2000, included a Schedule D compared to about 21 percent at the same point in time in 1999 and (2) as of June 2, 2000, the number of error notices related to problems with Schedule D had decreased 7.7 percent compared to 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dual Mailing Addresses Used to Better Identify Remittances", "paragraphs": ["When tax returns come into a service center, it is important that IRS be able to quickly distinguish those that include remittances from those that do not. IRS gives priority processing attention to returns with remittances so that the money can be quickly deposited to the U.S. Treasury. The mail- sorting equipment IRS uses to identify and segregate mail containing remittances relies on a magnetic ink detection system to determine if there is a check in the envelope. However, because laser computer printers use magnetic ink, the equipment often misreads that print as indicating the presence of a check. According to a report prepared by IRS\u2019 Statistics of Income Division, this problem caused many returns to be misidentified as containing remittances. This misidentification causes an excessive amount of nonremittance work to receive priority processing attention, which, according to IRS, ultimately delays monetary deposits to the Treasury.", "For the 2000 filing season, in an effort to better identify returns with remittances, IRS tested the use of dual mailing addresses for taxpayers to use in sending their Form 1040 return to IRS (persons using Forms 1040A and 1040EZ still used only one address). IRS\u2019 test involved the use of one address for returns claiming a refund and another address for returns not claiming a refund.
