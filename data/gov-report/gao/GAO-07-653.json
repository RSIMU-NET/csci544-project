Because of recent concerns about some federal researchers possibly being restricted from disseminating their research on controversial topics, GAO determined (1) the policies that guide the dissemination of federal research at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); (2) how effectively these agencies have communicated their policies to researchers; and (3) the extent to which researchers have been restricted in disseminating their research. GAO conducted a survey of 1,811 researchers randomly selected at the three agencies, and had a 66 percent response rate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most of the NASA, NIST, and NOAA policies that guide the dissemination of federally funded research generally facilitate the dissemination process, but some do not. GAO found that overall NASA's policies, including its recently revised media policy, are clear and should help facilitate dissemination regardless of the dissemination approach used. At NIST and NOAA, GAO found that the agencies' policies for dissemination through publications and presentations were generally clear and should facilitate dissemination; but their policies for disseminating research through media interviews and press releases may hinder it. For example, because both NIST and NOAA are part of Commerce, researchers at these agencies must comply with department-level policies to disseminate their research results through media interviews or press releases, but Commerce's policies are outdated and can prevent researchers from meeting media schedules. Moreover, requests by NOAA researchers to share their research via media interviews and press releases may be further hampered because these researchers must also comply with their own agency's media interview and press release policies in addition to the Department of Commerce's. NOAA officials told GAO that because its media interview and press release policies lack clarity, they have been inconsistently interpreted by NOAA public affairs officials. According to GAO's survey, NASA, NIST, and NOAA have made efforts to communicate their dissemination policies to their research staff, but many researchers are not confident that they know how to comply with some of the policies. The agencies have communicated their dissemination policies through staff meetings, on agency Web sites, and in limited formal training. While 90 percent of researchers are confident that they understand the policies for publications, only about 65 percent are confident they understand their agency's media interview and press release policies well enough to comply with them. Similarly, almost half of the researchers across the agencies are unsure whether their agency's policy allows them to discuss their personal views on the policy implications of their research. Finally, only 25 percent of researchers across the agencies are aware of a process to follow to appeal denials of requests to disseminate their research. On the basis of responses to GAO's survey, 6 percent--or about 200 researchers--across NASA, NIST, and NOAA had dissemination requests denied during the last 5 years. One of the most common reasons researchers mentioned for these denials was that the topic of the research was sensitive or restricted for security reasons; in some cases, no reason was given. Most researchers at these agencies believe that their agency is more supportive of dissemination of research through publications and presentations, than dissemination through the media. Most NIST and NOAA researchers believe that their agency consistently applies the dissemination policies for each route of dissemination, while more researchers at NASA believe the agency consistently applies its policies for publications than believe the agency consistently applies its policies for press releases and interviews."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies strive to base science-related public policy on the best  Federal agencies strive to base science-related public policy on the best  available information provided through objective research, some of which  available information provided through objective research, some of which  is conducted by federal researchers.

Some dissemination routes, such as through publications,  including peer-reviewed journals and agency scientific and technical  reports, are useful for sharing information with the scientific community.  Similarly, researchers can present their findings to colleagues at  conferences, workshops, symposia, or professional society meetings.  Other dissemination routes can reach a still wider audience. For example,  agency press releases or postings on agency Web sites can help target  media attention to particular research findings, and media interviews can  provide the general public with access to scientific information.", "In recent years, concerns have emerged regarding the possibility that  limits are being placed on the efforts of federally employed researchers to  share the results of their work through these various dissemination routes.  For example, in January 2006, the press reported allegations that a NASA  scientist was restricted from speaking with the press after presenting his  research findings related to climate change at a conference. In addition,  some researchers at NOAA have claimed that the agency had put  restrictions on their ability to speak to reporters, had imposed delays in  the approval and coordination process for speaking with the media, or had  censored their views in issued reports.", "In this context, we (1) identified and evaluated the policies that guide the  dissemination of federal research results at NASA, NIST, and NOAA;   (2) determined how effectively the dissemination and dispute resolution  policies of these agencies have been communicated to researchers; and   (3) determined the extent to which researchers at these agencies have  experienced restrictions on the dissemination of their research results. In  addition, we obtained information on the role that the Office of Science  and Technology Policy (OSTP) has identified for itself in helping agencies  develop and implement policies related to the dissemination of research  results.", "To identify and evaluate the policies that guide the dissemination of  federally funded research results at NASA, NIST, and NOAA, we obtained,  reviewed, and analyzed the dissemination policies for these agencies, in  addition to relevant policies from Commerce. In addition, we spoke with  managers and researchers at NASA, NIST, and NOAA as well as public  affairs officials at each of these agencies and Commerce. During these  interviews, we confirmed that we had copies of the relevant dissemination  policies and discussed how these policies were put into practice. To  determine how effectively these policies have been communicated to  researchers and the extent to which researchers at these agencies have  experienced restrictions on the dissemination of their research results, we  surveyed a stratified random sample of 1,811 researchers across scientific  and engineering disciplines at NASA, NIST, and NOAA. This sample  included 578 NASA researchers, 699 NIST researchers, and 534 NOAA  researchers. We selected these 1,811 researchers from among the 1,794  researchers at NASA, 1,337 researchers at NIST, and 1,815 researchers at  NOAA. Overall, we received a 66 percent response rate to our survey, for a  total of 1,177 respondents. We defined researchers to be included in our  population as federally employed scientists, engineers, or other  researchers who are in a position to disseminate their research results to a  wider audience. Through our survey, we sought the researchers\u2019 views on  their agencies\u2019 research dissemination policies, the level of agency support  for dissemination, and their experiences with dissemination. In addition,  we asked the researchers to provide examples of ways in which their  agencies\u2019 dissemination policies work well and ways in which these  policies could be improved. All estimates based on our survey allow us to  project the results of our survey to all researchers at these three agencies  with a 95 percent level of confidence. Unless otherwise noted, all  percentage estimates have a 95 percent confidence interval within plus or  minus 8 percentage points. In addition, any comparison between point  estimates is statistically significant at the 0.05 level, unless otherwise  noted. In one instance, the number of responses to three follow-up  questions designed to elicit elaborative information received too few  responses to generalize to the population. Although we cannot generalize  from these responses, we included this information because it provides  context for specific concerns that these respondents had about certain  research dissemination policies at their agencies. Where we use this  information, we highlight the fact that it cannot be generalized to the  population by attributing the statements as a survey response, rather than  as researcher perception. To determine OSTP\u2019s role in helping agencies  develop and implement policies for the dissemination of research results,  we submitted detailed questions to OSTP officials, to which we received  written responses. Appendix I contains an expanded explanation of our  scope and methodology, and appendix II contains selected survey results  for NASA, NIST, and NOAA. We conducted our work from June 2006  through March 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, there have been a number of allegations concerning  interference with federal researchers in their efforts to disseminate their  research results to a wider audience, external to their agency. Many of  these allegations have concerned interference with researchers\u2019 attempts  to speak with the media or present research findings at conferences. These  claims have frequently surrounded research on politically sensitive topics,  such as climate change and the role it may play in connection to other  weather events, such as hurricanes. For example, some federal  researchers have alleged that they were not allowed to use the phrase  \u201cglobal warming,\u201d and others have alleged that NOAA has limited scientific  debate by not reporting all of the research regarding a possible connection  between global warming and increased hurricane intensity.", "These concerns have resulted in a number of inquiries into the  dissemination practices and policies at several federal agencies. For  example, in May 2006, in response to a congressional request, the National  Science Foundation\u2019s National Science Board examined the existing  policies of selected federal science agencies, including NASA and NOAA,  to determine if they contained steps to ensure the credibility of research  results and insulate these results from suppression or distortion. The  board found that there was no consistent federal policy regarding the  dissemination of research results by federal employees and recommended  that all agencies that conduct research establish policies and procedures  to encourage an open exchange of data and results. The board also  recommended that the administration develop and issue an overarching  set of principles for the communication of scientific information by  government scientists, policymakers, and managers that could be used as  the framework under which each agency would develop its specific  policies and procedures.", "In addition to the National Science Board review, other groups have  sought information on the dissemination activities of federal agencies. For  example, in 2005, Environmental Science and Technology, an online and  print journal published by the American Chemical Society, requested and  received copies of NOAA Office of Public Affairs documents through the  Freedom of Information Act pertaining to climate change, including  exchanges between NOAA scientists and public affairs staff. Furthermore,  in September 2006, 14 Senators requested that the Inspectors General at  Commerce and NASA investigate reports of political interference with the  work of scientists at NASA and NOAA. In February 2007, the Union of  Concerned Scientists and the Government Accountability Project, two  nongovernmental advocacy organizations, jointly issued a report  examining the extent to which politics play a role in scientific research.  More recently, over the first few months of 2007, Congress has held  several hearings exploring allegations of political interference with the  work of government climate change scientists.", "A number of federal agencies conduct scientific research that is used to  inform federal policy decisions. This report focuses on NASA and 2 of the  13 agencies within Commerce\u2014NIST and NOAA. NASA\u2019s organic  statute\u2014the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as amended\u2014 calls for NASA to \u201cprovide for the widest practicable and appropriate  dissemination\u201d of the scientific and technical information resulting from  NASA\u2019s research efforts. This work is structured around four mission  areas\u2014aeronautics research, exploration systems, science, and space  operations\u2014and is performed at 10 research and flight centers across the  United States. Each of these centers performs a variety of research,  engineering, construction, and support functions related to the mission  areas, and each has a separate management structure, including a center  director, to guide its activities. Furthermore, each center has its own  public affairs office that is responsible for managing the center\u2019s media  contacts and communications. In addition, NASA headquarters has its own  public affairs office that oversees agencywide programs and activities to  coordinate and maintain open and credible communication channels to  the news media and the public.", "Each of Commerce\u2019s 13 agencies is headed by its own director,  undersecretary, or assistant secretary. Even though each of these agencies  has its own public affairs office, Commerce\u2019s Office of Public Affairs is  responsible for overseeing public affairs interactions for the department,  such as issuing press releases and answering media inquiries, as well as  for keeping abreast of the activities at all 13 agencies, many of which  disseminate research results, as is the case with NIST and NOAA. NIST\u2019s  mission is \u201cto promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by  advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that  enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.\u201d To a large  extent, this mission is fulfilled by the research undertaken by scientists,  engineers, and technical experts at the agency\u2019s Maryland and Colorado  facilities. NIST is specifically required to disseminate research conducted  under several of its programs. Most research at NIST is conducted at one  of its eight laboratories, covering research areas such as manufacturing  engineering, physics, and information technology. It is NIST\u2019s policy to  publish the results of these technical programs openly, widely, and  promptly, and this is accomplished through scientific reports issued by  researchers as well as press releases and Web-based newsletters issued by  NIST\u2019s Public and Business Affairs Office. NOAA is the largest of the  Commerce agencies, and its work is structured around four program  goals\u2014ecosystems, climate, weather and water, and commerce and  transportation\u2014and seven operating organizations, or program offices.  Similar to NASA and NIST, NOAA headquarters has a public affairs  office\u2014the Office of Communications\u2014which is led by a director and  tasked with facilitating media and public communications with the  agency. Each of NOAA\u2019s program offices also has a public affairs officer  who reports to the director of the Office of Communications and serves as  the primary public affairs contact for program office researchers.", "Research dissemination at each of these agencies is guided by  departmental or agency policies. In addition, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) has also issued guidelines and bulletins that have an  impact on the dissemination of research results. For example, in October  2001, OMB issued its Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the  Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated  by Federal Agencies, which required agencies to issue their own  guidelines to ensure the quality of information being disseminated. NASA,  NIST, and NOAA have all issued their own information quality guidelines.  In addition, OMB issued the Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer  Review in December 2004 that established governmentwide guidance  establishing that important scientific information shall be peer-reviewed  by qualified specialists before it is disseminated by the federal  government. Among other things, the bulletin provides guidance to federal  agencies on what information is subject to peer review and requires  agencies to begin a systematic process of peer-review planning for  influential scientific information (including highly influential scientific  assessments) that the agency plans to disseminate in the foreseeable  future.", "In addition to the research activities of specific agencies, OSTP advises the  President and others in the Executive Office of the President (EOP) on the  effects of science and technology on matters being considered in the  policymaking process. OSTP serves as a source of scientific and  technological information and advice for the President with respect to  major policies of the federal government and acts as the scientific and  technical arm of the EOP policymaking process. As part of this work,  OSTP and OMB collaborate to help agencies develop research and  development budgets to address national priorities. OSTP meets regularly  with agency staff as well as representatives of industry, academia, and the  general public to seek or share information about science and technology  policy and leads interagency efforts to develop and implement science and  technology policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NASA, NIST, and NOAA Policies Generally Facilitate the Dissemination of Research, but Some Do Not", "paragraphs": ["Researchers at NASA, NIST, and NOAA must comply with both office  specific and agencywide or departmental-level policies, most of which  facilitate dissemination of research.

For example, for publications and  presentations, all researchers are directed to comply with the agency\u2019s  policy for approval, publication, and dissemination of scientific and  technical information. Scientific and technical information is defined as  the results\u2014including facts, analyses, and conclusions\u2014of basic and  applied scientific, technical, and related engineering research and  development. This information can be disseminated through a variety of  channels, including NASA publications, outside journals, presentations at  meetings or workshops, and Web sites. The policy directs that all scientific  and technical information released outside the agency through these  means must be reviewed to determine whether public access to it should  be prohibited or restricted, for national security or intellectual property  reasons. In addition, NASA\u2019s policies direct that all research results that  are to be disseminated undergo professional and technical reviews to  ensure that the information is being clearly communicated, is technically  accurate, and meets data quality standards. These technical review and  management approval procedures vary depending upon the information  content, publication route, and intended audience\u2014domestic or  international. To indicate that a document has completed the necessary  reviews, researchers generally must complete two forms\u2014one identifying  what restrictions, if any, need to be placed on the document prior to  dissemination and the other indicating that the document has undergone  technical peer review. NASA managers with whom we spoke at the centers  said that they found the agency\u2019s policies to be clear, easy to follow, and  similar to procedures researchers follow in the academic community,  although some said that the agency\u2019s reviews to identify security  restrictions can be cumbersome at times.", "Regarding dissemination of research through media interviews and press  releases, researchers at NASA are subject to the agency\u2019s policy on the  release of information to news and information media, hereafter referred  to as the \u201cmedia policy.\u201d This policy, which was revised in March 2006,  governs the release of information to the media, especially information  with the potential to generate significant media or public interest,  including press releases, media advisories, news features, and Web  postings. According to NASA, the media policy in place prior to March  2006 had not been substantively modified since 1987 and required  clarification to be both useful and practical to implement. Furthermore,  the NASA public affairs policy review team, composed of representatives  from throughout NASA\u2019s scientific and public affairs offices, found that  the previous policies were convoluted, bureaucratic, and resulted in a  breakdown between researchers and public affairs staff.", "We found that NASA\u2019s revised 2006 media policy is generally clear and  should help facilitate dissemination of research results by devolving  decision making and providing a process to resolve disputes. The policy,  its accompanying \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d guide, and statements by  the NASA Administrator assert NASA\u2019s commitment to a culture of  openness with the media and the public and affirm that the agency values  the free exchange of ideas, data, and information as part of scientific and  technical inquiry. The policy defines the roles, responsibilities, and  methods of coordination for managers, researchers, and public affairs staff  and lays out guidelines for working with the public affairs office, clearly  stating what public affairs officials can and cannot do. Specifically,  regarding media interviews, the updated policy clearly affirms that NASA  employees may speak to the media and public about their work without  prior approval; however, they must notify their immediate supervisor and  their center public affairs office immediately thereafter. While researchers  are encouraged to have a public affairs official present during interviews,  it is not required and the policy clearly defines the role of public affairs  staff as one of logistical support and clarification, not interference. Finally,  the policy states that NASA employees may communicate conclusions on  the basis of their research to the media. However, NASA employees who  present personal views outside of their official area of expertise or  responsibility must make clear that they are presenting their individual  views and not those of the agency.", "In addition to clarifying the policy for conducting media interviews,  NASA\u2019s revised media policy also describes the process for dissemination  via press releases or other media items, such as news features, media  advisories, or news-related Web postings. Specifically, the policy,  augmented by accompanying operating procedures, clearly outlines the  coordination, review, and approval process that is required prior to issuing  a press release. While some public affairs officials and managers told us  that some of the reviews for press releases can require more time than  available to meet the deadlines of the news cycle, they also felt that the  revised policy had improved the approval process. In addition, the policy  specifically delegates authority to NASA centers, independent of  headquarters, to issue public information that is of local interest, among  other things. Items eligible for issuance by the centers include releases on  specific research topics that have a targeted audience, such as the  development of a new \u201csuperplastic\u201d that would be of interest to people  who use polymers, or an announcement of an upcoming lecture series to  be held at the center. Delegating authority to the centers to issue their own  press releases allows NASA to better publicize the work it does to targeted  audiences of interest. Finally, the revised media policy describes the  process for researchers to use when they disagree with the agency\u2019s  decision regarding whether to issue a press release or another type of  public information. The policy allows such appeals to be elevated to the  Office of the Administrator for resolution, if needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIST and NOAA Policies Provide Clear Guidance to Facilitate the Dissemination of Research through Publications and Presentations", "paragraphs": ["NIST\u2019s publication and presentation policy, called the Technical  Communications Program, generally facilitates the dissemination of  scientific results. Similar to NASA\u2019s publications policy, NIST\u2019s policy  clearly describes the extent and type of reviews for technical and scientific  accuracy that are required before publications and presentations may be  released outside the agency. For example, abstracts and outlines for talks  that are not of a sensitive nature and will be limited in distribution can be  approved by the researcher\u2019s division chief and do not need to go through  a more extensive review. However, manuscripts for journals and books  that are intended for public distribution must be reviewed and approved  by the laboratory to which the researcher belongs as well as the NIST  Editorial Review Board. This board, composed of NIST technical authors  and editors from all organizational units, conducts a critical evaluation of  the technical content and methodology, among other things. If the review  board does not support publication, it generally recommends changes,  which if made by the author, would result in approval. If the author  chooses not to accept these changes, the policy delineates the steps that  the author should take to resolve any disagreement. NIST managers said  that the guidance and procedures for getting potential publications  through the editorial review process and disseminated were adequate,  clear, and readily accessible to researchers on the internal NIST Web site.", "Similar to NIST, NOAA\u2019s publication and presentation policy facilitates  research dissemination and clearly describes the process for disseminating  scientific and technical publications. Specifically, NOAA\u2019s policy  encourages each program office to review, edit, and disseminate its own  publications, and the policy clearly delegates responsibility to each  program office to ensure the scientific and technical quality of its  publications and presentations. Furthermore, NOAA has developed a  standard form to guide the review process and to document final approval  for release. In addition, several NOAA program offices have supplemented  these agencywide policies with office-specific ones. For example, the  National Weather Service\u2019s policy clearly delineates the review and  approval process for their publications. Similarly, the National  Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service created an office- specific form that documents the multiple reviews a proposed manuscript  must undergo. This form, signed by the branch chief, division chief, and  office director or deputy director, certifies that a research paper is worthy  of scientific review or useful for education or outreach purposes.

Because Commerce\u2019s  public affairs office is responsible for overseeing the media activities for  13 agencies, according to Commerce officials, it is not realistic to expect  this office to review every media interview and press release request that  each of these agencies generates. For example, from a large agency like  NOAA, the volume of media requests can range from dozens on a normal  business day to hundreds following a major event, such as a tsunami. In  addition, Commerce\u2019s policy states that disputes concerning a potential  media interview or press releases that are not resolved by the Director of  Public Affairs shall be referred to the Secretary of Commerce.", "At a February 2007 Senate hearing, a Commerce official referred to the  department\u2019s communication policies as \u201ccontradictory\u201d and \u201cwoefully  outdated.\u201d These policies, which have not been revised since 1983, were  implemented prior to the expansion and widespread adoption of newer  media outlets, such as the Internet and 24-hour cable news stations, and  therefore do not take these routes of dissemination into consideration.  While officials from Commerce\u2019s Office of Public Affairs said that they  would like to be informed about all press releases and interviews, they  realize that this request is not realistic given the volume of releases from  some agencies. Consequently, Commerce public affairs officials  acknowledged that even though it is required, they do not generally review  low-level or routine releases.", "To streamline the approval process and respond to allegations by some  researchers about the department\u2019s interference with media dissemination  of research results, Commerce began an effort in November 2005 to revise  its media and communications policies. According to a Commerce official,  this effort included three rounds of input. During the first round,  Commerce solicited informal feedback from managers and some scientists  at selected agencies, including at NIST and NOAA. As part of the  subsequent two rounds, Commerce solicited input from managers and  public affairs officials at all Commerce agencies. In addition, these  officials were encouraged to share the draft with researchers and other  public affairs officials within their agency to obtain their feedback and  input. We reviewed a draft of the revised policy in March 2007. Because  the final policy was released after our audit work was completed, we did  not conduct a detailed evaluation of the new policy. However, we did note  that the revised policy included provisions to address some of the  concerns we identified with the prior policy. For example, the revised  policy affirms the department\u2019s support for open and free communication  of scientific and technical ideas, findings, and conclusions based on  researchers\u2019 official work and asserts that researchers are free to  participate in interviews, without prior approval, on matters directly  related to their research. In addition, the revised policy takes other  positive steps, such as the inclusion of an appeals process and the  clarification of the role of the public affairs office. However, it also  contains some unclear elements that may cause confusion for the agencies  and researchers who are trying to adhere to the policy. The policy was  officially released on March 29, 2007, and, according to a Commerce  official, it will be accompanied by a training program to educate public  affairs officials on how to implement it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Researchers at NIST Have Been Provided with Supplemental Agency Guidance", "paragraphs": ["To supplement Commerce policies for dissemination of research results  through media interviews and press releases, NIST has issued Web-based  guidance that provides an overview of the Commerce policy and serves as  a reference tool for NIST researchers who interact with the media.

For example, regarding media interviews, one  part of NOAA\u2019s policy directs its employees to inform NOAA headquarters  or program office public affairs officials prior to participating in interviews  that are of national news interest, concern regulatory or controversial  issues, or pertain to research having potential policy interest; however,  another part of this policy states that responsibility of the NOAA  headquarters\u2019 public affairs office is to approve and coordinate media  communications, including interviews and press releases. As a result of  this unclear language, public affairs officials have interpreted these  requirements differently. Some believe that researchers are required to  obtain prior approval for all interviews, while others believe researchers  must notify the public affairs office after an interview has occurred. This  has resulted in an uneven application of the policy among researchers.  Furthermore, the policy does not define what qualifies as \u201cof national  news interest\u201d or \u201ccontroversial,\u201d thereby leaving the interpretation to  each individual.", "In addition, some of NOAA\u2019s procedures required for media interview  approvals can be burdensome and could delay dissemination of research.  To seek approval for a media interview, NOAA program office public  affairs staff are expected to complete a form that contains information  about the topic, the potential questions, the media outlet, and the reporter,  among other things. The completed form is forwarded to the headquarters\u2019  public affairs office for review and approval. However, while interview  approvals typically occur within a few hours, in some cases they have  arrived after the reporters\u2019 deadlines, resulting in missed interviews,  according to NOAA public affairs officials. Furthermore, some of these  officials expressed concern that reporters may shy away from contacting  NOAA researchers because of the drawn out approval process, ultimately  causing NOAA to miss opportunities to inform the public about its work.", "Regarding press releases, NOAA public affairs officials have also  interpreted approval requirements differently from one another. For  example, some officials believe that the policy requires all press releases  to be approved by the NOAA headquarters\u2019 public affairs office, while  others believe headquarters approval is not required for releases of  regional interest or involving routine activities. NOAA\u2019s press release  policy, unlike NASA\u2019s policy, does not distinguish between press releases  on local topics and press releases on national topics and does not delegate  authority to program office public affairs officials to issue such press  releases. However, according to public affairs officials with whom we  spoke, routine releases may not warrant the same scrutiny as ones likely  to be of national interest or controversial. For example, a NOAA public  affairs official commented that routine releases about StormReady\u2014a  community safety and emergency preparedness program\u2014should be  treated differently from press releases that have a broader scope, such as  annual releases of climate data.", "According to NOAA public affairs officials, the approval process for press  releases is lengthy and burdensome, and approvals that took 1 to 2 days a  few years ago can now take as long as 2 weeks to obtain. This is because  the process involves 13 separate steps for approval that begin after the  press release has been drafted, which itself can be a lengthy process. (See  fig. 1.) In November 2006, another requirement was added to the approval  process\u2014that is, a public affairs briefing memorandum must precede  certain requests to issue a press release, such as those involving a  controversial or \u201chot\u201d topic. According to a senior NOAA public affairs  official, the intent of requiring the memorandum was to inform NOAA  management about upcoming announcements and help ensure that the  program office public affairs staff had gathered enough information about  the proposed release to judge its merit.", "The myriad steps in the approval process can hinder the timely issuance of  press releases. As was the case with delays in approving interviews,  officials told us press releases that come out too late are in danger of not  making it into the news and cited several instances in which requests to  issue press releases never received an approval or a denial from  headquarters public affairs and, consequently, were never released.  Moreover, no explanation for the lack of response was offered to the  public affairs office or the researcher. Furthermore, officials at a NOAA  laboratory have become discouraged from seeking press releases for  research conducted at the laboratory because of delays and the lack of  responsiveness to such requests, further limiting NOAA\u2019s ability to  publicize its research."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Despite Agencies\u2019 Efforts to Communicate Research Dissemination and Dispute Resolution Policies, Many Researchers Are Not Confident about How to Comply with Them", "paragraphs": ["According to our survey, researchers at NASA, NIST, and NOAA usually  learned about their agency\u2019s dissemination policies through informal  communication methods, rather than through formal training provided by  their agency.

We selected these researchers from among the 1,794 researchers at NASA,  1,337 researchers at NIST, and 1,815 researchers at NOAA. Overall, we  received a 66 percent response rate to our survey, for a total of 1,177  respondents. We stratified by agency subcomponent\u2014such as the NASA  center, NIST laboratory, and NOAA program office\u2014and produced  estimates at the agency level. Each subcomponent has a known nonzero  probability of being selected, and each subcomponent is weighted in the  analysis to account statistically for all subcomponents in the population,  including those that were not selected. We sought the researchers\u2019 views  on their agency\u2019s research dissemination policies, the level of agency  support for dissemination, and their experiences with dissemination. In  addition, we asked the researchers to provide examples of ways in which  dissemination of results works well and ways in which it could be  improved. We defined researchers to be included in our population as  federally employed scientists, engineers, or other researchers who are in a  position to disseminate their research results to a wider audience. To  identify these names, we asked center or program managers at NASA,  NIST, and NOAA to provide a list of researchers in their organization who  would meet our defined criterion. We cross-referenced this list with other  published lists of researchers in each facility, where available. We further  refined the list by sending out notification e-mails that allowed recipients  who did not meet our criteria to notify us prior to issuing the survey.", "Information about accessing the survey was provided via e-mail for all  survey participants. The survey was activated, and researchers were  informed of its availability on November 16, 2006; it was available through  December 31, 2006. To ensure security and data integrity, we provided all  participants with a user name and a personal password that allowed them  to access and complete the survey. No one else could access that survey or  edit its data. To reduce survey nonresponse, we sent out e-mail reminder  messages and a contractor was used to make follow-up telephone calls to  all nonrespondants to encourage them to complete the survey. From the  initial notification, we identified 21 individuals who were outside the  target population. For example, some individuals had retired from the  agency. In all, we received a 66 percent response rate. Response rates for  our survey population by agency were as follows: NASA, 63.6 percent;  NIST, 61.5 percent; and NOAA, 73.7 percent.", "All sample surveys are subject to sampling error\u2014that is, the extent to  which the survey results differ from what would have been obtained if the  whole population had been observed. Measures of sampling error are  defined by two elements, the width of the confidence intervals around the  estimate (sometimes called the precision of the estimate) and the  confidence level at which the intervals are computed. Because we  followed a probability procedure based on random selections, our sample  is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn.  Because each sample could have provided different estimates, we  expressed our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s  results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would  contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could  have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the  confidence intervals based on the survey includes the true values in the  sample population. Unless otherwise noted, all percentage estimates have  a 95 percent confidence interval within plus or minus 8 percentage points.  The 95 percent confidence intervals for numeric estimates are presented  along with those estimates in the body of the report. In addition, any  comparison between point estimates is statistically significant at the 0.05  level, unless otherwise noted. In some instances, we used general  modifiers (i.e., few, some, many, and most) to characterize percentage  point estimates or to indicate the number of center or office managers  who made a particular statement. We used the following method to assign  these modifiers to our statements: \u201cfew\u201d represents less than 10 percent of  respondents or managers representing centers or offices, \u201csome\u201d or  \u201cmany\u201d represents 10 to 50 percent of respondents or managers  representing centers or offices, and \u201cmost\u201d represents over 50 percent of  respondents or managers representing centers or offices. These ranges do  not represent a standard; rather, we assigned these numeric ranges on the  basis of natural breaks in our data. In all cases where we use these  modifiers to characterize point estimates from our survey, their use  implies statistical significance. For example, where we use the term  \u201cmost,\u201d the lower bound of the confidence interval of the point estimate is  greater than 50 percent.", "Regarding the survey data on instances in which researchers were denied  the opportunity to disseminate, the percentage of researchers reporting  such instances can be generalized to the population. However, because the  number of denials is small, the details concerning the reason for denial,  the researcher\u2019s primary field of research, and the actions taken in  response to the denial cannot be generalized. Because the issue of a  researcher being denied is a salient piece of our analysis, we included this  nongeneralizable information to provide context to this important issue.  To analyze select, open-ended questions on our survey, including those  given as the reason researchers said they were denied, we conducted a  content analysis to develop our agreement statistics. Reviewers (two per  question) collaboratively developed content categories based on survey  responses, and then independently assessed and coded each survey  response into those categories. Intercoder reliability (agreement) statistics  were electronically generated in the coding process, and agreement  statistics for all categories were 90 percent or above. Coding  disagreements were resolved through reviewer discussion or a third-party  arbiter.", "In addition to the reported sampling errors, as previously indicated, the  practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors,  commonly referred to as \u201cnonsampling errors.\u201d For example, differences  in how a particular question is interpreted, the information sources  available to respondents, or the types of sample members who do not  respond can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. Our  estimation method assumes that nonrespondents are missing at random. If  characteristics of respondents are different than nonrespondents on key  items, it could introduce a bias not accounted for in our analysis. We took  extensive steps in questionnaire development, data collection, and the  editing and analysis of the survey data to minimize nonsampling errors.  For example, the survey was developed by a GAO survey specialist in  conjunction with subject matter experts, and then reviewed by a second,  independent survey specialist. In addition, we pretested the survey by  telephone with researchers from all three agencies. During these pretests,  we asked each researcher to complete the survey as they would when they  received it. We then interviewed the respondents to ensure that (1) the  questions were clear and unambiguous, (2) the terms used were precise,  (3) the survey did not place an undue burden on the researchers  completing it, and (4) the survey was independent and unbiased. On the  basis of the feedback from the pretests, we revised the questions, as  appropriate. The SAS and SUDAAN programs that produced our survey  estimates, including estimates of categories derived from content analysis,  were reviewed by a second, independent programmer to ensure accuracy  in the logic and syntax of the program.", "To determine OSTP\u2019s role in helping agencies develop and implement  policies for the dissemination of research results, we submitted written  questions.
