Therefore, GAO reviewed (1) how CBP identifies potential illegal textile transshipment, (2) how well CBP's textile review process works to prevent illegal textile transshipment, and (3) how effectively CBP uses its in-bond system to monitor foreign textiles transiting the United States."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To identify potential illegal textile transshipments, CBP uses a targeting process that relies on analyzing available trade data to focus limited inspection and enforcement resources on the most high-risk activity. In 2002, CBP targeted about 2,500 textile shipments out of more than 3 million processed, or less than 0.01 percent. Given resource constraints at CBP ports, CBP's textile review process for preventing illegal textile transshipment increasingly depends on information from foreign factory visits that CBP conducts, based on the targeting results. However, CBP's foreign factory visit reports are not always finalized and provided to ports, other agencies, or the foreign governments for timely follow-up. Further, after the global textile quotas end in 2005, CBP will lose its authority to conduct foreign factory visits in former quota countries. U.S. overseas Attache offices and cooperative efforts by foreign governments can supplement information provided to the ports. Under CBP's in-bond system, foreign textiles and apparel can travel through the United States before formally entering U.S. commerce or being exported to a foreign country. However, weak internal controls in this system enable cargo to be illegally diverted from its supposed destination, thus circumventing quota restrictions and payment of duties. Moreover, CBP's penalties do not deter in-bond diversion. Bond amounts can be set considerably lower than the value of the cargo, and violators may not view the low payments as a deterrent against diverting their cargo."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With overall U.S. imports of textile and apparel products running about $81  billion in 2002, or about 7 percent of all U.S. imports, U.S. policymakers and  industry groups have been concerned that some foreign textile and apparel  imports are entering the United States fraudulently and displacing U.S.  textile and apparel industry workers.  Illegal textile transshipment is one  form of such illegal import activity and occurs when false country-of-origin  information is provided for imported goods in order to evade U.S. textile  quotas and customs duties.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  does not have a reliable estimate of the overall amount of illegal textile  transshipment that occurs annually, but restrictive U.S. quotas and  relatively high tariffs on certain textile and apparel products create  incentives to foreign suppliers and importers to avoid these trade  restrictions.", "Congress included a mandate in the Trade Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210, Aug. 6,  2002) directing that we assess CBP\u2019s system for monitoring and enforcing  textile transshipment and make recommendations for improvements, as  needed.  As discussed with representatives of the Senate Committee on  Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means, we have focused  on answering the following questions:    How does CBP identify potential textile transshipment?", "How well does CBP\u2019s textile review process work to prevent illegal  textile transshipment?", "How effectively does CBP monitor foreign textiles transiting the United  States in its in-bond system before entering U.S. commerce or being  exported? and  What challenges, if any, has CBP experienced in using penalties and  other means to deter illegal textile transshipment?", "To answer these questions, we conducted fieldwork at seven ports of entry  (New York/Newark, New York; Los Angeles/Long Beach, California;  Laredo, Texas; Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio; and Seattle and Blaine,  Washington) to review how CBP reviews textile shipments at the major  land, sea, and inland ports.  Together, these ports represent CBP service  ports that processed 55 percent of textiles and apparel imported into the  United States in 2002. We also reviewed CBP\u2019s data analysis at its Strategic  Trade Center in New York, observed a Textile Production Verification Team  conduct foreign factory visits in El Salvador, and discussed CBP\u2019s efforts to  coordinate textile enforcement activities with the customs authorities in El  Salvador, Hong Kong, Macau, Mexico, and Canada.

When a country\u2019s quota fills up on a certain category of merchandise, that  country\u2019s exporters may try to find ways to transship its merchandise  through another country whose quota is not yet filled or that does not have  a quota.  Transshipment may also occur because obtaining quota can be  very expensive and the exporters want to avoid this expense.  The actual  illegal act of transshipment takes place when false information is provided  regarding the country-of-origin to make it appear that the merchandise was  made in the transited country.   The effects of the illegal act of  transshipment are felt in both the transited country (potentially displacing  its manufactured exports) and the United States, increasing competition  for the U.S. textile and apparel industry.", "These U.S. quotas, embodied in approximately 45 bilateral textile  agreements, are scheduled for elimination on January 1, 2005, in  accordance with the 1995 World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on  Textiles and Clothing.  However, U.S. quotas will remain for approximately  five countries that are not members of the WTO and for specific product  categories when trade complaint actions, resulting in reinstated quotas, are  approved.  Incentives to engage in transshipment will also continue due to  the differing tariff levels resulting from the various bilateral or multilateral  free trade agreements and preference programs that the United States has  signed with some countries.  U.S. tariffs on certain types of sensitive  textile and apparel products range up to 33 percent, but such tariffs can  fall to zero for imports from trade agreement countries.  As with quotas,  manufacturers from countries facing higher U.S. tariffs may find ways to  transship their merchandise to countries benefiting from lower or no U.S.  tariffs, illegally indicate the merchandise\u2019s country-of-origin, and enter the  merchandise into the U.S. market."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Imports Nearly Double over Past Decade, While Production and Employment Decline", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, U.S. imports of textile and apparel products have  grown significantly, while domestic production and employment have  declined.

Applying a risk-management approach, CBP  targets shipments for review based on trade data, such as sudden surges of  products restricted by quotas from nonquota countries, production data,  results of past factory and port inspections, suspicious patterns of  behavior, and tips from the private sector.  CBP then reviews the targeted  shipments for evidence of transshipment, while expediting the processing  of nontargeted shipments.  From its country-level review, CBP targets 16  countries per year on average, and actually visits 11 of them on average.   For the countries CBP selects, it targets on average about 45 high-risk  manufacturing plants to visit.  These visits seek to find evidence of  transshipment or to verify that the factories are in compliance with U.S.  trade laws and regulations regarding the origin of the goods exported to the  United States.  If problems are found, CBP uses that information to target  shipments (entries) entering the United States for possible detention and  exclusion.  CBP targeted 2,482 shipments in 2002.  CBP has begun to target  high-risk importers\u2019 shipments for review while also conducting internal  audits of selected importers.  Figure 2 shows the general process CBP uses  to target suspicious activity.", "Before the beginning of each fiscal year, CBP analyzes trade and  production data, as well as other available intelligence, to assess the  relative risk of each major U.S. trade partner for engaging in illegal textile  transshipment.  CBP generally identifies 16 countries a year on average as  being at high risk for transshipment or other trade agreement violations  and updates its assessment at least once during the fiscal year.  The risk  level (high, moderate, or low) is based largely on the volume of trade in  sensitive textile categories, such as certain types of knit apparel and fabric,  and the likelihood of transshipment through that country.  For example, as  of November 1, 2003, quotas on men and women\u2019s knit shirts and blouses  were approximately 80 percent or more filled for China, India, and  Indonesia.  This situation creates an incentive for producers in those  countries concerned that the quotas will close before the end of the year to  transship their goods.  CBP may increase its monitoring of trade in these  products through neighboring countries.  The likelihood of transshipment  is a qualitative judgment that CBP makes based on available intelligence.", "Countries with high production capabilities and subject to restrictive  quotas and tariffs, such as China, India, and Pakistan, are considered  potential source countries.  These countries could produce and export to  the United States far more textile and apparel products than U.S. quotas  allow.  Countries that have relatively open access to the U.S. market, either  through relatively generous quotas (Hong Kong and Macau) or trade  preferences programs (Central America and the Caribbean, and sub- Saharan Africa) are considered potential transit points for textile  transshipment.  CBP focuses its efforts on targeting and reviewing goods  from these transit countries rather than source countries because any  evidence that goods were actually produced elsewhere, such as closed  factories or factories without the necessary machinery to produce such  shipments, would be found in the transit country.", "After selecting the high-risk countries, CBP then selects a subset of these  countries to visit during the year to conduct TPVT factory visits.  During  the past 4 years, CBP conducted 42 TPVT visits to 22 countries.  Cambodia,  Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan in Asia, and El Salvador in Latin America  received three or more visits between 2000 and 2003.  Table 1 shows the  U.S. trade partners that CBP visited on a TPVT trip in those years, along  with their share of U.S. imports of textile and apparel products in 2002.   For some U.S. trade partners, their share of overall textile and apparel  trade may be relatively low, but for certain products they are significant  suppliers.  For example, although Thailand is the tenth largest supplier  overall, it is the fifth largest supplier of cotton bed sheets.", "The number of countries CBP visits each year has varied, but from 1996  through 2003 CBP visited 11 countries per year on average.  Although the  overall size of trade is an important factor in targeting countries, CBP also  looks at a range of information in making its determination.  For example,  several relatively small suppliers, such as Nicaragua, Swaziland, and  Botswana, were visited because they receive special preferences as  developing countries.  Also, Vietnam, which only accounted for about 1  percent of U.S. imports in 2002, was selected partly due to trade anomalies  occurring during a period when Vietnam\u2019s quota-free access to the U.S.  market made it a potential transit country. Figure 3 describes the case of  Vietnam as an example of the role and limitations of the targeting process.   However, Canada and Mexico are both top U.S. trade partners and  designated as high-risk countries, but CBP has not made any TPVT visits.   Under the NAFTA, producers in these countries are subject to visits to  verify NAFTA eligibility.  However, these visits do not focus on  transshipment specifically and although CBP has sought to send a TPVT  visit to Canada, it has not yet been successful in persuading the Canadian  government.", "CBP targets about 45 factories on average per country visit, although this  number varies depending on the characteristics of each country.  For  example, the proximity of factories to one another and the length of trip (1  to 2 weeks) will affect the number of factories that can be visited.  The  importance of the trade partner in U.S. textile and apparel trade will affect  the length of the trip and number of factories targeted.  On the November  2003 Hong Kong TPVT trip, for example, CBP visited over 200 factories.   Before undertaking a TPVT visit in a foreign country, CBP conducts a  special targeting session to identify the manufacturers in that country that  it suspects may be involved in textile transshipment.  Similar to its  targeting of countries, CBP import and trade specialists consider the recent  trade flows, available intelligence, experience from past factory visits, and  reviews of merchandise at U.S. ports in order to narrow down from the  total list of factories in the country to a list of the highest-risk factories that  they will target for a visit.  The process involves collaboration between  the STC trade specialists, the port-level import specialists that will travel to  the factories, and headquarters staff.", "During the past 4 years, CBP found that about half the manufacturers that it  targeted as high risk were actually found by TPVT visits to have serious  problems.  These problems included actual evidence of transshipment,  evidence that indicated a high risk of potential transshipment, permanently  closed factories, and factories that refused admission to CBP officials.   Each of these problems is considered a sufficient reason to review and  detain shipments from these factories as they reach U.S. ports.  In addition,  some factories were found to warrant additional monitoring by the STC.   They were listed as low risk and their shipments were not targeted for  review when they reached U.S. ports.", "Although the share of targeted factories found to have problems is  relatively high, the factories that CBP targeted were those that generally  had some indication of risk, based on intelligence or trade data analysis.  Also, the targeted manufacturers that were visited (about 1,700) during the  4-year period generally make up a small share of the total number of  manufacturers in each country.  However, for smaller trade partners, such  as those that receive trade preferences under the Caribbean Basin Trade  Partnership Act (CBTPA) or African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA),  CBP can visit a sizable share of the factories within the country because  their overall number of factories is smaller.  For El Salvador and Nicaragua,  CBP has visited about 10 percent of the factories, and for Swaziland and  Botswana, CBP has visited about 22 and 28 percent of the factories,  respectively.", "Due to the small share of factories that CBP can actually visit, the STC says  it is developing evaluation tools to improve CBP\u2019s process of targeting  foreign manufacturers for TPVT visits.  Currently, the STC tracks the  number and results of the TPVT visits in order to assess whether the  targeted factories were actually found to have problems by the TPVT visits.   CBP says it is developing a database to keep track of the specific criteria it  used to target manufacturers for TPVT visits.  It plans to use the results of  the TPVT visits to identify which criteria were most useful in its targeting  process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CBP Identified More Than 2,400 Shipments in 2002", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, CBP identified 2,482 high-risk shipments (entries) for greater  scrutiny or review\u2014less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the more than 3  million textile and apparel entries that year.

Of the shipments reviewed,  about 24 percent resulted in exclusions from U.S. commerce, 2 percent in  penalties, and 1 percent in seizures.  To choose shipments for review, CBP  headquarters uses information collected from TPVT factory visits as well as  other intelligence information to create criteria for its targeting system.   When shipments match these criteria, they are flagged at the ports for a  review.  For instance, when a TPVT visit finds that a foreign factory has  been permanently closed, CBP will place this information in its automated  system to be used as criteria for targeting any shipments destined for entry  into the United States that claimed to have been produced in that factory.   In addition, other information such as prior shipment reviews or  intelligence information concerning possible illegal activity by  manufacturers, importers, or other parties can be entered as criteria to stop  shipments.

According to CBP officials, they can pursue penalties  against these companies, because this pattern of behavior may violate  reasonable care provisions of U.S. trade laws.  CBP also uses this  information and other intelligence it collects to target for review shipments  that these importers receive.  In addition to this targeting, CBP\u2019s Regulatory  Audit division has traditionally conducted internal control audits of  importers, and it uses a separate targeting process to identify the importers  that it will audit.

First, the number of  foreign factories and shipments targeted is limited by the ability of CBP to  conduct the reviews.  As previously discussed, CBP is able to visit only a  small share of the foreign factories exporting textile and apparel products  to the United States. The results of these visits then provide key  information for targeting shipments for review as they arrive at U.S. ports.   Similarly, CBP targets only a small share of textile and apparel shipments  to U.S. ports for review.  CBP officials with whom we met said CBP limits  the number of shipments it targets for port reviews because port staff are  unable to effectively examine a significantly larger number of shipments.", "In addition to resource constraints due to security (previously discussed),  reviewing shipments for textile transshipment is labor intensive and  involves more than a simple visual inspection of the merchandise.  Unlike  cases involving narcotics in which physical inspections alone can lead to  discovery of the drugs, physical inspections of textile or apparel products  rarely provide sufficient evidence of transshipment.  Port staff generally  needs to scrutinize detailed production documentation, which is time  consuming, to determine a product\u2019s origin and assess the likelihood of  transshipment.", "Second, staff constraints restrict the extent to which CBP can utilize and  develop its targeting process. As of December 2, 2003, the STC had 25  percent of its staff positions unfilled (3 out of 12 positions), while its  responsibilities are growing as trade agreements are increasing.  For each  new trade agreement, STC staff monitor trade and investment patterns to  detect whether anomalies are developing that should be targeted.   Consequently, CBP officials said that resource constraints have meant that  several types of analysis that the STC planned on conducting have either  been delayed or not conducted at all.  These included analyses of high-risk  countries, improvements to existing targeting processes, and studies of  alternative targeting techniques.  Despite these resource limitations, CBP  and the STC, in particular, have made regular improvements to the  targeting process.

The result is that, even at the larger ports, fewer  CBP inspectors are knowledgeable about a specific commodity, such as  textiles. These inspectors now have less time and expertise to inspect  textile shipments.  For example, at all but one of the ports we visited,  inspectors were mainly pulling sample garments from shipments for import  specialists to examine rather than acting as an additional, knowledgeable  source on textiles who could do a first level of review.", "As a result, the import specialists have become more critical in preventing  textile transshipment.  About 900 import specialists work at the ports, of  which approximately 255 are assigned to work on textiles, according to a  senior CBP official.  These specialists have always been central to  determining whether illegal textile transshipment has occurred, because  visual inspection is usually not sufficient.  While physical clues such as cut  or resewn labels can provide an indicator that a garment should be further  examined, in many cases nothing about the garment itself indicates that a  problem exists.  To establish textile transshipment, import specialists must  request production documents from the importer (who, in turn, requests  them from the manufacturer) and review them to see if they support the  claimed country of origin.  This is a highly complex, technical, and labor- intensive process.", "Import specialists (or at some ports, entry specialists or inspectors) review  the basic entry paperwork for all textile shipments arriving at the ports that  are covered by quotas or need visas.  They will place a hold on a textile  shipment: 1. if there are \u201cnational criteria,\u201d that is, if headquarters has entered an  alert in the Automated Commercial System (ACS), CBP\u2019s computer  system for imports, based on targeting, TPVT findings, and other risk  factors, to detain all shipments from that manufacturer or to that  importer and request production documents;  2. if there are \u201clocal criteria,\u201d that is, the port has entered an ACS alert  based on concerns particular to that port;  3. if the port has conducted its own targeting on shipments arriving at the  port and found questionable entries;  4. if there are abnormalities in the paperwork that warrant further review;  or 5. if there is other information that may be provided by domestic industry,  the Office of Textiles and Apparel at the Commerce Department, CITA,  foreign governments, or informants.", "In most cases, shipments with national criteria will automatically be  detained, a sample pulled from the shipment, and production verification  documents requested.

A good example of such an arrangement is CBP\u2019s present  relationship with Hong Kong customs authorities.  The Hong Kong Trade  and Industry Department has established an extensive system for  regulating Hong Kong\u2019s textile industry, which it enforces together with the  Customs and Excise Department.

Hong Kong also  provides self-policing assistance to CBP.  Hong Kong officials conduct  follow-up investigations on findings by the TPVTs, called Joint Factory  Observation Visits in Hong Kong, which have resulted in numerous  cancelled or suspended export licenses.  Hong Kong officials have also  actively prosecuted and convicted individuals violating Hong Kong\u2019s textile transshipment laws. As it is a matter of public record, CBP gets the names  of those companies that have been convicted of violations. Macau and  Taiwan also provide CBP with such information.

In some countries, customs authorities may be  constrained by domestic laws that either limit their authority or do not  extend sufficient authority to adequately enforce textile transshipment  provisions in their bilateral agreements with the United States.  For  example, government officials in El Salvador said that they do not have the  same authority that U.S. CBP has in requesting production documentation  from Salvadoran factories, because such authority is not provided in their  customs laws. Such lack of authority was also an issue that USTR  addressed when it negotiated the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement  (FTA), finalized in 2003.

Port management officials we  spoke with at two major ports stated that since the September 11 attacks,  resources have shifted to other antiterrorism areas.  In addition, because  brokers for in-bond shipments at the port of arrival provide very little  information regarding shipments, targeting of in-bond shipments is difficult  to conduct (See fig. 9 for illustration of in-bond shipment process and  points of concern).", "CBP officials at most of the ports we visited cited resource constraints as a  top reason for not inspecting in-bond shipments.  For example, CBP  officials at the Los Angeles/Long Beach, California, port\u2014one of the  busiest, with the highest volume of in-bond entries\u2014told us that the  current understaffing does not allow examination for many in-bond  shipments.  Moreover, results from our survey showed that more than 80  percent of the 13 area ports we surveyed do not have full-time staff  dedicated to inspecting in-bond shipments.  Some ports responded that if  they had more staff dedicated to in-bond shipments, they would have a  greater ability to inspect in-bond shipments.  In addition, seven of the eight  largest ports that responded to our survey stated that inspectors dedicate  less than 10 percent of their time to in-bond inspections.   For example,  CBP officials at the port of New York/Newark said that they estimated that  less than 2 percent of in-bond entries are actually inspected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nature of In-bond Regulations May Make It Difficult to Monitor In-bond Shipments", "paragraphs": ["According to several CBP in-bond personnel we spoke with at two ports,  certain provisions in the in-bond regulations make it more difficult to track  in-bond shipments.  These regulations pertain to (1) whether importers can  change a shipment\u2019s final destination without notifying CBP and (2) the  time allowed for in-bond shipments to reach their final destination.", "Under the regulations, an in-bond shipment can be diverted to any Customs  port without prior notification to CBP, except where diversions are  specifically prohibited or restricted.  For example, an importer with a  shipment arriving in Los Angeles may declare that it will travel in-bond to  Cleveland, Ohio.  However, after filing the paperwork, the importer may  then elect to change the final destination to New York, without filing new  paperwork or informing CBP.  The information provided to CBP at the port  of arrival will still state Cleveland as a final destination.  CBP has no way of  knowing where the shipment is going until and if it shows up at another  port.", "For in-bond shipments of textiles or textile products, a change in  destination requires approval of CBP\u2019s director at the port of origin.  However, officials at three ports that handle high volumes of textile in-bond  shipments said that they were either unaware of the regulation or that it  was too difficult to enforce due to the high volume of shipments they  processed.", "Another problem CBP in-bond personnel mentioned in monitoring in-bond  movements is the extensive time allowed to carriers to transport  merchandise across the country.  The Tariff Act of 1930 established the in- bond system and CBP regulations set time limits at 30 days for the delivery  of merchandise at the port of destination for entry or for exportation.   Port officials stated that this time limit is excessive and may contribute to  the diversion of cargo by giving carriers too much time to move  merchandise to different locations.  Tracking would be easier if a carrier  had a more restricted time period during which brokers or carriers would  have to close out the in-bond, such as 10 to 20 days, depending on the  distance between the port of arrival and the final port of destination,  according to these CBP officials.", "Mexico\u2019s in-bond system works differently than the U.S. system.  In fact,  when we spoke with Mexican Customs officials at the port of Nuevo  Laredo in Mexico regarding illegal textile transshipment, they said that  their in-bond system could track the movement of goods more easily  because (1) importers were not allowed to change the final destination and  (2) carriers are given a certain time limit to deliver merchandise, depending  on the distance between the port of arrival and the port of destination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shipments Declaring Exportation to Mexico Lack Sufficient Monitoring to Ensure Actual Exportation", "paragraphs": ["Several BICE investigations have uncovered in-bond fraud concerning  textile shipments that were allegedly exported to Mexico but instead  entered into U.S. commerce to circumvent quota and duty payment.  To  cope with this problem, BICE officials in Laredo, Texas, initiated an effort  to improve the verification of exports to Mexico by requiring that for  shipments processed for immediate exportation, brokers had to submit a  Mexican document known as a \u201cpedimento,\u201d as proof that shipments were  exported to Mexico.  However, these documents are easily falsified and can  be sold to willing buyers for submission to CBP, according to Laredo CBP  officials.  When we spoke with Mexican Customs officials at the Nuevo  Laredo, Mexico, port, they acknowledged that reproducing false  government pedimentos is easy to do and that it is not a reliable method for  verifying exportations.  The broker community in Laredo, Texas, also  expressed serious concerns with fraudulent activity by some Mexican  government officials.   They suspected that pedimentos were being sold by  some Mexican Customs officials to facilitate the diversion of goods into the  United States.  In fact, in August 2003, the port director of Nuevo Laredo,  Mexico, was indicted for selling false Mexican government documents for  $12,000 each.", "Moreover, many ports along the U.S.-Mexican border do not have export  lots where trucks with shipments bound for Mexico can be physically  examined to ensure that the shipments are actually exported to Mexico  instead of entering the U.S. commerce.   Although export lots were  opened at one time, they have been closed at many ports as a result of  resource constraints.  When export lots were open, inspectors were able to  verify exportation because carriers were required to physically present the  truck with the shipments for inspection.", "Since our review began, CBP has opened an export lot in Laredo, Texas,  and has required that all shipments declared for export to Mexico be  presented and inspected at the export lot.  However, not all ports along the  border have export lots, and Laredo in-bond personnel have noticed that as  a result many trucks were now choosing to clear their goods through those  ports without export lots.  CBP officials we interviewed in Laredo, along  with the members of the Laredo broker community, have raised this  concern and have noted the need to reopen export lots as a way to  minimize fraud.", "As of October 20, 2003, a CBP directive mandated that all merchandise to  be exported should be presented for export certification.  Certification is  not to take place until the merchandise is physically located where export  is reasonably assured.  According to a senior CBP official, as a result of this  directive, ports with export facilities have reopened them or provided a  reasonable alternative such as reporting to the import facility.  He also  stated that CBP has developed plans to verify that at least a representative  sample of reported exports are actually reported.

Depending on the circumstances, CBP may pursue the following  enforcement actions:    Exclusion of the textile shipment.  CBP can exclude textiles from entry  if the importer has not been able to prove country of origin.  Before  admitting goods into the United States, CBP may ask for production  records, review them, and then make a determination on origin.  The  importer must be able to prove the textiles\u2019 country of origin.  If CBP  cannot clear the goods within 30 days, the textiles are automatically  excluded.  CBP may also deny entry of textiles if production documents  reveal that the textiles were produced at a factory identified in the  Federal Register by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile  Agreements, as discussed below.", "Seizure of the textile shipment.  CBP can seize the textiles, if it has  evidence that violations of a law have occurred. By law, seizure is  mandatory if textiles are stolen, smuggled, or clandestinely imported.    In other instances, CBP can exercise discretion in deciding whether  seizure is the most appropriate enforcement action.  When seizure is  invoked, CBP takes physical possession of the merchandise.  In order  for textiles to be seized, there must be specific statutory authority that  allows for the seizure.", "Imposition of penalties.  CBP has several administrative penalties  available, based on the nature of the violation.  CBP may levy  administrative penalties locally at the port level without conducting an  investigation.  Alternatively, CBP may refer a suspected violation for an  investigation by BICE.  The outcome of the BICE investigation may be a  referral to (1) CBP for an administrative penalty or (2) a referral to the  U.S. Attorney for possible criminal prosecution of the importer and its  principal officers and the imposition of criminal monetary penalties.   Thus, some monetary penalties result from investigations performed by  BICE, while others simply result from activity within a port.  In addition  to civil administrative penalties, CBP may also assess liquidated  damages claims against bonded cartmen (carriers) implicated in  violations involving cargo transported in-bond.  CBP\u2019s Office of Fines,  Penalties and Forfeitures is responsible for assessing certain penalty  actions for transshipment violations and is responsible for adjudicating  penalties, liquidated damages claims and seizures occurring at the ports,  up to a set jurisdictional amount.", "Pursuit of judicial criminal or civil prosecutions.  CBP may refer unpaid  civil administrative penalty or liquidated damages cases to the  Department of Justice for the institution of collection proceedings  either in federal district court or in the Court of International Trade.

The importer can ship to another  country, abandon, or destroy the excluded textiles.", "CBP may elect not to levy penalties on excluded goods where culpability of  the importer cannot be established, and generally issues penalties against  the importer only if the importer is implicated or the transshipped textiles  entered the commerce of the United States.  However, a senior CBP official  said that the exclusion of textiles is considered a better deterrent than  penalties because the importer cannot receive the goods and, therefore,  cannot get them into U.S. stores that are waiting for them\u2014often for  seasonal shopping.   Also, the complexity and length of investigations and  litigation are no longer of concern, since the goods are simply excluded  from entering the United States.  Table 3 presents port-level data on  selected enforcement actions in 2000 to 2002.", "The investigative phase for textile transshipment cases can be a complex  and lengthy effort, resulting in few criminal penalties.

They also may have  to subpoena banks, interview brokers and shippers, get foreign government  cooperation, and pursue new leads as they arise.  A BICE official noted that  it is often difficult to pursue textile transshipment criminal cases because,  unlike with some crimes, there is no \u201csmoking gun\u201d at the port.  For  example, when drugs are found, the drugs themselves are evidence of the  violation.  With textile transshipment, an illegal T-shirt will look no  different than a legal one.  The basis for the violation is established by  proving that a false country of origin was knowingly claimed and that the  importer intended to commit fraud, committed negligence, or gross  negligence.", "Although CBP does not keep records on the length of time for disposition  of cases, import specialists and inspectors voiced concern that  investigations can be lengthy.  For example, a senior CBP official noted that  in 1989, there were 83 illegal entries.  Although some civil cases went to the  Court of International Trade in 1990, the first decisions were made in 1993,  and the last were not decided until 1995, 1997, and 1999.  Two of the larger  civil cases against multinational corporations took 7 and 10 years to pursue  at the Court of International Trade.  Accordingly, CBP has a process in  place to determine whether to accept offers to settle civil cases out of  court, which includes evaluating the litigation risk and the resources CBP  would have to devote to a trial.", "One factor relating to the length of the case is that, if BICE initiates a  criminal investigation, any action relating to that case is held in abeyance  pending possible criminal prosecution of the case.  If sufficient evidence  exists to justify a criminal prosecution, the case then goes to the U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Office.  This move delays related civil proceedings.  BICE  officials in Los Angeles/Long Beach noted that U.S. attorneys are short on  resources, since they are also working on drug-smuggling and money- laundering investigations; and in the past 10 years in that district, fewer  than 10 cases have been sent to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and prosecuted.   They noted, though, that the U.S. attorneys had not rejected any textile  transshipment cases that BICE had brought to them.  Neither CBP nor the  Justice Department could provide exact figures on the numbers of  prosecutions of illegal textile transshipments, but CBP officials noted that  the figures were low.", "In addition, investigating a case may entail allowing the suspect textile  transshipments to continue for a while, to obtain sufficient evidence.   However, investigators can be pulled off a particular textile investigation  for a higher priority; and then the textile case sits, with CBP sometimes  never getting back to it, according to a senior CBP official.", "When CBP pursues a case, the monetary amounts of the penalties may get  reduced, according to CBP staff, in line with CBP\u2019s mitigation guidelines.   CBP data are not available to summarize the penalty amounts assessed and  the final mitigated penalty amounts.  But in one example, CBP discovered  that a company transshipped $600,000 worth of blue jeans to evade quota  and visa restrictions.  Company officials pled guilty and, in the end, paid  CBP civil penalties totaling only $53,000.

First, the previously discussed weaknesses  in the system make it difficult for CBP to track in-bond movements and  catch the violators.  Second, when CBP discovers a breach of a bond by a  bonded cartman (carrier), the total liability associated with the bond  breach is limited to the value of the bond, rather than the value of the  merchandise.  Additionally, it is difficult for CBP to enforce payment of  unpaid penalties and liquidated damages because the Department of  Justice does not have sufficient resources available to prosecute all the  referrals for collections actions.", "Because in-bond shipments are not tracked, CBP cannot account for all the  in-bond shipments that fail to fulfill the requirements of timely cargo  delivery. According to a senior BICE official involved in in-bond  investigations, when an investigation is initiated, BICE must physically  track the cargo to prove a violation has occurred. This is difficult because  the cargo is often not at the port but at a warehouse, and CBP\u2019s surveillance  must be constant in order to establish that the cargo was not exported.", "When CBP does find in-bond diversion occurring, it typically seeks  liquidated damages for breach of the bond.  When CBP demands payment  of liquidated damages, the claim cannot exceed the amount of the bond.   Several CBP and BICE officials stated that the bond amounts set by CBP  regulations are low, compared with the value of the merchandise.  The  original bond amount for textile entries relates to the total value of  shipments.  However, according to BICE officials, convention has allowed  bonds for bonded cartmen (carrier) to be generally set at $25,000-$50,000 a  year\u2014a minimal amount that, as one BICE investigator put it, is the \u201ccost of  doing business.\u201d   For example, if a textile shipment with a domestic value  of $1 million is illegally diverted, liquidated damages can be set at three  times the value of the merchandise.  However, if the bond is set at $50,000,  the demand for payment of liquidated damages cannot go above this bond  amount.  Furthermore, violators may request mitigation of the $50,000 fine  so that the resulting mitigation may only be as little as $500.  Bond  amounts are usually set every calendar year and, if the liquidated damages  claims in one year exceed that year\u2019s bond amount, the next year\u2019s bond  cannot be used to pay the liquidated damages incurred the previous year.", "In 1989, CBP recognized the problem in which the amount of delinquent  liquidated damages claims against a bonded carrier exceeded the amount  of the bond.  CBP then issued a directive that required district directors to periodically review bond sufficiency.  CBP again issued directives in 1991  and 1993 to provide guidelines for the determination of bond sufficiency.

The  actual number of textile and apparel shipments CBP reviews at the ports is  low (less than 0.01 percent), and in 2002 about 24 percent of these reviews  resulted in exclusions, 2 percent in penalties, and 1 percent in seizures.   CBP\u2019s overall efforts at deterrence are aimed more at excluding problem  shipments from U.S. commerce and emphasizing importer compliance  responsibilities rather than at pursuing enforcement actions in the courts,  due to the complexity and length of the investigative process and past  experiences with ultimate imposition of minimal penalties.  The low  likelihood of review and minimal penalties limit the system\u2019s deterrent  effect and make high-quality intelligence and targeting essential to focusing  limited resources on the highest risk overseas factories and shipments.   Although textile import quotas on WTO members will be eliminated on  January 1, 2005, with the expiration of the Agreement on Textiles and  Clothing, the roles of the STC and the port import specialists will continue  to be important, because incentives will continue to exist to illegally  transship merchandise through countries benefiting from trade preferences  and free trade agreements.  In addition, quotas will remain on Vietnam until  its WTO accession, and quotas may be placed into effect on certain imports  from China under the safeguard provision of China\u2019s WTO Accession  Agreement.", "Because transshipment will remain a concern beyond this coming year,  CBP will still face challenges in implementing its monitoring system.  First,  CBP has been slow to follow up on some of the findings from the TPVT  factory visits, which are one of the key sources of information used in  decisions on what textile shipments to review.  CBP has not fully made the  results of these trips known and acted quickly by entering all national  criteria at an earlier stage rather than waiting until CBP approves the TPVT  report.  CBP has the authority to review any shipments presented for  import.  The result of waiting for TPVT report approval may mean that  some suspect shipments are not reviewed or inspected at the ports.   Second, CBP faces challenges in ensuring that additional import specialists  are placed in Customs Attach\u00e9 Offices overseas to assist with textile  monitoring and enforcement activities.  CBP would be able to further  facilitate cooperation on textile issues, follow up on TPVT findings, and  supplement the enforcement information it needs to trigger port textile  reviews if it placed more import specialists in Customs Attach\u00e9 Offices in  high-risk countries.", "In addition, we found weaknesses in CBP\u2019s current monitoring of in-bond  cargo transiting the United States, and CBP has only in the last year begun  to intensively address the issue of in-bond textile and apparel shipments  being diverted into U.S. commerce.  CBP\u2019s current in-bond procedures may  facilitate textile transshipment by allowing loosely controlled interstate  movement of imported cargo upon which no quota or duty has been  assessed.   Internal control weaknesses have meant that CBP places an  unacceptably high level of reliance on the integrity of bonded carriers and  importers.  Without an automated system and detailed and up-to-date  information on in-bond shipments, CBP cannot properly track the  movement of in-bond cargo.   In addition, limited port targeting and  inspections of in-bond shipments constitute a major vulnerability in  monitoring possible textile transshipments and other areas of national  security.  CBP\u2019s regulations regarding delivery time and shipment  destination also hinder proper monitoring.  Unless these concerns are  addressed, proper revenue collection, compliance with trade agreements,  and enforcement of national security measures cannot be ensured.  While  CBP has taken some preliminary steps, much remains to be done before  the in-bond system has an acceptable level of internal controls.", "Moreover, CBP\u2019s system for assessing liquidated damages does not provide  a strong deterrent against in-bond diversion.   With bond amounts set  considerably lower than the value of the merchandise and mitigation of  liquidated damages down to a fraction of the shipment value, violators may  see paying the bond as a cost of doing business and may not perceive it as a  deterrent against the diversion of goods.

As discussed with Committee representatives, we have  focused on answering the following questions: (1) how CBP identifies  potential textile transshipment, (2) how well CBP\u2019s textile review process  works to prevent illegal textile transshipment, (3) how effectively CBP  monitors foreign textiles transiting the United States in its in-bond system  before entering U.S. commerce or being exported, and (4) what challenges  CBP experienced in using penalties and other means to deter illegal textile  transshipment.", "To examine how CBP identifies potential textile transshipment, we  reviewed and analyzed internal planning documents and trade studies from  the Office of Strategic Trade\u2019s Strategic Trade Center (STC) in New York  City, which conducts analysis and targeting of textile transshipment.  We  also analyzed CBP foreign factory and cargo shipment reports and  summaries from the STC; the Office of Field Operations\u2019 Textile  Enforcement and Operations Division at CBP\u2019s headquarters; and some  ports of entry, from 2000 to 2003.  We collected and analyzed data from  2000 to 2003 on the targeting process from CBP\u2019s internal database and  documents and reviewed how CBP collected the data. We examined the  data for their reliability and appropriateness for our purposes.  We found  the data to be sufficiently reliable to represent CBP\u2019s targeting activity.  In  addition, we also collected official U.S. international trade statistics from  the Census Bureau for 1993 to 2002, textile and apparel production  statistics from the Census Bureau (Annual Survey of Manufacturers) for  1993 to 2001, and employment statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  (Current Employment Survey) for 1993 to 2002.  We defined \u201ctextile and  apparel goods for international trade,\u201d based on the definition in the World  Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (Annex),  as well as additional textile and apparel goods not covered by the  agreement but identified as textile and apparel goods by the Department of  Commerce\u2019s Office of Textiles and Apparel on the Department of  Commerce\u2019s Web site.  We reviewed these statistics for their reliability and  appropriateness for our purposes and found them sufficiently reliable to  represent the trends and magnitude of trade, production, and employment  in the textile and apparel sector.  We also observed a targeting session at  the STC in preparation for a foreign factory visit to El Salvador.  In  addition, we interviewed CBP officials in the Office of Strategic Trade\u2019s  STC and Regulatory Audit Division, the Office of Field Operations, and in  seven ports of entry (New York/Newark, New York; Los Angeles/Long  Beach, California; Laredo, Texas; Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio; and  Seattle and Blaine, Washington) about their targeting activities and roles.  Together, these ports represent CBP service ports that processed 55  percent of textiles and apparel imported into the United States in 2002.   However, we recognize that activities among individual ports of entry  within CBP service port areas may vary from ports that we visited.  To gain  additional perspectives on CBP\u2019s targeting operations, we interviewed  officials of the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR), as well as former Customs officials and private  sector business associations.", "To examine CBP\u2019s textile review process to prevent illegal textile  transshipment, we reviewed internal planning documents, directives, and  reports of the Office of Field Operations\u2019 Textile Enforcement and  Operations Division, the Office of International Affairs, and the Office of  Strategic Trade\u2019s STC and Regulatory Audit Division covering the years  1999 to 2003.  We visited seven ports of entry and observed operations.  To  review CBP\u2019s foreign factory visits, we observed a Textile Production  Verification Team (TPVT) visit in El Salvador.  To report on CBP\u2019s overall  textile review activity, we collected data on TPVT visits and port-level  textile review activity from 1996 to 2003 from CBP\u2019s internal database and  documents.  We reviewed how CBP collected the data and examined the  data for their reliability and appropriateness for our purposes.  We found  the data to be sufficiently reliable to represent CBP\u2019s foreign factory  inspections and port-level activity.  We interviewed CBP officials in the  Office of Field Operations, the Office of International Affairs, the Office of  Strategic Trade, and the seven ports of entry we visited.  We also  interviewed officials of the Department of Commerce, including the  Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) and the  Office of Textiles and Apparel; USTR; and the Department of State; as well  as former Customs officials and private sector business associations.  In  addition, we interviewed customs and trade officials in Hong Kong and  Macao, as well as a Mexican embassy trade official in Washington, D.C.,  and Mexican port officials in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.  We communicated  with Canadian officials through an exchange of written questions and  answers.", "To review how CBP uses its in-bond system to monitor foreign textiles  transiting the United States before entering U.S. commerce or being  exported, we observed in-bond operations at six of the ports of entry we  visited: Newark, New Jersey/New York, New York; Long Beach/Los  Angeles, California; Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio; Laredo, Texas; and  Blaine, Washington.  We reviewed documents on CBP\u2019s in-bond operations  from the Office of Field Operations\u2019 Cargo Verification Division, as well as  documents on in-bond penalties from the Office of Field Operations\u2019 Fines,  Penalties, and Forfeitures Branch.  We conducted interviews on the in-bond  system with CBP officials in the Cargo Verification Division; the Fines,  Penalties, and Forfeitures Branch; and the Textile Enforcement and  Operations Division at headquarters; and at the ports of entry and Bureau  of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE) headquarters and Field  Offices.", "In addition, we conducted a survey of in-bond activities at 11 major U.S.  area ports that process the highest levels of textile and apparel imports and  2 smaller area ports that also process textile and apparel imports.  For each  area port, we also requested that the survey be distributed to two  additional subports that also processed textile and apparel imports.  We  asked ports to respond to the survey, based on in-bond activities from  October 2001 to May 2003.  We received responses from all 13 area ports  and 29 subports we surveyed.  We selected ports for our survey, based on  four criteria: (1) ports with the highest value of textile and apparel imports;  (2) geographic distribution that included coastal, in-land, northern, and  southern border ports; (3) ports with the highest value of textile and  apparel imports by trade preference program (such as the African Growth  and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act); and  (4) ports of various sizes, allowing us to include smaller ports that also  process textile and apparel imports.  We found the data to be sufficiently  reliable to review how the in-bond system monitors foreign textiles  transiting the United States.  Not all ports were able to provide data for the  entire time period requested; therefore, we were not able to use some of  the data for the missing time period.  In addition, although we received a  100-percent response rate, the in-bond data we received from the 13 area  ports and 29 subports are not representative of in-bond operations at all  Customs ports.  Copies of the survey are available from GAO.", "To examine the challenges CBP experienced in using penalties and other  means to deter illegal textile transshipment, we reviewed internal planning  documents, memorandums, and reports, dating from 1999 to 2003, from  former Office of Investigations officials now in the BICE, as well as from  CBP\u2019s Offices of Chief Counsel; Field Operations (including the Textile  Enforcement and Operations Division and the Fines, Penalties, and  Forfeitures Division); Strategic Trade, (including the STC and Regulatory  Audit Division); and Regulations and Rulings.  We also reviewed CBP\u2019s  enforcement authorities in the relevant statutes and federal regulations, as  well as reviewing informed compliance publications and other information  on CBP\u2019s and BICE\u2019s Web sites.  We collected data on CBP\u2019s enforcement  and penalty actions for the years 2000 to 2002, from CBP\u2019s internal  databases and documents.

Elimination of these quotas is likely to affect  trade patterns as more efficient producers acquire greater market share.   Tariffs and other potential barriers, however, such as antidumping and  safeguard measures, still exist and could still affect trade patterns and  create an incentive for illegal textile transshipment.

As figure 10 shows, the  majority of U.S. textile and apparel imports are apparel products (about 73  percent in 2002).  The remaining imports consist of yarn (10 percent),  uncategorized textile and apparel products (9 percent), made-up and  miscellaneous textile products (7 percent), and fabric (2 percent).", "The major foreign suppliers of textile and apparel to the U.S. market are  China, Mexico, and the Caribbean Basin countries.   However, as figure 11  shows, no major supplier had more than a 15 percent share of overall  textile and apparel imports in 2002.  Also, after the top 10 suppliers,  remaining suppliers still provided more than a third of imports.  These  smaller suppliers include Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)  countries, which supplied $1.1 billion (about 1.4 percent) of imports, and  Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) countries,  which supplied $790 million (about 1 percent) of imports.", "Countries with free trade agreements (FTA) with the United States  accounted for 18.8 percent of total textile and apparel imports in 2002.

Other FTA partners\u2014 Chile, Israel, Jordan, and Singapore\u2014supplied the remaining 1.7 percent.   In addition, the United States is negotiating FTAs with several other  countries, which combined accounted for 15 percent of U.S. imports.  The  most important (in terms of imports) of these potential FTA partners are  the countries in the Central American FTA negotiations (Costa Rica, El  Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) and the Dominican  Republic, all of which are also part of the overall Free Trade Area of the  Americas (FTAA) negotiations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Top U.S. Ports", "paragraphs": ["The service ports of New York and Los Angeles were the top two recipients  of textile and apparel imports into the United States in 2002.

By 1995, the United States, the European  Union, Canada, and Norway were the only WTO members to maintain  quotas on textile and apparel.  Each agreed, however, to remove a share of  their quotas by January 1 in 1995, 1998, 2002, and 2005.  Based on 2002  Department of Commerce import statistics and our analysis, the United  States still maintains quotas on products that account for about 61 percent  of its textile and apparel imports by value.  Not all of these imports,  however, are subject to quotas because not all U.S. trade partners are  subject to quotas on these products.  For instance, U.S. textile and apparel  categories 338 and 339 (men and women\u2019s cotton knit shirts and blouses)  account for over 12 percent of U.S. imports of textile and apparel products,  and categories 347 and 348 (men and women\u2019s cotton trousers and shorts)  account for about another 13 percent.  Although several countries face U.S.  quotas in each of these categories, not all countries are restricted.   Therefore, quotas only limit a portion of the 25 percent of imports  accounted for by products in these categories.

For example, in 2002,  the U.S. International Trade Commission estimated that quota barriers  amounted to an approximately 21.4 percent tax on apparel imports and a  3.3 percent tax on textile imports.  However, these estimates were  calculated across all textile and apparel products and countries.  Therefore,  actual barriers may be significantly higher for certain highly restricted  products.  Upon removal of these quotas, trade patterns are likely to  change, with more efficient foreign suppliers that were formerly restricted  under the quotas capturing a larger share of the U.S. market.", "FTAs, though, will still provide preferential access to products that meet  rules of origin requirements from FTA partners.  FTAs generally provide  tariff-free access, while 2002 tariff rates on more restricted textile and  apparel products ranged from 15 to 33 percent.  Also, the United States  provides similar preferential access unilaterally to countries from the  Caribbean Basin, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Andean region under the  CBTPA, AGOA, and ATPDEA preferential programs.  Officials and experts  that we spoke with said they believed these tariff differentials to be a  significant incentive for continued illegal textile transshipment because  they act as a tax on textile and apparel products from non-FTA partners.   Also, under WTO rules, the United States may impose antidumping or  countervailing duties on imports from certain countries if it can be shown  that these products have either been \u201cdumped\u201d in the U.S. market or were  subsidized.  Furthermore, under China\u2019s accession agreement with the  WTO, members may impose a special safeguard mechanism on imports  from China if they are shown to cause market disruption.
