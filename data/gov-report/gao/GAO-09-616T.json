DOD also lacks information on why contractor personnel are used, which limits its ability to determine whether decisions to use contractors to supplement the in-house acquisition workforce are appropriate. GAO found that program office decisions to use contractor personnel are often driven by factors such as quicker hiring time frames and civilian staffing limits, rather than by the nature or criticality of the work. In comparison with DOD's practices, leading organizations maintain and analyze data on their contractor personnel and take a business-oriented approach to determining when to use contractor support. DOD also lacks key pieces of information that limit its ability to determine gaps in the acquisition workforce it needs to meet its missions. In addition to lacking information on contractor personnel, DOD lacks complete information on the skill sets of its in-house personnel. DOD also lacks information on the acquisition workforce it needs to meet its mission. Not having this information not only skews analyses of workforce gaps, but also limits DOD's ability to make informed workforce allocation decisions and determine whether the total acquisition workforce--in-house and contractor personnel--is sufficient to accomplish its mission. In comparison with DOD's practices, leading organizations identify gaps in the workforce by assessing the competencies of their workforces and comparing those with the overall competencies the organization needs to achieve its objectives. DOD recently initiated several efforts aimed at improving the management and oversight of its acquisition workforce, such as plans for overseeing additional hiring, recruiting, and retention activities. DOD is also planning to increase its in-house acquisition workforce by converting 11,000 contractor personnel to government positions and hiring an additional 9,000 government personnel by 2015.

Over the past several years,  changes in the federal acquisition environment have created significant  challenges to building and sustaining a capable acquisition workforce.  From fiscal years 2001 to 2008, DOD\u2019s spending on goods and services  more than doubled to $388 billion, and the number of weapon system  programs has also grown. Despite this substantial increase, the number of  civilian and military personnel in DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce has  remained relatively stable.

Today I will discuss the limitations of DOD\u2019s assessment of the  sufficiency of its total acquisition workforce and highlight some recent  DOD efforts to improve the management and oversight of that workforce. I  will also discuss selected practices of leading organizations that may  provide DOD with insights for its efforts. I will conclude with some  observations on what further actions the department should take to  address these challenges.", "This testimony is based primarily on our recent report Department of  Defense: Additional Actions and Data Are Needed to Effectively Manage  and Oversee DOD\u2019s Acquisition Workforce, as well as other prior GAO  products. We also conducted additional analyses on data we obtained  during our recent review of DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce management and  on updated data we obtained from DOD.

DOD defines its  acquisition workforce to include 13 career fields, based on the Defense  Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act of 1990. From fiscal years 2001  to 2008, the number of civilian and military acquisition personnel in these  13 fields declined overall by 2.6 percent; however, some career fields have  increased substantially\u2014test and evaluation\u2014while others have shown  dramatic declines\u2014business, cost estimating and financial management..  See appendix I for the number of military and civilian personnel in each of  the acquisition career fields in fiscal years 2001 and 2008, and the  percentage change between those years.", "Our prior work has shown that DOD has relied heavily on contractor  personnel to augment its in-house workforce. In March 2008, we reported  that in 15 of the 21 offices we reviewed, contractor personnel  outnumbered DOD personnel and comprised as much as 88 percent of the  workforce. In the other 6 offices, contractor personnel comprised  between 19 and 46 percent of the workforce.  Although this review did not  focus on the acquisition workforce, many of the 21 offices had acquisition  responsibilities.", "While use of contractors provides the government certain benefits, such as  increased flexibility in fulfilling immediate needs, we and others have  raised concerns about the federal government\u2019s services contracting, in  particular for professional and management support services, including  acquisition support services. In March 2008, we noted concern about one  DOD component\u2019s hiring contractor personnel in reaction to a shortfall in  the government workforce rather than as a planned strategy to help  achieve its mission. In our case study, we found that one Army  component was paying between 17 and 27 percent more on average for  contractor personnel working as contract specialists than for its  government employees who were doing equivalent work.", "In addition to the risk of paying more than necessary for the work that it  needs, is the risk of loss of government control over and accountability for  mission-related policy and program decisions when contractors provide  services that closely support inherently governmental functions, which  require discretion in applying government authority or value judgments in  making decisions for the government. The closer contractor services come  to supporting inherently governmental functions, the greater the risk of  their influencing the government\u2019s control over and accountability for  decisions that may be based, in part, on contractor work. Other concerns  about using contractor personnel include improper use of personal  services contracts and the increased potential for conflicts of interest,  both organizational and personal.", "Numerous components in DOD share policy and guidance responsibility  for the workforce. Among the components, the Office of the Under  Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L), is responsible  for managing DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce, including tailoring policies and  guidance specific to the acquisition workforce and managing the training  and certification of that workforce. In addition, each military service has  its own corresponding acquisition offices that develop additional service- specific guidance, and provide management and oversight of its  workforce. Within each service, the program offices identify acquisition  workforce needs, make decisions regarding the composition of the  workforce (the mix of civilian, military, and contractor personnel), and  provide the day-to-day management of the workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AT&L Lacks Comprehensive Information on the Use of Contractor Personnel in Its Acquisition Workforce", "paragraphs": ["DOD lacks critical departmentwide information on the use and skill sets of  contractor personnel performing acquisition-related functions. While DOD  planning documents state that the workforce should be managed from a  \u201ctotal force\u201d perspective\u2014which calls for contractor personnel to be  managed along with civilian and military personnel \u2014DOD has only  recently collected departmentwide data on contractor personnel  performing acquisition-related functions. According to an AT&L official,  DOD\u2019s baseline count shows that 52,000 contractor personnel are  supporting the acquisition workforce. As such, contractor personnel  comprise about 29 percent of DOD\u2019s total acquisition workforce. The  AT&L official noted that the contractor personnel tracking system is still  under development.", "Data we obtained from 66 program offices show that contractor personnel  comprised more than a third of those programs\u2019 acquisition-related  positions. Table 1 shows the data on contractor personnel reported by  the 66 program offices (see appendix II for more detailed information).", "DOD also lacks information on factors driving program offices\u2019 decisions  to use contractor personnel rather than hire in-house personnel. DOD  guidance for determining the workforce mix outlines the basis on which  officials should make decisions regarding what type of personnel\u2014 military, civilian, or contractor\u2014should fill a given position. The  guidance\u2019s primary emphasis is on whether the work is considered to be  an inherently governmental function, not on whether it is a function that is  needed to ensure institutional capacity.", "The guidance also states that using the least costly alternative should be  an important factor when determining the workforce mix. However,  when we asked program offices about their reasons for using contractor  rather than civilian personnel, we found that cost was cited by only 1  program office. The 30 program offices, which provided reasons for using  contractor personnel, cited the following key factors:  22 cited a shortage of civilian personnel with a particular expertise,  18 cited staffing limits on civilian personnel,  17 cited that the particular expertise sought is generally not hired by  the government,  15 cited the ease or speed of bringing on contractor personnel,  9 cited having a short-term requirement,  8 cited funding not being available for civilian personnel, and  1 cited the cost of contractor personnel being less than civilian  personnel  (See appendix III for information on the number of program offices  reporting the reasons for using contractor personnel by component.)", "In comparison with DOD\u2019s practices, we found that leading organizations  maintain and analyze data on their contractor personnel in order to  mitigate risks, ensure compliance with in-house regulations and security  requirements, and ensure that reliance on contractor personnel creates  value for the company. We also found that leading organizations take a  business-oriented approach to determining when to use contractor  support. For example, some companies generally use contractor personnel  to facilitate flexibility and meet peak work demands without hiring  additional, permanent, full-time employees. Some also place limits on their  use of contractor personnel, such as limiting the use of contractor  personnel to temporary support, to 1 year of operations, or to functions  that are not considered as core pieces of the company\u2019s main business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AT&L Lacks Key Pieces of Information Necessary to Conduct Workforce Gap Analyses", "paragraphs": ["AT&L lacks key pieces of information that hinder its ability to determine  gaps in the number and skill sets of acquisition personnel needed to meet  DOD\u2019s current and future missions.

AT&L is currently conducting a competency  assessment to identify the skill sets of its current in-house acquisition  workforce. While this assessment will provide useful information  regarding the skill sets of the current in-house acquisition workforce, it is  not designed to determine the size, composition, and skill sets of an  acquisition workforce needed to meet the department\u2019s missions.", "AT&L also lacks complete information on the acquisition workforce  needed to meet DOD\u2019s mission. The personnel numbers that AT&L uses to  reflect needs are derived from the budget. Because these personnel  numbers are constrained by the size of the budget, they likely do not  reflect the full needs of acquisition programs.

The inventory is required to include, among other  things, information identifying the missions and functions performed by  contractors, the number of full-time contractor personnel equivalents, and  the funding source for the contracted work.

In addition, without guidance on the appropriate  circumstances under which contractor personnel may perform acquisition  work, DOD runs the risk of not maintaining sufficient institutional  capacity to perform its missions, paying more than necessary for the work  that it needs, or losing control over and accountability for mission-related  policy and program decisions. Until DOD maintains more comprehensive  information on its contractor personnel, it will continue to have  insufficient information regarding the range of skills and the functions  performed by this key component of the acquisition workforce.

We recommended that the Secretary:      Collect and track data on contractor personnel who supplement the  acquisition workforce\u2014including their functions performed, skill sets,  and length of service\u2014and conduct analyses using these data to  inform acquisition workforce decisions.  Identify and update on an ongoing basis the number and skill sets of  the total acquisition workforce that the department needs to fulfill its  mission.", "Review and revise the criteria and guidance for using contractor  personnel to clarify under what circumstances and the extent to which  it is appropriate to use contractor personnel to perform acquisition- related functions.", "Develop a tracking mechanism to collect information on the reasons  contractor personnel are being used so that DOD can determine  whether the guidance has been appropriately implemented across the  department.", "We are pleased that DOD has implemented part of the first  recommendation by collecting departmentwide data on the number of  contractor personnel that support the acquisition workforce. We are  encouraged by DOD generally concurring with the rest of our  recommendations, although the department noted that collecting  information on the skill sets and length of service of contractor personnel  needed to be carefully considered. We agree that the manner in which data  on contractor personnel are to be collected should continue to be carefully  considered. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that comprehensive data  on contractor personnel are needed to accurately identify the  department\u2019s acquisition workforce gaps and inform its decisions on the  appropriate mix of in-house or contractor personnel.
