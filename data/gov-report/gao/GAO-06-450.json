HAVA required some major changes in the nation's elections processes, not all which had to be implemented by the November 2004 election. HAVA addressed issues of people, processes, and technology, all of which must be effectively integrated to ensure effective election operations. GAO initiated a review under the authority of the Comptroller General to examine an array of election issues of broad interest to Congress. For each major stage of the election process, this report discusses (1) changes to election systems since the 2000 election, including steps taken to implement HAVA, and (2) challenges encountered in the 2004 election. For this report, GAO sent a survey to the 50 states and the District of Columbia (all responded) and mailed a questionnaire to a nationwide sample of 788 local election jurisdictions about election administration activities (80 percent responded). To obtain more detailed information about experiences for the 2004 election, GAO also visited 28 local jurisdictions in 14 states, chosen to represent a range of election system characteristics."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In passing HAVA, Congress provided a means for states and local jurisdictions to improve upon several aspects of the election system, but it is too soon to determine the full effect of those changes. For example, 41 states obtained waivers permitted under HAVA until January 1, 2006, to implement a requirement for statewide voter registration lists. States also had discretion in how they implemented HAVA requirements, such as the identification requirements for first-time mail registrants. Some local election jurisdictions described different identification procedures for first-time mail registrants who registered through voter registration drives. Although states differed regarding where voters who cast provisional ballots for federal office must cast those ballots in order for their votes to be counted, provisional voting has helped to facilitate voter participation. HAVA also created the Election Assistance Commission, which has issued best practice guides and voluntary voting systems standards and distributed federal funds to states for improving election administration, including purchasing new voting equipment. The results of our survey of local election jurisdictions indicate that larger jurisdictions may be replacing older equipment with technology-based voting methods to a greater extent than small jurisdictions, which continue to use paper ballots extensively and are the majority of jurisdictions. As the elections technology environment evolves, voting system performance management, security, and testing will continue to be important to ensuring the integrity of the overall elections process. GAO found that states made changes--either as a result of HAVA or on their own--to address some of the challenges identified in the November 2000 election. GAO also found that some challenges continued--such as problems receiving voter registration applications from motor vehicle agencies, addressing voter error issues with absentee voting, recruiting and training a sufficient number of poll workers, and continuing to ensure accurate vote counting. At the same time, new challenges arose in the November 2004 election, such as fraudulent, incomplete, or inaccurate applications received through voter registration drives; larger than expected early voter turnout, resulting in long lines; and counting large numbers of absentee ballots and determining the eligibility of provisional voters in time to meet final vote certification deadlines."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The November 2004 presidential election was not as close as the 2000 presidential  election, but it still raised concerns about our election processes.

Faith in the fairness and  accuracy of the U.S. election system is at the foundation of our democracy.  Reports of problems encountered in the close 2000 presidential election  with respect to voter registration lists, absentee ballots, ballot counting,  and antiquated voting equipment raised concerns about the fairness and  accuracy of certain aspects of the U.S. election system.

Congressional authority to affect the administration of  elections derives from various constitutional sources, depending upon the  type of election. Congress has passed legislation in several major areas of  the voting process. For example, the National Voter Registration Act of  1993 (NVRA), expanded the opportunities for citizens to register to vote  for federal elections by, among other things, requiring most states to accept  registration applications for federal elections by mail and at state motor  vehicle agencies (MVA) and at certain other state agencies. The act also  requires that in the administration of elections for federal office, states are  to take certain steps to accurately maintain voter registration lists, and it  limits the circumstances for removing names from voter lists. The  Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (UOCAVA)  requires states to, among other things, permit uniformed services voters  absent from the place of residence where they are otherwise qualified to  vote, their dependents, and U.S. citizens residing outside the country to  register and vote absentee in elections for federal office.", "The Help America Vote Act was enacted into law on October 29, 2002. As  discussed below, the act includes a number of provisions related to voter  registration, provisional voting, absentee voting, voting equipment, and  other election administration provisions, and authorizes the appropriation  of funds to be used toward implementing the law\u2019s requirements. HAVA  also provides that the choices on the methods of implementation of such  requirements, for example, a computerized statewide voter registration list,  provisional voting, voter information requirements at the polling place,  identification requirements, and voting system standards (for ballot  verification, manual audit capacity, accessibility, and error rates), are left to  the discretion of the states. HAVA further specifies that such requirements  are minimum requirements and should not be construed to prevent states  from establishing election technology and administration requirements that  are stricter than HAVA requirements as long as they are not inconsistent  with certain other specified provisions.", "HAVA, in general, applies to all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  Areas covered by the law include  Computerized statewide voter registration list: HAVA requires most  states to implement a single, uniform, centralized, computerized  statewide voter registration list to serve as the official voter  registration list for the conduct of all elections for federal office in  each such state. Under HAVA, the computerized statewide voter  registration list was to have been implemented by 2004. However,   40 states and the District of Columbia received waivers to extend the  deadline until January 1, 2006. States are required to perform regular  maintenance of the voter list by comparing it to state records on  felons and deaths, and to match voter registration applicant  information on the voter list with information in the state motor  vehicle agency\u2019s records and Social Security Administration records,  as appropriate.", "Absentee ballots: HAVA contains various amendments to UOCAVA  regarding absentee voting for absent uniformed service voters and  certain other civilian voters residing outside of the United States.   The amendments, among other things, (1) required that the  secretaries of each military department, to the maximum extent  practicable, provide notice to military personnel of absentee ballot  deadlines, (2) extended the time that can be covered by a single  absentee ballot application from UOCAVA voters, and (3) prohibited  states from refusing to accept or process, with respect to federal  elections, a voter registration application or an absentee ballot  application by an absent uniformed services voter on the ground that  the application was submitted before the first date that the state  otherwise accepts or processes applications for that year from   nonuniformed service absentee voters.", "Provisional ballots: HAVA requires most states to implement  provisional voting for elections for federal office. Under HAVA, in an  election for federal office, states are to provide a provisional ballot to  an individual asserting (1) to be registered in the jurisdiction for  which he or she desires to vote and (2) eligible to vote in a federal  election but (3) whose name does not appear on the official list of  eligible voters for the polling place. Provisional ballots are also to be  provided in elections for federal office to individuals who an election  official asserts to be ineligible to vote, and for court-ordered voting in  a federal election after the polls have closed. These various types of  individuals, under HAVA, are to be permitted to cast the provisional  ballot upon the execution of written affirmation at the polling place  that they are registered voters in the jurisdiction and that they are  eligible to vote in that election. If election officials determine that the  individual is eligible under state law to vote, the individual\u2019s  provisional ballot is to be counted as a vote in accordance with state  law. HAVA also requires that a free access system be established to  inform voters if their votes were counted, and if not, the reason why.", "Polling places: HAVA provisions targeted, among other things,  improving information at polling places and Election Day  procedures. To improve the knowledge of voters regarding voting  rights and procedures, HAVA requires election officials to post  voting information at each polling place on the days of elections for  federal office, including, for example, a sample ballot, polling place  hours, how to vote, instructions for first-time voters who registered  by mail, and general information on federal and state voting rights  laws and laws prohibiting fraud and misrepresentation. The act also  authorized the appropriation of funds for payments to states for  educating voters concerning voting procedures, voting rights, and  voting technology. Under HAVA, voting systems used in elections for  federal office are required to meet specified accessibility  requirements for individuals with disabilities. With respect to  improving accessibility, HAVA also authorized the appropriation of  funds for payments to states to be used for improved accessibility of  polling places for, among others, individuals with disabilities and  those with limited English proficiency. HAVA also requires that such  voting systems provide individuals with disabilities with the same  opportunity for access and participation (including privacy and  independence) as for other voters. In connection with this  requirement, HAVA provides for the use of at least one direct  recording electronic (DRE) device or other voting system equipped  for individuals with disabilities at each polling place.", "Identification requirements: Under HAVA, states are to require that  certain voters who register by mail to provide specified types of  identification when voting at the polls or send a copy of the  identification with their mailed applications. Acceptable  identification includes a current and valid photo identification or  current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or  other government document that shows the name and address of the  voter. Under HAVA, voters at the polls who have not met the  identification requirement may cast a vote under HAVA\u2019s provisional  voting section. Similarly, mail-in ballots from persons who have not  provided the required identification also are to be counted as HAVA  provisional ballots.", "Election administration: HAVA also established an agency with  wide-ranging duties to help improve state and local administration of  federal elections. The Election Assistance Commission is to be  involved with, among other things, providing voluntary guidance to  states implementing certain HAVA provisions, serving as a national  clearinghouse and resource for information with respect to the  administration of federal elections, conducting studies, administering  programs that provide federal funds for states to make improvements  to some aspects of election administration, and helping to develop  testing for voting systems, and standards for election equipment.  EAC is led by four Commissioners, who are to be appointed by the  President and confirmed by the Senate. The Commissioners, who,  under HAVA, were to be appointed by February 26, 2003, were  appointed by the President in October 2003 and confirmed by the  Senate in December 2003. Since beginning operations in January  2004, EAC has achieved many of its objectives. Among other things,  EAC has held hearings on the security of voting technologies and the  national poll worker shortage; established a clearinghouse for  information on election administration by issuing two best practices  reports; distributed payments to states for election improvements,  including payments for voter education and voting equipment  replacement; drafted changes to existing federal voluntary standards  for voting systems; and established a program to accredit the  national independent certified laboratories that test electronic voting  systems against the federal voluntary standards. However, EAC has  reported that its delayed start-up affected its ability to conduct some  HAVA-mandated activities within the time frames specified in the act.  In turn, according to its fiscal year 2004 annual report, the delayed  EAC start-up affected states\u2019 procurement of new voting equipment  and the ability of some states and local jurisdictions to meet related  HAVA requirements by statutory deadlines.", "Voting systems: One of the primary HAVA provisions relates to  encouraging states to replace punch card voting systems and lever  voting systems and authorizing appropriations for payments to  support states in making federally mandated improvements to their  voting systems. A voting system includes the people, processes, and  technology associated with any voting method. It encompasses the  hardware and software used to define the ballot, conduct the vote,  and transmit and tally results, and system maintenance and testing  functions. With respect to standards for voting systems used in  elections for federal office, HAVA requirements for such systems  include providing voters with the ability to verify their votes before  casting their ballots, producing permanent paper records for manual  auditing of voting systems, and compliance of voting system ballot  counting error rates with those set out in specified federal voting  system standards. HAVA also directs that updates to the federal  voluntary voting system standards for these requirements be in place  by January 1, 2004, and provides for additional updates to the  voluntary standards as approved by the Election Assistance  Commission. Mechanisms are also specified that can be used by  states and localities in acquiring and operating voting systems,  including accreditation of laboratories to independently test and  evaluate voting systems and federal certification for voting systems  that undergo independent testing.", "The time frames for implementing various HAVA requirements ranged from  as early as 45 days after enactment (a deadline for establishing a grant  program for payment to the states for improved election administration) to  as late as January 1, 2006, for various voting system standards. Several  key deadlines were set for January 1, 2004, including implementation of  HAVA\u2019s provisional voting requirements and the establishment of a  statewide voter registration list (or to request a waiver from the deadline  until January 1, 2006). States receiving funds to replace punch card voting  systems or lever voting systems could also request a waiver until January 1,  2006; otherwise such systems were to be replaced in time for the November  2004 general elections. The deadline for states and jurisdictions to comply  with specific requirements for voting systems, such as producing a paper  record for audit purposes, was January 1, 2006.", "HAVA vests enforcement authority with the Attorney General to bring a  civil action against any state or jurisdiction as may be necessary to carry  out specified uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology and  administration requirements under HAVA.

The statewide registration lists for federal elections  are intended to implement a system capable of maintaining voter  registration lists that are more accurate by requiring states to (1) match  voter registration application information against other state and federal  agency databases or records to help ensure that only eligible voters are  added to such lists, (2) identify certain types of ineligible voters whose  names should be removed from the lists, and (3) identify individual voter  names that appear more than once on the list to be removed from the lists.

On the basis of our survey of state election officials, states varied in  the progress made in implementing their statewide voter registrations lists,  how they have implemented these systems, and the capabilities of their  systems to match information with other state and federal agency records  as well as many other features of the state systems.", "In addition to requiring states to develop statewide voter registration lists,  HAVA provides that states must require that mail registrants who have not  previously voted in a federal election in the state are to provide certain  specified types of identification with their mail application, and if they do  not provide such identification with their application, these first-time mail  registrants are to provide the identification at the polls. Furthermore, if  such a voter does not have the requisite identification at the polls, HAVA  requires that the voter be provided a provisional ballot with the status of  his or her ballot to be determined by the appropriate state or local official.  As with the statewide voter registration list requirement, HAVA leaves the  choices on the methods of implementing the provisional voting  requirement to the discretion of the states. On the basis of interviews of  officials in 28 local election jurisdictions, implementation of the  requirement for first-time voters who registered by mail varied. One  noteworthy variation is in the definition of mail registration, where some  local jurisdictions we visited told us that applications received through  voter registration drives would be treated as mail registrations subject to  HAVA identification requirements and other local jurisdictions we visited  told us applications from registration drives were not treated as mail  registrations and therefore were not treated as subject to HAVA  identification requirements.", "As noted above, during 2004 and 2005 many states were in the process of  implementing their HAVA-required statewide voter registration lists and  associated requirements for maintaining the lists. Thus, the potential  benefits to be gained from HAVA\u2019s requirement for the statewide voter  registration lists were not evident in many states at the time of the  November 2004 general election. Maintenance requirements in HAVA  intended to help states and local election jurisdictions to have access to  more accurate voter registration list information, such as identifying  duplicate registrations and matching the voter information against other  state agency databases or records, were not yet fully implemented by many  states. Many local jurisdictions were not yet seeing the benefits of being  able to verify voter registration application information with state motor  vehicle agency databases to identify eligible voters, or to match voter  registration lists with state vital statistics agency records to identify  deceased persons, and to appropriate state agency\u2019s records to identify  felons who may be ineligible to vote. Thus, on the basis of our nationwide  survey and local election jurisdictions we visited, many local jurisdictions  continued to encounter challenges with the voter registration lists that they  had experienced in the 2000 general election, such as difficulties related to  receiving inaccurate and incomplete voter registration information,  multiple registrations, or ineligible voters appearing on the list. In addition,  election officials in some jurisdictions we visited told us they continued to  face challenges obtaining voter registration applications from motor  vehicle agencies and other NVRA entities.", "In addition, for some local election jurisdictions we visited, election  officials told us that efforts on the part of various groups to get out the vote  by registering new voters through voter registration drives created new  challenges not identified to us as a problem in the 2000 general election.  Specifically, at some local jurisdictions we visited, election officials told us  they faced a challenge processing large volumes of voter registration  applications just prior to the deadlines for registration, which included  challenges in some large jurisdictions to resolve issues of incomplete or  inaccurate (and potentially fraudulent) applications submitted by entities  conducting voter registration drives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes Required by HAVA Subsequent to the 2000 General Election", "paragraphs": ["HAVA requires states to, among other things, (a) implement a single,  uniform, computerized statewide voter registration list for conducting  elections for federal office; (b) perform regular maintenance by comparing  the voter list against state records on felons and deaths; (c) verify  information on voter registration applications with information in state  motor vehicle agency databases or with a Social Security Administration  database, as appropriate.

At the time, some states had statewide voter  lists, but others did not and were not required to do so. Moreover, most  jurisdictions we visited at the time maintained their own local,  computerized voter lists. Under HAVA, this has changed. HAVA requires  the chief election official in the state to implement a \u201csingle, uniform,  official, centralized, interactive, computerized statewide voter registration  list\u201d that must contain the name and registration information of every  legally registered voter in the state. Under HAVA, states were required to be  in compliance with the statewide voter registration list requirement by  January 2004 unless they obtained a waiver until January 2006.

In connection with this  requirement to verify voter registration application information,  states must require that individuals applying to register to vote  provide a current and valid driver\u2019s license number, or the last four  digits of their Social Security number; if neither has been issued to  the individual, then the state is to assign a unique identifier to the  applicant. The state MVA must enter into an agreement with the  Social Security Administration (SSA), as applicable, to verify the  applicant information when the last four digits of the Social Security  number are provided, rather than a driver\u2019s license number or state  ID number.", "Perform list maintenance on the statewide voter registration lists by  coordinating them on a regular basis with state records on felony  status and deaths, in order to identify and remove names of ineligible  voters.

In January 2006, the Justice Department asked all states, the District  of Columbia, and other covered territories to provide a detailed statement  of their compliance with voting systems standards and implementation of a  single, uniform, official, centralized, interactive computerized statewide  voter registration list. If the states, the District of Columbia, or covered  territories were not implementing HAVA\u2019s requirements for the  computerized statewide voter registration lists as of January 2006, the  Justice Department reported that it then asked them to identify steps they  planned to take to achieve full implementation of the HAVA-compliant  statewide voter registration list and the date on which each step would be  accomplished. According to Justice Department officials, they are  reviewing the information provided by the states, the District of Columbia,  and such territories to make determinations of what, if any, enforcement  action might be needed. The Department of Justice reports that it entered  into a memorandum of agreement with California in November 2005 after  that state realized it would not be able to fully meet HAVA\u2019s requirements by  the January 1, 2006, deadline. On March 1, 2006, the Department of Justice  also filed suit in a federal district court against the state of New York  alleging the state not to be in compliance with, among other things, HAVA\u2019s  requirement for a computerized statewide voter registration list and  seeking a judicial determination of noncompliance and a court order  requiring the state to develop a plan for how it will come into compliance.", "During our site visits in 2005, we asked local election officials about the  status of their statewide registration systems. Election officials in some  local jurisdictions we visited cited difficulties related to implementing their  statewide voter registration systems involving, among other things, internal  politics and technology-related challenges. For example, election officials  in a large jurisdiction reported that a disagreement between the State  Board of Elections and local election officials over the type of system to  implement delayed the project for a year. State election officials wanted a  system requiring all voter registrations to be entered at the state level but  maintained locally. The local election officials expressed the view that such  a system would result in a lack of control over data entry at the local level  at the front end, while imposing accountability on them on the back end  (data maintenance). During our interview in August 2005, these election  officials told us that a statewide registration system had not been  implemented yet. In some jurisdictions, the difficulties cited by election  officials may have reflected the fact that they were establishing statewide  voter registration systems for the first time. For example, in 1 large  jurisdiction that was establishing a HAVA voter registration list from  scratch, local election officials noted that at the time of our interview in  August, the system was behind schedule, lacked the ability to identify  duplicates, had no quality control, and was not planned to function as a  real-time system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Capabilities for Matching Voter Registration Lists with State and Federal Records, as Required by HAVA, Were Under Way or Not Yet Achieved", "paragraphs": ["In our survey of states and the District of Columbia, and our survey of local  election jurisdictions nationwide, among other things, we inquired about  the status of their capabilities for meeting HAVA provisions for (1) verifying  voter registration application information against MVA and SSA databases  and (2) maintaining the statewide voter lists by comparing information on  the statewide voter registration list against state death records and felon  information, and discussed the issues during our local site visits. Our work  focused on how states had matched or planned to match voter registration  lists against other state records, as required by HAVA. However, it is  important to note that the success of such matching in ensuring accurate  voter registration lists is dependent upon the accuracy and reliability of the  data in the databases used for matching. If that state\u2019s MVA databases, felon  records, death records, or other records used for matching are inaccurate,  they can result in voter registration list errors.", "When a driver\u2019s license or driver\u2019s license number is presented as  identification when registering to vote in an election for federal office,  HAVA requires that states match the voter registration application  information presented with that in the MVA records. In our survey of state  election officials, we asked states whether their voter registration systems  would have the capability to perform electronic matching of such voter  registration information with state motor vehicle agency records for the  purposes of verifying the accuracy of information on the registration  application. Twenty-seven states reported they will have or currently had  the capability to match on a real-time basis, 15 states and the District of  Columbia reported they will have or currently had capability to match in  batches, and 4 states reported they would not have the capability to  perform electronic matching. The remaining 4 states included 2 states that  reported that they are not subject to HAVA\u2019s registration information  verification requirement because they collect the full Social Security  numbers on voter registration applications; 1 state, North Dakota, which  does not require voter registration, did not respond, and 1 state reported  that it was uncertain of its capability to perform electronic matching.", "With respect to matching voter information with SSA data when a Social  Security number is presented instead of a driver\u2019s license, in our state  survey, 7 states had and 26 states and the District of Columbia reported that  they would have the capability, by January 1, 2006, to electronically match  voter registration information with SSA (through the MVA); 10 states  reported they planned to have this capability in place but not by January  2006; and 6 states had not yet determined whether they could do so. Many  states reported concerns with whether SSA would be able to return  responses to verify requests in a timely manner. Specifically, 30 states and  the District of Columbia reported some level of concern about the issue.  When asked whether they thought local jurisdictions would be able to  resolve nonmatches resulting from SSA verification checks, opinions were  divided, with a number of states (21) expressing some degree of concern  about this, while a nearly equal number (22 states and the District of  Columbia) did not.", "In our June 2005 report on maintaining accurate voter registration lists, we  found that in one state (Iowa) that had verified its voter registration list  with SSA before the 2004 general election, there was no unique match for  2,586 names, according to the SSA records. As we stated in our report,  Iowa officials said that the biggest problem they faced was that SSA did not  specify what specific voter information did not match (i.e., was the  mismatch in name, date of birth, or final four-digit Social Security number).  Without that information, they were not able to efficiently resolve the non- matching problems. In that same report, we also noted that an SSA official  said that the system established to perform the HAVA matching on the four- digit Social Security number is not able to provide that detail. In addition,  we found that use of SSA\u2019s database to identify deceased registrants, which  is linked with the system established to perform the HAVA verification of  voter registration application information, had matching and timeliness  issues.", "As shown in figure 8, many states reported that they faced significant  challenges when trying to match voter registration information with state  records. For example, in our survey, 29 states and the District of Columbia  reported that records with incomplete data posed a challenge; 19 states and  the District of Columbia reported that obtaining records not maintained  electronically was a challenge; and 23 states reported that verifying  information against incompatible electronic record systems was also a  challenge.", "During our site visits to local jurisdictions, we obtained additional views on  how well, in general, states were believed to perform various data- matching functions.

One jurisdiction in Illinois reported it was not sure how or if its  voter registration system would be able to match data with MVA and SSA  databases or to verify eligibility status for felons and by age.

If a voter is ineligible under state  requirements and is to be removed from the statewide voter registration  list, states are generally required to remove such names in accordance with  NVRA provisions relating to the removal of voter names from registration  lists for federal elections. Under NVRA, in the administration of voter  registration for federal elections, states may not remove the names of  people who are registered to vote for nonvoting and names may be  removed only for certain specified reasons: at the request of the registrant;  by reason of criminal conviction, as provided by state law; by reason of  mental incapacity, as provided by state law; or pursuant to a general  program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible  voters from the official lists by reason of the death of the voter or on the  ground that the voter has changed address to a location outside the  election jurisdiction on the basis of change of address information from the  U.S. Postal Service (but only if either (1) the voter confirms in writing a  change of address to a place outside the election jurisdiction or (2) the  voter has failed to respond to a confirmation mailing and the voter has not  voted or appeared to vote in any election between the time of such notice  and the passage of two federal general elections).", "Reasons Names Removed from Registration Lists In our survey of local election jurisdictions nationwide, we asked about the  reasons names were removed from voter registration lists. On the basis of  our survey of local election jurisdictions, the following table shows various  reasons that jurisdictions removed names from voter registration lists for  the 2004 general election and our estimates of how frequently names were  removed for that reason. For example, the most frequent reason was the  death of the voter (76 percent). Names were removed with about equal  frequency because the voter requested that his or her name be removed (54  percent) or the registrant\u2019s name appeared to be a duplicate (52 percent).  The least frequent reason was for mental incompetency (10 percent). In  many jurisdictions, names were not removed but rather placed on an  inactive list for a period of time. In our survey of local jurisdictions, nearly  half, or an estimated 46 percent, took this step.", "In our June 2005 report on maintaining accurate voter registration lists,  on the basis of interviews of election officials in 14 jurisdictions and 7 state  election offices, we reported that in larger jurisdictions, the task of  identifying and removing registrants who died can be substantial. For  example, in the city of Los Angeles, in 1 week in 2005 alone, almost 300  persons died.", "The issue of felons voting unlawfully\u2014that is, voting when their felony  status renders them ineligible to voter under state law\u2014was a high-profile  issue in some jurisdictions. According to an election official in a  Washington jurisdiction we visited, this issue was identified during the  November 2004 general election. This official also told us that the Secretary  of State is working to establish a database that will indicate felony status  and cancel the registration of felons. This election official noted that the  jurisdiction rarely receives information from federal courts on felony  convictions. Under federal law, U.S. Attorneys are to give written notice of  felony convictions in federal district courts to the chief state election  official of the offender\u2019s state of residence. In our June 2005 report on  maintaining accurate voter registration lists, we found that U.S. Attorneys  had not consistently provided this information, and while the law did not  establish a standardized time frame or format for forwarding the federal  felony conviction information, election officials in 7 states we visited  reported that the felony information received from U.S. Attorneys was not  always timely and was sometimes difficult to interpret. We recommended  that the U.S. Attorneys provide information in a more standardized manner.", "Under HAVA, duplicate names on the statewide voter registration list are  also to be identified and removed. In our state survey, 49 states and the  District of Columbia reported that their voter registration systems will  include a function for checking duplicate voter registration records. On  the basis of our nationwide survey of local jurisdictions, we estimate that  72 percent of local jurisdictions employed a system of edit checks  (automated controls to identify registration problems) to identify  duplicates. Our prior work has also found that states were, for the most  part, able to handle duplicate registrations\u2014though obtaining timely,  accurate data to facilitate the identification of duplicate registrations has  been viewed as a challenge among some state election officials.  Specifically, in our February 2006 report on certain states\u2019 (9 states that did  not seek a waiver until January 1, 2006 and were to implement a  computerized statewide voter registration list by January 1, 2004)  experiences with implementing HAVA\u2019s statewide voter registration lists,  we found that 8 of the 9 states we reviewed screened voter applications to  identify duplicate registrations, and most did so in real time. We also  reported that 8 of these 9 states checked voter registration lists for  duplicate registrations on an annual, monthly, or other periodic basis. And  4 of the 9 states reported that implementing the HAVA requirements led to  some or great improvement in the accuracy of their voter lists by reducing  duplicate registrations or improving the quality of voter information before  it was entered into the statewide voter list.", "Checking for duplicates remained a challenge for some in 2004 and 2005,  however. In our June 2005 report on maintaining accurate voter  registration lists, we noted that officials in 7 of the 21 local election  jurisdictions we spoke with during 2004 and 2005 had some concern about  the accuracy and timeliness of data they received to identify duplicate  registrants and verify that registrants resided within the jurisdiction.

According to the EAC  voluntary guidance on HAVA\u2019s statewide voter registration system, the   top-down approach most closely matches HAVA requirements\u2014but other  configurations may be used as long as they meet the HAVA requirement   for a single, uniform list that allows election officials to have   immediate access.", "Our 2005 survey of state election officials sought information on how states  were implementing statewide computerized voter registration systems.

Election officials in most jurisdictions reported  that voter information (such as name and address) is public information if  it is to be used for political purposes\u2014though some do not release Social  Security numbers, and others limit access to this information by requiring a  fee. Some local election officials noted that security standards for this  information were not set by the state but rather at the county or local level,  though many look to the state for future guidance on standards. The type of  security in place to restrict access to voter registration records varied by  jurisdiction; among the procedures commonly used were password  protection (so that only certain election officials could log onto the voter  registration system to access the information); storage of voter registration  records in locked facilities; use of \u201cbest practice\u201d protocols such as system  firewalls; and in some cases, registration information is maintained on a  computer system that is separate from the jurisdiction\u2019s central system.  Along these lines, 1 jurisdiction noted that it planned to implement a public  key infrastructure (PKI). A PKI is a system of computers, software,  policies, and people that can be used to facilitate the protection of sensitive  information and communications.

To determine  whether states went beyond HAVA requirements to share voter registration  data with other states to identify registrants who died in another state,  were incarcerated in another state, or registered in another state, we asked  on our survey of state election officials whether they had taken action to  electronically exchange voter registration information with at least 1 other  state and whether they were sharing registration information routinely with  other states. In our state survey, 31 states and the District of Columbia  reported that they did not plan to electronically exchange voter registration  information with another state. However, 35 states and the District of  Columbia reported they share information with states when a new  registrant indicates he or she previously resided in another state. Other  types of information sharing across state lines were less common.

Applications for the 46 states and the District of  Columbia and both federal applications had a place on their registration  application where registration applicants could indicate prior registration  in another state on their forms. Three states (Kentucky, Texas, and  Wyoming) did not include a place on their registration forms to identify  prior registration information in another state. Forty-five states and the  District of Columbia included a space for registration applicants to indicate  prior registration in another jurisdiction within their state on their forms,  or in the case of the District of Columbia applicants were to indicate the  address of their last registration. Four states (Alaska, Hawaii, Kentucky,  and Wyoming) did not provide space to indicate prior registration within  their state.

For example, Arizona reported plans to upgrade its current  system to reflect reciprocity agreements with other states, so that election  officials can be alerted when a voter moves from state to state, and will  allow election officials to retrieve data on such issues as voter petitions,  provisional ballots, poll worker training, and polling locations.

These individuals  (first-time mail registrants) must provide certain specified types of  identification either by submitting copies of such identification during the  mail registration process or by presenting such identification when voting  in person for the first time following their mail registration. Moreover,  first-time mail registrants are to be informed on the application that  appropriate identifying information must be submitted with the mailed  form in order to avoid additional identification requirements upon voting  for the first time. An individual who asserts that he or she has registered by  mail and desires to vote in person but who does not meet the identification  requirements may cast a provisional ballot under HAVA\u2019s provisional  language. However, according to election officials in some jurisdictions we  visited, casting a provisional ballot requires that these voters are to provide  identification to election officials by a specified time (e.g., by close of polls  on Election Day or within a certain number of days following Election Day)  to have their ballot count. On the basis of our local survey, we estimate that  32 percent of local jurisdictions encountered a problem in counting  provisional ballots because voters did not provide identification as  specified by HAVA for mail-in registrants and were voting for the first time  in the precinct or jurisdiction. Our discussion of provisional voting  processes appears in chapter 5.", "HAVA, in general, provides states with discretion as to the methods of  implementing HAVA\u2019s identification requirements for first-time mail  registrants, such as ensuring that voters comply with the requirements and,  subject to certain limitations, allows states to establish requirements that  are stricter than those required under HAVA. According to our state  survey, 7 states reported that such HAVA requirements were already  covered by existing state legislation or some type of state executive action  (such as orders, directives, regulations, or policies); 44 states and the  District of Columbia reported that they enacted new legislation or took  some type of state executive action (such as orders, directives, regulations,  or polices) to address the identification requirements in HAVA for first-time  mail registrants.", "We analyzed state and federal (NVRA) voter registration application forms  to determine whether the applications provided instructions on  identification requirements for individuals registering in a jurisdiction for  the first time.

Registration forms were those on the Web site or obtained from the states  as of January 2006. Our analysis showed that 39 states and the District of  Columbia had information on their application forms and 10 states did not  provide this information on their forms.

Five local jurisdictions told us that applications  received by mail as a result of voter registration drives are not treated as  mail-in applications and therefore are not treated as subject to mail  registration identification requirements under HAVA; 3 jurisdictions told us  that applications submitted by voter registration drives were treated as  mail-in applications subject to HAVA\u2019s mail registration identification  requirements. Election officials in 1 of these jurisdictions told us that under  their state law (Pennsylvania) all voters who are voting for the first time in  a district must show a valid form of identification, regardless of how they  registered to vote.", "Also, during our site visits we asked local election officials how they  processed voter registration applications from first-time mail registrants  for the 2004 general election. Election officials reported taking different  approaches, many involving mailed communications from election officials  sent back to the applicant, particularly if required information was missing.  For example, at least 2 large jurisdictions reported that first-time voters  who did not mail in identification with their applications were sent letters  instructing them to do so. Similarly, officials in 2 jurisdictions in another  state said letters were sent to applicants whose applications were  incomplete, advising them of the need to provide photo ID\u2014and informed  applicants that if they failed to do so, they may have to use a provisional  ballot on Election Day, which would be subject to the voter subsequently  providing identification. In other jurisdictions, though local election  officials reported taking steps to process incomplete applications from  first-time voters, they did not necessarily give the applicant a chance to  correct the application prior to Election Day. For example, in a medium  jurisdiction we visited, first-time voter applicants who did not submit  proper identification were to have been given provisional ballots. However,  the election official told us her office did not inform them about this in  advance for the 2004 general election.", "In addition to contacting applicants to inform them of the need to provide  identification discussed above, 1 jurisdiction we visited told us that it  periodically provided a list of applicants who provided driver\u2019s license  numbers but did not provide identification at the time of registration to the  state MVA as another means to verify the registrant\u2019s identity. In this case,  the MVA compared the county clerk office\u2019s registration list against its list  of licensed drivers to see if the name, date of birth, and driver\u2019s license  number matched, and returned the results to election officials. If all these  data elements matched, the election official certified the records and these  prospective voters were not required to show identification at the polling  place.", "If a registrant did not provide identification prior to Election Day, local  election officials at all 28 sites we visited reported having a system for  recording first-time voters who failed to provide identification and  transferring that information to a polling site by annotating the poll book.  One large jurisdiction, for example shaded the voter line in the poll book,  while another printed the words \u201cID required\u201d next to the voter\u2019s name.  With respect to voters who presented themselves at a polling place and did  not have identification, election officials at some local jurisdictions we  visited described different ways that the voter\u2019s provisional ballot could  become verified. For example, a jurisdiction in Georgia said that if a voter  did not provide identification at the polls, it allowed the voter to vote a  provisional ballot and the voter had until 2 days after the election to  provide identification. Another jurisdiction in Kansas told us that the voter  had until the day that votes were canvassed to provide identification. Other  jurisdictions told us that voters would have until the close of the polls on  Election Day to provide identification to election officials. A local  jurisdiction in Washington told us that if the voter did not have  identification on Election Day, the voter would vote a provisional ballot  and election officials would subsequently have the voter\u2019s signature  matched against the registration application to verify the voters identity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Processing Registration Applications Received from MVAs and Other NVRA Entities Remained a Challenge", "paragraphs": ["Citizens generally have numerous opportunities to apply to register to vote.

For  the 2004 general election, the time frame for processing applications had  the potential to pose an even greater challenge given the increase in the  number of voter registration applications that elections officials reported  receiving for the November 2004 general election.

On the other hand, they pose challenges in assessing the validity of  submitted registrations and in processing large numbers of registrations  submitted close to the registration deadline. For the November 2004  general election, election officials in some jurisdictions we visited told us  they encountered challenges validating and processing the large number of  voter registration applications obtained through voter registration drives  that employed either paid staff (where workers are paid for each voter  registration application completed and submitted to election authorities  prior to Election Day) or used volunteers. For example, Wisconsin\u2019s state  legislative audit bureau conducted an evaluation of the 2004 general  election in its state. It found, among other things, that many registration  deputies appointed for the November 2004 general election worked for  special interest groups or political parties interested in increasing voter  turnout. The evaluation states that investigators found that registration  deputies had submitted 65 falsified names for the 2004 general elections  and that district attorneys in two counties charged four individuals with  submitting fraudulent registration forms.

For example, in 1 large jurisdiction, election  officials reported that approximately 30,000 registrations received in  2004\u2014about 90 percent\u2014were submitted by registration drives. Of these,  the election officials estimated that only about 50 applications were  irregular\u2014that is, they were unreadable, had questionable signatures, were  incomplete, or had invalid addresses. The election official from this  jurisdiction noted that it appeared some of the applications had been filled  out by individuals who took addresses from the phone book and changed  them slightly. In another large jurisdiction in a battleground state, local  election officials estimated that 70,000 registration applications were  submitted by volunteer or paid registration drives, and here too  irregularities were noted\u2014such as fictitious names and fake signatures\u2014 but election officials stated that these irregular applications represented a  \u201clow\u201d percentage of the total. In other large jurisdictions, fewer voter  registration applications were received; 1 jurisdiction, for example, in  another battleground state, reported receiving 2,500 such applications and  estimated that about 20 percent of them were irregular. Two medium  jurisdictions we visited reported receiving a few hundred voter registration  applications or fewer, and both reported that there were no irregularities.  One small jurisdiction did not report any voter registration drives taking  place.", "When we asked local election officials during our site visits whether they  had the ability to determine whether a person actually tried to vote using a  false or fictitious name, responses were mixed: Election officials in 3 large  jurisdictions we visited told us they did not have the ability to make this  determination. An election official in another large jurisdiction stated that  \u201cthere is no way to know if someone falsely registered has voted.\u201d Others,  however, reported that they were able to determine whether false identities  had been used. For example, in 1 large jurisdiction, election judges check  voter IDs and signatures at the polls to prevent the use of fictitious  identities. One large jurisdiction verifies voter registration information  against Social Security and driver\u2019s license information and checked voter  history internally; election officials in this jurisdiction reported that they  believe anyone who attempted to use a false or fictitious name in the  November 2004 general election would have been caught. And in another  jurisdiction, election officials told us that if an individual attempted to vote  using a fictitious name that was not in the poll book, that individual would  be issued a provisional ballot\u2014which would not be verified if it was  determined that the name was indeed fictitious. Election officials in some  jurisdictions we visited said there was no way to know whether the poll  book already contained fictitious names.", "When asked what steps, if any, local jurisdictions we visited took to notify  law enforcement or other legal authorities on irregular registration  applications received, most reported taking some actions. For example,   1 large jurisdiction we visited reported providing irregular registration  applications to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the district  attorney\u2019s office and to the Secretary of State\u2019s office for investigation.  Both the FBI and the district attorney declined to pursue the matter on the  ground that they were understaffed, the jurisdiction reported. The  Secretary of State\u2019s office concluded that while the registration  applications were fraudulent or fictitious, a purposeful fraud was not  committed and that the people completing the fake applications were not  trying to alter an election, but to obtain money by working for the  registration drives. Four other jurisdictions that we visited said they  contacted appropriate state or federal authorities, such as state law  enforcement, a State\u2019s Attorney, a state election enforcement agency, or the  FBI, but election officials did not know whether any action had been taken.", "In addition, in our June 2005 report on maintaining voter registration lists,  we reported that election officials in seven locations we visited referred  reported instances of voter registration fraud allegations to appropriate  agencies, such as the district attorney and the U.S. Attorney for  investigation.

The jurisdiction reported that Colorado\u2019s legislature passed a  bill pertaining to voter registration drives.

In addition, the 2005 state legislation provides that  voter registration organizers may not compensate persons circulating voter  registration application forms based on the number of applications  distributed or collected. The Secretary of State issued rules in November  2005 implementing such requirements, including rules that require  registration drive organizers to file a statement of intent with the Secretary  of State and require persons circulating such application forms to ensure  that the tear-off receipt on the application is completed and given to the  applicant.

Given the continuing  challenge of maintaining accurate voter registration lists in a highly mobile  society, this is to be expected.", "For election officials, the voter registration process presents a continuing  challenge in balancing ease of registration for eligible voters with sufficient  internal controls to help ensure that only eligible voters are added to and  remain on the voter registration rolls. To maintain accurate voter  registration lists, election officials must use and rely upon data from a  number of sources, such as state death and criminal records and  applications from MVAs.", "HAVA\u2019s requirements for creating and maintaining statewide voter  registration lists and its identification requirements for first-time voters  who register by mail were designed to help improve the accuracy of voter  registration lists and reduce the potential for voter fraud. Specifically,  HAVA\u2019s requirements for creating and maintaining a statewide voter  registration list was designed to improve voter registration list accuracy by  identifying duplicate registrations within the state and identifying those  ineligible to vote because of death, criminal status, or other reasons. HAVA  requires states to match the names and other identifying information on  their statewide voter registration lists against death and felony records in  the state. States may voluntarily match their voter registration lists with the  voter registration lists, death, felony, or other records in other states. In the  absence of voluntary cross-state matching, it is possible to fully implement  HAVA\u2019s statewide voter registration provisions and still have ineligible  persons on the state\u2019s voter registration rolls on Election Day, such as those  who died out of state or were convicted in federal courts or other states.  Nor would implementing HAVA\u2019s statewide matching requirements identify  persons who are registered to vote in more than one state. Although some  states report sharing registration and eligibility information among states,  the practice was generally limited to neighboring states or dependent upon  a registrant indicating that he or she previously resided in another state.", "HAVA includes a provision that requires certain first-time voters who  register by mail to provide identification as proof of their identity and  eligibility to vote in the jurisdiction. Which voters must present  identification either with their mail application or when they vote for the  first time depends upon how states and local jurisdictions define \u201cmail  registrations\u201d subject to HAVA\u2019s identification requirement. In our site  visits, we found that some local jurisdictions considered registration  applications submitted by registration drives to be mail registrations  subject to HAVA\u2019s identification requirement for first-time voters, while  other jurisdictions did not consider such registrations to be mail  registrations subject to the identification requirement. This distinction has  importance on Election Day for first-time voters who registered through  registration drives. In those jurisdictions that considered mail registrations  to include registration drive applications, first-time voters who registered  through registration drives would be required to show an acceptable form  of identification at the polls on election day. If they did not do so, they are  to be permitted to cast a provisional ballot, but the ballot would only be  counted upon a state determination that the voter is eligible to vote under  state law. In contrast, in those jurisdictions that did not consider mail  applications to include those submitted through registration drives, first- time voters would not be treated as subject to the HAVA identification  requirement and could generally cast a regular ballot that would be  counted with all other regular ballots.", "Election jurisdictions continue to face challenges in obtaining voter  registration applications from NVRA entities, including MVAs. Some local  jurisdictions have established processes to manage receipt of voter  registration applications from these entities, such as training for staffs of  these agencies. To the extent that NVRA entities do not track and forward  to the appropriate election jurisdiction the voter applications that they  have received, voters may be required to cast provisional ballots instead of  regular ones because their names do not appear on the voter registration  lists. In addition, the provisional ballot will not be counted if the voter\u2019s  valid registration cannot be verified. Our survey of local election  jurisdictions found that many local jurisdictions encountered problems  counting provisional ballots in cases where voters claimed to have  registered at an MVA or some other NVRA entity but there was insufficient  evidence that the voter had submitted a registration application at the MVA  or NVRA entity.", "A surge of last-minute registrations in many jurisdictions prior to the  November 2004 election illustrated the challenge of balancing ease of  registration with assurance that only eligible voters are on the registration  rolls. Some election jurisdictions reported registration drive groups  submitted hundreds or thousands of applications just before the  registration deadline. When the registration deadline is close to Election  Day, processing these applications presents a tremendous challenge in  checking applications for completeness, having time to contact applicants  to obtain missing information, verifying applicants\u2019 eligibility to vote, and  adding the name of eligible voters to the registration list. Some  jurisdictions reported hiring and training temporary employees to process  the applications.

Because of the wide diversity in absentee and  early voting requirements, administration, and procedures, citizens face  different opportunities for obtaining and successfully casting ballots before  Election Day.", "To collect information about absentee and early voting options, in our state  and local surveys we asked questions about each of these voting options  separately. We defined absentee voting as casting a ballot, generally by  mail, in advance of Election Day (although ballots could be returned  through Election Day and dropped off in person). We defined early voting  as generally in-person voting in advance of Election Day at specific polling  locations, separate from absentee voting. However, there is some measure  of overlap between absentee voting and early voting reported by the states,  especially where states have reported in-person absentee voting to be, in  effect, early voting. This may be due, in part, to the fact that the relational  statutory framework for early voting and absentee voting varies among the  states\u2014with some states, for example, providing early voting within the  context of the state\u2019s absentee voting provisions, while others, for example,  provide for absentee voting within the context of the state\u2019s early voting  provisions. Similarly, local jurisdictions that completed our survey may  also have had some measure of overlap in relation to their practices for  absentee and early voting. During our interviews with local election  officials in jurisdictions that offered early voting, we were able to obtain  more detailed information about absentee and early voting procedures and  practices for those jurisdictions.", "On the basis of our site visits to jurisdictions that had early voting, absentee  and early voting were similar in some ways and distinct in others. Election  officials described to us that when voters cast absentee ballots, they  typically followed a specific process including applying for and receiving  the ballot and returning their marked ballots before Election Day or, in  some cases, returning the ballot up until the close of polls on Election Day.  According to the description that election officials gave us, early voting  was distinct from in-person absentee voting in that in-person absentee  voters usually applied for and received a ballot, and cast it at the registrar\u2019s  office, while early voters reported to a voting location where early voting  staff verified their eligibility to vote, usually by accessing the jurisdiction\u2019s  voter registration list. Also, early voting usually did not require citizens to  provide an excuse, as some states required for absentee voting, and it was  usually allowed for a shorter period of time than absentee voting. For  example, in the 14 jurisdictions we visited in 7 states that reported having  early voting, the time frame allowed for absentee voting was almost always  at least twice as long as that for early voting (e.g., Colorado allowed 30 days  for absentee voting and 15 days for early voting). Early voting was similar  to Election Day voting in that the voting methods were usually the same.  However, according to election officials in jurisdictions we visited that had  early voting, voters were not limited to voting in their precinct because all  early voting locations had access to a complete list of registered voters for  the jurisdiction (not just precinct specific) and had appropriate ballots that  included federal, state, and precinct-specific races. Appendix VII provides a  description of selected characteristics of the early voting jurisdictions we  visited.", "In this chapter, we will discuss changes since 2000 and challenges related  to (1) absentee voting in general, (2) overseas military and civilian absentee  voting, and (3) early voting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Some states have increased the opportunities for citizens to vote absentee  or early.

Three states reported expanding their provision for permanent  absentee status (usually reserved for the elderly or those with disabilities),  allowing voters to receive absentee ballots for a state-specified time period,  such as 4 years. One state reported eliminating its requirement that mail-in  absentee voters provide an attestation from a notary or witness for their  signature along with the completed absentee ballot. Eliminating the need  for a notary or witness removes a potential barrier to an absentee ballot  being counted. According to election officials in 2 jurisdictions in 1 state  we visited that required a notary or witness signature, an absentee ballot  may not be counted if voters neglect to have their ballots witnessed or  notarized. Furthermore, HAVA amended the Uniformed and Overseas  Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) to, among other things, extend the  period of time that can be covered by a single absentee ballot application  by absent uniformed service voters and certain other civilian voters  residing outside of the United States from the year during which the  application was received to a time period covering up to the two next  regularly scheduled general elections for federal office.", "Election officials reported facing some of the same challenges in the  November 2004 general election that they had identified to us for the  November 2000 general election, and they also reported some new  challenges. Continuing absentee voting challenges included (1) receiving  late absentee voter applications and ballots; (2) managing general  workload, resources, and other administrative constraints; (3) addressing  voter error issues such as unsigned or otherwise incomplete absentee  applications and ballot materials; and (4) preventing potential fraud.", "Election officials also told us that they encountered new challenges in the  November 2004 general election. Some election officials said that the  increased early voter turnout during this election resulted in long lines. In  some local jurisdictions we visited, election officials said that factors such  as inadequate planning on their part, limitations on types of facilities that  could be used for early voting locations, and funding constraints on hiring  more staff or acquiring more voting locations affected their management of  large early voter turnout. In addition, some election officials reported that  they encountered a challenge handling disruptive third parties as they  attempted to approach early voters who were in line to vote. Another  challenge could develop as a result of a 2002 HAVA amendment to  UOCAVA. In an effort to help make registration and voting easier for absent  uniformed service voters and certain other civilian voters residing outside  of the United States, this 2002 amendment, as noted above, extended the  period of time that can be covered by a single application from the year  during which the application was received to a time period covering up to  the next two subsequent general elections for federal office. Election  officials in 4 jurisdictions we visited told us that a possible unintended  consequence of this amendment could be that when uniformed services  personnel are reassigned to other duty posts, absentee ballots may not be  sent to the correct address for subsequent general elections.

The secrecy  envelope would be to ensure that the voted ballot was not linked to the  voter, while the voter\u2019s affidavit information, such as a name, address, and  signature, needed to certify that the voter was eligible to vote, would be  marked on the outer envelope. Election officials in some jurisdictions  provided examples of the envelopes used to return absentee ballots. One of  these examples had a separate affidavit envelope, which was to be placed  in a pre-addressed return envelope and mailed to the local elections  jurisdiction. Other examples allowed the voter to include the affidavit  information on the back of the pre-addressed return envelope. Once the  local elections jurisdiction certified that the absentee ballots could be  counted using the affidavit information, election officials in jurisdictions  we visited told us that they removed the secrecy envelope (with the voted  ballot sealed inside) and set it aside for counting.

According to  our state survey, these deadlines may be different for absent uniformed  service voters and certain other civilian voters residing outside the United  States, a subject that will be discussed later in this chapter.", "In our October 2001 comprehensive report on election processes, we  reported that election officials for the 2000 general election identified  receiving applications and ballots after state statutory deadlines as a  challenge. According to our nationwide survey, local jurisdictions  encountered similar problems with processing absentee ballot applications  and absentee ballots for the November 2004 general election. More  specifically, on the basis of our survey, we estimate that 55 percent of local  jurisdictions received absentee ballot applications too late to process. We  also estimate 77 percent of local jurisdictions encountered problems in  processing absentee ballots because ballots were received too late.  Furthermore, we asked jurisdictions about which problems were  encountered most frequently. An estimated 25 percent of local jurisdictions  encountered the ballot lateness problem most frequently. Figure 22 shows  that medium and large jurisdictions encountered lateness with absentee  ballots more than small jurisdictions did.", "Appendix VIII summarizes states\u2019 deadlines for receiving domestic mail-in  absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots.", "Election officials in the local jurisdictions we visited told us that they tried  to approve applications and mail absentee ballots to voters as quickly as  possible, assuming that the ballots had been finalized and printed. In   8 jurisdictions we visited in 5 states (Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico,  Pennsylvania, and Washington), election officials said that their states  mandated that local election jurisdictions process absentee ballot  applications within a specified time period, such as within 24, 48, or   72 hours of receipt of the application. In 2 Pennsylvania jurisdictions we  visited, election officials stated that they established a local policy  encouraging election staff to process absentee ballot applications faster  (such as on the day of receipt) than the time period specified in state law  (which was 48 hours). In 1 Illinois and 1 Nevada jurisdiction we visited,  election officials said that while a 24- or 48-hour turnaround time for  absentee ballot applications was not mandated in state law, local office  policy was to process them as quickly as possible\u2014such as within 24 hours  of receipt of the application.", "During our site visits, election officials in 9 jurisdictions stated that they  received large numbers of mail-in absentee ballot applications just prior to  the deadlines prescribed by state law. Most of these election officials said  they were able to meet their state-mandated or office policy application- processing time, although they had to work long hours and hire additional  staff to process the absentee ballot applications by the deadline. In   1 Florida jurisdiction we visited, local election officials said that even  though they had no absentee ballot application deadline, they processed  applications using \u201clong hours and extra people\u201d and tried to send out  absentee ballots within 24 hours of receiving a complete application.", "In jurisdictions we visited in Pennsylvania and Colorado, election officials  said that sometimes the 24- or 48-hour turnaround was impossible to meet  because the state did not finalize the ballots for printing until the days  immediately preceding Election Day for the November 2004 election. For  example, an election official in the Pennsylvania jurisdiction we visited told  us that determining whether or not an independent presidential candidate\u2019s  name was to be included on the November 2004 general election ballot  proved to be a challenge. In this jurisdiction, the validity of petition  signatures supporting the independent candidate\u2019s request to be included  on the ballot was challenged in state court about 10 weeks before the  election. As a result, according to the election official, election officials  were required to participate in a court-mandated process of verifying the  signatures. According to the election official, it took about 10 days in court  to resolve the situation, which delayed the printing of the ballots.", "In 6 jurisdictions we visited, election officials told us that slowness in the  delivery of the mail added to the processing time crunch during the week  before Election Day\u2014a problem that is out of election officials\u2019 control and  may contribute to the local election officials\u2019 receipt of absentee voting  materials after state-mandated deadlines. Although envelopes can use an  \u201cofficial election mail\u201d designation, election officials in these 6 jurisdictions  we visited said that the U.S. Postal Service did not always process absentee  voting materials in a timely manner. For example, in one New Mexico  jurisdiction we visited, election officials stated that they experienced  serious problems with the U.S. Postal Service delivering absentee ballot  applications. These officials felt that the post office ignored the envelopes\u2019  official election mail designation and did not process and deliver them  quickly. Election officials in this jurisdiction said that their telephone  system crashed numerous times leading up to Election Day in November  2004, given the heavy volume of incoming calls from voters checking on the  status of their absentee ballot applications. In one Pennsylvania  jurisdiction that we visited, election officials said that postal concerns were  raised when some college students\u2019 absentee ballot applications were  received after Election Day. These officials could not definitely say at what  point these applications might have been delayed and explained that the  mail delivery delay could have been attributable to either the U.S. Postal  Service or the university\u2019s mailing center.

In an Illinois jurisdiction we visited, election officials told us  that prior to the election, staff from his office met with the postmaster to  establish a good working relationship. Election officials in a New  Hampshire and Ohio jurisdiction we visited stated that the post office was  very helpful. In a Nevada jurisdiction we visited election officials said that  they received excellent service from the postal service.", "When an absentee application was received after the state-mandated  deadline, election officials in 13 jurisdictions we visited told us that they  often sent these applicants a letter explaining that their application was  received too late.

The basic process for absentee  voting under UOCAVA is generally similar to that described in figure 18 for  absentee voters not covered under UOCAVA in that UOCAVA voters also  must establish their eligibility to vote on their absentee ballot application,  and the ballot must be received by the voter\u2019s local jurisdiction to verify it  for counting. Election officials in some jurisdictions we visited told us that  they allow UOCAVA voters to submit a voted ballot via facsimile\u2014a  method that might not be allowed for absentee voters not covered under  UOCAVA because of concerns about maintaining ballot secrecy.

This ballot may be used when such  voters submit a timely application for an absentee ballot (i.e., the  application must have been received by the state before the state deadline  or at least 30 days prior to the general election, whichever is later) but do  not receive a state absentee ballot. Some states\u2019 absentee ballot application  forms included serving in a uniformed service or residing outside the  country as excuses for voting absentee.

Also, in 1 jurisdiction in Georgia that we visited, election  officials told us that they were concerned that many of the absentee ballots  sent in subsequent general elections would be returned as undeliverable. In  an Illinois jurisdiction we visited, elections officials expressed concerns  about paying the postage for mail that may be undeliverable will be a  challenge in future years. Also, we noted in our March 2006 report on  election assistance provided to uniformed service personnel, that one of  the top two reasons for disqualifying absentee ballots for UOCAVA voters  was that the ballots were undeliverable.", "The Federal Post Card Application was revised in October 2005, after the  November 2004 general election, and now allows overseas military and  civilians to designate the time period for which they want to receive  absentee ballots.

Those who do not  wish to receive ballots for two regularly scheduled general elections can  designate that they want an absentee ballot for the next federal election  only and then complete the form and request a ballot for each subsequent  federal election separately. The FPCA used at the time of the November  2004 election did not allow overseas military and civilian voters to make  this designation.", "Even with the revised FPCA, some applications might not have this box  checked, and jurisdictions could continue to have absentee ballots  returned as undeliverable. In an attempt to mitigate these problems,  election officials in 3 local jurisdictions we visited told us that they planned  several activities in an attempt to maintain and update the addresses of  uniformed services voters and civilian voters residing outside the country.  In a Washington jurisdiction we visited, election officials told us that they  began requesting e-mail addresses from such voters so that any problems  with these applications or ballots could be corrected more efficiently. In  previous elections, when e-mail addresses were not available, elections  officials in this jurisdiction told us that many absentee applications and  ballots sent to uniformed services members and civilian voters residing  outside the United States were often returned as undeliverable. In a  Georgia jurisdiction that we visited, election officials said that they planned  to create a subsystem within their voter registration system. This  subsystem will, according to the election officials, allow staff in the  election office to produce a form letter for each uniformed services voter  that will verify the voter\u2019s current address. The election officials also told  us letters will be mailed in January asking the voter to contact the  jurisdiction to confirm that he or she continues to reside at the address on  the letter. If the jurisdiction does not receive confirmation from the  uniformed services voter, the election officials told us that they will contact  the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) for assistance in locating  the voter. In an Illinois jurisdiction we visited, election officials stated that  they plan to canvass all uniformed services members and civilians residing  outside the United States who are registered in the state in 2006. Election  officials in this jurisdiction told us that they had approximately 7,400 such  registered voters who completed the FPCA and that the jurisdiction  planned to canvass these voters to confirm that they continued to reside at  the address on the FPCA.

The  voting may or may not be at the election registrar\u2019s office. Early voting is  distinct from in-person absentee voting in that in-person absentee voters  usually apply for an absentee ballot at the registrar\u2019s office and vote at the  registrar\u2019s office at that time. Also, early voting usually does not require an  excuse to vote, which some states require for absentee voting, and in the  jurisdictions we visited in 7 states with early voting, it was usually offered  for a shorter period of time than absentee voting. The time frame allowed  for absentee voting was almost always at least twice as long as for early  voting. For example, election officials in the Colorado jurisdictions we  visited said that they allow 30 days for absentee voting and 15 days for early  voting. In the jurisdictions we visited in 7 states with early voting, election  officials said early voting is similar to Election Day voting in that the voter  generally votes using the same voting method as on Election Day. However  they added that it differs from Election Day voting in that voters can vote at  any early voting polling location because all early voting locations have  access to a list of all registered voters for the jurisdiction (not just precinct  specific) and can provide voters with appropriate ballots that include  federal, state, and precinct-specific races.", "Proponents argue that early voting is convenient for voters and saves  jurisdictions money by reducing the number of polling places and poll  workers needed on Election Day, and also provides the voter with more  opportunity to vote. Opponents counter that those who vote early do so  with less information than Election Day voters, and there is no proof that  early voting increases voter turnout. Statistics on voter turnout for early  voting can be difficult to come by, partly because some states and localities  combine early and absentee voting numbers. Nevertheless, early voting in  certain jurisdictions appears to be popular with voters and on the rise. In a  New Mexico jurisdiction, election officials told us that early voting  accounted for about 34 percent of the ballots cast in that jurisdiction. In  North Carolina and Colorado elections jurisdictions we visited, election  officials said that early voters cast about 35 and 38 percent of the  jurisdictions\u2019 total votes in the November 2004 election, respectively. In a  Nevada jurisdiction we visited, election officials told us that the percentage  of voters who voted early steadily increased over time.

Some states\u2019 statutes are less prescriptive, such as those of Florida, where  the statute specifies that early voting should be provided for at least   8 hours per weekday during the early voting period, and at least 8 hours in  the aggregate for each weekend during the early voting period, without  specifying the specific hours such voting is to be offered. Other states, such  as Kansas, however, do not specify in statute the hours for voting early.  Kansas statute, in general, leaves it to county election officials to establish  the times for voting early. Officials at some local jurisdictions we visited  said that their hours of operations were set based on the hours of the  election office or by the hours of the facility that was hosting early voting  such as a shopping mall or a library.", "According to our survey of local jurisdictions, an estimated 34 percent of  local jurisdictions that provided early voting for the November 2004 general  election offered early voting during regular business hours (e.g., from   8 a.m. until 4 p.m.) on weekdays, and 16 percent offered early voting  during regular business hours on weekdays and during other hours. Other  hours included weekday evenings (after 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. or   9 p.m.) and Saturdays (all day) and Sundays (any hours) for about 2 percent  of the jurisdictions, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Number and Types of Early Voting Locations", "paragraphs": ["As with early voting time frames, some states reported having requirements  for local election jurisdictions regarding the number of early voting  locations.

For example,  New Mexico\u2019s early voting statutory provisions specifically require that  certain counties with more than 200,000 registered voters establish not  fewer than 12 voting locations each. During our site visits, we asked  jurisdictions how they determined the number of early voting locations. In  a Nevada jurisdiction that we visited, election officials said that the number  of locations was determined by the availability of resources such as fiscal  and manpower needs. In a Colorado jurisdiction we visited, an election  official said he would like to have had more early voting locations but could  not because the jurisdiction did not have the funds to pay for additional  costs associated with additional sites, such as the cost for computer  connections needed for electronic voter registration list capability.

However, as described by election officials in jurisdictions we visited that  had early voting, early voting differs from Election Day voting in that staff  are generally required to perform their voting day-related duties for more  than 1 day, and staff generally do not use poll books to identify eligible  voters and check them in. Instead, as described by some of these  jurisdictions, early voting staff usually access the jurisdiction\u2019s voter  registration list to identify eligible voters and to indicate the voter voted  early to preclude voting on Election Day or by absentee ballot. Also,  election officials told us that, generally, staff must possess some computer  skills and need to be trained in using the jurisdiction\u2019s voter registration  system. Furthermore, staff must be aware that ballots are specific to the  voter\u2019s precinct.", "In our nationwide survey of local election jurisdictions, we asked about the  type of staff who worked at early voting polling places. According to our  survey for the November 2004 general election, local election jurisdictions  relied on permanent election jurisdiction staff most often to work at early  voting polling locations. As table 13 shows, we estimate 30 percent of local  jurisdictions offered early voting using only permanent election jurisdiction  staff to work at the early voting polling places; we estimate that 14 percent  of local jurisdictions used poll workers exclusively; and we estimate   14 percent used other staff (e.g., county or city employees).", "Election officials at 11 jurisdictions we visited emphasized the importance  of staffing early voting locations with experienced staff such as election  office staff or experienced and seasoned poll workers. Even with  experienced staff working early voting locations, election officials at local  jurisdictions we visited mentioned that staff were required to take training  and were provided tools to help them perform their duties.", "In our nationwide survey, we asked local jurisdictions that provided early  voting about the ways that staff were trained for early voting. As shown in  table 14, the majority of jurisdictions used methods, such as providing a  checklist of procedures, written guidance for self-study or reference, and  quick reference materials for troubleshooting, to train early voting staff.", "Local jurisdictions could do more than one of the above ways to train early  voting staff.

The election officials  also said they used a feature in their electronic poll book system to track  the number of ballots used at each site to determine whether sites had  adequate inventories of ballots. The program for the poll book system had  an alarm that went off if any site was running low on ballots, according to  these election officials. Two other jurisdictions we visited in Kansas and  Florida noted the importance of having experienced staff for early voting,  with the election officials in 1 Kansas jurisdiction saying that designating a  group of workers to work on early voting helped the process run effectively  and the election officials in 1 Florida jurisdiction saying that having the  supervisor of elections office staff on site to support early voting helped  make the process work well."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Local Jurisdictions We Visited Encountered Long lines Resulting from Larger than Expected Early Voter Turnout", "paragraphs": ["When asked about challenges with early voting faced during the November  2004 general election, in half of the local jurisdictions we visited that  offered early voting election officials identified long lines as a major  challenge.

Officials attributed challenges handling the large number of voters  and resulting long lines to problems with technology, people, and  processes. Election officials at local jurisdictions we visited made the  following comments:   Election officials in one Florida jurisdiction we visited said that their  jurisdiction faced more early voters than anticipated and this fact,  coupled with slowness in determining voter eligibility, resulted in  long lines. They said that on the first day of early voting, staff was  unable to access the voter registration list because laptops were not  functioning properly. To address the problem, a worker at the early  voting location paired with another worker, who called the  supervisor of elections office to obtain voter registration information  and provide information on the voter seeking to vote early.", "An election official in another Florida jurisdiction said that while  state law provides for early voting in the main office of the supervisor  of elections, other locations may be used only under certain  conditions. For example, in order for a branch office to be used, it  must be a full-service facility of the supervisor and must have been  designated as such at least 1 year prior to the election. In addition, a  city hall or public library may be designated as an additional early  voting location, but only if the sites are located so as to provide all  voters in the county an equal opportunity to cast a ballot, insofar as is  practicable. The official thought more flexibility was needed to allow  him to either have more early voting locations or use other types of  facilities, such as a local community center, that could accommodate  more voters.", "An election official in a Nevada jurisdiction we visited said that the  jurisdiction\u2019s process flow was inadequate to handle the large turnout  for early voting. The election official said that the jurisdiction had not  planned sufficiently to manage the large turnout for early voting and  did not have enough staff to process voters. The election official said  that in the future, he will hire temporary workers and will assign one  person to be in charge of each process (e.g., checking in voters,  activating the DRE machine, etc.) In addition, the election official  said that, in hindsight, he made a questionable decision to close all  but two early voting locations for the last day of early voting. The  closing of all but two locations on the last day of early voting  coincided with a state holiday so children were out of school. The  decision to close all but two locations caused 3 to 3\u00bd hours of wait  time, with parents waiting in line with children. The election official  said he has set a goal for the future that no wait time should be longer  than half an hour.", "To address challenges related to heavy early voter turnout, election  officials in 1 Nevada jurisdiction said they have gradually added new early  voting locations each year to keep up with the increasing number of people  who vote early. In a New Mexico jurisdiction we visited, election officials  said that they used a smaller ratio of voters to machines than required by  state statute. According to these election officials, the state required at  least one machine for every 600 voters, and during early voting, the election  officials said they used one machine for every 400 voters registered in the  jurisdiction.", "In 1 Colorado jurisdiction we visited, election officials said that they  addressed the challenge of long lines by having greeters inform voters  about the line and make sure the voters had required identification with  them.

State  restrictions on various activities in or around polling places on Election  Day include prohibitions relating to, for example, the circulation of  petitions within a certain distance of a polling place, the distribution of  campaign literature within a certain distance of the polls, the conduction of  an exit or public opinion poll within a certain distance of the polls, and  disorderly conduct or violence or threats of violence that impede or  interfere with an election. Election officials in 1 jurisdiction we visited  stated that campaign activities too close to people waiting in line were a  concern to the extent that police were called in to monitor the situation at  one early voting location. Election officials in a Florida jurisdiction we  visited said that they were concerned about solicitors, both candidates and  poll watchers, approaching people waiting in line to vote early and offering  them water or assistance in voting. While Florida\u2019s statutory provisions in  place for the November 2004 general election contained restrictions of  various activities in or around polling places on Election Day, such  provisions did not explicitly address early voting sites. Amendments to  these provisions, effective January 2006, among other things, explicitly  applied certain restrictions of activities in or around polling places to early  voting areas.

Many  states and local jurisdictions appear to be moving in the direction of  enabling voters to vote before Election Day by eliminating restrictions on  who can vote absentee and providing for early voting. Many states allowed  voters to use e-mail and facsimiles to request an absentee ballot application  and, in some cases, to return applications. To the extent that large numbers  of voters do vote absentee or early, it can reduce lines at the polling place  on Election Day and, where permitted by state law, ease the time pressures  of vote counting by allowing election officials to count absentee and early  votes prior to Election Day.", "However, there are also challenges for election officials. An estimated   55 percent of jurisdictions received absentee ballot applications too late to  process, and an estimated 77 percent received ballots too late. Although we  do not know the extent of these problems in terms of the number of  applications and ballots that could not be processed, the estimated number  of jurisdictions encountering these problems may be of some concern to  state and local election officials. Absentee application deadlines close to  Election Day provide citizens increased time to apply to vote absentee.  However, the short time period between when applications are received  and Election Day may make it difficult for election officials to ensure that  eligible voters receive absentee ballots in time to vote and return them  before the deadline for receipt at election offices.", "Voter errors on their absentee applications and ballots also create  processing problems for election officials. These include missing or  illegible signatures, missing or inadequate voting residence addresses, and  missing or incomplete witness information for a voter\u2019s signature or other  information. In addition, mail-in absentee ballots are considered by some to  be particularly susceptible to fraud. This could include such activities as  casting more than one ballot in the same election or someone other than  the registered voter completing the ballot. Despite efforts to guard against  such activities, election officials in some of the jurisdictions we visited  expressed some concerns, particularly regarding absentee voters being  unduly influenced or intimated by third parties who went to voters\u2019 homes  and offered to assist them in voting their ballots. Some election officials  expressed similar concerns about the influence of third parties on early  voters waiting in line who were approached by candidates and poll  watchers. After this happened in Florida in November 2004, the state  amended its election provisions to prohibit such activity with respect to  early voters.", "Getting absentee ballots to uniformed service personnel and overseas  citizens is a continuing challenge. UOCAVA permitted such voters to  request an absentee ballot for the upcoming election, and HAVA extended  the covered period to include up to two subsequent general elections for  federal office. Because the duty station of uniformed service personnel  may change during the period covered by the absentee ballot requests,  election officials in jurisdictions we visited were concerned that they have  some means of knowing the current mailing address. Some jurisdictions  are taking action to ensure that they have the correct address for sending  absentee ballots for the November 2006 election, such as requesting e-mail  addresses that can be used to obtain the most current address information  prior to mailing the absentee ballot.

Instead of providing one DRE machine for each of its  280 polling places, Vermont plans to implement a secure vote-by-phone  system that allows voters to mark a paper ballot, in private, using a regular  telephone at the polling place. According to the Vermont\u2019s Secretary of  State\u2019s Office, a poll worker uses a designated phone at the polling place to  call a computer system located at a secure location and access the  appropriate ballot for the voter. The computer will only permit access to  the system from phone numbers that have been entered into the system  prior to the election, and only after the proper poll worker and ballot  access numbers have been entered. The phone system reads the ballot to  the voter, and after the voter makes selections using the telephone key pad,  the system prints out a paper ballot that is automatically scanned by the  system and played back to the voter for verification. The voter may then  decide to cast the ballot or discard it and revote. The system does not use  the Internet or other data network, and it produces a voter-verified paper  ballot for every vote cast. In addition, according to an election official,  voters are able to dial into a toll-free telephone number for at least 15 days  prior to an election to listen to, preview, and practice with the actual ballot  they will vote on Election Day.

On the basis of our 2005 survey, we estimate that more  jurisdictions provided these measures. For instance, we estimate that   49 percent of all jurisdictions placed public service ads on local media, and  43 percent of all jurisdictions listed polling places on the Internet. However,  increases in the overall estimates from the 2001 and 2005 surveys are, in  part, likely due to differences in the sample designs of the two surveys and  how local election jurisdictions that were minor civil divisions (i.e.,  subcounty units of government) were selected. Because of these sample  design differences, comparing only election jurisdictions that are counties  provides a stronger basis for making direct comparisons between the two  surveys\u2019 results.

Results of our state and local jurisdiction surveys show that while  providing identification could be one of several methods used to verify  identity, it was not required by the majority of states, nor was it the only  way used to verify voters\u2019 identities in the majority of local jurisdictions for  the November 2004 election. Voter identification requirements vary in  flexibility, in the number and type of acceptable identification allowed, and  in the alternatives available for verifying identity if a voter does not have an  acceptable form of identification.", "Results of our state survey of election officials show that for the November  2004 general election 28 states reported that they did not require all  prospective voters to provide identification prior to voting in person.  Twenty-one states reported that they required all voters to provide  identification prior to voting on Election Day 2004. However, 14 of these  states reported allowing prospective voters without the required  identification an alternative. In 9 of these 14 states the alternative involved  voting a regular ballot in conjunction with, for example, the voter providing  some type of affirmation as to his or her identity. For example,  Connecticut, in general, allowed voters who were unable to provide  required identification to swear on a form provided by the Secretary of  State\u2019s Office that they are the elector whose name appears on the official  registration list. Kentucky allowed an election officer to confirm the  identity of a prospective voter by personal acquaintance or by certain types  of documents if the prospective voter did not have the required  identification. The other 5 states reporting that they offered an alternative  did so through the use of a provisional ballot if a prospective voter did not  have the required identification. For the November 2004 election, 5 of the  21 states that reported having identification requirements also had  statutory provisions requiring, in general, that such identification include a  photograph of the prospective voter. For the other 16 states that reported  requiring identification, there was a range of acceptable forms of  identification, including photo identification, such as a driver\u2019s license, and  other documentation, such as a copy of a government check or current  utility bill with a voter\u2019s name and address.

On the basis of this survey, we estimate  that 65 percent of all local jurisdictions checked voters\u2019 identification as  one way to verify their identities on Election Day. However, in an estimated  9 percent of all jurisdictions, providing identification was the only way  voters could verify their identities.", "Since the November 2004 general election, several states have reported  that they have considered establishing identification requirements for all  prospective voters, and some reported that they have implemented  requirements. Results of our state survey show that at the time of our  survey, 9 states reported having either considered legislation (or executive  action) or legislation (or executive action) was pending to require voters to  show identification prior to voting on Election Day. Four states, at the  time of our survey, reported having taken action since November 2004 to  require that voters show identification for in-person Election Day voting.  For example, changes in Arizona law and procedure emanating from a  November 2004 ballot initiative were finalized in 2005 after receiving  approval from the Department of Justice. These Arizona changes require  voters to present, prior to voting, one form of identification with the voter\u2019s  name, address, and photo, or two different forms of identification that have  the name and address of the voter. Indiana enacted legislation in 2005  requiring, in general, that voters provide a federal- or state-of-Indiana- issued identification document with the voter\u2019s name and photo prior to  voting, whereas 2005 legislation in New Mexico and Washington imposed  identification requirements but allowed prospective voters to provide one  of several forms of photo or nonphoto forms of identification. In all four  states, if voters are not able to provide a required form of identification,  they are allowed to cast a provisional, rather than a regular, ballot. Finally,  a state that had identification requirements in place for the November 2004  general election may have taken additional actions to amend such  requirements. Georgia, for instance, required voters in the November 2004  general election to provide 1 of 17 types of photo or nonphoto  identification. In 2005 Georgia enacted legislation that, in general, amended  and reduced the various forms of acceptable identification and made the  presentation of a form of photo identification, such as a driver\u2019s license, a  requirement to vote."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recruiting a Sufficient Number of Skilled, Reliable Poll Workers Continued to Be a Challenge for Large and Medium Jurisdictions", "paragraphs": ["Having enough qualified poll workers to set up, open, and work at the polls  on Election Day is a crucial step in ensuring that voters are able to  successfully vote on Election Day.

These officials provided a variety of reasons why they did not  encounter difficulties, including having a set number of appointed or  elected poll workers for each precinct, having a general public interest in  being involved in a presidential election, and using a variety of strategies  and sources to recruit poll workers. For example, election officials in a  large jurisdiction in New Mexico told us that their lack of problems with  recruitment was due to the fact that they had a full-time poll worker  coordinator who began the search for poll workers very early and, as a  result, was able to fill all of the positions needed (about 2,400) for the  November 2004 election. Election officials in other large jurisdictions  reported that they were able to obtain enough poll workers by relying on  multiple sources. For example, election officials in a large jurisdiction in  Kansas told us that they made an exhaustive effort to recruit about   1,800 poll workers for the November 2004 general election that included  soliciting from an existing list of poll workers, working with organizations,  using a high school student program to obtain about 300 student poll  workers, recruiting from a community college, using county employees,  and coordinating with the political parties.

We estimate that 15 percent of all jurisdictions indicated that  recruiting poll workers fluent in languages other than English was difficult  or very difficult. Jurisdictions of all size categories may encounter  difficulties recruiting poll workers with needed language skills for different  reasons. For instance, small jurisdictions may find it difficult to recruit  enough poll workers fluent in other languages because of a limited pool of  potential recruits, whereas large jurisdictions may be required to provide  voters with assistance in multiple languages other than English.

For example, election officials in  a large jurisdiction in Nevada told us that poll workers were trained in a  workshop fashion in which 15 to 20 poll workers were provided hands-on  training for their specific function, such as operating voting machines or  processing voters. In a large jurisdiction in Kansas, election officials told us  that they conduct the training for between 70 and 100 poll workers using a  formal presentation as well as the documents poll workers use on Election  Day and the voting equipment. Election officials in a large jurisdiction in  Washington told us that poll worker training consisted of a PowerPoint  presentation conducted in a train-the-trainer style where election officials  trained the chief poll workers, who then trained the poll workers.", "Election officials in 9 of the 27 large and medium jurisdictions we visited  reported encountering some challenges with training poll workers, but  generally reported that they overcame them. Some of the challenges  reported by these officials included keeping poll workers informed about  new or changing requirements, conveying a vast amount of information  about election processes to a large number of people in a limited time, and  ensuring that poll workers understand their tasks and responsibilities. For  instance, election officials in a large jurisdiction in Ohio told us that it was  challenging keeping up with state changes and incorporating such changes  into poll worker training. Election officials in a large jurisdiction in  Connecticut told us that effectively training poll workers on a variety of  new changes (such as those required by HAVA) could be challenging  because the procedures can be difficult to understand, especially for  tenured poll workers who have been working at the polls for many years.  Election officials in a large jurisdiction in Kansas noted that addressing the  need to have a systematic way to evaluate poll worker performance at  polling places was a challenge. These officials said that they currently rely  on the fact that the poll worker showed up, general observations of the poll  workers\u2019 performance, and feedback cards completed by voters exiting the  polls. Election officials in the jurisdictions we visited reported taking steps  to address these challenges, such as providing poll workers training  manuals or booklets for reference on Election Day, training poll workers to  perform one function, and conducting training in a workshop fashion with  smaller class sizes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Poll Worker Performance Problems in Some Large and Medium Jurisdictions", "paragraphs": ["Election officials and poll workers perform many tasks throughout the day  to ensure that elections run smoothly and that voters move efficiently  through the polling place.

Results of our 2005 state and local surveys and site visits  show that combining precincts at a polling location continued to be a  strategy used by local jurisdictions, predominantly large and medium  jurisdictions, to find adequate polling locations for voters in all precincts.  According to our state survey, nearly all states (47) reported that they  allowed precincts to be colocated in a polling place for the November 2004  general election. Ten states reported allowing colocation only under  specified conditions, for instance, if no suitable polling place existed for a  precinct, and 37 states reported allowing colocation but did not specify  conditions. On the basis of our survey of local jurisdictions, we estimate  33 percent of all jurisdictions had multiple precincts located in the same  polling place.

During our site visits, election officials in 22 of the 28 jurisdictions we  visited told us that they combined precincts in the same polling location for  the November 2004 general election. Included in the 6 jurisdictions that did  not report combining precincts in a single polling place were the 1 small  and 2 medium jurisdictions we visited. Further, in many of the large  jurisdictions we visited, election officials told us that most of their polling  places had more than one precinct. For example, election officials in a  large jurisdiction in Ohio told us that there was an average of three  precincts per polling location, but that there could be up to nine precincts  in one polling place.", "Although combining precincts may help solve the issue of obtaining a  sufficient number of voting places that meet requirements, other  challenges may surface, including voter confusion in not finding the correct  precinct at a location, poll worker confusion about eligibility if a voter is  not in the correct precinct poll book at a polling place, and the possibility  of voters voting on the wrong voting machine for their precinct. However,  on the basis of our local survey, few challenges were encountered in polling  places where precincts were combined for the November 2004 general  election. We estimate that of the 33 percent of jurisdictions with multiple  precincts at a polling location, 85 percent (+6 percent, -5 percent) did not  experience challenges in terms of voters locating their correct precinct.  Election officials in jurisdictions we visited described steps they took to  help ensure that voters were able to easily find their correct precinct,  including posting signage to direct voters to the correct precinct, using  specially designated poll workers as greeters to direct voters as they  entered the polling location, setting up separate tables or voting areas for  each precinct, and locating the precincts in distinct areas of the building,  for example, in the gym and cafeteria of a school building.", "Election officials in a few jurisdictions we visited told us that they  consolidated functions, such as the check-in table or voting equipment, for  precincts located in the same polling location in order to avoid voter  confusion or problems with voting. For example, election officials in a  jurisdiction in Kansas reported that they used one registration table with a  consolidated poll book for all precincts at a polling location. As a result,  voters only needed to locate one table. Election officials in a jurisdiction in  Nevada reported that once voters checked in, they were able to vote on any  voting machine in the polling location because the machines were  programmed with ballots from each of the precincts located at the polling  place, and poll workers activated the particular ballot style for a particular  voter.", "Beyond consolidating some functions at a polling place, in 2004 Colorado  authorized the use of \u201cvote centers,\u201d which are polling places at which any  registered voter in the local election jurisdiction may vote, regardless of the  precinct in which the voter resides. Each vote center is to use a secure  electronic connection to a computerized registration list maintained by the  local election office to allow all voting information processed at any vote  center to be immediately accessible to computers at all other vote centers  in the jurisdiction. Larimer County, with 143 precincts and about   200,000 registered voters, reported using 31 vote centers for the November  2004 general election. Election officials in Larimer County described  several benefits of vote centers, including voter convenience; cost- effectiveness; minimal voter wait time on Election Day; and overall easier  management, including requiring fewer poll workers. Election officials told  us that voters liked the convenience of being able to vote anywhere in the  jurisdiction, regardless of the precinct they live in. Vote centers can also be  cost-effective, according to election officials, for jurisdictions faced with  replacing voting equipment to comply with HAVA accessibility  requirements for voting systems used in federal elections. Using vote  centers also reduces the number of polling places a jurisdiction needs,  which can be cost-effective with respect to finding enough accessible  polling places. Election officials also told us that on Election Day they were  able to avoid having long lines at most vote centers by issuing media  announcements to voters throughout the day specifying which vote centers  were busy and which were not, and by using their electronic poll book  technology to process voters quickly and to monitor ballots and supplies.  Officials told us that on average there was a 15-minute wait time for voters.  Finally, officials told us that from the perspective of election officials, vote  centers facilitated aspects of election administration because there were  fewer locations (about 30 instead of about 140) and fewer poll workers  overall to recruit and train.", "While other jurisdictions in Colorado have used vote centers since the  November 2004 election or are planning to pilot vote centers in elections in  2006, election officials in a second jurisdiction we visited in Colorado  explained why their jurisdiction opted to not use vote centers. Officials  told us that their jurisdiction assessed the feasibility of implementing vote  centers and concluded that despite several advantages offered by vote  centers, the cost of implementation was prohibitive. For example, election  officials identified costs including the connectivity for the electronic poll  books, so that voters can be credited with voting in real time; potential  rental costs for facilities, such as hotels, to house vote centers; and the  expense of purchasing additional voting equipment. Because a voter in a  jurisdiction using vote centers can vote at any vote center, each vote center  needs to be stocked with all applicable ballot styles for an election or have  DRE voting machines capable of being programmed with all applicable  ballot styles, according to election officials. For the November 2004 general  election, these officials told us that they used optical scan for absentee and  Election Day voting and DREs for early voting. To avoid the cost and  confusion of having to print and keep track of ballot styles for their   378 precincts\u2014compared to Larimer County\u2019s 143 precincts\u2014election  officials said that they would need to purchase additional DRE voting  machines if they were to implement vote centers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Election Officials in Some Jurisdictions We Visited Reported That Designing Clear Ballots Continued to Be a Challenge", "paragraphs": ["Election officials are responsible for designing ballots that meet various  state requirements, possibly federal requirements under the minority  language provisions of the Voting Rights Act relating to offering voting  materials in specified minority languages in addition to English, and the  requirements of the particular voting equipment, and these ballots must be  easy for voters to understand. Ballot design generally involves both state  and local participation. Most states (46 states and the District of Columbia)  were involved in ballot design for the November 2004 general election. For  instance, according to our state survey, 17 states and the District of  Columbia reported designing ballots for local jurisdictions, 3 states  reported requiring approval of the ballot design, and 26 states reported  having requirements for local jurisdictions regarding ballot design   (e.g., layout, candidate order, or paper stock). Specifically, election  officials must determine all races, candidates, and issues that voters in  each precinct in a jurisdiction will vote on and construct layouts for these  races and issues for the particular types of ballots used with their election  equipment.

Ballot design problems were not highlighted by voters as a problem in the  November 2004 election; therefore, we did not inquire about the extent of  ballot design problems in our local survey of jurisdictions. However, we  asked about ballot design processes and problems during our visits to local  election jurisdictions. Election officials in all of the jurisdictions we visited  reported that they did not encounter voter problems with confusing ballot  designs for the November 2004 general election. However, election officials  in 7 jurisdictions we visited told us that designing easily understood ballots  that meet the particular constraints of the voting equipment can be  challenging when there are a large number of races or issues to include on  the ballot. For example, election officials in a jurisdiction we visited in  Colorado that used optical scan ballots told us that fitting all of the races  and questions on the ballot is always challenging, but they managed to do  so by limiting the number of words on ballot questions and using small  fonts. These officials noted that they provided magnifying glasses at polling  places to assist voters. Election officials in a jurisdiction we visited in  Florida reported that they had to use oversized optical scan ballots to  accommodate the number of constitutional amendments that had to be  included on the ballot.", "Some ballot design options taken to help ensure clarity for voters could  lead to problems later. For example, election officials in a jurisdiction in  Kansas reported that they used a two-sided ballot design requiring that the  optical scan counting equipment read the ballot front and back, which  presented a problem. Chapter 6 discusses challenges with counting ballots.  The requirements of the voting equipment may also limit options election  officials can take related to ballot design. For example, election officials in  a jurisdiction in Illinois that used punch cards reported that lengthy ballots  could have been a problem in the November 2004 election, but they  decided to change the type of punch card ballot used. These officials told  us that increasing the number of punch positions allowed for more space  on the ballot and prevented challenges related to length of ballot. However,  with punch card ballots, the greater the number of choices on a punch card,  the greater the potential for voter error in punching the preferred choice, as  voters must align the ballot carefully.", "Election officials in jurisdictions we visited that designed their ballots  described steps they took to ensure that ballots were clear to voters,  including using templates from the state or election management systems,  proofreading both before and after printing, and public viewing or testing  of ballots. For example, election officials in a jurisdiction in Colorado told  us that prior to printing they send proofs of the ballot designs to candidates  for their review. After printing, election officials said that staff members  and representatives of the political parties test the ballot designs to ensure  that there are no problems with how the ballots are processed through the  counting equipment. Election officials in another jurisdiction in Colorado  reported conducting a mock election with county employees to review the  ballot and test a ballot from each package of printed ballots.

While election officials may not be able to prepare for every  contingency that could affect a voter\u2019s wait time or experience at the polls,  ensuring that there is a sufficient number of ballots or voting machines can  minimize potential problems. On the basis of our survey of local  jurisdictions, we estimate that few jurisdictions had problems with ballot  or voting equipment shortages for the November 2004 general election. We  estimate that 4 percent of all jurisdictions experienced problems with  Election Day ballot shortages, and an estimated 4 percent of all  jurisdictions did not have enough voting equipment on Election Day.  However, there were statistical differences between large and small  jurisdictions in having enough voting equipment. We estimate that   12 percent of large jurisdictions, 4 percent of medium jurisdictions, and   3 percent of small jurisdictions did not have enough voting equipment.  Election officials in 23 of the 28 jurisdictions we visited reported that they  encountered no challenges with preparing and delivering ballots, voting  equipment, and supplies for the November 2004 general election.

Uncertainties about ballot content, such as whether or not certain  candidates or issues will be included on the ballot, could affect these  activities by delaying printing or leading to a last-minute rush to ensure that  ballots are printed in time for the election. While election officials in most  of the jurisdictions we visited did not report encountering these  uncertainties, election officials did in 4 jurisdictions. For example, election  officials in a jurisdiction in Colorado reported that ballot printing was  delayed by three statewide lawsuits regarding the content of the ballot.  These officials reported that they prepared two ballot designs\u2014one with a  particular candidate\u2019s name and one without\u2014so that they would be  prepared to send the ballots to an external printer regardless of the  lawsuits\u2019 outcome.", "Some jurisdictions are required to provide ballots in languages other than  English. Producing ballots in multiple languages can add to the complexity  of preparing ballots because election officials must take steps to ensure  proper translation and printing for each required language.

We estimate that  significantly more large jurisdictions provided ballots in languages other  than English than medium and small jurisdictions.

Election officials in 18 of the 28 jurisdictions we visited told us that  they contracted with moving companies to deliver voting equipment to  polling places prior to Election Day. For example, election officials in a  jurisdiction in Pennsylvania told us that they contract with a moving  company that transports about 1,000 DREs to about 400 polling places in  the week prior to Election Day. Election officials in a jurisdiction in Nevada  told us that to ensure that voting machines were delivered to the correct  polling places, they bar-coded each DRE and also assigned a bar code to  each polling place. Upon delivery, contract movers used scanners to read  the bar codes on each DRE and the bar code for the specific polling place.  Prior to Election Day, these officials said that teams of election staff  technicians then went to each polling place to set up the DREs and verify  the scanned bar codes. After setting up the DREs, the rooms in which they  were located were secured until Election Day. In contrast, in a jurisdiction  we visited in New Hampshire, two election workers delivered 12 optical  scan counters to the 12 polling places at 4:00 a.m. on Election Day.

We asked election  officials during our site visits whether or not any polling places in their  jurisdictions had long lines during the November 2004 general election and  to describe factors they thought contributed to or helped to reduce long  lines.", "Election officials in 17 of the 28 jurisdictions we visited reported having  long lines at one or more polling places in their jurisdiction at some point  on Election Day. However, there was variation in the reported voter wait  times, times of day, and numbers of polling places with lines. For instance,  election officials described voter wait times that ranged from 15 minutes to  1 \u00bd hours. Some election officials reported that the longer lines occurred in  the morning; others told us that they kept polling places open past the  official closing time to accommodate voters who were in line when the  polls closed. Election officials in over half these 17 jurisdictions attributed  long lines to higher than expected voter turnout, both in general and at  peak voting times. Some of these jurisdictions were located in states where  the presidential race was considered close (often referred to as  \u201cbattleground states\u201d). For example, the election official in a jurisdiction  in Nevada attributed long lines to using a new voting system in addition to  being a battleground state and encountering high voter turnout. This  official estimated that there were between 30,000 and 35,000 more voters  for the November 2004 general election than in previous elections. Election  officials in 2 jurisdictions we visited in Ohio told us that higher than  expected voter turnout in some precincts led to long lines. For example,  election officials in 1 of these jurisdictions reported that at a polling place  where two precincts were located there was higher than expected turnout  because of a school board race. According to these officials, at this polling  place there was a single line for voters from both precincts to check in at  the registration table, and this line backed up. Election officials in another  jurisdiction in Ohio told us that some precincts had long lines, and one  precinct in particular had a waiting time of up to 1 hour. These officials said  that one precinct closed 30 to 45 minutes after closing time for the voters  that were in line at 7:30 p.m.", "Election officials in 11 of 28 jurisdictions we visited told us that none of the  polling places in their jurisdictions had long lines, and some described  factors that helped to reduce or prevent lines.

Election officials in a jurisdiction we visited in Washington (which reported  that it did not require or allow early voting) told us that they attributed their  lack of long lines on Election Day to the fact that two-thirds of voters in  their jurisdiction vote by absentee ballot. Election officials in a jurisdiction  in Florida reported that in planning for the November 2004 general  election, they decided to encourage early and absentee voting as  alternatives to Election Day voting in anticipation that there would be  heavy turnout for the general election. Their voter education campaign,  which included buying airtime on radios and in movie theaters, stressed  early voting options.

On the basis of our  nationwide survey of local jurisdictions, for the November 2004 general  election, we estimate that for 48 percent of all jurisdictions, the primary  means of communication between polling places and the central office was  telephones installed at polling places. Cell phones were also used as a  primary means of communication in some jurisdictions. For example, on  the basis of our local survey results, we estimate that for 25 percent of all  jurisdictions, personal cell phones were the primary means of  communication.", "Having inadequate communication lines on Election Day was a problem for  election officials in the November 2000 election, as we noted in our  October 2001 report on election processes. On the basis of our 2005  survey of local jurisdictions, communication problems between polling  places and the election office on Election Day were a challenge for some  jurisdictions in the November 2004 election, and these problems varied by  the size category of jurisdiction, with more large jurisdictions encountering  major problems than medium and small jurisdictions. We estimate that   36 percent of large jurisdictions, 63 percent of medium jurisdictions, and   89 percent of small jurisdictions encountered no major problems with the  communication system used at polling places. Small jurisdictions may not  have experienced communication problems on Election Day for a variety  of reasons, among them because a single polling place is located in the  same building as the central election office, allowing the election officials  to be physically present to resolve any questions or issues.

The differences between all size categories  are statistically significant. Election officials in many large jurisdictions we  visited reported receiving numerous phone calls on Election Day, both  from polling places and from the public. In addition to poll workers calling  from polling places, election officials at the central office may receive  phone calls from citizens asking about the location of their polling place or  whether or not they are registered to vote. For example, a large jurisdiction  we visited in Nevada reported receiving over 35,000 calls on Election Day  2004, about three times the number reportedly received in 2000. Election  officials reported that most calls received were from people wanting to  know whether or not they were registered or where their polling place was,  despite providing polling place locations on their Web site, printing the  locations in the newspaper, and mailing a sample ballot listing polling place  locations to every registered voter in the jurisdiction. Election officials in   2 other large jurisdictions in Florida and Kansas reported that the volume  of calls received was extremely high and that most inquiries concerned  voter eligibility.

For example, election officials in a large jurisdiction in  Pennsylvania reported that after experiencing problems being able to  handle the volume of calls on Election Day 2000, they implemented a call  center at their office with 30 phone lines for the November 2004 election.  While these election officials reported receiving \u201ca lot\u201d of calls for the 2004  general election, they said they were able to successfully handle the  volume because of the new phone lines. Election officials in a large  jurisdiction in Illinois reported that a feature, new for the November 2004  election, on the jurisdiction\u2019s Web site that allowed voters to determine  their polling place online helped to reduce the number of phone calls  received from people asking about polling location."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Election Officials in Some Jurisdictions We Visited Reported That Third-Party Observers Were a Challenge on Election Day 2004", "paragraphs": ["After the November 2004 general election, some reports highlighted  allegations of voter intimidation by third parties (e.g., poll watchers,  observers, or electioneers) at polling places.

Election officials in 19 of the   28 jurisdictions we visited did not report experiencing problems with third  parties on Election Day.

Poll watchers, according to election  officials, had been bused in from another state to observe the election  because Nevada was a battleground state, which led to having 14 poll  watchers at some locations. These officials noted that while most poll  watchers simply observed, the poll watchers did increase the number of  people at polling places, creating more for poll workers to manage.  Election officials in other jurisdictions reported that third-party behavior  negatively affected poll workers and voters. For example, election officials  in a jurisdiction in Pennsylvania reported that one of the biggest challenges  on Election Day was managing poll workers\u2019 stress levels in an especially  contentious election where poll watchers and observers yelled at them  throughout the day. Election officials in another jurisdiction in Nevada told  us that outside observers\u2019 behavior was disruptive and noted that the  observers were contentious, violated electioneering limits at the polling  place, and questioned every action that poll workers made. Election  officials in a jurisdiction in Colorado reported that at one polling location  on a college campus, poll watchers and representatives of a national  organization were encouraging students to go to the polling place at one  time to create a disruption. Students were also being encouraged to get  back in line after they had voted, which caused long lines for other voters.  Election officials said that they ended up calling security officers to help  manage the situation.", "In other instances, election officials reported that observers provided  misinformation to voters or even used intimidation tactics. Election  officials in a jurisdiction in Florida reported that third-party organizations  caused confusion at polling places by misinforming voters and staging  demonstrations. In a jurisdiction we visited in Colorado, election officials  told us that poll watchers caused problems at some polling places by  providing misinformation to voters, such as informing them that their  provisional ballots would not be counted. In a jurisdiction in New Mexico,  election officials said that one polling place had to remain open until   10:30 p.m. because voters were encouraged by local political advocates to  go to that polling place to vote even though the polling location for their  precinct had been changed. As a result, according to these officials,  hundreds of provisional ballots were cast at the polling place, which made  for long waiting times. Election officials in another jurisdiction in New  Mexico reported that outside candidate advocates and observers from  political parties tried intimidation tactics and treated people at the polls  \u201cterribly.\u201d For example, these election officials told us that some advocates  were observed taking photographs of the license plates of Hispanic voters  as they arrived at polling places.", "We did not ask a specific question about third-party activities at polling  places on our survey of local jurisdictions because of the complexities in  capturing the range of alleged behaviors on a structured survey.

Larger jurisdictions are also likely to need to rely to a  greater degree on technology to manage their elections administration  process, and this brings its own set of challenges. The complexity of  administering an election and the potential for challenges increase with the  number of people and places involved, the ethnic diversity and language  skills of the voting population, and the scope of activities and processes  that must be conducted. Many of the election officials in large jurisdictions  we visited told us that being well prepared, having established policies and  procedures in place, and having qualified election staff were factors that  contributed to a smooth Election Day.

These ballots  are called provisional because they are counted only if an election official  determines that the voter is eligible under state law to vote.

In Michigan, for example, a voter receiving a provisional  ballot who was unable to meet the identification requirement was  permitted, according to election officials responding to our state survey, to  fax, mail, or hand-deliver an acceptable form of photo identification to the  clerk anytime during the 6 days following the election."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternatives to Provisional Voting Available in Some Jurisdictions We Visited", "paragraphs": ["Some jurisdictions we visited reported that Election Day voting options  other than provisional ballots were available. For example, election  officials in jurisdictions we visited in Ohio said that provisional ballots  were the only special ballots available for that election. In contrast, in a  New Mexico jurisdiction we visited, election officials said the state offered  an in-lieu-of ballot for voters who requested an absentee ballot, and  claimed it did not arrive. These election officials said the in-lieu-of ballot  was the same as a provisional ballot, but it was placed in a different sleeve  for later determination of whether an absentee ballot had been cast or not.  At a Connecticut jurisdiction we visited, election officials described the  state\u2019s presidential ballot, available at the clerk\u2019s office on Election Day for  the November 2004 election. A presidential ballot, according to election  officials and documents they provided, allowed voting for president and  vice-president by former Connecticut residents who had moved to another  state within 30 days of the election and for that reason could not vote in  their new state of residence.", "Election officials in some jurisdictions we visited, such as 1 jurisdiction in  Florida and 2 jurisdictions in New Jersey, said their procedures allowed  challenged voters to sign a statement, such as an affidavit declaring their  eligibility, and to vote on a regular ballot that would be counted with other  ballots on Election Day. According to poll worker guidance provided by  election officials in the Florida jurisdiction, a written challenge must be  submitted under oath and given to the voter; then the voter has the right to  submit an oath affirming his or her eligibility. The polling place clerk and  inspectors must resolve the challenge by majority vote, providing a regular  ballot if the decision is in the prospective voter\u2019s favor. The guidance states  that a challenged voter who refuses to sign the oath must be offered a  provisional ballot. In both jurisdictions we visited in New Jersey, voters  who were challenged were not issued a provisional ballot, according to  documents provided by election officials. As stated in the poll worker  manual for one of the jurisdictions for the 2004 general election, a voter  who was challenged completed a challenged voter affidavit, as shown in  figure 43. The manual stated that the location\u2019s four poll workers take a  vote to decide whether the voter would be allowed to vote. On the basis of  the decision, the challenged voter cast a regular ballot or was not allowed  to vote, according to the manual (in case of a tie, the voter was allowed to  vote).", "In our survey of local election jurisdictions nationwide, we asked for  information on the use of provisional ballots, challenged ballots, or other  types of ballots under various scenarios for the November 2004 election.  Table 18 shows the extent to which we estimate that local jurisdictions  provided provisional ballots as compared to providing other types of  ballots.", "Apart from permitting voters to cast provisional ballots under the  circumstances specified in HAVA, election officials in jurisdictions we  visited described differing approaches under which provisional ballots  were utilized for the November 2004 election.", "Election officials in most of the 28 jurisdictions we visited said that in the  November 2004 election they would not refuse an individual a provisional  ballot. In a Colorado jurisdiction, election officials said that election judges  were instructed to direct all voters meeting the criteria for voting  provisionally (e.g., claiming to be registered and eligible, but with some  eligibility question) to the provisional voting table. In 1 Nevada jurisdiction,  the election official said that anyone could receive a provisional ballot. He  said that they had Las Vegas tourists who wanted to vote a provisional  ballot, even though they were informed that it would not be counted.  Election officials in 1 Washington jurisdiction said voters knew that they  could cast a ballot regardless of circumstances, and election officials in the  other Washington jurisdiction said that provisional ballots served as a  conflict avoidance tool at the polls. Election officials in both New Mexico  jurisdictions said that if a voter was not on the registration list, he or she  was immediately given a provisional ballot. According to the New Mexico  election officials, precinct officials were not to direct a voter to the correct  precinct; instead, under the provisional voting rule, they were to offer a  provisional ballot to the voter.", "Election officials in some other jurisdictions we visited told us that poll  workers may have taken certain steps before providing a voter with a  provisional ballot. In 1 Illinois jurisdiction, an election official said that if a  potential voter was not listed, the poll workers first tried to determine if the  voter was registered in another jurisdiction. If that was the case, the poll  workers then directed the voter to that jurisdiction, but they did not refuse  to provide a provisional ballot if a voter requested one. In 1 Ohio  jurisdiction, election officials told us that if a voter was registered in Ohio,  everything was done to get the voter to the correct precinct. In a New  Jersey jurisdiction we visited, election officials explained that poll workers  take several steps when the voter\u2019s name was not listed in the poll book.  Poll workers were instructed, according to the poll worker\u2019s manual, to  check the poll book for misspellings or for the name being out of  alphabetical sequence, and to check the county street guide to see if the  voter was in the wrong location. Election officials in this jurisdiction also  told us that voters who were in the wrong location were directed to the  correct location. They added that voters who did not wish to vote  provisionally were told to go before a superior court judge to plead their  cases.", "In 5 jurisdictions we visited, election officials said there were instances  where election officials would refuse to provide a provisional ballot on  Election Day. In 1 Ohio jurisdiction, election officials said that a provisional  ballot was provided if the potential voter appeared at the polling place.  However, if the person came to the election office on Election Day and no  record of voter registration was found by the Registrar, then the voter was  not allowed to vote provisionally. A potential voter stating that he or she  was not registered or not a resident was a reason not to offer the individual  a provisional ballot, according to election officials in 1 jurisdiction in  Nevada, and 1 in New Jersey, and both jurisdictions in North Carolina.  Officials in 1 Georgia jurisdiction we visited said that an individual might  not be offered a provisional ballot if he or she was on the voter registration  list and therefore eligible to vote a regular ballot.", "Whether a provisional ballot was provided or not might have been based, in  part, on the size of the jurisdiction and the familiarity of the poll workers  with the voters. Several election officials in small local jurisdictions  included in our nationwide survey made this point in written comments.  For example, comments included the following:  \u201cThis is a small township. We don\u2019t have the problems big cities have.  People know who lives in the township. They know their neighbors.\u201d   \u201cMost voters are personally known, including their addresses.\u201d   \u201cWe were told that the state voter list was the bible for the day. But we  had one lady who should have been provisional but we all knew where  she lived so we let her vote. It was the choir lady\u2019s niece. Her signature  was on file.\u201d", "In larger jurisdictions, poll workers might be less likely to know the voters  in the precinct and may have made greater use of provisional ballots than in  smaller jurisdictions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Newness of Providing Provisional Ballots Presented Some Challenges in November 2004", "paragraphs": ["Some jurisdictions we visited reported that knowing how many provisional  ballots to have available for the November 2004 election was a challenge.  However, on the basis of our survey of local jurisdictions, we estimate that  for the November 2004 election, only 1 percent of jurisdictions had a  shortage of provisional ballots. The difficulty with anticipating the need for  provisional ballots, according to an Illinois jurisdiction election official,  was that officials had no historical experience to rely upon in deciding how  many to make available at each site. In this jurisdiction, provisional ballots  were used for the first time in the November 2004 election, according to the  election official. Similarly, in a Pennsylvania jurisdiction we visited,  election officials stated that they had no basis to plan for the number  needed, and that they had to rush to produce (e.g., placing a provisional  ballot sticker over an absentee ballot) additional provisional ballots at the  last minute because some precincts needed more than were initially  allocated. Election officials in one Nevada jurisdiction we visited said some  polling places were overstocked while others were understocked, requiring  them to shuttle the ballots between polling places. In a Colorado  jurisdiction we visited, election officials said that last-minute changes by  state officials created a need for more provisional ballots because this  change allowed individuals who registered during a voter registration drive  but who were not on the voter list to vote provisionally.", "On the basis of our local survey, poll workers failing to follow procedures  for conducting provisional voting surfaced as an issue in some jurisdictions  in the November 2004 election. We estimate that 12 percent of jurisdictions  nationwide encountered poll worker performance problems related to their  failure to follow procedures with provisional voting. The newness of the  provisional procedures or last-minute changes in the guidance were  challenges that confused poll workers, according to election officials in  jurisdictions we visited. Specifically,  In a Georgia jurisdiction, election officials told us there was a question  regarding whether several college students were eligible to vote  provisionally, and state election officials were called for clarification  (the students were allowed to vote provisionally).", "In a Connecticut jurisdiction, election officials said poll workers were  confused about the process, issuing provisional ballots in some cases  before checking with the Registrar to try to locate the prospective  voters in the statewide database.", "In both Nevada jurisdictions, election officials we visited identified poll  worker training needs; for example, in 1 of the Nevada jurisdictions  election officials said provisional ballot materials were not adequately  tracked and returned.", "In an Ohio jurisdiction, election officials identified poll worker handling  of provisional ballots as an area for improvement based on finding valid  provisional ballots returned in envelopes for soiled and defaced ballots.  In addition, they said about half of the provisional voters did not sign the  poll book, as they were supposed to have done under this jurisdiction\u2019s  requirements. Furthermore, voters were to place their provisional  ballots in a colored provisional sleeve for determination of eligibility  before the vote was submitted, but the election official estimated that  about 10 percent of the provisional ballots were placed directly in the  ballot box instead.", "Some election officials in jurisdictions we visited described actions they  took to implement provisional voting that worked well for the November  2004 election. Several identified training given to poll workers that  prepared them for provisional voting, or had staff dedicated to handling  provisional votes, or poll workers with prior provisional voting experience.  For example, election officials in 1 Colorado jurisdiction said that they had  election judges whose sole responsibility was conducting provisional  voting. According to these election officials, the election judges (i.e., poll  workers) were well trained and sat at a separate table to handle provisional  voting. One jurisdiction we visited in Illinois had specific instructions on  the voter affidavit for election workers to follow.

In the  November 2004 election, state requirements regarding the location from  which voters had to cast their provisional ballot in order for it to be  counted (e.g., in the specific precinct in which the voter is registered or  anywhere within the county\u2014city, parish, township\u2014in which the voter  was registered) was one key difference among states. States also varied in  how missing voter information was handled and how voters were informed  whether their vote was counted or not.

As a result, states establish,  under their own election codes, the applicable jurisdiction where voters  must cast their provisional ballot from in order for such ballot to be eligible  to be counted. For example, in some states this location is the specific  precinct in which the voter is registered, and in other states, the voter may  be anywhere within the county (city, parish, township) in which the voter  resides and is registered. Our survey of state election officials asked where  a provisional voter needed to cast a vote in order for it to be counted for  the November 2004 election.

For example, voters in Kansas could, according to  election officials, vote provisionally in precincts other than where they  were registered (but within the same county) and if otherwise eligible to  vote have their vote partially counted (e.g., for county, state, or federal  offices or issues). Nevada election officials said they count provisional  votes cast anywhere in the county where the voter was registered and  otherwise eligible, but all provisional ballots only included federal races.  Election officials in both Washington jurisdictions we visited reported that  a voter in the November 2004 election was allowed to cast a provisional  ballot anywhere in the state of Washington, and the ballot would be  forwarded to the correct county (if the ballot was cast in a county other  than the one in which the voter was registered) and counted if the voter  was eligible. Election officials in 1 Washington jurisdiction we visited said  that county election workers mailed the provisional ballots for non- Washington residents to the Secretary of State of the state where the voter  claimed to be registered, but these officials were not knowledgeable of  what became of the ballots.", "Election officials in several states have faced court challenges to their state  requirements regarding the location where a provisional ballot must have  been cast in order to be counted. The litigation has primarily arisen in  states requiring that a provisional voter had to cast a vote in the specific  precinct in which he or she was registered, in order for that vote to be  counted. In this context, the courts have generally held that HAVA does not  require a state to count provisional votes cast in the wrong precinct as legal  votes when they would otherwise be considered invalid under state law.", "In our state survey, we also asked state election officials if they anticipated  that their state would change, by November 2006, where a provisional voter  must cast a vote for it to be counted.

The fourth state, Colorado, had reported for the November 2004 general  election that provisional voters had to cast their votes in the specific  precincts in which they were registered in order for their votes to be  counted. Georgia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia said they did not  know whether rules specifying where a provisional voter must cast a ballot  in order to be counted could be anticipated to change, and the remaining   4 states responded that they will not have provisional voting.

In exercising this discretion, states have created varied provisional voting  rules and practices. Under HAVA, provisional ballots are to be counted as a  vote under state law if the person casting the ballot is determined to be  eligible to vote under state law. These statutory provisions and  determinations of eligibility and what constitutes a properly voted ballot  vary by state and thus affect the state rules and procedures used to  determine whether provisional ballots are counted. At least 1 state, for  example, allows voters to cast a provisional ballot for statewide offices  anywhere in the state, with the ballot returned for eligibility verification  and counting to the jurisdiction in which the voter said he or she was  registered. Other states required that voters cast provisional ballots in their  assigned precinct for the ballots to be counted. The actual impact of these  varying practices on provisional balloting and vote counting is unknown.

In our site  visits, local election officials also described securing DRE tapes and  cartridges under lock and key before and after they were delivered to  boards of elections or other authorities. For example, election officials  from 1 jurisdiction we visited described securing memory cards in optical  scan counting machines by attaching a plastic band with a serial number.  The band would have to be severed in order for the memory card to be  removed, according to election officials. One such band is shown in Figure  47 securing a voting equipment bag.", "Election officials in 2 jurisdictions we visited also described a variety of  measures they took to ensure that ballots were not lost or miscounted. In   1 Washington jurisdiction, officials said they secured punch card ballots at  polling places for counting elsewhere by transporting ballots twice: once  earlier on Election Day and the other time after the polls had closed. These  officials also said that ballots were bundled into groups of 50, separated by  type (Election Day, provisional, and absentee ballots), and put into  transport carrier safe boxes. Two poll workers, one from each political  party, accompanied the ballots when they were transported to the elections  office for counting.

According to our state  survey, 47 states and the District of Columbia reported that they required  jurisdictions to count or keep track of ballots that were unused, spoiled,  rejected, or issued but not returned. Two states, Montana and Maine,  reported not requiring jurisdictions to count or keep track of such ballots.  New York reported in our survey that because it does not have paper  ballots, such tracking was not necessary. New York reported that it did not  use paper, optical scan, or punch card ballots.

The official total was usually certified by an election official. This  process varied among jurisdictions in terms of how and where it was done  and who was responsible.", "The counting process involved several different types of ballots, cast under  different circumstances:   General election votes are cast at polling places on Election Day by  voters who appeared in the registration lists for that precinct and voted  a regular ballot.", "Provisional votes are cast by those, for example, whose registration  (and qualification to vote) could not be established at the time of voting  at the polls on Election Day.", "Absentee votes are generally votes received and cast by mail before  Election Day.", "Early votes are generally cast in person before Election Day.", "According to our local survey, for the November 2004 general election,  local jurisdictions nationwide used different voting methods for different  ballot types.

In  jurisdictions we visited, we learned about some of the substantial  variations in the sequence, procedures, and precautions taken to conduct  the count. We found in our site visits that vote counting ranged from a very  simple process in a small jurisdiction to more complex processes in larger  jurisdictions. For example, a small New Hampshire jurisdiction, with just  over 1,000 registered voters, had one polling place and one precinct open  on Election Day, according to election officials. They told us the paper  ballots were not transferred to any location for counting and were hand- counted by 25 election workers. These officials also said that five teams of  five individuals each reviewed votes cast on each paper ballot and used  paper and pencil to record and tally vote totals. The final election outcomes  were written on a standard form and submitted to the New Hampshire  Secretary of State\u2019s office, according to election officials.", "In contrast, election officials in a large Washington jurisdiction described a  more complex process for their centralized vote count of punch card  ballots. As described by these officials, their process enabled them to begin  reporting results on Election Day evening by precinct and to provide  updates of the count every 30 minutes. Once Election Day ballots were  transferred to the election office by poll workers, the ballots were counted  to determine total numbers, according to election officials. They also told  us that after the ballots were separated by precinct, up to 20 inspection  boards, composed of two Republicans and two Democrats each, inspected  the ballots one precinct at a time. In the inspection process, the officials  said that the ballots were further separated into categories\u2014those that  were machine-readable and those that required further examination, such  as ballots with write-in candidates or with a chad hanging by two or more  corners. Once all questions were resolved (including any that would  require review by a canvassing board), they told us ballots in batches of   500 each were placed in trays by precinct and brought to the ballot  tabulation area. According to these officials, the jurisdiction used a punch  card tabulator, which was connected to a computer and had a processing  speed of 600 ballots per minute (see fig. 48). Once all ballots were counted,  jurisdiction election officials told us they generated an unofficial report  with results for all races and voting propositions.

For example, in a  large Kansas jurisdiction, election officials said that voters were able to  place their ballots in an optical scanner at the polling place that read the  ballot and rejected it if there were any problems. According to officials  there, the machines could return to the voter any ballot that, for example,  had too few or too many votes for a specific office and provide a screen  message for what to correct before resubmitting the ballot. After the polls  closed, the optical scan machines with their memory cards\u2014which had  been programmed for the specific precinct\u2014were transferred to election  headquarters, according to election officials.

At 1 jurisdiction in  Washington election officials said that they qualified the absentee ballots as  they were received at the election office, but did not count the votes until  3:00 p.m. on Election Day. Additionally, at a jurisdiction in Illinois, election  officials said that they distributed most absentee ballots to their respective  precincts to be counted along with the Election Day ballots. In each of  these jurisdictions, however, according to election officials, the absentee  ballot results were not released until after the Election Day polls were  closed.

At one jurisdiction we visited,  election officials told us that early voting DRE votes were reconciled daily.  According to these officials, at the end of the early voting period, election  department staff shut down the DRE machines and removed the memory  cards (which stored cast votes). The officials said that the memory cards  were sealed and returned to the election department office for counting, in  a manner similar to Election Day DRE votes.

Illinois reported that it had no  requirements or guidance for determining voter intent, according to our  state survey.

In a Washington jurisdiction we visited  that used punch card ballots in the 2004 general election, election officials  said that state law guided their jurisdiction\u2019s written instructions for  determining voter intent.

In 1 North Carolina jurisdiction we visited, which used DRE machines,  local election officials described the recount process as follows: The  recount was conducted in a different manner from the initial count. For the  initial count, votes were electronically transferred from each DRE machine  to vote storage devices at the polls that stored the vote totals by precinct.  The precinct totals were then downloaded from the vote storage devices  onto a computer located at the jurisdiction\u2019s election headquarters, and  vote tabulation software summed vote totals from each precinct for each  election contest in the jurisdiction. During the recount, rather than relying  on aggregated votes totaled by precinct for a vote count, officials tabulated  individual DRE ballots. To complete this process, the jurisdiction\u2019s  tabulation software recognized individual ballot images from the DRE  machines rather than aggregated votes per precinct. The individual ballot  images were downloaded onto the computer in election headquarters, and  votes for the races in question were retabulated (by voter, rather than by  precinct as in the initial count).

For the 2004 general  election, Arizona reported in our state survey that it had amended its  mandatory recount requirements so that the thresholds triggered by the  number of votes only applied when the total number of votes cast was  25,000 or fewer.", "Washington\u2019s mandatory recount provisions in place for the November  2004 general election had changed since the November 2000 general  election. The requirement in 2000 for a mandatory recount by machine was  a margin of 0.5 percent or less of total votes cast for the top two candidates.  If the margin was less than 150 votes and less than 0.25 percent of total  votes cast for the top two candidates, a manual recount was required. The  amended requirement, in place for the November 2004 general election,  specified that a recount by machine was required when the margin is both  fewer than 2,000 votes and less than 0.5 percent of total votes cast for the  top two candidates. If the margin was fewer than 150 votes and less than  0.25 percent of total votes cast for the top two candidates, there was to be a  manual recount.", "Since the November 2000 election, Minnesota amended its mandatory  recount triggers to include a specific percentage margin of victory in  certain circumstances, rather than only a specified difference in the  absolute number of votes between the top two candidates. While a margin  of 100 votes or fewer in an election had previously triggered a recount for  the 2000 general election, Minnesota election officials reported in our state  survey that for the 2004 general election their state required a recount if the  margin was determined to be either less than one-half of 1 percent of the  total number of votes counted or, was 10 votes or less when no more than  400 votes are cast.", "According to our state survey, state requirements or guidance for who may  request a recount, in place for the November 2004 general election,  changed in Florida, Maine, and Rhode Island since 2000. While any Florida  candidate or candidate\u2019s political party in 2000 could request a recount, this  was no longer true for the November 2004 general election. For the 2004  general election, Florida election officials reported that no candidate or  political party could request a recount, and that the only authorized  recounts were mandatory recounts to be conducted when the margin of  victory was 0.5 percent or less of the total votes cast. Rhode Island, which  reported that for the November 2000 general election it had allowed  recount requests by any candidate who trailed the winning candidate by  less than 5 percent, reported that for the November 2004 general election, it  required a smaller margin before a losing candidate could request a  recount. For example, for races with between 20,001 and 100,000 votes,  Rhode Island reported that it required a margin of 1 percent or less (or   500 votes) before a trailing candidate could request a recount, and for races  with more than 100,000 votes the required margin was one-half of 1 percent  (or 1,500 votes) before a trailing candidate could request a recount. Maine,  on the other hand, reported that its recount provisions in place for the  November 2004 general election were clarified to provide that an apparent  losing candidate, rather than only the second-place candidate, could  request a recount."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vote Count Audits Were Not Prevalent in the 2004 General Election, but Some States Reported Taking Action to Require Them", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia reported that for the 2004  general election, they did not have provisions requiring or allowing local  jurisdictions to conduct a vote count audit of election results. However, in  our state survey, 9 states reported taking action since November 2004   (e.g., enacted legislation or took executive action) to require audits of vote  counts. As used in this report, a vote count audit is an automatic recount, in  full or in part, of the vote tabulation, irrespective of the margin of victory, in  order to ensure accuracy before certification.", "On the basis of our state survey, as shown in figure 52, 8 states reported  that for the 2004 general election they had a vote count audit requirement  for all local jurisdictions, and 2 states reported requiring vote count audits  for some local jurisdictions. Election officials from 29 states and the  District of Columbia reported that for the 2004 general election they did not  require or allow local jurisdictions to conduct vote count audits. Eleven  states reported that they allowed them. We estimate, on the basis of our  local survey, that 15 percent of all local jurisdictions were required by their  states to conduct such audits as part of the certification process for the  2004 general election. Larger and medium jurisdictions were more likely to  have been required to do so than smaller jurisdictions. Nine percent of  small jurisdictions, 27 percent of medium, and 38 percent of large  jurisdictions conducted a required vote count audit of the 2004 general  election. Both large and medium jurisdictions were statistically different  from small jurisdictions.", "Nine states reported in our state survey that they had enacted legislation or  taken some executive action to require audits since November 2004. For  example, in Washington, beginning January 1, 2006, prior to election  certifications, county officials must audit the results of votes cast on DRE  machines. The audit must be conducted by randomly selecting up to   4 percent of the DRE voting machines or one machine, whichever is  greater, and for each device, comparing the results recorded electronically  with the results recorded on paper.", "During our visits to local election jurisdictions, election officials in 5  jurisdictions described conducting vote count audits as a part of the  election certification process for the November 2004 general election. For  instance, 2 large jurisdictions in Nevada reported that the state requires  each jurisdiction to randomly audit election results when DRE machines  were used. According to officials in 1 of these Nevada jurisdictions, they  were required to select 1 percent of DRE machines, or 20 machines,  whichever amount is greater, and to perform a manual audit of the  machine-tabulated vote totals. The officials said that they used a computer  program to randomly select which of the jurisdiction\u2019s 740 DRE machines  to audit. To conduct a paper-based audit, they told us that for each  randomly selected machine, election workers printed the DRE result tapes  from the voter-verified paper trail printer, manually counted the vote data  on the tapes, and compared the manual count results to the original  electronic results.", "In one large Illinois jurisdiction we visited, election officials told us they  were required by the state to automatically audit (by retabulating votes)  results of punch card ballots in 5 percent of their precincts, which were  randomly selected. According to the officials, the State Board of Elections  sent the jurisdiction officials a letter specifying which randomly selected  precincts had to retabulate their votes.", "Election officials in a Pennsylvania jurisdiction we visited said that state  law required random audits when electronic voting machines were used.  According to these officials, they were required to audit 2 percent of DRE  vote totals following an election. They told us, however, that in practice  they actually audit all DRE machine vote totals to ensure an accurate vote  count. They stated that vote data stored on DRE backup memory cards is  printed and compared to vote data stored on DRE cartridges used in  original vote counts.

At several of the jurisdictions we  visited, officials recounted mistakes in using the DRE systems, for  example, that echoed other recent findings (in our September 2005 report  on the security and reliability of electronic voting), noting inadequate  understanding of the equipment on the part of those using it.", "In our September 2005 report on electronic voting, we noted that instances  of fewer votes counted than cast in one Pennsylvania county in the 2004  general election had resulted from incorrectly programmed DRE machines.  Similarly, in our 2005 site visits to election jurisdictions for this report,  officials with whom we spoke recounted difficulties that had resulted from  mistakes in programming the electronic equipment. In 1 Florida  jurisdiction, for example, officials reported that the storage capacity of an  optical scan accumulator (used to combine vote data from DREs and  optical scanners) had been inadequately programmed to capture all of the  votes cast. Officials there were able to discover and rectify the problem so  that all votes were counted. In a Nevada jurisdiction, officials said that on  Election Day, there were 198 provisional ballots (out of 4,532 cast) that  were incorrectly programmed on the DRE machines at several polling  locations, resulting in the provisional votes being counted without the  voter first being qualified. According to these officials, poll workers forgot  to add the \u201c0\u201d to the beginning of the precinct number. The officials noted  that 2004 was the first time that the jurisdiction had used provisional voting  and that in the future they planned to use paper provisional ballots to avoid  any confusion.", "In a North Carolina jurisdiction we visited, election officials told us about  how a misunderstanding of the voting equipment resulted in the loss of  votes. Specifically, election officials were unclear about the vote storage  capacity of a DRE machine used in early voting and failed to notice the  machine\u2019s warning that its file was full. The software installed on this  machine was an older version of the program and only recognized up to  3,500 votes, according to election officials. Election administrators  believed that it could recognize up to 10,500 votes. They discovered the  error at the close of Election Day when reconciling the number of votes  cast on the DRE machine used in early voting with the number of voters  credited with early voting at the polls. Furthermore they said it was not  until they subsequently conducted a simulation of votes cast that they  discovered the cause of the problem. They also discovered that while the  machine\u2019s software flashed warnings on its screen when the voter file  became full, election workers had not seen it because of the screen\u2019s  positioning. Also, according to the officials, they had been operating under  the assumption that the machine would have automatically stopped  accepting votes once the limit had been reached. Instead, the machine had  continued to accept votes cast, overwriting earlier votes in order to  accommodate the new ones. The officials said they determined that   4,235 votes were lost.", "Not all equipment failures resulted in lost votes, but some did create  technical challenges. Officials in a Colorado jurisdiction stated that  memory cards for optical scan machines at early voting sites sometimes  failed, which meant that all affected optical scan ballots were rescanned  using a new card once poll workers realized that the original card was  malfunctioning. Also, in our September 2005 report on the security and  reliability of electronic voting mentioned earlier, we noted that a Florida  county experienced several problems with its DRE system, including  instances where each touch screen took up to 1 hour to activate and had to  be activated separately and sequentially, causing delays at the polling place.  In addition, we reported that election monitors discovered that the system  contained a flaw that allowed one DRE machine\u2019s ballots to be added to the  canvass totals multiple times without being detected. In another instance,  our report notes that a malfunction in a DRE system in Ohio caused the  system to record approximately 3,900 votes too many for one presidential  candidate in the 2004 general election. We also reported that a state- designated voting system examiner in a Pennsylvania jurisdiction noted  that the county DRE system had technical problems, such as failure to  accurately capture write-in votes, frozen computer screens, and difficulties  sensing voters\u2019 touches.", "During our 2005 site visits, officials from 3 jurisdictions also described  several cases of jamming problems with optical scan and punch card ballot  tabulators. For example, election officials in a Kansas jurisdiction we  visited told us that an extensive two-sided optical scan ballot frequently  jammed voting machines because of its length. These officials told us that  they used a two-sided ballot design which required that the optical scan  counting equipment read the ballot front and back, which presented a  problem. According to the officials, the ballot was not scored properly to  feed easily through the equipment and paper jams occurred frequently.  Election officials said the ballots had to be hand-sorted into 13 groups  before scanning, which took time. Similarly, officials in a New Jersey  jurisdiction told us that their optical scan machines had frequently jammed  when reading provisional and absentee ballots. According to the officials,  the ballots had two or three folds, which in combination with the high  volume of ballots being read, jammed the machine regularly. To repair the  jams, officials told us they would straighten ballots and run them through  again, or, if needed, would remake the ballot. Also, officials in an Illinois  jurisdiction we visited said punch cards had also jammed in their tabulator.  Officials there said that this had been likely due to the punch cards swelling  in humid weather, and this problem had caused the scanner to misread  ballots on several occasions. In all of these instances, the problems were  corrected.", "While we heard in our site visits about some human error at the polls, in  our survey of local jurisdictions we found that human error was a problem  for a small portion of election jurisdictions in terms of at least one key  function. Specifically, we estimate that 6 percent of local jurisdictions  nationwide experienced poll worker errors in tracking and accounting for  ballots. To the extent that these errors occurred, they were more common  in large jurisdictions. We estimate 1 percent of small jurisdictions,   14 percent of medium jurisdictions, and 34 percent of large jurisdictions  had these errors. The differences between all size categories are  statistically significant. In 10 of the jurisdictions we visited, election  officials cited poll worker or voter errors as the cause of discrepancies in  the number of ballots and voters. In 1 Ohio jurisdiction, for example,  election officials said the discrepancy in the number of ballots and votes  was caused by the fact that poll workers did not track some voters who left  the polling place without voting. In a Florida jurisdiction, according to  election officials, some voters left the polling place without signing a poll  book (which was used to reconcile voter numbers). Another cause for  discrepancies in the number of ballots and voters cited by election officials  in a Washington jurisdiction was that poll workers erroneously counted  some provisional ballots as regular Election Day ballots, which led to the  appearance of more regular Election Day ballots cast than voters credited  with voting in that manner.", "Finally, from election officials in 2 jurisdictions we visited, we learned of  voter errors in using voting technology. In one Kansas jurisdiction, officials  reported that some voters did not know how to scroll down the electronic  screen to see all of the information. Also, we were told by election officials  in a New Jersey jurisdiction that poll workers had noticed that some voters  had failed to press a button to finalize their votes.

California officials responded that achieving an appropriate balance  between vote count accuracy and the speed of vote tabulation was a  challenge statewide. Arkansas officials said that the Secretary of State\u2019s  office had to contact local election jurisdictions numerous times to receive  certified election results in a timely manner.", "In some local jurisdictions we visited, we also heard about difficulty  meeting certification deadlines, particularly with regard to provisional  ballots. In 7 local election jurisdictions we visited, election officials cited  concerns with the timing requirements of election certifications.  Specifically, the task of verifying voter information with respect to  provisional ballots and counting provisional ballots made achieving  certification deadlines difficult. For example, officials in 1 Colorado  jurisdiction said that verifying and counting provisional ballots within the  state-mandated 12-day period required that the county hire additional  workers. A Florida jurisdiction reported a similar challenge, but in this  instance, these officials stated that the county canvassing board was  required to consider each provisional ballot individually, which added to  the challenge to meet the short state certification deadline. One large  jurisdiction in Illinois also reported that its 14-day certification deadline  was difficult to achieve because of the large number of provisional ballots  that had to be verified and counted. In a Washington jurisdiction, officials  stated that verifying and counting all ballots (including provisional ballots)  within state-mandated periods had been a challenge in 2004.

Provisional ballots  were to have included on the ballot envelope the voter\u2019s name and  residence.

In King County, the court found  that 348 provisional ballots were improperly cast without verifying voter  eligibility. The Election Center management audit found this had occurred  because the provisional voters had been allowed to put their ballots, which  had not been verified, directly into the optical scan machines at the voting  precincts. The Superior Court found that of these 348 provisional ballots,  252 were ultimately determined to have been cast by registered voters.

On the basis of their experience in  November 2004, some jurisdictions are implementing new procedures for  provisional voting, such as printing provisional ballots in a color different  from other types of ballots or using paper ballots rather than DRE  machines for provisional voters.", "Two jurisdictions we visited in Washington have announced plans to move  to all-mail elections, which was authorized on a county-wide basis by  recent state law. Although replacing in-person voting with all-mail voting  eliminates some challenges\u2014e.g., poll worker training on voting equipment  operations and provisional voting or the chance of malfunctioning voting  equipment at the polls\u2014in some circumstances it could magnify the  importance of other aspects of state election processes, such as verifying  votes, accurately matching voter signatures and having guidance for  determining voter intent from improperly or unclearly marked ballots. For  those jurisdictions allowing or requiring the determination of a voter\u2019s  intent from an improperly or unclearly marked ballot, the importance of  having explicit and consistent criteria for treating such ballots became  evident in the 2000 general election when different interpretations for such  ballots in Florida made the close presidential race extremely contentious.  Eighteen states that reported they did not have voter intent guidance in  place for the November 2000 general election reported to us in our state  survey that they did have voter intent requirements or guidance in place for  the November 2004 general election. While federal election provisions do  not address the state counting issue of ascertaining voter intent, HAVA did  require states to adopt, by January 2006, uniform and nondiscriminatory  standards defining what constitutes a vote and what will be counted as a  vote for each type of voting system used by the state.", "The recount in the close gubernatorial election in Washington revealed the  interdependence of every stage of the elections process in ensuring an  accurate vote count. That experience also illustrated how small errors in  election operations can affect the vote counting process. Were any state\u2019s  election processes subjected to the very close scrutiny that characterized  the recount in Washington state, it is likely that imperfections would be  revealed. Votes are cast and elections are conducted by people who are not  and cannot be 100 percent error free in all their tasks all the time. Thus, the  consistently error-free vote count may be elusive, particularly in very large  jurisdictions with hundreds of thousands of ballots cast in person,  absentee, or provisionally. However, diligent efforts to achieve consistent  error-free vote counts can help to ensure that any errors are reduced to the  minimum humanly possible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Voting Methods and Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Voting methods can be thought of as tools for accommodating the millions  of voters in our nation\u2019s more than 10,000 local elections jurisdictions.  These tools are as simple as a pencil, paper, and a box, or as sophisticated  as programmable computer-based touch screens. Regardless of method,  however, the proper operation and functioning of each depends on its  effective interplay with the people who participate in elections (both voters  and election workers) and the processes (governed by policies,  procedures, and so forth) that govern the interaction of people with one  another and with the voting method.", "This chapter focuses on voting methods\u2014the technology variable in the  people, process, and technology election equation. It describes the use of  voting methods in the 2004 general election, compares this technology  environment with that of the 2000 general election, and examines plans for  voting technologies in the 2006 election, particularly in light of the roles  being played by states and HAVA. It also examines efforts to measure and  understand how well voting equipment performed in the 2004 election   (see fig. 53 for equipment examples), including the state of performance  standards and local jurisdictions\u2019 overall satisfaction with their respective  voting methods. Additionally, this chapter discusses the state of practice  relative to voting system security, testing, and integration, and presents key  challenges facing all levels of governments as voting systems, related  election systems, and supporting technologies continue to evolve."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The technology of the voting environment can be characterized as varied  and evolving, according to our 2005 state survey results and local  jurisdiction survey estimates. We estimate on the basis of our local  jurisdiction survey that the predominant voting methods most often used  for the 2004 general election by large jurisdictions were DRE and precinct  count optical scan, while medium jurisdictions most often used precinct  count optical scan and small jurisdictions most often used paper ballot. In  addition, the predominant voting method most often used for large  jurisdictions changed from precinct count optical scan in 2000 to both DRE  and precinct count optical scan in 2004, while the predominant voting  methods remained the same for the other jurisdiction sizes. Also in the  2004 general election, an estimated one-fifth of jurisdictions used multiple  voting methods to support voting activities. Most states generally exercised  influence over the voting methods used by their respective elections  jurisdictions through a range of approaches such as requiring the use of  one specific voting method, helping with local acquisition efforts, or  eliminating voting methods, according to our 2005 state survey. Ten states  and the District of Columbia reported that they required the use of one  specific method for the 2004 general election, and 4 additional states  planned to require a specific method for the 2006 general election. Sixteen  states and the District of Columbia reported that they were involved to  some extent in local jurisdiction efforts to acquire voting systems,  components, and services. States also reported that they were eliminating  lever and punch card equipment between the 2000 and 2006 general  elections. Specifically, for the November 2000 general election, 37 states  reported that they used lever or punch card voting equipment; by the  November 2006 general election, only 4 states had plans to use lever and  punch card equipment. HAVA has influenced state and local decisions  regarding particular voting methods by providing funds to states to replace  punch card and lever voting equipment with other voting methods. This  greater state involvement in jurisdictions\u2019 choice of voting methods,  combined with federal funding to replace lever and punch card voting  equipment and certain HAVA requirements\u2014among other factors\u2014is likely  to influence the adoption of DRE and optical scan voting methods.", "Federal and state standards provide an important baseline for the  performance of voting systems and were widely adopted for the 2004  general election. However, according to our local jurisdiction survey, voting  equipment performance was not consistently measured during the 2004  general election and varied by jurisdiction size and voting method, in part  because some types of measures were not well suited to particular voting  methods. For example, small jurisdictions were generally less likely to  collect accuracy measures such as accuracy of voting equipment  (estimated at 31 percent for small jurisdictions) than large and medium  jurisdictions (66 percent and 54 percent, respectively), and this may be  because the predominant voting method most used by small jurisdictions  was paper ballot. On the other hand, on the basis of our local jurisdiction  survey, we estimate that the vast majority of all jurisdictions were very  satisfied or satisfied with their systems\u2019 performance during the 2004  general election. For instance, we estimate that 78 percent of jurisdictions  were very satisfied or satisfied with the accuracy of their voting system  performance. The estimated high satisfaction levels demonstrated across  different voting system performance areas and jurisdiction sizes contrast  with our lower estimates of the performance measures that were collected  for the 2004 general election. Although the reasons for moderate collection  levels for performance measures are unclear, jurisdictions that may not  have collected performance data or may have considered such information  not applicable to their situation may lack sufficient insight into their system  operations to adequately support their satisfaction in the variety of  performance areas we surveyed. The moderate collection levels of data on  operational voting system performance may present a challenge to state  and local election officials in their efforts to make informed decisions on  both near-term and long-term voting system changes and investments.", "A wide range of recently published concerns for the security of voting  systems and the development of nationwide mechanisms under HAVA to  improve security standards and processes have not yet produced a  consistent approach across all jurisdictions for managing the security of  voting systems. Our 2005 local jurisdiction survey and our visits to local  jurisdictions found that voting system security has been primarily  shouldered by local jurisdictions. However, states, vendors, law  enforcement officials, and others shared in these efforts to varying degrees  for the 2004 general election. Our state survey for the 2004 general election  and visits to local jurisdictions indicated that security mechanisms  employed by some states\u2014but not others\u2014included promulgation of  policies and guidance, compliance of voting equipment with security  standards, and monitoring and evaluation of implemented security  controls. According to our local jurisdiction survey estimates and visits to  local jurisdictions, jurisdictions and their support organizations were  largely responsible for implementation of security controls, such as access  restrictions to voting equipment, system backup capabilities, and security- related testing. Estimates from our local jurisdiction survey also showed,  however, that many jurisdictions nationwide had not documented their  security measures, and we found that several of the jurisdictions we visited  reported that they had not implemented recommended measures, such as  security plans, training, and documentation of policies and procedures.  Furthermore, decisions by states to continue using outdated voting system  standards may allow the vulnerabilities of newer technologies to go  unevaluated and impair effective management of the corresponding  security risks. States and local jurisdictions face the challenge of regularly  updating and consistently applying appropriate standards and other  directives to meet the vulnerabilities and risks of their specific election  environments.", "Testing and evaluation of voting systems also varied across states and  jurisdictions for the 2004 general election. Our state survey found that most  states required certification testing of their voting systems using a range of  criteria. However, responsibility for purchasing a certified system typically  rested with local jurisdictions. Other results from our 2005 state survey and  responses from jurisdictions we visited indicated that acceptance testing  continued to be commonly performed, but there was wide variation in the  responsibilities and practices for this type of testing, including whether  such testing was applied to new systems or upgrades, the extent of vendor  participation, and the coverage of hardware and software functions. Also  on the basis of our local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that most  jurisdictions conducted readiness (logic and accuracy) testing for the 2004  general election as they did for the 2000 election, but in some jurisdictions  we visited, we found they used different procedures that may have  included one or more processes such as diagnostic tests, mock elections,  or suites of test votes. In contrast, our local survey estimates indicate that  parallel testing was employed by fewer than an estimated 2 percent of  jurisdictions. This may be due to, in part, the lack of directives for  conducting such tests. Finally, postelection voting system audit tests were  conducted by fewer than half of jurisdictions for the 2004 general election,  according to our local survey estimates, although many more large and  medium jurisdictions performed these tests than small jurisdictions. As  with other types of testing, the requirements and practices for audit tests  were diverse. Factors associated with the testing of voting systems may  further challenge states and local jurisdictions as they adapt to changes in  voting system capabilities, standards, and national certification for the 2006  general election. Those factors are likely to include increased certification  testing workloads to recertify systems with new capabilities, ongoing limits  to the number of available testing laboratories until a new laboratory  accreditation process becomes fully operational, and more complex testing  because a new version of the federal voluntary voting system guidelines  has been added in 2005 to older federal standards from 1990 and 2002 that  states are already using.", "The number of jurisdictions that had integrated particular aspects of voting  system components and technologies was limited for the 2004 general  election, according to estimates from our local jurisdiction survey and  visits to local jurisdictions for the selected areas of integration we  examined, such as electronic programming or setup and electronic  management. Two-thirds of the jurisdictions we visited told us that they  used electronic programming or setup of voting equipment, and an  estimated 7 percent of jurisdictions that used voting methods other than  paper ballots, according to our local survey, connected their voting  equipment via a local network at polling locations. Relatively few local  jurisdictions we visited also reported having plans for integrating or further  integrating their election-related systems and components for the 2006  general election, and in the instances where jurisdictions reported plans,  the scope and nature of the plans varied. For instance, officials at 5  jurisdictions we visited reported plans to introduce a voter-verifiable paper  trail (VVPT) capability for future elections, and officials from 1 jurisdiction  reported plans to purchase an optical scanner with the ability to tabulate  both DRE and optical scan election results. Nevertheless, the potential for  greater integration in the future does exist as states and jurisdictions act on  plans to acquire the kind of voting equipment (e.g., optical scan and DRE  products) that lends itself to integration. For example, on the basis of our  local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that at least one-fifth of jurisdictions  plan to acquire DRE or optical scan equipment before the 2006 general  election, and officials from 2 jurisdictions we visited who used DRE  equipment told us that their state planned to purchase electronic poll  books for its precincts to use during the 2006 elections to electronically  link its voter registration system with its voting systems. It is unclear if and  when this migration to more technology-based voting methods will  produce more integrated election system environments. However, suitable  standards and guidance for these interconnected components and  systems\u2014some of which remain to be developed\u2014could facilitate the  development, testing, operational management, and maintenance of  components and systems, thereby maximizing the benefits of current and  emerging election technologies and achieving states\u2019 and local  jurisdictions\u2019 goals for performance and security. The challenge inherent in  such a dynamic environment is to update system standards so that  emerging technical, security, and reliability interactions are systematically  addressed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Voting Methods Vary among Jurisdictions and Are Being Influenced by States\u2019 Choices and HAVA", "paragraphs": ["The technology of the voting environment can be characterized as varied  and evolving, according to our 2005 state survey results and local  jurisdiction survey estimates.

Our state and local jurisdiction  surveys also indicate plans for changes to voting technologies for the 2006  general election.", "Overall, the estimated percentages of predominant voting methods used by  local jurisdictions in the 2000 and 2004 general elections did not change  appreciably. In particular, from our local jurisdiction survey, we estimate  that the mix of predominant voting methods used in the November 2000  general election was 5 percent DRE, 21 percent central count optical scan,  26 percent precinct count optical scan, 5 percent central count punch card,  2 percent precinct count punch card, 8 percent lever, and 31 percent paper.  In comparison, we estimate that the mix for the November 2004 general  election (in the same order) was 7 percent DRE, 21 percent central count  optical scan, 30 percent precinct count optical scan, 2 percent central  count punch card, 2 percent precinct count punch card, 7 percent lever,  and 30 percent paper. Figure 54 compares these percentage changes.", "According to our local jurisdiction survey, there may have been a small  shift away from punch card and lever machine voting methods (estimated  at 3 percent or 1 percent loss of jurisdictions, respectively) and may have  been an increase in optical scan and DRE voting equipment (estimated at   5 percent and 2 percent gain of jurisdictions, respectively) for the 2004  general election. However, these differences are not statistically  significant. During the same time frame, we estimate that 16 percent of  jurisdictions acquired new voting equipment through their own purchases  or leases and 15 percent of jurisdictions through purchases or leases by  their state. Thus, the new voting equipment acquired by many jurisdictions  since 2000 did not substantively affect the predominant voting methods  that were already in use.", "One notable change did occur, however, in the use of predominant voting  methods in the 2000 and 2004 general elections. The percentage of large  jurisdictions using DREs doubled (estimated at 15 percent in 2000 and   30 percent in 2004, respectively)\u2014an increase that is statistically  significant. This increase in the use of DREs changed the predominant  voting method most often used for large jurisdictions, which was precinct  count optical scan in 2000, to both DRE and precinct count optical scan in  2004. A smaller increase in the use of DREs among medium jurisdictions  (from an estimated 13 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2004) is not  statistically significant, and there was virtually no change in DRE use  among small jurisdictions (an estimated 1 percent for both elections). In  contrast, the use of paper ballots as a predominant voting method did not  appreciably change between the 2000 and 2004 general elections (with  overall use at 30 percent in 2000 and 31 percent in 2004, respectively).  Small jurisdictions were the major contributors to this steady use of paper  ballots (estimated at 43 percent in 2000 and 41 percent in 2004,  respectively); medium jurisdictions were minor contributors (3 percent for  each election). (No large jurisdictions used paper ballots as their  predominant voting method for either of these elections.) We also estimate  that use of precinct count optical scan as the predominant voting method  for medium jurisdictions did not change appreciably between the 2000 and  2004 elections (estimated at 35 percent in 2000 and 39 percent in 2004,  respectively).

In general, fewer jurisdictions  expected to acquire central count optical scan voting equipment than the  other two voting methods, although the differences were not statistically  significant.

In addition, we estimate that  between 4 and 10 percent of local jurisdictions had plans to acquire  additional equipment in each of these voting methods but had not set a  target date for doing so at the time of our survey.", "During visits to election jurisdictions across the country, local election  officials explained some of their motivations behind plans to acquire DRE  or optical scan voting equipment. For example, election officials in   6 jurisdictions cited HAVA as the reason for purchasing new DRE  equipment, particularly HAVA\u2019s requirement that each voting place have at  least one voting method that is accessible to persons with disabilities, as  we discussed earlier in chapter 4. More specifically, officials in 1 large  jurisdiction in Connecticut said that they would evaluate the use of DREs  to meet HAVA accessibility requirements before deciding whether to  purchase more DREs in time for the November 2006 general election.  Election officials from 5 other jurisdictions stated that they planned to  purchase new voting equipment to provide a VVPT, a requirement levied by  3 of the 14 states we visited (Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico). Officials  from 5 other jurisdictions said that they expected to acquire new voting  equipment but did not give a reason and, in some cases, did not yet know  what type of equipment they would obtain.

On the basis of our 2005 local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that   21 percent of jurisdictions used more than one voting method in the  November 2004 general election, with the most common combination of  methods being central count optical scan with paper ballot (estimated to be  5 percent of jurisdictions). Other common combinations in 2004 were  lever machine with paper ballot (4 percent) and DRE with paper ballot   (3 percent).

We  estimate that paper ballot was the most widely used voting method for  absentee voting (36 percent of jurisdictions), provisional voting   (18 percent), and early voting (8 percent). Precinct count optical scan  (shown in fig. 59) was generally the second most widely used voting  method for these types of voting (24 percent of jurisdictions for absentee,  10 percent for provisional, and 5 percent for early voting, respectively),  while central count optical scan was the third most widely used method   (20 percent of jurisdictions for absentee, 9 percent for provisional, and   5 percent for early voting, respectively)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Jurisdictions\u2019 Voting Methods Were Influenced by the States and HAVA", "paragraphs": ["Most states have generally exercised influence over the voting methods  used by their respective elections jurisdictions through a range of  approaches.

Among other things, HAVA provided funds to states to replace  punch card and lever voting equipment with other voting methods (Section  102 funds). During fiscal year 2003, the General Services Administration  (GSA) reported distributing about $300 million to 30 states that applied for  these funds.

Among other things, HAVA  requires that voting systems used in federal elections provide voters with  ballot verification and correction capabilities by January 1, 2006, including  the opportunity to verify their ballots in a private and independent  manner before they are cast;   the ability to change their ballots or correct any error in a private and  independent manner before the ballots are cast and counted; and  the capability to both notify the voter whenever more than one  candidate has been selected for a single office and correct the  ballots.", "HAVA also requires voting equipment to generate a permanent paper record  with manual audit capacity as an official record of the election.", "Our October 2001 report on election processes described how voting  methods varied in their ability to support features such as error identification and correction for voters. With regard to minimizing voter  error at the polls, our local jurisdiction survey for the 2004 general election  found that, for instance, voters were provided the opportunity to correct a  ballot or exchange a spoiled ballot for a new one in most jurisdictions, and  such capabilities were largely available for all voting methods. Our  estimates of the availability of ballot correction capabilities range from   100 percent (for jurisdictions whose predominant voting method was  central count punch cards) to 70 percent (for jurisdictions predominantly  using DREs).

Accuracy refers to how frequently the equipment  completely and correctly records and counts votes; reliability refers to a  system\u2019s ability to perform as intended, regardless of circumstances; and  efficiency refers to how quickly a given vote can be cast and counted.  Performance in each of these areas depends not only on how well a given  voting system was designed and developed, but also on the procedures  governing its operation and maintenance and the people who use and  operate it. Thus, it is important that system performance be measured  during an election when the system is being used and operated according  to defined procedures by voters and election workers. As we have  previously reported in our October 2001 report on election processes,  measuring how well voting systems perform during a given election allows  local election officials to better position themselves for ensuring that  elections are conducted effectively and efficiently. Such measurement  also provides the basis for knowing where performance needs,  requirements, and expectations are not being met so that timely corrective  action can be taken.", "HAVA recognized the importance of voting system performance by  specifying requirements for error rates in voting systems and providing for  updates to the federal voting system standards, including the performance  components of those standards. Moreover, according to our local  jurisdiction survey, most local jurisdictions adopted performance  standards for the 2004 general election\u2014usually standards selected by  their respective states. As was the case for the 2000 general election,  jurisdictions collected various types of voting system performance  measures for the 2004 general election, although some types of measures  were collected by fewer jurisdictions than others\u2014in part because they  were not well suited to particular voting methods. Furthermore, from our  local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that the vast majority of all  jurisdictions were very satisfied or satisfied with their systems\u2019  performance during the 2004 general election, even though performance  data may not have been collected to an extent that would provide firm  support for these views."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HAVA Has Increased the Focus on Voting System Performance", "paragraphs": ["In our October 2001 report on voting equipment standards, we reported  that the national voluntary voting system standards being used by some  states and local jurisdictions at that time were originally approved in 1990  and were thus out of date. Among other things, these standards identified  minimum functional and performance thresholds for voting systems in  terms of accuracy, reliability, and efficiency. In 2002, the Federal Election  Commission updated these standards and, in doing so, provided new or  enhanced coverage of certain performance requirements for, among other  things,   voting system components that define, develop, and maintain  election databases; perform election definition and setup functions;  format ballots; count votes; consolidate and report results; and  maintain records to support vote recounts;  direct feedback to the voter that indicates when an undervote or  overvote is detected in DRE and paper-based voting systems that  encompass punch cards and optical scan;  system standards to meet the needs of voters with disabilities,  including specific standards for DREs; and  strengthened election record requirements to address a range of  election management functions, including such functions such as  ballot definition and election programming.", "HAVA further focused attention on voting system performance by  establishing a performance requirement for systems used in elections for  federal offices and by providing for updates to federal voting system  standards. Specifically, HAVA required that voting systems used in federal  elections comply with error rate standards specified in the 2002 federal  voting system standards. Under these standards, the maximum  acceptable error rate during testing is 1 in 500,000 ballot positions.

Of these, most jurisdictions (an estimated 77 percent) had  adopted their state\u2019s standards or requirements pertaining to voting system  performance, although a few had adopted performance standards from a  source other than their state (10 percent) or developed their own   (8 percent). The apparently high adoption rate for standards among states  and local jurisdictions is important because it indicates broad acceptance  of a basic management tool needed for systematic performance  measurement and evaluation.", "Consistent with our results on voting system performance measurement  from our October 2001 report on election processes, estimates from our  local jurisdiction survey indicated that jurisdictions used several specific  measures that could be generally grouped into the areas of accuracy,  reliability, and efficiency to assess the performance of their voting systems  for the 2004 general election. However, jurisdictions measured how well  their systems actually performed in the 2004 election to varying degrees. In  the discussion below, we compare jurisdictions\u2019 collection of selected  information on voting system performance for the 2000 and 2004 general  elections, and then examine jurisdictions\u2019 performance monitoring in each  of the three performance areas.", "On the basis of on our local jurisdiction surveys for the 2000 and 2004  elections, we estimate that about 50 percent of jurisdictions collected  performance information in both elections using three measures\u2014 accuracy, undervotes, and overvotes. The percentage of jurisdictions that  collected information on a fourth performance measure\u2014average time to  vote\u2014was much smaller (estimated at 10 percent or less). The differences  between estimates for the two elections are not statistically significant.  Figure 64 shows the percentages of jurisdictions that collected these  performance measures for the 2000 and 2004 general elections.", "In the area of accuracy, we estimate that 42 percent of jurisdictions overall  monitored the accuracy of voting equipment in the 2004 general election.  Other widely used measures of accuracy in the 2004 general election were  spoiled ballots (estimated at 50 percent of jurisdictions), undervotes   (50 percent of jurisdictions), and overvotes (49 percent of jurisdictions).", "During our visits to local jurisdictions, election officials in several  jurisdictions told us that measuring overvotes was not a relevant  performance indicator for jurisdictions using lever machines and DREs  because neither permits overvoting. Election officials in several local  jurisdictions we visited also told us that undervotes were not a meaningful  metric because most voters focused on a limited range of issues or  candidates and thus frequently chose not to vote on all contests.", "Jurisdictions\u2019 collection of the accuracy measures we studied for the 2004  general election varied according to jurisdiction size, with small  jurisdictions generally less likely to collect these measures than other  jurisdiction sizes. Both large jurisdictions (an estimated 66 percent) and  medium jurisdictions (54 percent) were significantly more likely than small  jurisdictions (31 percent) to collect data on vote count accuracy. In  addition, large jurisdictions (65 percent) were significantly more likely than  small jurisdictions (47 percent) to collect data on undervotes. (See fig. 65.)  This disparity may be due to the proportion of smaller jurisdictions that use  paper ballots and for whom collection of these data would be a manual,  time-consuming process.", "In the area of reliability, we estimate that 15 percent of jurisdictions  measured the reliability of their voting equipment in terms of pieces of  equipment that failed, and 11 percent measured equipment downtime.", "As with accuracy, a higher percentage of large and medium jurisdictions  collected such reliability data than small jurisdictions, and in the case of  equipment failures, there were statistically significant differences in the  collection of this information among different sizes of jurisdictions.   (See fig. 66.) Importantly, an estimated 55 percent of all jurisdictions kept a  written record of issues and problems that occurred on Election Day,  which could be a potential source of reliability data.", "Collection of reliability data for automated voting equipment was also  related to the predominant voting method used by a jurisdiction, with  jurisdictions that predominantly used DREs more likely to collect  reliability data than those that used optical scan voting methods.", "An estimated 45 percent of jurisdictions whose predominant method was  DREs collected information on the number of pieces of voting equipment  that failed. The next most frequently collected information on machine  failures was for precinct count optical scan systems (an estimated   23 percent of jurisdictions) and central count optical scan systems   (an estimated 10 percent). The differences in data collection on equipment  failures among jurisdictions that predominantly used DREs and those that  used precinct count optical scan or central count optical scan voting  methods are statistically significant. (See fig. 67.)", "In the area of efficiency, we estimate that 13 percent of jurisdictions  measured their voting system\u2019s speed of counting votes, 17 percent  measured the time it took for election workers to set up equipment, and   4 percent measured the average length of time it took for voters to cast  ballots on Election Day. Large jurisdictions (34 percent) were significantly  more likely than were both medium jurisdictions (19 percent) and small  jurisdictions (9 percent) to collect information on counting speed. There  were no significant differences for other efficiency measures by  jurisdiction size. (See fig. 68.)", "It is worth noting that for several types of performance measures in our  local jurisdiction survey, jurisdiction size was a factor in whether system  performance information was collected. Generally, large jurisdictions were  most likely to record voting system performance and small jurisdictions  were least likely, with medium jurisdictions in between. Moreover, large  jurisdictions were more likely to keep a written record of issues or  problems that occurred on Election Day. Specifically, on the basis of our  local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that 79 percent of large jurisdictions  kept such records, compared with 59 percent of medium jurisdictions and  52 percent of small jurisdictions. The differences between large  jurisdictions and both medium and small jurisdictions are statistically  significant. The responsibilities for monitoring or reporting voting system  performance most often rested with local jurisdictions. On the basis of our  local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that 83 percent of local jurisdictions  had local officials responsible for performance monitoring or reporting,  while states or other organizations (such as independent consultants or  vendors) held such responsibilities in 11 percent and 13 percent of  jurisdictions, respectively.", "Information obtained during our visits to local election jurisdictions was  generally consistent with the above estimates from our local jurisdiction  survey. For example, election officials in the 28 jurisdictions we visited  most frequently cited number of undervotes (14 jurisdictions), overvotes  (10 jurisdictions), and equipment failures (10 jurisdictions) as types of  performance metrics collected. Another collected metric (cited by election  officials in 6 jurisdictions we visited) was equipment speed, measured in  terms of how fast the voting equipment downloaded vote totals or  transmitted totals to its central count location, and the time required to  cast a vote (reported by election officials in 4 jurisdictions, although  officials in 2 of these 4 jurisdictions limited their measurements to early  voting). Another measurement that election officials in some jurisdictions  told us they collected was comments from poll workers and voters on the  efficiency of the equipment. For instance, an election official in a large  jurisdiction in Georgia told us that poll workers commented that it took   20 minutes to vote using the voting equipment\u2019s audio feature. In addition,  election officials in several jurisdictions that we visited told us that they  had established performance management programs for their voting  systems. For example, election officials in 1 jurisdiction reported that they  collected data on the time it took to vote to better allocate its voting  equipment to various locations. Officials in a large jurisdiction in Kansas  said they had conducted a survey of voters concerning their satisfaction  with the ease of use of voting equipment during the 2004 general election  and determined that they were very satisfied."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Local Jurisdictions Were Generally Satisfied with Their Voting Systems in 2004, although Some Problems Were Reported", "paragraphs": ["In our October 2001 report on election processes, we reported that   96 percent of local jurisdictions nationwide were satisfied with the  performance of the voting equipment during the November 2000 general  election.

Estimated satisfaction varied for specific  areas of voting system performance, ranging from relatively high levels for  accuracy (78 percent), speed of vote counting (73 percent), time to set up  equipment (63 percent), and number of spoiled or ruined ballots   (61 percent), to relatively low levels for equipment failures (37 percent),  and downtime (36 percent). Some of these measures may not be  applicable to all jurisdictions, such as those using only hand-counted paper  ballots. When jurisdictions that used only hand-counted paper ballots were  excluded from our results, satisfaction levels were higher in all  performance areas\u2014accuracy (86 percent), speed of vote counting   (83 percent), time to set up equipment (76 percent), number of spoiled  ballots (68 percent), equipment failures (54 percent), and downtime   (52 percent). However, even with the exclusion of paper ballot  jurisdictions, \u201cnot applicable\u201d responses were often selected by  jurisdictions in the areas of equipment failures (41 percent not applicable)  and downtime (43 percent not applicable).", "Also on the basis of our local jurisdiction survey, for five of six satisfaction  measures, we estimate that medium and large jurisdictions were satisfied  or very satisfied with their voting systems more frequently than small  jurisdictions and that most of these differences are statistically significant.  These ratings may be related to the widespread use of paper ballots by  small jurisdictions, where this voting method was predominant in an  estimated 41 percent of jurisdictions. Figure 69 shows the frequency of  satisfaction in each of six performance areas for large, medium, and small  jurisdictions.", "The estimated high satisfaction levels demonstrated across different voting  system performance areas and jurisdiction sizes contrast with our lower  estimates of the performance measures that were collected for the 2004  general election. Although the reasons for moderate collection levels for  performance measures are unclear, jurisdictions that may not have  collected performance data or may have considered such information not  applicable to their situation may lack sufficient insight into their system  operations to adequately support their satisfaction in the variety of  performance areas we surveyed.", "Local election officials at most of the 28 jurisdictions we visited also  expressed satisfaction with the performance of their voting systems or  method. For example,  Election officials in several jurisdictions using optical scan systems  stated that they were pleased with their equipment because it  produced a paper trail and permitted fast processing. Officials in   1 large jurisdiction in Florida added that their use of the same  equipment over several elections made it easy for voters to use the  equipment in both 2000 and 2004.", "Election officials in several other jurisdictions using DREs told us  that their equipment was easy to use and provided results that were  accurate and timely. Officials in 1 large jurisdiction in New Jersey  reported that, in contrast to paper ballots, DREs do not require poll  workers to interpret a voter\u2019s ballot.", "Election officials in a large Connecticut jurisdiction using lever  machines said that voters were happy with the equipment and that it  had worked well for over 60 years. They emphasized that the  simplicity and transparency of the equipment\u2019s counting mechanisms  gave voters confidence that their votes would be counted correctly.", "Election officials in a small New Hampshire jurisdiction using paper  ballots reported that they had used the same hand-counted paper  ballot system for decades and it has been very cost-effective for the  small population of voters in the jurisdiction.", "Overall, election officials in few of the 28 jurisdictions that we visited  reported substantive performance issues, such as overvoting, undervoting,  or equipment failure.", "Although the estimated level of satisfaction with voting equipment  performance in the 2004 general election was high overall, some  dissatisfaction existed. On the basis of our local jurisdiction survey, we  estimate that between 1 and 4 percent of jurisdictions were dissatisfied or  very dissatisfied with their voting systems in the 2004 general election for  the six performance areas of our survey.", "Our local jurisdiction survey provided additional insight into the role of  voting equipment in jurisdictions\u2019 dissatisfaction ratings. Of almost   300 responses to our open-ended question about the issue or problem that  occurred most frequently on Election Day, November 2004, fewer than   20 responses were specifically related to voting equipment. The most  frequent reason for voting system dissatisfaction was voting equipment  malfunction. Ballot errors related to voting equipment were much less  frequently mentioned.", "Although such problems were rarely mentioned by election officials during  our visits to local jurisdictions, some did describe a few reasons for  dissatisfaction with voting equipment, including   the additional time required to count ballots using DREs versus the  optical scan equipment previously used,   the perceived lower reliability and greater failure rates of DREs over  the voting equipment used in the past,  accuracy problems with DRE computer programs, and   difficulty in first-time poll worker operation and voter use of DREs.", "Election officials in a few jurisdictions we visited noted situations that  required considerable effort to resolve. For example, as mentioned in our  discussion of vote counting in chapter 6, election officials in a North  Carolina jurisdiction told us that 4,235 ballots were lost by one of the DREs  used for early voting because the software manufacturer had not installed  an upgrade that would have allowed the machine to record up to 10,000  ballots rather than its original limit of 3,500 ballots. The machine continued  to show the number of people who voted on the machine after 3,500 ballots  had been cast, but did not store the results of their ballots. As a result, the  jurisdiction switched to hand-counted paper ballots for elections after the  2004 general election until its state can approve a new automated system  for use. Given the real and potential impacts of situations where  dissatisfaction was reported, systematic collection and analysis of  performance information may help provide election officials with objective  support for decisions to improve the operation and upgrade of these  systems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Attention to Voting System Security Management Continues to Vary amid Published Concerns and Federal Improvement Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Having secure voting systems is essential to maintaining public confidence  in the election process, and accomplishing this is a shared responsibility  among federal, state, and local jurisdiction authorities.

HAVA recognized  some of these challenges by requiring specific system security controls and  providing improved security management guidance. Nevertheless, while  we estimate from our local survey that most jurisdictions have assigned  responsibility for voting system security to individuals and implemented  certain security controls, the nature and extent of their respective security  efforts and activities varied widely. In particular, according to our state  survey, estimates from our local jurisdiction survey, and visits to  jurisdictions, there are differences across jurisdictions in the (1) adoption  of system security standards, with some states requiring jurisdictions to  use outdated standards for voting systems; (2) reported implementation of  system security controls; and (3) testing performed to ensure that security  controls are functioning properly. For instance, we estimate on the basis of  our local jurisdiction survey that at least 19 percent of local jurisdictions  nationwide (excluding jurisdictions that reported using paper ballots) did  not conduct security testing for the systems they used in the November  2004 general election. In addition, 27 states reported in our state survey  that they are requiring jurisdictions to apply federal standards to voting  systems used for the first time in the November 2006 general election that  are outdated, unspecified, or entail multiple versions. This variability in  implementation and testing of controls is generally consistent with what  we reported for the 2000 general election.

In particular, we  estimated that 89 percent of the local jurisdictions assigned responsibility  for performing security-related functions to one or more individuals, and  implemented some type of controls to protect their equipment during the  election. Examples of implemented security controls included such  physical controls as locks and surveillance, and such embedded controls as  access restrictions and firewalls. However, we also reported in 2001 that an  estimated 40 percent of the jurisdictions had not assessed the security  threats and risks on which their controls were based, and 19 percent had  not reviewed the sufficiency of their security controls. Moreover, the  nature of established controls varied by type of system, and these controls  were not uniformly followed across jurisdictions.", "For the November 2004 general election, jurisdictions addressed system  security to varying degrees and through various means. At the foundation  of these approaches, responsibilities for voting system and network  security were distributed among local officials, the state, and third parties  (e.g., independent consultants and vendors) in varying proportions. On the  basis of our 2005 local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that 90 percent of all  jurisdictions (excluding those that used only hand-counted paper ballots on  Election Day) specifically assigned responsibility for voting system  security in the 2004 general election. We estimate that 67 percent of these  local jurisdictions assigned responsibilities for voting system and network  security to local election officials, 14 percent relied on state officials to  perform these responsibilities, and 24 percent assigned them to third  parties. Moreover, this distribution varied somewhat according to  jurisdiction size, with large jurisdictions depending on local officials the  most and medium jurisdictions depending on local officials the least.  Figure 70 shows how voting system and network security responsibilities  were distributed among various parties for each size of jurisdiction.", "On the basis of our visits to local jurisdictions, the types of system security  responsibilities and the groups that performed them further demonstrate  the variation among security approaches and controls applied to voting  systems. Specifically, election officials in these jurisdictions were typically  responsible for implementing security controls, state officials were usually  involved with developing security policy and guidance and monitoring local  jurisdictions\u2019 implementation of security, and third parties performed tasks  such as ensuring adequate security of voting equipment during transport or  storage. Table 24 shows examples of security tasks and the parties that  performed them as reported to us by election officials in the jurisdictions  that we visited.", "Responses to our state survey showed that both states and third parties  participated in security responsibilities related to monitoring and  evaluating security and privacy controls. Although the most frequently  cited party responsible for this area was local officials (identified by 38  states), just less than one-half of the states (22 states and the District of  Columbia) reported that they had some level of responsibility for security  monitoring and evaluation as well. In addition, 22 states responded that  third parties (e.g., independent consultants or vendors) were involved in  monitoring and evaluating controls. Overall, security monitoring and  evaluation was performed by two or more entities in 26 of the states.", "The use of certain security controls was similarly varied. On the basis of  our local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that 59 percent of jurisdictions  used power or battery backup, 67 percent used system access controls,   91 percent used hardware locks and seals, and 52 percent used backup  electronic storage for votes. We further estimate that 95 percent of  jurisdictions used at least one of these controls, with hardware locks and  seals being most consistently used across the automated voting methods  associated with this survey question. Furthermore, we estimate that a  lower percentage of small jurisdictions used power or battery backup and  electronic backup storage of votes for their voting equipment than large or  medium jurisdictions, and these differences are statistically significant in  most cases.

For each category of personnel\u2014local officials, state election  officials, vendors, or other parties\u20147 to 8 percent of jurisdictions did not  know if remote access was available to their systems, a situation that could  increase the risk of unauthorized access to these systems. Some of the  jurisdictions responding to this survey question described a variety of  protections to mitigate the risk of unauthorized remote access, including  locally controlled passwords, passwords that change for each access, and  local control of communications connections.", "Among the jurisdictions that we visited, election officials reported that  various security measures were in use during the 2004 general election to  safeguard voting equipment, ballots, and votes before, during, and after the  election. However, the measures were not uniformly reported by officials in  these jurisdictions, and officials in most jurisdictions reported that they did  not have a security plan to document these measures or other aspects of  their security program. The security controls most frequently cited by  officials for the jurisdictions that we visited were locked storage of voting  equipment and ballots, and monitoring of voting equipment. Other security  measures mentioned during our visits included testing voting equipment  before, during, or after the election to ensure that the equipment was  accurately tallying votes; planning and conducting training on security  issues and procedures for elections personnel; and video surveillance of  stored ballots and voting equipment.

Our research of  recommended practices shows that effective system security management  involves having, among other things, (1) defined policies governing such  system controls as authorized functions and access, and documented  procedures for secure normal operations and incident management;   (2) documented plans for implementing policies and procedures;   (3) verified implementation of technical and procedural controls designed  to reduce the risk of disruption, destruction, or unauthorized modification  of systems and their information; and (4) clearly assigned roles and  responsibilities for system security.", "On the basis of our local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that 46 percent of  election jurisdictions nationwide that used some type of automated voting  method had written policies for voting system security and access in place  for the November 2004 general election, while 45 percent had formal  security procedures. Written security policies were more prevalent among  large jurisdictions, an estimated 65 percent, compared to an estimated   52 percent of medium jurisdictions and an estimated 41 percent of small  jurisdictions.

However, we  estimate that up to one-fifth of jurisdictions did not have written policies  and procedures uniformly in place, including policies and procedures for  transporting unvoted and voted ballots or electronic memory, storing  unvoted and voted ballots, and electronic transmission of voted ballots.  The disparity in written policies and procedures was observed for  electronic transmission of voted ballots for counting, where an estimated  18 percent of jurisdictions had such security management tools,  compared with between 66 and 76 percent of jurisdictions for each of the  other four types of ballot controls\u2014a difference that is statistically  significant but which may be linked to the percentage of jurisdictions that  used paper ballot and older technologies in the 2004 general election. Yet  we also found that an estimated 17 percent of jurisdictions whose  predominant method was DRE had no policies or procedures for electronic  transmission of voted ballots for counting. In addition, the differences in  estimates of policies and procedures for electronic ballot transmission  among jurisdictions whose predominant voting method was punch cards  and those whose methods were DRE or optical scan are statistically  significant. Figure 73 shows the variation in estimates of documented  policies and procedures for electronically transmitting ballots among  jurisdictions that used specific voting methods.", "Moreover, our visits to local jurisdictions found diverse approaches to  documenting security policies and procedures. Election officials in 8 of the  jurisdictions that we visited told us that they had written instructions for  managing security aspects of their voting equipment and processes.  However, some guidance we reviewed did not cover these topics. Election  officials in some jurisdictions stated that their security measures were  contained in the voting process documentation for the voting system or  were covered in election worker training. For example, the hardware guide  for the voting system used by some jurisdictions described the verification  and authentication functions that were built into the system to secure vote  counts during transmission of the precinct results to the jurisdiction,  including processes for ballot creation and vote tabulation that also  included security procedures. In contrast, several other jurisdictions that  we visited had published detailed security policies and procedures for their  voting systems that included, for example, network security policies for  election tabulation, procedures for securing and protecting election  equipment and software, testing voting equipment to ensure accurate  recording of votes, and disaster recovery plans, and they provided them to  GAO. Officials in several jurisdictions also described their steps to ensure  that election workers had access to, and were trained in, the contents of  the policies and procedures for securing ballots and voting equipment.", "Information system security plans typically identify the responsibilities,  management approach, and key controls to be implemented for an  information system, based on an assessment of identified risks to the  information. Election officials in a few of the jurisdictions that we visited  told us that they had security plans in place for the November 2004 general  election (8 of 28). Officials at 4 of the jurisdictions that we visited stated  that they had security plans or plan components that were approved at the  state level, and officials in 1 large jurisdiction in Nevada reported having a  state statutory requirement for a voting system security plan. However,  jurisdictions that employed advanced security technologies, such as  encryption, in their systems did not always have a plan that would  document how the elections people, process, and technologies would work  together to provide comprehensive protections. Moreover, the contents of  plans we obtained from our visits to local jurisdictions varied widely. One  of the jurisdiction security plans we examined covered most aspects of the  voting process, from ballot preparation through recount, while another  plan focused on the security of its vote-tallying system in a stand-alone  environment. Two security plans covered several security topics including  risk assessment, physical and personnel controls, and incident response.  Table 26 shows the variation in topics covered in the security plans we  reviewed.", "Security testing is an important way to verify that system security controls  have been implemented and are functioning properly. From our survey of  state election officials, 17 states and the District of Columbia reported that  they had conducted security testing of the voting systems used in the 2004  general election, and 7 other states reported that they required local  jurisdictions to conduct such testing. The remaining 22 states said that they  did not conduct or require system security testing. (Three states reported  that security testing was not applicable for their voting systems.) Moreover,  from our local jurisdiction survey, we estimate that at least 19 percent of  local jurisdictions nationwide (excluding jurisdictions that reported that  they used paper ballots) did not conduct security testing for the systems  they used in the November 2004 general election. Although jurisdiction size  was not a factor in whether security testing was performed, the percentage  of jurisdictions performing security testing was notably higher when the  predominant voting method was DRE (63 percent) and lower for  jurisdictions where the predominant method was central count optical  scan (38 percent) or precinct count optical scan (45 percent). However,  the difference in the percentages of jurisdictions performing security  testing on DRE or central count optical scan is not statistically significant.", "Beyond jurisdictions\u2019 efforts to verify implementation of voting system  security controls, some states required that their voting systems be  nationally qualified against the federal voluntary voting system standards,  which include a security component. In particular, from our state survey,  most states that used a new voting system for the first time in the  November 2004 general election said that they required the system to go  through qualification testing. For example, all 26 states that used DREs for  the first time in the 2004 general election, as well as the District of  Columbia, required qualification testing and approval by the National  Association of State Election Directors (NASED). Similarly, of the   35 states and the District of Columbia that used optical scan systems for  the first time in the 2004 general election, 31 reported that they required  voting systems to be qualified.

However, they  are not all using the same version of the voluntary standards. This is  troublesome because the 2002 standards are more stringent than the 1990  standards in various areas, including security. For instance, the 2002  standards establish security requirements and acceptable levels of  performance for the telecommunications components of voting systems,  while the 1990 standards do not include detailed requirements for this  control measure.", "According to our analysis of responses states reported in our state survey,  17 of the 44 states and the District of Columbia reported that their voting  systems must comply solely with the 2002 standards that were developed  and approved by the Federal Election Commission and later adopted by  EAC. However, 27 other states are requiring their jurisdictions to apply  federal standards to their new voting systems that are outdated,  unspecified, or entail multiple versions. In the case of 5 of these 27 states  where multiple versions of voluntary federal standards will be applied, one  of the versions is the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, which was  approved by the EAC in December 2005. These guidelines promote  security measures that address gaps in prior standards and are applicable  to more modern technologies, such as controls for distributing software  and wireless operations. Nevertheless, these same 5 states reported that  they will also apply older federal standards to systems that are new to the  2006 election. Furthermore, 2 other states responded that they do not plan  to require their voting systems to comply with any version of the voluntary  federal standards, while 3 additional states reported that they had not yet  made a decision on compliance with voluntary federal standards for 2006.

As the use of  electronic voting systems expanded and the 2004 general election  approached, the media and others continued to report problems with these  systems that caused some to question whether they were secure and  reliable. To clarify the wide range of concerns and issues raised and  identify recommended practices for addressing them, our September 2005  report on the security and reliability of electronic voting analyzed over   80 recent and relevant studies related to the security and reliability of  electronic voting systems. We focused on systems and components  associated with vote casting and counting, including those that define  electronic ballots, transmit voting results among election locations, and  manage groups of voting machines.", "In summary, our September 2005 report stated that while electronic voting  systems hold promise for a more accurate and efficient election process,  numerous organizations and individuals have raised concerns about their  security, citing instances of weak security controls, system design flaws,  inadequate system version control, inadequate security testing, incorrect  system configuration, poor security management, and vague or incomplete  voting system standards, among other issues. For example, we reported  that studies found (1) some electronic voting systems did not encrypt cast  ballots or system records of ballots, and it was possible to alter both  without being detected; (2) it was possible to alter the files that define how  a ballot looks and works so that the votes for one candidate could be  recorded for a different candidate; and (3) vendors installed uncertified  versions of voting system software at the local level. We also reported that  some of these concerns were said to have caused local problems during  national elections\u2014resulting in the loss or miscount of votes. We added,  however, that many of the reported concerns were drawn from specific  system makes and models or from a specific jurisdiction\u2019s election, and  that there has been a lack of consensus among election officials and other  experts on the pervasiveness of the concerns.", "We also reported in September 2005 that federal organizations and  nongovernmental groups have issued recommended practices and  guidance for improving the election process, including electronic voting  systems, as well as general practices for the security of information  systems. For example, in mid-2004, EAC issued a collection of practices  recommended by election experts, including state and local election  officials. This guidance includes approaches for making voting processes  more secure and reliable through, for example, risk analysis of the voting  process, poll worker security training, and chain of custody controls for  Election Day operations, along with practices that are specific to ensuring  the security and reliability of different types of electronic voting systems.  As another example, in July 2004, the California Institute of Technology and  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology issued a report containing  recommendations pertaining to testing equipment, retaining records of  ballots, and physically securing voting systems. In addition to such  election-specific practices, numerous recommended practices are available  that are relevant to any information system. For instance, we, the National  Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), and others have issued  guidance that emphasizes the importance of incorporating security and  reliability into the life cycle of information systems through practices  related to security planning and management, risk management, and  procurement. We noted that the recommended practices in these election- specific and information technology-focused documents provide valuable  guidance that, if implemented effectively, should help improve the security  of voting systems.", "Further, our September 2005 report stated that since the passage of HAVA,  the federal government has begun a range of actions that are expected to  improve the security and reliability of electronic voting systems.  Specifically, after beginning operations in January 2004, EAC was leading  efforts to (1) draft changes to the existing federal voluntary standards for  voting systems, including provisions related to security; (2) develop a  process for certifying, decertifying, and recertifying voting systems;   (3) establish a program to accredit the national independent testing  laboratories that test electronic voting systems against the federal  standards; and (4) develop a software library and clearinghouse for  information on state and local elections and systems. However, we  observed that these actions were unlikely to have a major effect in the 2006  federal election cycle because at the time of our report publication the  changes to the standards had not yet been completed, the system  certification and laboratory accreditation programs were still in  development, and the software library had not been updated or improved  since the 2004 elections. Further, we stated that EAC had not defined tasks,  processes, and time frames for completing these activities, and we  recognized that other organizations had actions under way that were  intended to improve the security of electronic voting systems. These  actions include developing and obtaining international acceptance for  voting system standards, developing voting system software in an open  source environment (i.e., not proprietary to any particular company), and  cataloging and analyzing reported problems with electronic voting systems.", "To improve the security and reliability of electronic voting systems, we  made recommendations to EAC for establishing tasks, processes, and time  frames for improving the federal voluntary voting system guidelines,  testing capabilities, and management support available to state and local  election officials.

Further  confidence in election results can be gained by conducting Election Day  and postelection audits of voting systems. For the November 2004 general  election, voting system testing was conducted for almost all voting  systems, but the types and content of the testing performed varied  considerably. Most states and local jurisdictions employed national and  state certification testing and readiness testing to some extent, but the  criteria used in this testing were highly dependent on the state or  jurisdiction. Also, many, but not all, states and jurisdictions conducted  acceptance testing of both newly acquired systems and those undergoing  changes or upgrades. In contrast, relatively few states and jurisdictions  conducted parallel testing during elections or audits of voting systems  following elections.", "To assist election officials in testing voting systems for the 2004 general  election, most local jurisdictions documented policies and procedures  related to some types of testing, according to estimates based on our  survey of local jurisdictions. However, the testing approaches embodied in  policies and procedures that the local jurisdictions we visited shared with  us varied considerably. Furthermore, in jurisdictions we visited, few voting  system problems were reported as a result of local testing, and  correspondingly few changes were made to the systems or election  processes. The variability in testing approaches among states and  jurisdictions underscores our previously reported concerns from our  September 2005 report about whether actual testing of voting systems is  sufficient to ensure satisfaction of system requirements, including those  associated with accuracy, reliability, and security.", "Voting system test and evaluation can be grouped into various types or  stages: certification testing (national level), certification testing (state  level), acceptance testing, readiness testing, parallel testing, and  postelection voting system audits. Each of these tests has a specific  purpose, and is conducted at the national, state, or local level at a  particular time in the election cycle. Table 27 summarizes these types of  tests.", "Many states have laws or regulations that mandate specific types of testing  for voting equipment and time frames for conducting those tests.  Documented policies and procedures for testing and evaluation provide an  important means for ensuring that testing is effectively planned and  executed. Effective test and evaluation can greatly reduce the chances of  unexpected or unknown equipment problems and errors. From our local  jurisdiction survey for the 2004 election, we estimate that 85 percent of  local jurisdictions had documented policies and procedures for some type  of voting system testing, 6 percent of jurisdictions did not have policies and  procedures for testing, and 9 percent did not know whether their  jurisdictions had them. Larger jurisdictions were more likely to have these  management tools than smaller ones.

However, officials said they did  conduct readiness testing at the polling place prior to the election. Election  officials in a large Ohio jurisdiction that used punch card voting equipment  told us that readiness testing had been conducted by local officials.  However, election officials stated that certification and acceptance testing  were not performed for 2004 because this system had been used in prior  elections. They also said that neither parallel testing nor audit testing of  voting systems was performed. Officials in a large Colorado jurisdiction we  visited that used central count optical scan equipment told us that they  obtained state certification of the newly purchased equipment, conducted  acceptance and readiness testing prior to the election, and executed  another readiness test following the election. Election officials in a large  Georgia jurisdiction that used DRE voting equipment reported that the  state performed both certification and acceptance testing when the  equipment was purchased and conducted a parallel test of the tabulation  system during the election. Further, local officials reported that they  conducted readiness testing prior to the election, but did not perform  postelection audit testing.

First, HAVA\u2019s requirements for voting system  capabilities, such as voter error correction and manual audit, along with  the attendant new guidelines, are likely to require additional testing at the  national level to recertify previously fielded and certified systems that have  been upgraded. Second, this increased workload is not likely to be met with  added national testing capacity, since the process for accrediting new  voting system testing laboratories is not expected to produce newly  accredited labs in time for the 2006 election. Third, the complexity of the  testing being performed is likely to increase because states report that they  will collectively apply the full range of available standards\u20141990, 2002, and  2005 standards, as well as various combinations of these\u2014to voting  systems first used for the November 2006 election.

The areas in which integration was reported  can be grouped into four categories: (1) electronic programming or setup  of voting equipment from a centralized facility, (2) electronic aggregation  and tabulation of voting results from multiple voting systems or locations,  (3) add-on voting features and technologies, and (4) electronic  management of voting equipment and operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Electronic Programming or Setup", "paragraphs": ["Electronic programming or setup of voting equipment involves integration  between an administrative system and voting equipment to initialize vote  count totals, load ballot definitions, and authorize voter access. As we  previously reported in our September 2005 report on the security and  reliability of electronic voting, this type of integration has raised security  concerns. Election officials in 19 of the 28 jurisdictions that we visited  used portable memory cartridges or cards for electronic programming or  setup of their voting equipment. To accomplish programming or setup,  officials at some of the local jurisdictions that we visited said that they used  a computer to preload voting equipment with ballots or tabulation logic  prior to transporting the equipment to polling locations. At 1 large New  Jersey jurisdiction, officials stated that the administrative computer used a  dedicated connection to the election server to electronically transmit the  data and logic necessary to program and enable the units for the election.  Election officials in some jurisdictions told us that an administrative  system loaded ballot definitions onto portable electronic devices, such as  memory cartridges or smart cards, which were then physically transported  to the locations where the voting equipment was being prepared for the  election\u2014either at a storage facility or polling location (see fig. 77). The  cartridges or cards were then inserted into individual voting units to  prepare or activate them for the election. Some electronic ballot cards  were provided directly to the voter to activate the voting equipment, then  returned to election workers when the ballot has been cast.", "Electronic aggregation or tabulation of cast ballots also requires  integration between voting equipment and another computer system that is  responsible for collecting and aggregating the votes. Figure 78 shows  examples of computer systems used for vote tabulation.", "Transfer of votes or election results between the voting equipment and the  central tabulator may employ portable electronic media or  telecommunication lines. Portable electronic media were the means that  officials at 7 of the 28 jurisdictions that we visited said they used to  electronically aggregate election results from multiple voting locations. For  DRE equipment, memory cartridges that stored cast ballots from individual  voting units were transferred to the election office, and the data they  contained were uploaded and tallied by an electronic tabulation system.", "Some jurisdictions also used telecommunications services to transfer  election data from polling locations or election coordination centers to  tabulation facilities, although how these services were used varied.  Officials at 4 jurisdictions that we visited told us that they employed dial-up  connections to transmit local vote tallies for further tabulation. For  instance, election officials in a large jurisdiction in Washington told us that  after the polls were closed and all ballots were scanned and recorded by  the optical scan machines at each polling place, the machines were taken  to storage areas, where the results were transmitted to the central  computer for tabulation using the jurisdiction\u2019s phone line. Officials at a  large jurisdiction that we visited in Ohio said that they had election judges  take voting machine memory cartridges from their polling locations to  facilities where laptop computers would read the cartridges and transmit  vote tallies over phone lines to a remote access server at the elections  office. In a large jurisdiction that we visited in Illinois, election officials told  us that they took their portable precinct ballot counters to 1 of 10 stations  throughout the city, where vote totals from the counters were encrypted  and transmitted to a remote access server via a cellular network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Add-on Features and Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Add-on features and technologies to ensure the accuracy of votes, provide  easier access to persons with disabilities or special needs, and enhance  security or privacy were also integrated into voting systems by a few states  and jurisdictions for the 2004 general election. Officials at both large  jurisdictions in Nevada that we visited told us that they had integrated a  VVPT capability into their DREs to meet a state requirement for VVPT.  Figure 79 shows one example of a VVPT voting system component. Overall,  we estimate that about 8 percent of jurisdictions operating DRE voting  equipment in the November 2004 general election produced VVPT.", "Audio features were also added to voting systems for the 2004 election.  Officials at 6 of the jurisdictions that we visited reported that they had  incorporated an audio ballot component into their DRE machines for  voters with sight impairments. Election officials in 3 jurisdictions reported  that they offered audio ballots in languages other than English.", "Security and privacy capabilities, such as data encryption and virtual  private networks, were also reportedly integrated into several jurisdictions\u2019  voting system environments for the 2004 general election to protect  electronically transferred election data or to secure remote system access.  Election officials at 6 of the 28 jurisdictions that we visited said they used  encryption to protect ballots during electronic storage. Officials at both  jurisdictions in Georgia explained that their state-selected DRE equipment  used individual access cards for each voter, uniquely encrypted data on the  card (including the voter\u2019s cast ballot) for each polling location, and a  separately encrypted electronic key needed to access the voter\u2019s ballot.  Officials at 7 jurisdictions said they applied encryption to the transmission  of election results during the 2004 general election. Election officials in   1 large Colorado jurisdiction stated that they used a virtual private network  to ensure the secrecy of data and authenticity of parties when transmitting  election results from jurisdictions to the state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Electronic Management", "paragraphs": ["Electronic management of voting equipment and operations was another  form of integration employed for the 2004 general election. Electronic  management covers such functions as equipment testing, initializing,  operational monitoring, diagnosis, troubleshooting, shutdown, and  auditing. It also includes election operations that affect voting equipment,  such as voter processing at the polling place and handling of absentee  ballots. We previously reported that some of these capabilities were  available during the 2000 general election in our October 2001 report on  election processes. For the 2004 general election, on the basis of our local  jurisdiction survey, we estimate that 7 percent of jurisdictions that used  voting methods other than paper ballots connected their voting equipment  via a local network at their polling locations. The frequency with which  remote access to voting systems was provided for the 2004 general election  was similarly low (estimated at 10 percent of jurisdictions that used voting  methods other than paper ballots) but was again affected by the size of  jurisdictions. We estimate that a higher percentage of large jurisdictions  used remote access to voting equipment (estimated at 19 percent) than  medium jurisdictions (13 percent) or small jurisdictions (7 percent). The  difference between large and small jurisdictions is statistically significant.  Furthermore, we estimate that remote access was primarily provided to  local election officials (in 6 percent of jurisdictions) and to a lesser extent,  state election officials, voting equipment vendors, and third parties. Figure  80 shows the estimated percentages of jurisdictions of various sizes that  used networking or various types of remote access. These capabilities pose  voting system security and reliability concerns as reported in our  September 2005 report on the security and reliability of electronic voting.  From approximately 20 open-ended text responses to our survey of local  jurisdictions that described steps taken to prevent unauthorized remote  access to voting systems, four safeguards were identified: employing  passwords for remote users, limiting operations to specific election  activities, use of virtual private networks, and system monitoring.", "As we previously reported in our September 2001 report on voting  assistance to military and overseas citizens, state and local election  officials used technologies like electronic mail and faxing to better  integrate activities during the 2000 general election and to improve  communications with absentee voters. According to our estimates from  the local jurisdiction survey for the 2004 election, jurisdictions continued  to use electronic mail to interact with voters and also relied on Web sites  for a variety of election needs including voter registration status, the  application and processing of absentee ballots, and the status of  provisional ballots. For seven items in our survey where we asked about  jurisdictions\u2019 use of e-mail and Web sites for voter services, we estimate  that large jurisdictions generally used these technologies more frequently  than both medium and small jurisdictions, and that differences in six of  these items were statistically significant. Figure 81 shows the extent to  which jurisdictions of different sizes employed e-mail and Web sites for  selected voter services. In addition to using technology to support  individual voters, election officials in 1 large jurisdiction we visited in New  Mexico described their use of telecommunications technology to support  early voting at multiple locations. This jurisdiction connected its  registration database to its early voting locations with dedicated phone  lines, thus making voter registration information electronically available at  each location."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Prospects for Expanded Use of Integrated Election Systems Are Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Relatively few local jurisdictions we visited reported having plans for  integrating or further integrating their election-related systems and  components for the 2006 general election, and in cases where they had  plans, the scope and nature of the plans varied. At the same time, we  estimate on the basis of our local jurisdiction survey that a relatively large  proportion of jurisdictions expect to acquire DREs and optical scan  systems, which will introduce greater integration opportunities. However,  given the uncertainty surrounding the specific types of systems and  features to be acquired, the extent and timing of greater integration of  voting systems and components, as well as election-related systems,  remains to be seen.", "More specifically, officials in several jurisdictions that we visited told us  about plans to integrate relatively modular add-on components to their  systems, while officials with several other jurisdictions described plans for  more complex end-to-end interactions among election systems and  technologies. For example, officials at 5 jurisdictions that we visited  reported plans to introduce a VVPT capability for future elections, and  officials at 2 jurisdictions reported plans to integrate an audio component  to comply with HAVA requirements. In another case, officials in   2 jurisdictions told us that their state is planning to purchase electronic poll  books for its precincts to use during the 2006 elections to electronically  link its voter registration system with its voting systems. Officials at  another jurisdiction told us that they plan to obtain a new optical scanner  that will be used to tabulate both DRE and optical scan election results.", "The scope and magnitude of election system integration may be influenced,  in part, by the jurisdictions\u2019 adoption of the optical scan and DRE voting  methods and the corresponding products that support add-on automated  features, such as languages and accessibility tools, and interactions among  automated components of the election process, such as ballot generation  and tabulation. As we discussed earlier in this chapter, one-fifth of local  jurisdictions are planning to acquire new optical scan and DRE voting  equipment in time for the 2006 general election. For instance, on the basis  of our survey of local jurisdictions, we estimate that 25 percent of  jurisdictions plan to acquire precinct count optical scan voting equipment  by the November 2006 general election. However, some jurisdictions had  not yet finalized their time frame for acquiring voting equipment at the time  of our survey. In addition, their acquisition plans also include technologies  for their election Web sites. Figure 82 estimates the percentages of  jurisdictions with acquisition plans for various technologies and their  implementation time frames. While the advent of more technology-based  voting methods provides greater opportunities for integration, the  uncertainty around the timing and nature of their introduction makes the  future extent of this integration unclear at this point.", "It is important for voting system standards developers to recognize the  opportunity and potential for greater integration of election systems. EAC  recently adopted a new version of the voluntary voting system guidelines in  December 2005 that will become effective in December 2007. However, this  version does not address some of the capabilities discussed above. For  instance, the guidelines do not address the integration of registration  systems with voting systems. Neither do they address commercial-off-the- shelf devices (such as card readers, printers, or personal computers) or  software products (such as operating systems or database management  systems) that are used in voting systems without modification. EAC has  acknowledged that more work is needed to further develop the technical  guidelines in areas such as voting accessibility, usability, and security  features. Such efforts have the potential to assist states and local  jurisdictions in maximizing the benefits of emerging election technologies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The challenges confronting local jurisdictions in acquiring and operating  voting technologies are not unlike those faced by any technology user\u2014 adoption and consistent application of standards for system capabilities  and performance, reliable measures and objective data to determine  whether the systems are performing as intended, rigorous and disciplined  performance of security and testing activities, and successful management  and integration of the people, process, and technology components of  elections during system acquisition and operation. These challenges are  heightened by other conditions common to both the national elections  community and other information technology environments: the  distribution of responsibilities among various organizations, technology  changes, funding opportunities and constraints, emerging requirements  and guidance, and public attention.", "The extent to which states and local jurisdictions adopt and consistently  apply up-to-date voting systems standards will directly affect the security  and performance of voting systems. A substantial proportion of  jurisdictions have yet to adopt the most current federal voting system  standards or related performance measures. Even if this happens, however,  other challenges loom because systems will need to be tested and  recertified by many states (and by federal processes whenever states have  adopted national standards) to meet any newly adopted voting standards  and HAVA requirements for accuracy. Organizations involved with  recertification\u2014including federal, state, and local governments; testing  authorities; and vendors\u2014may need the capacity to assume the workloads  associated with expected increases in the adoption of current standards  and the use of new voting systems so that potential risks to near-term  election processes are minimized.", "Reliable measures and objective data are also considered essential  management practices for determining whether the technology being used  is meeting the needs of the jurisdiction\u2019s user communities (both the voters  and the officials who administer the elections). Looking back to the  November 2000 and 2004 general elections, we estimate that the vast  majority of jurisdictions were satisfied with the performance of their  respective technologies. However, considering that our local jurisdiction  surveys for the 2000 and 2004 elections indicated limited collection of  voting system performance data, we conclude that estimated levels of  satisfaction with voting equipment found in our local surveys have been  mostly based on a patchwork of operational indicators and, based on site  visits to local jurisdictions, have involved anecdotal experiences of election  officials. Although these impressions should not be discounted, informed  decision making on voting system changes and investment would benefit  from more objective data about how well existing equipment is meeting  specific requirements, such as those governing system accuracy, reliability,  efficiency, and security. No one voting method, or particular voting system  make and model, will meet the needs of every jurisdiction. The challenge is  thus to ensure that decisions about staying with an existing voting method  or investing in new or upgraded voting equipment are made on the basis of  reliable and relevant data about the operational performance of the  existing method against requirements and standards, as well as the benefits  to be derived versus the costs to be incurred with each choice.", "Effective execution of well-planned security and testing activities provides  opportunities to anticipate and address potential problems before they  affect election results. This is important because even a few instances of  election errors or disruptions can have a sizable impact if election results  are close. We estimate that the vast majority of jurisdictions performed  security and testing activities in one form or another for the 2004 general  election. However, the nature and extent of these activities varied among  jurisdictions\u2014to some degree by jurisdiction size, voting method, or  perceived applicability of the activities. These activities were also largely  responsive to\u2014and limited by\u2014formal state and local directives. When  appropriately defined and implemented, such directives can promote the  effective execution of security and testing practices across all phases of the  elections process. As voting technologies and requirements evolve, states  and local jurisdictions face the challenge of regularly updating and  consistently implementing the directives to meet the needs of their specific  election environments.", "As we noted for the 2000 general election, managing the three election  components of people, process, and technology as interrelated and  interdependent variables presents an important challenge in the acquisition  or operation of a given voting method. Whether a state or jurisdiction is  acquiring, testing, operating, or maintaining a new voting system or an  existing one, how successfully the system actually performs throughout the  election cycle will depend not only on how well the technology itself has  been designed, but also on how well the people and processes associated  with the system fulfill their roles for each stage. The technical potential of  more extensive integration of voting equipment, components, and election  systems also holds the prospect for even more interrelationships and  interdependencies among the people, processes, and technologies, with all  their attendant risks. In addition to establishing minimum functional and  performance requirements and processes for voting system aspects of the  election process, system standards can also be used to govern the  integration of election systems; address the accuracy, reliability, privacy,  and security of components and interfaces; and deliver needed support for  the people and processes that will use the integrated election systems.  Timely development of integration standards presents a challenge to the  election community to keep pace with the advancement of election  systems and technology."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
