This report (1) identifies challenges that selected municipalities in fiscal crisis experienced when managing federal grants and steps taken by those municipalities; (2) reviews the monitoring processes that federal agencies used to oversee selected grants to selected municipalities; and (3) examines actions the White House Working Group on Detroit and selected federal agencies took to assist municipalities in fiscal crisis.", "For this review, GAO conducted site visits to four municipalities in fiscal crisis: Detroit, Michigan; Flint, Michigan; Camden, New Jersey; and Stockton, California.

The diminished capacity of selected municipalities in fiscal crisis hindered their ability to manage federal grants in several ways. First, reductions in human capital capacity through the loss of staff greatly reduced the ability of some cities to carry out grant compliance and oversight responsibilities. Second, the loss of human capital capacity also led to grant management skills gaps. For example, in Detroit, Michigan, loss and turnover of staff with the skills to properly draw down funds caused some grant funds to remain unspent. Third, decreased financial capacity reduced some municipalities' ability to obtain federal grants. For example, both Flint, Michigan, and Stockton, California, did not apply for competitive federal grants with maintenance of effort requirements because their city governments were unable to ensure that they would maintain non-federal funding at current levels. Fourth, outdated information technology (IT) systems hampered municipalities' ability to oversee and report on federal grants. For example, Detroit's 2011 and 2012 single audits identified IT deficiencies in every federal grant program reviewed, which led to the city having to pay back some federal grant funds. In response to these challenges, the four municipalities GAO reviewed have taken a number of actions to improve their management of federal grants including centralizing their grant management processes and partnering with local nonprofits to apply for grants.", "Federal grant monitoring and oversight processes. The eight grant programs GAO reviewed used, or had recently implemented, a risk-based approach to grant monitoring and oversight. These approaches applied to all grantees not just those in fiscal crisis. The grant programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Justice (Justice) consistently assessed grantees against a variety of risk factors to help program officials determine the need for more in-depth monitoring actions such as onsite monitoring visits. When program officials at HUD, Justice, the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) found deficiencies through monitoring actions, they required corrective actions from their grantees. However, in some cases, local grantees did not implement these corrective actions, resulting in continued grant management problems. In such cases, federal program officials took actions such as increasing the level of financial oversight or withholding grant funds until the grantee improved its grant management processes.", "Actions taken to assist municipalities in fiscal crisis. The White House Working Group on Detroit\u2014an interagency group assembled by the White House to assist Detroit\u2014as well as selected agencies took a variety of actions to aid municipalities in fiscal crisis. These actions included improving collaboration between selected municipalities and federal agencies, providing flexibilities to help grantees meet grant requirements, and offering direct technical assistance. However, neither individual agencies nor the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which was involved in the working group and has an interagency leadership role in achieving administration policy, have formal plans to document and share lessons learned from the efforts to assist Detroit with other federal agencies and local governments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB direct federal agencies involved in the White House Working Group on Detroit to document and share lessons learned from federal efforts to assist Detroit.

In extreme cases, some local governments have been unable  to raise enough revenue to meet their obligations, leading them to file for  Chapter 9 bankruptcy or to be enrolled in state-level programs for fiscally  distressed municipalities. In such cases, local governments often make  significant cuts to personnel and services, and these actions may have  impacts on the ability of these local governments to oversee and  administer federal grant funds.", "The federal government has a substantial interest in local government  fiscal health as a result of the grant funds it sends to state and local  governments. In fiscal year 2014, the federal government provided state  and local governments nearly $577 billion in federal grants, funding a  wide range of public policy areas, such as health care, transportation,  income security, education, job training, social services, community  development, and environmental protection.", "Given that municipalities in fiscal crisis must continue to meet federal  grant requirements while facing severe fiscal pressures and potential loss  of capacity, you asked us to examine the oversight of federal grants to  municipalities in fiscal crisis.

In conducting this  work we focused on four municipalities in fiscal crisis as case examples:  Detroit, Michigan; Flint, Michigan; Camden, New Jersey; and Stockton,  California. Criteria for selecting these municipalities included whether they  were in fiscal crisis (defined as having filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy or  being designated in fiscal crisis by their state government); amount of  federal grant obligations; population; and state intervention type (e.g.,  assignment of an emergency fiscal manager). We selected eight federal  grant programs that these municipalities received using the following  criteria: dollar amount, grant type (e.g., direct or pass-through), and  incidence across multiple municipalities. We focused our analysis on  federal grants received by these municipalities in the 5 year period from  2009 to 2013. Findings from these cases are not generalizable to all  municipalities in fiscal crisis.", "To identify challenges selected municipalities in fiscal crisis experience  when managing federal grants, to describe the steps the affected  municipalities took to address those challenges, and to review the actions  the White House Working Group on Detroit and selected federal agencies  have taken, we conducted interviews with local, state, and federal  officials. We conducted site visits to the four municipalities and  interviewed senior elected and appointed leadership as well as  departmental staff in charge of managing the selected grants. We  interviewed senior headquarters and regional staff where applicable at  the federal agencies responsible for the grants we selected. In the case of  the one pass-through grant included in our sample, we interviewed state  officials responsible for overseeing the distribution of that grant to our  selected cities. To obtain a government-wide perspective we interviewed  members of the White House Working Group on Detroit, described by  agency officials as an interagency collaborative effort to help coordinate  the federal response to Detroit\u2019s fiscal crisis, as well as officials at the  Office of Management and Budget and at the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s Office of State and Local Finance.

In managing revenue  and expenses, local governments occasionally confront deficits and  periods when they lack enough cash to cover expenses. Most of the  time, they find ways to get through the temporary trouble by, for example,  borrowing money over the short term. But when budget gaps widen and a  city cannot pay its bills, meet its payroll, balance its budget, or carry out  essential services, the local government is viewed as distressed.  Municipal officials usually respond with some combination of service cuts,  worker layoffs, tax and fee increases, reserve spending, and borrowing. If  those measures do not work and the city no longer has the money to  meet its obligations, the distress can escalate into a crisis or financial  emergency, which may include defaulting on a bond payment or, in rare  instances, filing for protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy  Code (Chapter 9).", "Chapter 9 provides a municipality with protection from creditors while the  municipality develops and negotiates a plan for adjusting its debts.  Among other requirements, a municipality may seek such bankruptcy  protection in a federal bankruptcy court if it is authorized to do so under  state law, and the municipality can prove to the bankruptcy court that it is  insolvent. Twenty-seven states authorize municipalities to file for Chapter  9 bankruptcy, but 15 of those states have conditions or limitations on the  authorization. Of the remaining 23 states, 21 do not have specific  authorizations, and 2 specifically prohibit their municipalities from filing for  Chapter 9. Chapter 9 filings are rare for general purpose municipalities  (e.g., cities, towns, and counties). From January 1980 to June 2014, 43 of  approximately 39,000 general purpose municipalities filed for Chapter 9.  These municipalities tended to be small in population: only 8 of the 43  municipalities had a population over 50,000.

For example, in  1975 New York City faced a serious fiscal crisis. New York City had  accumulated $14 billion in debt, and was unable to pay for normal  operating expenses. That year Congress passed legislation to provide  short-term loans to New York City to assist with its fiscal crisis. As a  condition of receiving these loans, the city had to agree to develop more  stringent financial procedures including a new accounting system that  would allow an auditor to perform an audit and render an opinion on the  city\u2019s financial statements. In a prior report on New York City\u2019s financial  plan, we concluded that the federal government\u2019s intervention, along with  other factors, helped to stabilize the city\u2019s fiscal crisis.", "Congress also took steps to assist the District of Columbia during its fiscal  crisis in 1995.

Grants represent one form of federal assistance  consisting of payments in cash or in kind to a state or local government or  a nongovernmental recipient for a specified purpose. Grant programs are  typically subject to a wide range of accountability requirements under  their authorizing legislation or appropriation and implementing regulations  so that funding is spent for its intended purpose. For example, the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers  Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) to aid states and  localities in providing housing, economic development, and other  community development activities. Congress mandated that HUD  administer these grant programs in a manner that principally benefits low- and moderate-income persons, aids in the prevention or elimination of  slums or blight, or meets urgent community development needs. HUD  regulations direct grant recipients to prepare planning documents and  maintain certain records proving the legislation\u2019s requirements as a  condition to receiving funds.", "In addition, grant programs are also subject to crosscutting requirements  applicable to most assistance programs. For example, recipients of grant  funds are prohibited from using those funds to lobby members and  employees of Congress and executive agency employees. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for developing  government-wide policies to ensure that grants are managed properly  and that grant funds are spent in accordance with applicable laws and  regulations. Until recently, OMB published guidance in various circulars to  aid grant-making agencies with such subjects as audit and record  keeping and the allowability of costs. In December 2013, OMB  consolidated its grants management circulars into a single document,  Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit  Requirements for Federal Awards, to streamline its guidance, promote  consistency among grantees, and reduce administrative burden on  nonfederal entities.", "For this review, we selected the grant programs listed below.

According to Detroit officials, it was  difficult for the staff that remained to carry out all of the department\u2019s  grant compliance and oversight responsibilities. They said the loss  ultimately contributed to adverse single audit findings, monitoring findings  and special grant conditions from HUD. For example, in a 2013  monitoring report for the CDBG program, HUD found seven deficiencies,  such as incorrect grant charges for staff time and failure to demonstrate  adequate controls to prevent charging CDBG for unallowable costs.

With overall lower staff numbers, remaining staff  were left to cover a larger set of responsibilities, including managing grant  programs that they had not been familiar with prior to the staff reductions.  Officials representing Detroit and Flint told us that when they lost grant  management staff, the resulting skill shortage sometimes contributed to  violations of grant agreements or grant funds remaining unspent in city  accounts.", "For example, Flint\u2019s Department of Community and Economic  Development, which administers HUD\u2019s CDBG and HOME grant  programs, lost a number of key staff during its fiscal crisis through layoffs  and attrition, including an experienced employee who reviewed and  approved grant expenditures. Flint officials as well as HUD\u2019s technical  assistance providers for the CDBG and HOME programs told us that  losing staff with critical grant management knowledge contributed to  compliance problems, resulting in a series of critical audits of Flint\u2019s  HOME program by HUD\u2019s Inspector General from 2009 to 2013.According to staff from HUD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, staff  turnover in Flint contributed to grant management knowledge gaps and  subsequent audit findings. These findings had serious monetary  consequences for the city of Flint. Flint officials told us that the city owed  HUD approximately $1.1 million in 2014 because Flint could not ensure  that its indirect costs had been appropriately calculated and allocated  across HUD\u2019s grant programs. In addition to increasing the risk of  violations of grant agreements, losing grant management skills made it  more difficult for officials in Detroit, Flint, and Stockton to draw down grant  funds.

According to city officials, this happened for two  reasons. First, because some cities in fiscal crisis must furlough  employees, lower salaries, or reduce retirement benefits, senior staff  members chose to leave their positions while they could still vest their  retirement benefits based on their highest salary levels. Second, more  experienced staff members had more marketable skills and were able to  find other jobs more easily than the junior staff members. Officials in  these two municipalities explained that losing senior staff created gaps in  institutional knowledge and made it more difficult for remaining staff to  meet existing grant requirements.", "These gaps in institutional knowledge were exacerbated by a lack of  robust knowledge transfer practices, which heightened the risk to federal  fund management as a city government lost staff because there was no  mechanism in place for staff to pass down knowledge to their successors  before they left. Knowledge management had been a long-standing  challenge for the city of Detroit. Detroit had few written grant policies to  help transfer knowledge about grants management. According to a city  of Detroit report and Detroit officials, grant management policies and  procedures in Detroit varied among grant-recipient departments.

Detroit Fire  Department officials told us that without the help of the Public Safety  Foundation, they would have limited capacity to apply for competitive  federal grants.", "Similarly, the city of Flint partnered with the Flint Area Reinvestment  Office and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation to identify and apply for  federal grants. The Flint Area Reinvestment Office is a local nonprofit  organization with the mission to \u201cinform, organize, and facilitate local  partner collaboration on strategic opportunities that attract federal and  state resources.\u201d The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation\u2014which began in  Flint in 1926\u2014supports a variety of projects through its Flint Area  Program, such as economic development, job training, and emergency  services projects. A senior Flint official told us that one of the valuable  contributions these local nonprofits made was to coordinate grant  applications in the area to help ensure that multiple organizations were  not applying for the same grant. These two organizations helped the city  apply for a COPS grant, which it received in 2013.", "In addition to taking steps that directly improve federal grant  management\u2014such as consolidating grant management processes and  working with local nonprofits to apply for federal grants\u2014some  municipalities also recognized the need for making improvements to  systemic financial and organization problems to set a proper foundation  for sound grant management. Two of the municipalities in our review\u2014 Flint and Stockton\u2014established committees to recommend changes in  city governance necessary to improve long-term fiscal health and stability.  These municipalities recognized that their fiscal issues were the result of  long-term, systemic policies and structures. Therefore, they created  committees to recommend changes to improve their long-term financial  capacity. Flint officials said that systemic changes were needed to protect  the fiscal future of the city. In response, Flint\u2019s Emergency Manager  appointed members to a Blue Ribbon Committee on Governance Reform.  The committee explored the structures, policies, and practices that  contributed to Flint\u2019s financial difficulties. It also proposed changes  designed to help the city avoid returning to those difficulties in the future.  In June 2014, the committee issued a number of recommendations to  Flint\u2019s Emergency Manager including that he embrace the use of multi- year budgeting, strategic planning, and long-term financial forecasts. In  November 2014, Flint citizens voted to adopt four of six Blue Ribbon  Committee recommendations.

Our past work has shown that to  ensure that grant funds are used for intended purposes, federal agencies  need effective processes for: (1) monitoring the financial management of  grants; (2) ensuring results through performance monitoring; (3) using  audits to provide valuable information about recipients; and (4) monitoring  subrecipients as a critical element of grant success. We reviewed  implementation of these monitoring procedures for each of the eight  selected grant programs in Detroit, Flint, Camden, and Stockton in fiscal  years 2009 through 2013.

These programs considered a variety of risk factors. For  example, to assess risk for JAG grants in 2013, program officials used a  grant assessment tool that included 29 risk indicators, such as the size of  the grant award, timeliness of progress reports, and whether there had  been an inspector general audit for the grantee in the previous 2 years. If  a grantee scored higher than a certain threshold on these indicators, the  grantee would likely be considered a high priority for in-depth monitoring  activities, such as enhanced desk reviews or site visits. Two of these four  programs\u2014CDBG and HOME\u2014considered risk factors that would likely  be impacted by a municipality experiencing fiscal crisis, such as  measures of employee loss, turnover, or extended vacancies of key staff.", "The four other grant programs\u2014Federal Transit Formula, Highway  Planning and Construction, AFG, and SAFER\u2014have taken steps toward  incorporating more risk assessments into grant monitoring processes. In  2014, FTA began formally using a new list of risk factors to determine  whether to conduct enhanced oversight of a Federal Transit Formula  grantee. This included whether the grantee had a state financial oversight  control board or similar mechanism, which some state agencies require  as a result of being in fiscal crisis. Of the eight programs we reviewed, the  Federal Transit Formula program was the only one to have a risk factor  directly linked to municipal fiscal distress. Prior to this change, FTA  conducted routine monitoring reviews of its approximately 600 Federal  Transit Formula grantees at least once every 3 years\u2014or about 200  grantees per year. According to FTA officials, the new risk factors allow  FTA to better target these reviews based on grantee risk and need.", "In 2014, FHWA also made improvements to its processes for identifying  risk for its locally-administered Highway Planning and Construction grant  projects. By law state departments of transportation are the direct  recipients of Highway Planning and Construction Grant funds and have  the primary role to oversee grant funds that are administered by  subrecipients, such as municipalities. However, FHWA is responsible for  monitoring the state departments of transportation to ensure that states  are accountable for implementing federal requirements and conducting  adequate oversight of federal funds. In August 2014, FHWA published an  order that established a uniform methodology for assessing risk in the  stewardship and oversight of locally-administered Highway Planning and  Construction grant funds by state departments of transportation. For  example, the order provides a guide for FHWA officials to use to assess  the extent to which state departments of transportation have acceptable  review and oversight plans detailing state oversight activities for locally- administered projects. FHWA developed this order to help provide  reasonable assurance that Highway Planning and Construction grant  projects comply with key federal requirements.", "In carrying out its oversight of AFG and SAFER grants, FEMA conducted  both financial and programmatic monitoring. Financial monitoring  primarily focuses on statutory and regulatory compliance of financial  matters, while programmatic monitoring focuses on grant progress,  targeting issues that may impact achievement of the grant\u2019s goals. Prior  to fiscal year 2013, a FEMA official told us that the reasons that AFG or  SAFER grantees were chosen for in-depth programmatic monitoring were  unclear, as those choices were often left to the discretion of regional  program officials. These officials explained that, in fiscal year 2013, the  agency conducted a baseline risk review of all new grantees to help  inform the selection of grants for programmatic monitoring. For financial  monitoring, prior to 2013 FEMA applied risk factors to a sample of grants  to inform in-depth monitoring decisions.

This contributed to continued grant management problems,  resulting in a potential financial risk.

For example, in administering and monitoring Federal  Transit Formula Grants in fiscal year 2012, FTA contractors found that the  Detroit Department of Transportation had increased the amount of some  of its contracts by more than $100,000 without including proper  documentation to support the changes to the contract. In response, FTA  required that Detroit provide evidence of adequate documentation to  support future change orders to contracts. As stated in its monitoring  reports, FTA has required numerous corrective actions from Detroit  during our review period (fiscal years 2009 through 2013). Between 2009  and 2013 FTA found over 60 deficiencies with Detroit\u2019s Federal Transit  Formula Grants. According to FTA officials, Detroit would submit  corrective action plans to address such deficiencies, but would not follow  through on the plans. To enforce corrective actions, FTA officials told us  that they could choose to withhold funds from Detroit. However, these  officials said that they were hesitant to withhold funds because, while  doing so may lead to changes in behavior of local officials, it would also  deprive the city\u2019s residents of the benefit of services provided by the  funds. Instead, in April 2013 FTA placed Detroit on restricted draw down  status. While in this status, FTA officials told us that all requests by the  city of Detroit for payments under their Federal Transit Formula Grant are  first to be reviewed by FTA officials to ensure that the costs are eligible  for reimbursement and that city officials have included the necessary  documentation.", "HUD officials also found chronic monitoring deficiencies in Detroit, but  they took a different enforcement approach. Between 2009 and 2013,  HUD\u2019s grant monitoring reports identified 29 deficiencies in Detroit\u2019s  CDBG and HOME grant programs. In general, deficiencies were found in  the following areas, among others: poor procurement practices,  inadequate calculation of administrative and indirect costs to the grants,  poor financial reporting, and lack of key documentation. In a December  2012 letter to the city of Detroit, HUD designated the city as a \u201chigh risk  grantee\u201d and imposed special grant conditions requiring Detroit to provide  written procedures for how it would maintain compliance with the  regulations governing its grant funds. As a result of these conditions  HUD withheld its fiscal year 2012 formula funds\u2014including CDBG and  HOME grants\u2014until Detroit had provided the agency with sufficient  documentation to satisfy HUD officials that the city could properly manage  the funds. HUD officials told us that the agency released these funds  gradually in fiscal year 2013 as Detroit demonstrated that it satisfied the  requirements set forth in the grant conditions. HUD had a similar  experience with continued monitoring deficiencies with the city of Flint.", "For example, in its 2011 monitoring report on Flint\u2019s HOME grant  program, HUD stated that it had not received responses from Flint on how  the city planned to address the agency\u2019s 2010 monitoring findings,  despite the fact that Flint officials had repeatedly promised to provide  them.

It sought to accomplish this objective by meeting with senior  city leaders to discuss their priorities and then connecting these officials  with available resources or expertise needed to respond to city problems.  For example, Detroit officials identified the city\u2019s outdated IT systems as  one of the top hurdles to its fiscal recovery. In response, the White House  Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Economic  Council convened a group of top IT leaders in municipal government.  These experts, dubbed the Tech Team, met with Detroit officials,  assessed the city\u2019s IT systems, and developed a set of recommendations  with the purpose of streamlining government processes, saving money,  and improving city services. Detroit city officials told us that they were  following through on the Tech Team\u2019s recommendations. For example,  the Tech Team recommended that Detroit establish a cabinet-level  position within city government charged with leveraging technology and  innovation to improve the delivery of government services. In February  2014, Detroit hired a Chief Information Officer to lead IT improvements in  the city. As a first step, the Chief Information Officer stated that Detroit is  working on another of the Tech Team\u2019s recommendations\u2014evaluating  citywide IT infrastructure\u2014by completing a comprehensive analysis of the  current IT systems in the city, providing new computers and issuing  requests for proposals for new records management systems for the  police and fire departments.", "Justice\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF)  collaborated with two of our selected municipalities to help leverage  limited local, state, and federal public safety resources.

Officials there  explained that much of Stockton\u2019s crime was drug and gang related as  the city is located at the intersection of two major drug corridors. As a  result of severe budget cuts and layoffs since 2009, Stockton Police  Department officials told us that they have been unable to respond to  nonviolent crimes.

Federal  agencies can provide flexibilities on such grant requirements in certain  circumstances.", "For example, members of the White House Working Group on Detroit  from both OMB and Treasury used such flexibilities to allow Detroit to  leverage previously allocated grant funds to address urban blight in the  city. A 2013 survey of Detroit\u2019s properties found that approximately  85,000 structures and vacant lots either met the definition of blighted  property or showed indications of future blight, and roughly 40,000 of  those structures needed immediate removal. A senior OMB official told  us that one of his tasks as a member of the White House Working Group  was to identify all existing federal funds that were already set aside for  Detroit.

In addition, OMB officials identified CDBG and HOME grant  funds that had been previously allocated to the city but were in danger of  expiring. Working together with staff from HUD and the city of Detroit,  these officials told us they were able to quickly formulate plans that met  grant requirements, thereby enabling the city to use the grant funds  before they expired.", "In another example of federal agencies providing flexibility, the COPS  Office worked closely with city officials in Camden to help legally transfer  its grant funds during the city-county police consolidation. In May 2013,  Camden dissolved its city police department and created a new Metro  Division for the city of Camden within the existing Camden County Police  Department. Camden officials told us that without dissolving the city  police department, Camden would have been unable to continue to afford  the salary and benefit costs of its police force. When Camden officials  started working on the plan to consolidate the city and county police  departments, officials reached out to the COPS Office to discuss what  would happen with the city\u2019s active COPS grant. Camden officials told us  that the COPS Office was very helpful in providing options and flexibilities  for Camden to continue to use the COPS grant. For example, the COPS  Office provided Camden with several options and worked with the city to  find a way to maintain its status as primary grantee but to transfer grant  funds to the new county police force. The COPS Office worked with  Camden officials in the police and finance departments to ensure that the  transfer and transition occurred in a manner that met grant requirements.

Local officials were also interested in lessons learned. In both Stockton  and Flint, city officials wanted to learn about what was working in Detroit  and in other cities dealing with a fiscal crisis. Stockton officials told us that  they understood that, given Detroit\u2019s size and the amount of public  attention it had received, its situation warranted a level of direct response  from the federal government that smaller cities probably could not expect.  However, these officials believed that their city and other municipalities  could still benefit from some of the approaches and advice offered to  Detroit.", "The informal structure of the White House Working Group may be one  reason that lessons learned have not been formally documented and  shared. Officials involved with the working group told us that the  composition of the group was driven by the needs of the city of Detroit.  When Detroit faced difficulties with blight, the working group assembled  agency officials from Treasury, HUD, OMB, and the Environmental  Protection Agency to advise city officials about how available grant funds  could be used for blight remediation. When the city faced difficulties with  street lighting, the working group assembled officials from the Department  of Energy to provide technical assistance and advice. After addressing  such needs in Detroit, these federal officials typically returned to their  usual responsibilities at their respective agencies.

We selected these municipalities based on a  number of factors. First, we applied two threshold fiscal crisis criteria,  which included either filing for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy or being  declared in fiscal crisis by their state government. Once these criteria  were met, we selected the municipalities with relatively high levels of  federal investment in terms of population and federal grant obligations.  We considered those municipalities with populations over 50,000, using  2010 Census data to estimate the population figures. We also narrowed  the pool of municipalities to those with federal grant obligation amounts of  at least $5 million between fiscal years 2011 and 2013. To obtain this  obligation data, we used grant obligation figures from USASpending.gov.

Some states intervene with an emergency  fiscal manager, a state oversight board, or a state agency, while other  states provide no interventions. Our selection provided two municipalities  with emergency fiscal managers (Detroit and Flint), one municipality with  oversight from a state agency (Camden), and one municipality with no  state intervention (Stockton). Finally, we considered geographic diversity  when selecting the municipalities and our final selection includes  municipalities on the east coast, west coast, and in the Midwest. Based  on the grants that our four municipalities received, we selected eight grant  programs for our review. Grant selection was also based on the following  criteria: (1) dollar amount; (2) grant type (e.g., direct or pass-through);  and (3) incidence across multiple municipalities. Findings from these  cases are not generalizable to all municipalities in fiscal crisis. See  appendix II for a list of the selected grants in our review and the grant  award amounts for our selected cities between 2009 and 2013. We chose  the period of fiscal years 2009 through 2013 because it included the latest  5 years with available monitoring data at the time of our review.", "To identify challenges that selected municipalities in fiscal crisis have  experienced when managing federal grants and the steps those  municipalities took to address those challenges, we primarily relied on  interviews with local, state, and federal officials. We conducted site visits  to the four selected municipalities and interviewed elected leadership and  departmental staff in charge of managing the selected grants. In the case  of the one pass through grant included in our sample, we interviewed  state officials responsible for overseeing the distribution of that grant to  our selected cities. We also interviewed federal headquarters and  regional staff where applicable who oversee the selected grants and  researchers and professional organizations that were knowledgeable  about municipal fiscal crises and challenges that municipalities faced. In  these interviews, we asked local, state, federal, and nongovernmental  officials to describe the challenges that the selected municipalities in  fiscal crisis faced regarding federal grants management. We reviewed  and analyzed our interviews with federal, state, and local officials to  identify grant management challenges. To illustrate the reduced capacity  of the selected cities, we used full-time equivalent (FTE) data from  published Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports for Detroit, Flint, and  Stockton as well as state municipal aid applications for Camden. To  determine that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report, we checked for consistency across published financial reports for  the selected cities. We also verified these numbers with cognizant city  officials.", "To review the internal controls, monitoring, and oversight processes that  federal agencies used to oversee the selected grants made to our four  case example municipalities, we examined grant laws, regulations, and  oversight policies for fiscal years 2009 to 2013 for our eight selected grant  programs. We compared the monitoring policies for the eight grant  programs with the implementation documentation for those policies in the  four selected agencies. For example, if an agency policy stated that  grants would receive risk scores that would help determine the  appropriate level of monitoring, we checked for documentation of the risk  scores and subsequent monitoring actions such as site visits or desk  reviews. Examples of oversight implementation documentation that we  reviewed for our selected grant programs included grant risk assessment  worksheets, monitoring reports, sanction letters, and monitoring follow up  documents. We also reviewed monitoring findings of single audits and  office of inspector general audit reports. We interviewed cognizant local,  state, and federal officials about these monitoring policies and actions.", "To examine the actions the White House Working Group on Detroit and  selected federal agencies took to assist selected municipalities in fiscal  crisis, we interviewed local, state, and federal officials involved with grant  management for the four selected municipalities and eight selected grant  programs. We conducted site visits to the four selected municipalities and  interviewed elected leadership and departmental staff in charge of  managing the selected grants. In the case of the one pass-through grant  included in our sample, we interviewed state officials responsible for  overseeing the distribution of that grant to our selected cities. In these  interviews, we asked officials to describe the actions that the White  House Working Group and selected federal agencies took to assist them  during their fiscal crisis. We asked officials to describe the actions that  were helpful and the actions that could be improved. We also interviewed  federal headquarters and regional staff who oversee the selected grants  to obtain their perspectives about the actions they took to assist these  selected municipalities. To obtain a government-wide perspective we  interviewed members of the White House Working Group on Detroit,  described by agency officials as an interagency collaborative effort to help  coordinate the federal response to Detroit\u2019s fiscal crisis, as well as  officials at the Office of Management and Budget and at the Department  of the Treasury\u2019s Office of State and Local Finance. We reviewed our  interviews with federal, state, and local officials to identify actions taken  by federal agencies that assisted municipalities in fiscal crisis. We used  criteria from our prior work to inform the usefulness of these actions,  including our work on effective federal collaboration, implementing  interagency collaborative mechanisms, and state and local grant  management.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2014 to March 2015,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Overview of Selected Grant Programs", "paragraphs": ["Appendix II: Overview of Selected Grant  Programs Agency and administering  component  Department of Housing and Urban  Development, Community Planning  and Development (CPD)", "Department of Housing and Urban  Development, CPD  Department of Transportation,  Federal Transit Administration  (FTA)", "Department of Transportation,  Federal Highway Administration  (FHWA)", "Department of Justice, Office of  Justice Programs (OJP)", "Department of Justice, COPS  Office  Department of Homeland Security,  Federal Emergency Management  Administration (FEMA)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": ["J.
