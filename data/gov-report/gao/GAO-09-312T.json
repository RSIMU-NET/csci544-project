A successful transition will require, among other things, addressing the following issues: (1) Establishing a foundation of clearly defined health IT standards that are agreed upon by all important stakeholders. Developing, coordinating, and agreeing on standards are crucial for allowing health IT systems to work together and to provide the right people access to the information they need: for example, technology standards must be agreed on (such as file types and interchange systems), and a host of content issues must also be addressed (one example is the need for consistent medical terminology). Although important steps have been taken, additional effort is needed to define, adopt, and implement such standards to promote data quality and consistency, system interoperability (that is, the ability of automated systems to share and use information), and information protection. (2) Defining comprehensive plans that are grounded in results-oriented milestones and measures. Using interoperable health IT to improve the quality and efficiency of health care is a complex goal that involves a range of stakeholders, various technologies, and numerous activities taking place over an expanse of time, and it is important that these activities be guided by comprehensive plans that include milestones and performance measures. Without such plans, it will be difficult to ensure that the many activities are coordinated, their results monitored, and their outcomes most effectively integrated. (3) Implementing an approach to protection of personal privacy that encourages public acceptance of health IT. A robust approach to privacy protection is essential to establish the high degree of public confidence and trust needed to encourage widespread adoption of health IT and particularly electronic medical records. Health IT programs and applications need to address key privacy principles (for example, the access principle, which establishes the right of individuals to review certain personal health information). At the same time, they need to overcome key challenges (for example, those related to variations in states' privacy laws). Unless these principles and challenges are fully and adequately addressed, there is reduced assurance that privacy protection measures will be consistently built into health IT programs and applications, and public acceptance of health IT may be put at risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to comment on federal efforts to  advance the use of health information technology (IT). Studies  published by the Institute of Medicine and others have long  indicated that fragmented, disorganized, and inaccessible clinical  information adversely affects the quality of health care and  compromises patient safety. Further, long-standing problems with  medical errors and inefficiencies have contributed to increased  costs of health care. With health care spending in 2007 reaching  approximately $2.2 trillion, or 16 percent of the U.S. gross domestic  product, concerns about the costs of health care have continued to  grow, and have prompted calls from policy makers, industry  experts, and medical practitioners to improve the U.S. health care  system.", "As has been recognized by you and other members of Congress, as  well as President Bush and President-elect Obama, the use of  information technology to electronically collect, store, retrieve, and  transfer clinical, administrative, and financial health information has  great potential to help improve the quality and efficiency of health  care. The successful implementation of health IT offers promise for  improving patient safety and reducing inefficiencies and has been  shown to support cost savings and other benefits. At the same time,  successfully achieving widespread adoption and implementation of  health IT has proven challenging, and the best way to accomplish  this goal remains subject to much debate. According to the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), only a small  number of U.S. health care providers have fully adopted health IT  due to significant financial, technical, cultural, and legal barriers,  such as a lack of access to capital, a lack of data standards, and  resistance from health care providers.", "Given its role in providing health care, the federal government has  been urged to take a leadership role to improve the quality and  effectiveness of health care and has been working to promote the  nationwide use of health IT for a number of years. In April 2004,  President Bush issued an executive order that called for widespread  adoption of interoperable electronic health records by 2014, and  HHS, in turn, initiated activities to advance the nationwide  implementation of interoperable health IT. In addition, for the past  decade, the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs  (VA) have been pursuing initiatives to share data between their  health information systems. In an effort to expedite the exchange of  electronic health information between the two departments, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 included  provisions directing the two departments to jointly develop and  implement, by September 30, 2009, fully interoperable electronic  health record systems or capabilities.", "Since 2001, we have been reviewing aspects of the various federal  efforts undertaken to implement information technology for health  care and public health solutions. We have reported both on HHS\u2019s  national health IT initiatives as well as on DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s electronic  health information sharing initiatives. Overall, our studies have  recognized progress made by these departments, but we have also  pointed out areas of concern that could jeopardize their success in  advancing the use of interoperable health IT. At your request, my  testimony today discusses important issues identified by our work  that have broad relevance to the successful implementation of  health IT to further improve the quality of health care.", "In developing this testimony, we relied largely on our previous  work. We conducted our work in support of this testimony between  December 2008 and January 2009 in Washington, D.C. All work on  which this testimony is based was performed in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform audits to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.", "In summary, transitioning to a nationwide health IT capability is an  inherently complex endeavor. Achieving this transition and the  potential efficiencies and quality improvements promised by  widespread adoption of health IT will require consideration of many  serious issues, including the need for a foundation of clearly defined  health IT standards that are agreed upon by all important  stakeholders, comprehensive planning grounded in results-oriented  milestones and measures, and an approach to privacy protection  that encourages acceptance and adoption of electronic health  records.  \u25cf  Developing, coordinating, and agreeing on standards are crucial for  allowing health IT systems to work together and to provide the right  people access to the information they need. Any level of  interoperability depends on the use of agreed-upon standards to  ensure that information can be shared and used. Developing and  implementing health IT standards requires structures and ongoing  mechanisms that include the participation of the relevant  stakeholders, in both the public and private health care sectors who  will be sharing information. Although important steps have been  taken, additional effort is needed to define, adopt, and implement  such standards to promote data quality and consistency, system  interoperability, and information protection.  \u25cf  Using interoperable health IT to improve the quality and efficiency  of health care is a complex goal that involves a range of  stakeholders, various technologies, and numerous activities taking  place over an expanse of time; in view of this complexity, it is  important that these activities be guided by comprehensive plans  that include milestones and performance measures. Milestones and  performance measures allow the results of the activities to be  monitored and assessed, so that corrective action can be taken if  needed. Without comprehensive plans, it will be difficult to ensure  that the many activities are coordinated, their results monitored,  and their outcomes integrated.   \u25cf  An important consideration in health IT is an overall approach for  protecting the privacy of personal electronic health information. The  capacity of health information exchange organizations to store and  manage a large amount of electronic health information increases  the risk that a breach in security could expose the personal health  information of numerous individuals. Addressing and mitigating this  risk is essential to encourage public acceptance of the increased use  of health IT and electronic medical records. We have identified key  privacy principles that health IT programs and applications need to  address and key challenges that they need to overcome. Unless  these principles and challenges are fully and adequately addressed,  there is reduced assurance that privacy protection measures will be  consistently built into health IT programs and applications, and  public acceptance of health IT may be put at risk."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Health care in the United States is a highly decentralized system,  with stakeholders that include not only the entire population as  consumers of health care, but also all levels of government, health  care providers such as medical centers and community hospitals,  patient advocates, health professionals, major employers, nonprofit  health organizations, insurance companies, commercial technology  providers, and others. In this environment, clinical and other health- related information is stored in a complex collection of paper files,  information systems, and organizations, but much of it continues to  be stored and shared on paper.", "Successfully implementing health IT to replace paper and manual  processes has been shown to support benefits in both cost savings  and improved quality of care. For example, we reported to this  committee in 2003 that a 1,951-bed teaching hospital stated that it  had realized about $8.6 million in annual savings by replacing  outpatient paper medical charts with electronic medical records.  This hospital also reported saving more than $2.8 million annually  by replacing its manual process for managing medical records with  an electronic process to provide access to laboratory results and  reports. Other technologies, such as bar coding of certain human  drug and biological product labels, have also been shown to save  money and reduce medical errors. Health care organizations  reported that IT contributed other benefits, such as shorter hospital  stays, faster communication of test results, improved management  of chronic diseases, and improved accuracy in capturing charges  associated with diagnostic and procedure codes.", "There is also potential benefit from improving and expanding  existing health IT systems. We have reported that some hospitals are  expanding their IT systems to support improvements in quality of  care. In April 2007, we released a study on the processes used by  eight hospitals to collect and submit data on their quality of care to  HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Among the  hospitals we visited, officials noted that having electronic records  was an advantage for collecting the quality data because electronic  records were more accessible and legible than paper records, and  the electronic quality data could also be used for other purposes  (such as reminders to physicians). Officials at each of the hospitals  reported using the quality data to make specific changes in their  internal procedures designed to improve care. However, hospital  officials also reported several limitations in their existing IT systems  that constrained the ability to support the collection of their quality  data. For example, hospitals reported having a mix of paper and  electronic systems, having data recorded only as unstructured  narrative or other text, and having multiple systems within a single  hospital that could not access each other\u2019s data. Although it was  expected to take several years, all the hospitals in our study were  working to expand the scope and functionality of their IT systems.", "This example illustrates, among other things, that making health  care information electronically available depends on  interoperability\u2014that is, the ability of two or more systems or  components to exchange information and to use the information  that has been exchanged. This capability is important because it  allows patients\u2019 electronic health information to move with them  from provider to provider, regardless of where the information  originated. If electronic health records conform to interoperability  standards, they can be created, managed, and consulted by  authorized clinicians and staff across more than one health care  organization, thus providing patients and their caregivers the  necessary information required for optimal care. (Paper-based  health records\u2014if available\u2014also provide necessary information,  but unlike electronic health records, do not provide automated  decision support capabilities, such as alerts about a particular  patient\u2019s health, or other advantages of automation.)", "Interoperability may be achieved at different levels (see fig. 1). For  example, at the highest level, electronic data are computable (that  is, in a format that a computer can understand and act on to, for  example, provide alerts to clinicians on drug allergies). At a lower  level, electronic data are structured and viewable, but not  computable. The value of data at this level is that they are structured  so that data of interest to users are easier to find. At still a lower  level, electronic data are unstructured and viewable, but not  computable. With unstructured electronic data, a user would have to  find needed or relevant information by searching uncategorized  data.", "It is important to note that not all data require the same level of  interoperability. For example, computable pharmacy and drug  allergy data would allow automated alerts to help medical personnel  avoid administering inappropriate drugs. On the other hand, for  such narrative data as clinical notes, unstructured, viewable data  may be sufficient. Achieving even a minimal level of electronic  interoperability would potentially make relevant information  available to clinicians.", "Any level of interoperability depends on the use of agreed-upon  standards to ensure that information can be shared and used. In the  health IT field, standards may govern areas ranging from technical  issues, such as file types and interchange systems, to content issues,  such as medical terminology.   \u25cf  For example, vocabulary standards provide common definitions  and codes for medical terms and determine how information will be  documented for diagnoses and procedures. These standards are  intended to lead to consistent descriptions of a patient\u2019s medical  condition by all practitioners. The use of common terminology helps  in the clinical care delivery process, enables consistent data analysis  from organization to organization, and facilitates transmission of  information. Without such standards, the terms used to describe the  same diagnoses and procedures may vary (the condition known as  hepatitis, for example, may be described as a liver inflammation).  The use of different terms to indicate the same condition or  treatment complicates retrieval and reduces the reliability and  consistency of data.  \u25cf  Another example is messaging standards, which establish the order  and sequence of data during transmission and provide for the  uniform and predictable electronic exchange of data. These  standards dictate the segments in a specific medical transmission.  For example, they might require the first segment to include the  patient\u2019s name, hospital number, and birth date. A series of  subsequent segments might transmit the results of a complete blood  count, dictating one result (e.g., iron content) per segment.  Messaging standards can be adopted to enable intelligible  communication between organizations via the Internet or some  other communications pathway. Without them, the interoperability  of health IT systems may be limited, reducing the data that can be  shared.", "Developing interoperability standards requires the participation of  the relevant stakeholders who will be sharing information. In the  case of health IT, stakeholders include both the public and private  sectors. The public health system is made up of the federal, state,  tribal, and local agencies that may deliver health care services to the  population and monitor its health. Private health system participants  include hospitals, physicians, pharmacies, nursing homes, and other  organizations that deliver health care services to individual patients,  as well as multiple vendors that provide health IT solutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Health IT Efforts Highlight Importance of Establishing Standards, Developing Comprehensive Plans, and Ensuring Privacy", "paragraphs": ["Widespread adoption of health IT has the potential to improve the  efficiency and quality of health care.

In previous work, we identified lessons learned  by U.S. agencies and by other countries from their experiences.  Among other lessons, they reported the need to define and adopt  common standards and terminology to achieve data quality and  consistency, system interoperability, and information protection. In  May 2003, we reported that federal agencies recognized the need for  health care standards and were making efforts to strengthen and  increase their use. However, while they had made progress in  defining standards, they had not met challenges in identifying and  implementing standards necessary to support interoperability  across the health care sector. We stated that until these challenges  were addressed, agencies risked promulgating piecemeal and  disparate systems unable to exchange data with each other when  needed. We recommended that the Secretary of HHS define  activities for ensuring that the various standards-setting  organizations coordinate their efforts and reach further consensus  on the definition and use of standards; establish milestones for  defining and implementing standards; and create a mechanism to  monitor the implementation of standards through the health care  industry.", "HHS implemented this recommendation through the activities of the  Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information  Technology (established within HHS in April 2004). Through the  Office of the National Coordinator, HHS designated three primary  organizations, made up of stakeholders from both the public and  private health care sectors, to play major roles in identifying and  implementing standards and expanding the implementation of  health IT:  \u25cf  The American Health Information Community (now known as the  National eHealth Collaborative) was created by the Secretary of  HHS to make recommendations on how to accelerate the  development and adoption of health IT, including advancing  interoperability, identifying health IT standards, advancing  nationwide health information exchange, and protecting personal  health information. Created in September 2005 as a federal advisory  commission, the organization recently became a nonprofit  membership organization. It includes representatives from both the  public and private sectors, including high-level officials of VA and  other federal and state agencies, as well as health systems, payers,  health professionals, medical centers, community hospitals, patient  advocates, major employers, nonprofit health organizations,  commercial technology providers, and others. Among other things,  the organization has identified health care areas of high priority and  developed \u201cuse cases\u201d for these areas (use cases are descriptions of  events or scenarios, such as Public Health Case Reporting, that  provide the context in which standards would be applicable,  detailing what needs to be done to achieve a specific mission or  goal).   \u25cf  The Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP),  sponsored by the American National Standards Institute and  funded by the Office of the National Coordinator, was established in  October 2005 as a public-private partnership to identify competing  standards for the use cases developed by the American Health  Information Community and to \u201charmonize\u201d the standards. As of  March 2008, nearly 400 organizations representing consumers,  healthcare providers, public health agencies, government agencies,  standards developing organizations, and other stakeholders were  participating in the panel and its committees. The panel also  develops the interoperability specifications that are needed for  implementing the standards. In collaboration with the National  Institute for Standards and Technology, HITSP selected initial  standards to address, among other things, requirements for message  and document formats and for technical networking. Federal  agencies that administer or sponsor federal health programs are  now required to implement these standards, in accordance with an  August 2006 Executive Order.   \u25cf  The Certification Commission for Healthcare Information  Technology is an independent, nonprofit organization that certifies  health IT products, such as electronic health records systems. HHS  entered into a contract with the commission in October 2005 to  develop and evaluate the certification criteria and inspection  process for electronic health records. HHS describes certification as  the process by which vendors\u2019 health IT systems are established to  meet interoperability standards. The certification criteria defined by  the commission incorporate the interoperability standards and  specifications defined by HITSP. The results of this effort are  intended to help encourage health care providers throughout the  nation to implement electronic health records by giving them  assurance that the systems will provide needed capabilities  (including ensuring security and confidentiality) and that the  electronic records will work with other systems without  reprogramming.", "The interconnected work of these organizations to identify and  promote the implementation of standards is important to the overall  effort to advance the use of interoperable health IT. For example,  according to HHS, the HITSP standards are incorporated into the  National Coordinator\u2019s ongoing initiative to enable health care  entities\u2014such as providers, hospitals, and clinical labs\u2014to  exchange electronic health information on a nationwide basis.  Under this initiative, HHS awarded contracts to nine regional and  state health information exchanges as part of its efforts to provide  prototypes of nationwide networks of health information  exchanges. Such exchanges are intended to eventually form a  \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d that is to produce the envisioned Nationwide  Health Information Network (NHIN). According to HHS, the  department planned to demonstrate the experiences and lessons  learned from this work in December 2008, including defining  specifications based upon the work of HITSP and standards  development organizations to facilitate interoperable data exchange  among the participants, testing interoperability against these  specifications, and developing trust agreements among participants  to protect the information exchanged. HHS plans to place the  nationwide health information exchange specifications defined by  the participating organizations, as well as related testing materials,  in the public domain, so that they can be used by other health  information exchange organizations to guide their efforts to adopt  interoperable health IT.", "The products of the federal standards initiatives are also being used  by DOD and VA in their ongoing efforts to achieve the seamless  exchange of health information on military personnel and veterans.  The two departments have committed to the goal of adopting  applicable current and emerging HITSP standards. According to  department officials, DOD is also taking steps to ensure compliance  with standards through certification. To ensure that the electronic  health records produced by the department\u2019s modernized health  information system, AHLTA, are compliant with standards, it is  arranging for certification through the Certification Commission for  Healthcare Information Technology. Both departments are also  participating in the National Coordinator\u2019s standards initiatives. The  involvement of the departments in these activities is an important  mechanism for aligning their electronic health records with  emerging federal standards.", "Federal efforts to implement health IT standards are ongoing and  some progress has been made. However, until agencies are able to  demonstrate interoperable health information exchange between  stakeholders on a broader level, the overall effectiveness of their  efforts will remain unclear. In this regard, continued work on  standards initiatives will remain essential for extending the use of  health IT and fully achieving its potential benefits, particularly as  both information technology and medicine advance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comprehensive Planning with Milestones and Performance Measures Is Essential to Achieving Health IT Goals", "paragraphs": ["Using interoperable health IT to help improve the efficiency and  quality of health care is a complex goal that involves a range of  stakeholders and numerous activities taking place over an expanse  of time; in view of this complexity, it is important to develop  comprehensive plans that are grounded in results-oriented  milestones and performance measures. Without comprehensive  plans, it is difficult to coordinate the many activities under way and  integrate their outcomes. Milestones and performance measures  allow the results of the activities to be monitored and assessed, so  that corrective action can be taken if needed.", "Since it was established in 2004, the Office of the National  Coordinator has pursued a number of health IT initiatives (some of  which we described above), aimed at the expansion of electronic  health records, identification of interoperability standards,  advancement of nationwide health information exchange, and  protection of personal health information. It also developed a  framework for strategic action for achieving an interoperable  national infrastructure for health IT, which was released in 2004. We  have noted accomplishments resulting from these various  initiatives, but we also observed that the strategic framework did  not include the detailed plans, milestones, and performance  measures needed to ensure that the department integrated the  outcomes of its various health IT initiatives and met its overall  goals. Given the many activities to be coordinated and the many  stakeholders involved, we recommended in May 2005 that HHS  define a national strategy for health IT that would include the  necessary detailed plans, milestones, and performance measures,  which are essential to help ensure progress toward the President\u2019s  goal for most Americans to have access to interoperable electronic  health records by 2014. The department agreed with our  recommendation, and in June 2008 it released a four-year strategic  plan. If the plan\u2019s milestones and measures for achieving an  interoperable nationwide infrastructure for health IT are  appropriate and properly implemented, the plan could help ensure  that HHS\u2019s various health IT initiatives are integrated and provide a  useful roadmap to support the goal of widespread adoption of  interoperable electronic health records.", "Across our health IT work at HHS and elsewhere, we have seen  other instances in which planning activities have not been  sufficiently comprehensive. An example is the experience of DOD  and VA, which have faced considerable challenges in project  planning and management in the course of their work on the  seamless exchange of electronic health information. As far back as  2001 and 2002, we noted management weaknesses, such as  inadequate accountability and poor planning and oversight, and  recommended that the departments apply principles of sound  project management. The departments\u2019 efforts to meet the recent  requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2008 provide additional examples of such challenges, raising  concerns regarding their ability to meet the September 2009  deadline for developing and implementing interoperable electronic  health record systems or capabilities. In July 2008, we identified  steps that the departments had taken to establish an interagency  program office and implementation plan, as required. According to  the departments, they intended the program office to play a crucial  role in accelerating efforts to achieve electronic health records and  capabilities that allow for full interoperability, and they had  appointed an Acting Director from DOD and an Acting Deputy  Director from VA. According to the Acting Director, the departments  also have detailed staff and provided temporary space and  equipment to a transition team. However, the newly established  program office was not expected to be fully operational until the  end of 2008\u2014allowing the departments at most 9 months to meet  the deadline for full interoperability.", "Further, we reported other planning and management weaknesses.  For example, the departments developed a DOD/VA Information  Interoperability Plan in September 2008, which is intended to  address interoperability issues and define tasks required to guide  the development and implementation of an interoperable electronic  health record capability. Although the plan included milestones and  schedules, it was lacking many milestones for completing the  activities defined in the plan. Accordingly, we recommended that  the departments give priority to fully establishing the interagency  program office and finalizing the implementation plan. Without an  effective plan and a program office to ensure its implementation, the  risk is increased that the two departments will not be able to meet  the September 2009 deadline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establishing a Consistent Approach to Privacy Protection Is Essential for Encouraging Acceptance and Adoption of Health IT", "paragraphs": ["As the use of electronic health information exchange increases, so  does the need to protect personal health information from  inappropriate disclosure.

The  collaboration selected 33 states and Puerto Rico as locations in  which to perform assessments of organization-level privacy- and  security-related policies and practices that affect interoperable  electronic health information exchange and their bases, including  laws and regulations. As a result of this work, HHS developed and  made available to the public a toolkit to guide health information  exchange organizations in conducting assessments of business  practices, policies, and state laws that govern the privacy and  security of health information exchange.", "However, we reported in January 2007 that HHS initiated these and  other important privacy-related efforts without first defining an  overall approach for protecting privacy. In our report, we identified  key privacy principles and challenges to protecting electronic  personal health information.  \u25cf  Examples of principles that health IT programs and applications  need to address include the uses and disclosures principle, which  provides limits to the circumstances in which an individual\u2019s  protected heath information may be used or disclosed, and the  access principle, which establishes individuals\u2019 rights to review and  obtain a copy of their protected health information in certain  circumstances.   \u25cf  Key challenges include understanding and resolving legal and policy  issues (for example, those related to variations in states\u2019 privacy  laws), ensuring that only the minimum amount of information  necessary is disclosed to only those entities authorized to receive  the information, ensuring individuals\u2019 rights to request access and  amendments to their own health information, and implementing  adequate security measures for protecting health information.", "We recommended that HHS define and implement an overall privacy  approach that identifies milestones for integrating the outcomes of  its privacy-related initiatives, ensures that key privacy principles are  fully addressed, and addresses challenges associated with the  nationwide exchange of health information.", "In September 2008, we reported that HHS had begun to establish an  overall approach for protecting the privacy of personal electronic  health information\u2014for example, it had identified milestones and an  entity responsible for integrating the outcomes of its many privacy- related initiatives.

Specifically, within  its approach, the department had not defined a process to ensure  that the key privacy principles and challenges we had identified  were fully and adequately addressed. This process should include,  for example, steps for ensuring that all stakeholders\u2019 contributions  to defining privacy-related activities are appropriately considered  and that individual inputs to the privacy framework are effectively  assessed and prioritized to achieve comprehensive coverage of all  key privacy principles and challenges. Without such a process,  stakeholders may lack the overall policies and guidance needed to  assist them in their efforts to ensure that privacy protection  measures are consistently built into health IT programs and  applications. Moreover, the department may miss an opportunity to  establish the high degree of public confidence and trust needed to  help ensure the success of a nationwide health information network.  To address these concerns, we recommended in our September  report that HHS include in its overall privacy approach a process for  ensuring that key privacy principles and challenges are completely  and adequately addressed.", "Lacking an overall approach for protecting the privacy of personal  electronic health information, there is reduced assurance that  privacy protection measures will be consistently built into health IT  programs and applications.
