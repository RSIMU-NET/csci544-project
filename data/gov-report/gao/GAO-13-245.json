To address these objectives, GAO obtained information over the 3-year period covering fiscal years 2009 through 2011 on the OIG's budget and staff levels and the reported monetary and nonmonetary accomplishments from this work. GAO obtained similar information reported by the OIGs in all cabinet-level departments. In addition, GAO summarized information on the USDA OIG's oversight coverage reported by audits and investigations, and the quality of the OIG's work as reported by peer reviews performed by other OIGs.

The OIG\u2019s  audits examine the economy and efficiency of USDA programs and  operations, including program results, compliance with applicable laws  and regulations, and fair presentation of financial reports. The USDA OIG  is a member of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and  Efficiency (CIGIE), which was established by the Inspector General  Reform Act of 2008 to address integrity, economy, and effectiveness  issues that transcend individual government agencies; and to increase  the professionalism and effectiveness of personnel in the OIGs.", "USDA is organized by seven mission areas, which are collections of  agencies that work together to achieve strategic goals. (See app. I.)  These mission areas provide leadership on addressing food, agricultural,  and environmental issues; developing agricultural markets; fighting  hunger and malnutrition; encouraging rural development; conserving  natural resources; performing agricultural research; and ensuring  standards of food quality through safeguards and inspections. In fiscal  year 2011, USDA had about 100,000 employees and delivered public  services through its more than 300 programs worldwide. USDA\u2019s mission  areas and administrative offices accounted for USDA\u2019s total budgetary  resources of approximately $182 billion in fiscal year 2011.", "OIG audits are required to be performed in accordance with Government  Auditing Standards provided by the Comptroller General, which  incorporate the professional standards set by the American Institute of  Certified Public Accountants.

In addition, the  OIG\u2019s investigators provide an emergency law enforcement response to  USDA-declared emergencies and suspected incidents of terrorism  affecting USDA-regulated industries, as well as USDA programs,  operations, personnel, and installations, in coordination with federal,  state, and local law enforcement agencies, as appropriate.", "The OIG\u2019s oversight of USDA\u2019s programs and mission areas is guided by  a strategic plan that establishes five goals aligned with the goals of the  department. These goals are to (1) strengthen USDA\u2019s ability to  implement safety and security measures to protect the public health and  agricultural and department resources, (2) reduce program vulnerabilities  and strengthen program integrity in the delivery of benefits to individuals,  (3) support USDA in implementing its management improvement  initiatives, (4) increase the efficiency and effectiveness with which USDA  manages and exercises stewardship over natural resources, and   (5) strive for a highly qualified diverse workforce with the tools and  training necessary to continuously enhance the OIG\u2019s ability to fulfill its  mission.", "The OIG publishes an annual performance plan that sets specific targets  for each of its performance measures for the coming fiscal year; lays out  the audit, investigation, inspection, and management priorities for the  year; and where appropriate, discusses the specific projects that will be  performed and expected initiation dates. OIG investigative officials have  stated that the majority of the OIG\u2019s investigative efforts are reactive.  However, in an effort to be proactive, the investigative office solicits input  from special agents in charge in the field and headquarters to identify  trends, areas of interest, and ways to best allocate resources for  achieving the OIG\u2019s strategic goals. Investigation\u2019s highest priorities are  (1) the health and safety of the American public and USDA employees,  (2) agricultural terrorism threats, and (3) the nation\u2019s food supply.", "In addition, much of the OIG\u2019s work is directed by legislative mandates,  such as the Recovery Act, which provided USDA about $28 billion in  funding involving a number of programs and increased the OIG\u2019s  oversight responsibilities.

Also, in detailed reporting of errors causing improper  payments, USDA reported that of the approximately $5.4 billion in  improper payments estimated in fiscal year 2011, 0.04 percent (or $2.2  million) were due to incomplete paperwork (documentation) in the  programs reporting significant improper payments.", "The OIG\u2019s 2012 audit report on USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2011 compliance with  improper payment reporting requirements concluded, among other things,  that USDA\u2019s component agencies did not consistently assign the  appropriate error category when reporting the causes of improper  payments and that as a result, USDA\u2019s reported amount of improper  payments caused by documentation errors was not accurate. USDA  officials acknowledged that USDA component agencies struggled to  properly categorize the root causes of improper payments into the causal  categories required by OMB. They also concurred with the OIG\u2019s report  recommendations to (1) implement a second-party quality review process  to ensure that improper payment information reported in the PAR is  properly supported, (2) implement controls to ensure that the USDA  agencies consistently and accurately categorize improper payment errors,  and (3) update USDA guidance for determining the cause of an error to  include specific examples related to USDA programs. In addition, USDA  officials stated that they will work with component USDA agency officials  to develop a plan to better understand and consistently categorize the  root causes of USDA\u2019s improper payments.
