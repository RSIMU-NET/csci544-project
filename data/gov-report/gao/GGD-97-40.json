According to information available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in 1992, 16.1 million full-time employees (47 percent) in small private establishments with 99 or fewer employees were covered by at least one retirement program to which their employers contributed. BLS also reported that, in 1993, 22.4 million full-time employees (78 percent) in medium and large private establishments with 100 or more employees were covered by retirement programs. The remaining employees are covered by Social Security, but not by retirement programs to which their employers contribute.", "The designs of private sector retirement programs and their individual plans vary greatly. All programs include Social Security, while some also include defined benefit (DB) plans only, some include defined contribution (DC) plans only, and others include a combination or variation of DB and DC plans.", "DB plans specify formulas for computing benefit amounts that are payable at retirement and are typically based on an employee\u2019s age, length of plan participation, and salary history. In contrast, DC plans specify amounts the employer (and employees, if required) will contribute to the plan. The accumulated contributions, plus investment earnings, constitute the source of retirement benefits from a DC plan. In summary, a DB plan specifies benefit amounts, and a DC plan specifies contribution amounts.", "The Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) are the two largest retirement programs for federal civilian employees. Together, they covered about 2.8 million employees at the beginning of fiscal year 1995. Several other retirement programs for specific groups of federal civilian employees exist, but these programs are much smaller than FERS and CSRS.", "CSRS was established in 1920 and is a DB plan that predates the Social Security system by several years. When the Social Security system was established, Congress decided that employees in CSRS would not be covered by Social Security through their federal employment. CSRS provides employees the option to retire with unreduced benefits at age 55 with 30 years of service, at age 60 with 20 years of service, and at age 62 with 5 years of service.", "At the beginning of fiscal year 1995, CSRS covered about 1.4 million employees and, during that year, paid annuities of almost $38 billion to about 2.3 million retired employees and survivor annuitants. CSRS was closed to new entrants after December 31, 1983. When all covered employees and annuitants are deceased, the program will end. According to OPM actuaries, the program is projected to end about 2070.", "FERS was implemented in 1987 and generally covers those employees who first entered federal service after 1983. The primary impetus for the new program was the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which required all federal employees hired after December 1983 to be covered by Social Security. FERS is a three-part retirement program and includes the following: (1) Social Security, (2) a DB plan, and (3) a DC plan\u2014the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)\u2014to which the government and most employees contribute. In FERS, the minimum optional retirement age (MRA) has been increased from the CSRS\u2019 age 55 to age 57 for FERS employees born after 1969. FERS provides employees with the option to retire with unreduced benefits at their MRA with 30 years of service, at age 60 with 20 years of service, and at age 62 with 5 years of service. FERS continued the CSRS objective of encouraging employees to spend their working careers in federal service by making unreduced benefits available at the MRA only to employees who serve 30 or more years with the government. FERS has another provision that is intended to serve as an incentive for employees to extend their careers beyond the MRA. This provision allows FERS employees who retire at age 62 or older and who have completed at least 20 years of service to receive retirement benefits calculated at a formula that provides a 10-percent greater benefit amount than the formula applied to employees who retire before age 62. However, FERS also provides employees the option to retire with reduced benefits at their MRA with 10 years of service. This provision is not available to employees covered by CSRS.", "At the beginning of fiscal year 1995, FERS covered about 1.4 million employees and, during that year, paid annuities of about $474 million to 48,000 retired employees and survivor annuitants. (See app. I for additional details on CSRS and FERS participants.)", "The government automatically contributes an amount equal to 1 percent of salary each pay period to the TSP for each FERS-covered employee whether or not the employee contributes to the TSP. In addition, FERS employees may contribute up to 10 percent of their salaries and receive government-matching contributions on the first 5 percent. CSRS-covered employees may also contribute up to 5 percent of their salaries to the TSP, but the government does not make matching contributions for them.", "Employees in FERS and the private sector paid 6.2 percent of their salaries to the Social Security system (excluding Medicare) on earnings of up to $65,400 in 1997. FERS-covered employees receive the same Social Security benefits as private sector employees. Social Security benefits payable at retirement are designed to replace a higher proportion of earnings for lower-paid employees than for higher-paid employees (see table II.4)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In response to the requests of the Chairmen of the former Senate Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil Service and the House Subcommittee on Civil Service, our objective in preparing this report was to compare FERS, CSRS, and private sector retirement programs. These retirement programs can be compared in a number of ways. One possible way is to compare the average benefit amounts different programs paid to their retirees in a given year. In this method, the \u201ctypical\u201d benefits paid by each program would be presumed to be indicative of the relative benefits offered by the programs. However, such a comparison approach would ignore differences in ages, salary levels, years of service, and other factors that cause benefit amounts to differ for individual retirees under the programs. Another possible comparison method is to compare program features, such as age and service requirements for retirement eligibility, benefit calculation formulas, salary amounts used in the benefit calculations, and how pension plan benefits are integrated with Social Security benefits. This method would provide useful information on how the various programs are designed, but it would not compare the actual benefit amounts available under the programs.", "Although a number of other comparison methods exist, the method we used in this report was to determine the benefit amounts federal and private sector programs would pay to employees who retire at the same ages with the same years of service and salary histories. In using this method, we avoided the benefit differences that could be caused by variances in individual employees\u2019 circumstances. Also, this method allowed us to (1) compare federal retirement benefits with the average benefits available under private sector programs for employees in the same circumstances and (2) provide a measure of the extent to which differences in the features of federal and private sector retirement programs cause differences in the relative benefit amounts available from the programs. However, this method does not consider what portions of the benefits are financed by the employee and the employer.", "We and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) contracted, at different times, with Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a company that collects benefits data from a wide range of employers, to obtain the information on the features and benefit levels of private sector retirement programs included in this report. Watson Wyatt provided this information from its 1993 COMPARISON database, which was the latest database available at the time our contract was awarded. The database contained information on the retirement programs of primarily large private sector employers and that, by design, excluded employers who had no retirement programs other than Social Security. About one-half of the employers were Watson Wyatt clients; the remainder were from a survey of U.S. employers included in Fortune magazine\u2019s list of 1,000 top employers. Therefore, the features and benefit levels developed from the database could not be generalized to the private sector as a whole.", "The database described the features of 661 employers\u2019 retirement programs. Of these programs, sufficient information was available to allow the contractor to determine the benefit amounts provided by 435 employers\u2019 programs. Of the 435 employers, 61 percent had 2,500 or more employees. Another 22 percent had 1,000 to 2,499 employees; about 15 percent had 999 or fewer employees. The remaining 2 percent of the employers did not provide size information. About 70 percent of the 435 employers provided both defined benefit and defined contribution plans, whereas about 24 percent of the employers had defined contribution plans only and about 6 percent had defined benefit plans only. Appendix I contains more detailed information on the sizes and program designs of the employers in the contractor\u2019s database as well as information on the industries and geographical areas that the employers represented.", "To show how employees with varying ages and years of service would fare under FERS, CSRS, and private sector retirement programs, we asked the contractor to calculate the benefit amounts potentially available to three illustrative employees (i.e., age 55 with 30 years of service, age 62 with 20 years of service, and age 65 with 20 years of service) at three different final salary levels (i.e., $25,000, $40,000, and $60,000). (See app. II for the salary histories and the actual dollar amounts used to calculate the benefit amounts.)", "Because of limited contract funds, we were limited to three illustrative employees. We chose the specific ages and years of service in the following manner: (1) age 55 with 30 years of service since that is the earliest age at which general employees in CSRS can choose to retire,(2) age 62 with 20 years of service since reduced Social Security retirement benefits are first available at that age, and (3) age 65 with 20 years of service since full Social Security benefits are available at this age. We chose 20 years of service to reflect the shortening of federal careers that may occur under FERS.", "Subsequently, CBO contracted with Watson Wyatt to obtain the benefit amounts potentially available to an additional two illustrative employees\u2014age 62 with 30 years of service and age 65 with 30 years of service. CBO chose age 62 with 30 years of service since that was the average for employees who retired under CSRS\u2019 optional retirement provisions in fiscal year 1995; they chose age 65 with 30 years of service to show the effect of the 30-year career on the age 65 comparisons. The results provided under the CBO contract were based on the same methodology and the same assumptions as the results provided under our contract. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the Watson Wyatt database or the benefit amounts calculated. However, the results from its database and calculations were consistent with results we reported in 1985 and with results reported more recently by others in the benefits field. Also, Watson Wyatt\u2019s calculations for FERS and CSRS were consistent with FERS and CSRS calculations we had made.", "The benefit amounts in this report are expressed as \u201creplacement rates.\u201d A replacement rate is the annual retirement benefit amount divided by an employee\u2019s salary amount in the final year of employment. For example, an employee who earned $40,000 in the final year of his or her employment and received retirement benefits of $20,000 a year would have a replacement rate of 50 percent.", "Because the amounts of benefits employees can receive from DC plans are determined in large part by the amounts they and their employers contribute to the plans, we calculated replacement rates for benefits from the FERS and private sector DC plans using the following three levels of assumed employee contributions: (1) employees contributed amounts necessary to receive maximum employer contributions, (2) employees contributed amounts necessary to receive one-half of the maximum employer contributions available, and (3) employees made no contributions to their DC plans.", "To examine the effects of cost-of-living adjustment practices that the retirement programs provide to restore lost purchasing power, we also calculated, in constant dollars, the replacement rates that would be available after 10 and 20 years of retirement.", "The replacement rates presented in chapter 2 of this report are for five illustrative employees at a final salary of $40,000. Appendix III shows the results of the replacement rate analyses for these five employees if they retired at the final salaries of $25,000, $40,000, and $60,000.", "While the relative replacement rates available from federal and private sector retirement programs for the five illustrative employees and salary levels used in our analyses are meaningful measures of how the various programs compare, they do not necessarily represent employees\u2019 actual experiences under the programs. For example, employees in CSRS and FERS, on the average, are considerably older than age 55 when they retire. In fiscal year 1995, employees retiring under CSRS\u2019 optional retirement provisions averaged age 62 with 30 years of service. Employees retiring under FERS\u2019 optional retirement provisions averaged age 63 with 14 years of service. The contractor\u2019s database did not contain information on the ages at which employees choose to retire in the private sector programs.", "In making the replacement-rate calculations, the contractor included the benefit amounts from the defined benefit and defined contribution plans to which employers made contributions as well as the amounts from Social Security. For private sector employers, the contractor made and then averaged separate calculations for each of the 435 private sector retirement programs. Therefore, the replacement rates presented represent averages of the benefits available from all programs of the same design. They do not represent the actual benefits that are available from any individual employer\u2019s retirement program. Rather, some programs will provide replacement rates that are higher than the average, and other programs will provide replacement rates that are lower than the average.", "The benefit amounts calculated were based on a single set of assumptions about salary histories, return on investments, the conversion of defined contribution plan amounts at retirement to annuities, and the rate of inflation after retirement. We had the contractor assume 4.5 percent annual increases in long-term inflation and the CPI and a 7-percent annual return on investments. These are the same assumptions the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) used in its latest actuarial valuation of FERS and CSRS. Because defined contribution plan benefits accumulate as individual account balances, the contractor converted these balances to life annuities using the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality table with a 3-year age setback so they could be compared with the benefits provided by defined benefit plans. We had the contractor assume that all of an employee\u2019s years of service were with the same employer who was the last employer before retirement; and that, for Social Security benefit calculations, employees had no earnings in the years before hire and after retirement.", "We also had the contractor assume that the salary histories for the illustrative employees included base pay only so that they would have a common compensation structure. Although base pay is generally the only type of compensation used in FERS and CSRS to calculate benefit amounts, at least one-half of the 435 programs in the contractor\u2019s database included base pay and other types of compensation, such as overtime pay, bonuses, and commissions, in their benefit calculations. We did not include these other types of compensation in the salary histories because (1) benefit calculations for FERS and CSRS do not include them and (2) the contractor did not collect data on the amounts of compensation, by type, that are typically provided to employees covered by the programs in the database. However, had we assumed the illustrative employees had other types of compensation in addition to the base pay represented in the salary histories, the replacement rates available from FERS and CSRS would have remained the same and the averages of the replacement rates available from the private sector programs could have increased. Also, had we assumed that the rate of salary growth in the last years of employees\u2019 careers had been greater, the replacement rates available from FERS, CSRS, and the private sector programs could have been smaller. However, because FERS and CSRS use the average of the highest 3 years\u2019 salaries in their benefit calculations, while about one-half of the 435 private sector programs use the highest 5 years\u2019 salaries, the replacement rates available from FERS and CSRS would not decrease as much as the private sector replacement rates.", "We believe these assumptions are reasonable because they either were those used by OPM in its latest actuarial valuations, were based on standards used in the benefits field, or were necessary to provide a common basis of comparison. However, different assumptions would change the relative magnitude of results between programs and the absolute magnitude over all programs. It could also be possible in some circumstances to change the relative rankings between programs. For example, an assumed annual return of 9.5 percent, rather than 7.0 percent, on DC plan investments could mean that a 30-percent increase in replacement rates would be available from DC plans after 20 years of service. Over 30 years, a 9.5 percent annual return could generate a 50-percent increase in DC plan benefits.", "To calculate the benefit amounts 10 and 20 years after retirement, the contractor needed estimates of the cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) provided in the DB plan portion of private sector employers\u2019 programs. Wide variation exists in how COLAs are provided. The adjustments tend to be ad hoc, and their size and frequency tend to vary by employer size. The contractor routinely tracks COLAs given by 50 large companies, but neither we nor the contractor are aware of any data sources that accurately track COLAs given by private sector DB plans, overall. In the absence of more complete data on DB plan COLAs in the private sector, we had the contractor use the 50 companies\u2019 COLA experiences to represent all private sector DB plans in calculating replacement rates available from private sector programs 10 and 20 years after retirement.", "We limited the federal and private sector benefit comparisons presented in this report to the benefits available to career employees under the \u201coptional\u201d or \u201cregular\u201d retirement provisions of employers\u2019 retirement programs. Accordingly, we did not include the following in our comparisons: other program provisions, such as early involuntary retirement, disability retirement, or survivor benefits; special benefits that are available in FERS and CSRS, such as the benefits that are provided to Members of Congress and congressional staff, law enforcement officers and firefighters, and air traffic controllers; extra benefits that private sector programs may provide to top executives; spousal or children\u2019s benefits that may be paid by Social Security in addition to benefit amounts paid to retirees.", "Our findings may have been different if another private sector database had been used in the benefit comparisons because our contractor\u2019s database could not be generalized to the private sector as a whole. Over one-half of the employers in the contractor\u2019s database have 2,500 or more employees. A number of small employers are in the database, but not in proportion to their overall representation among private sector employers with retirement programs in 1993. About 99 percent of the employers with retirement programs in 1993 had fewer than 2,500 employees. Also, about 24 percent of the employers in the contractor\u2019s database had retirement programs that included DC plans only. In an earlier report, we described the retirement program designs of all U.S. private sector employers who offered pensions in 1993. Overall, a higher proportion (88 percent) of these employers sponsored only DC plans than the employers in the contractor\u2019s database. However, the percentage of all employers with 2,500 or more employees that sponsored both DB and DC plans increased from 1984 to 1993, and nearly one-half of the employers with 2,500 or more employees sponsored DB plans in 1993.", "We did our review in Washington, D.C., from October 1995 to January 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested comments on a draft of this report from Watson Wyatt Worldwide and the heads of OPM and the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (the Thrift Board) or their designees. The Research Actuary of Watson Wyatt\u2019s Research and Information Center in Washington, D.C., and the Thrift Board\u2019s Director of External Affairs provided us with oral comments.

These factors include (1) the ages at which employees retire and at which programs provide unreduced benefits, (2) the extent to which employees and employers contribute to the DC plans that are integral components of FERS and most private sector programs, and (3) the impact of inflation and cost-of-living adjustments provided through the retirement programs. In general, when employees retire before age 62, the largest benefits are available from FERS and the smallest benefits are available from the private sector programs. The benefits available from CSRS fall between those available from FERS and the private sector programs.", "However, the comparative benefits are quite different for employees who retire at age 62 or older. For retirees at these older ages, FERS continues to make the largest benefits available, but these benefits are just slightly more than the average for private sector programs that, like FERS, include both DB and DC plans. The benefits that are available at age 62 or older from the private sector programs that include DB or DC plans only are quite similar, but these benefits are smaller than the benefits available from FERS and the average benefits available from the private sector programs that include both DB and DC plans.", "CSRS benefits for employees retiring at age 62 or older with 20 years of service are smaller than FERS benefits and the average benefits available from private sector programs, regardless of program design because (1) CSRS benefits are the same for specific years of service, regardless of age, and (2) CSRS-covered employees receive no Social Security benefits from their federal employment. For employees who retire at age 62 or older with 30 years of service, CSRS benefits are still smaller than the benefits available from FERS and the private sector programs that include both DB and DC plans, but the CSRS benefits become similar to the benefits available from private sector programs with DB or DC plans only.", "The level at which employees contribute to their DC plans is a significant factor in determining the benefits that are available from FERS and the private sector programs that incorporate DC plans. Considerably smaller benefits are available from such programs when employees contribute lesser amounts than are necessary to receive maximum employer contributions.", "In this chapter, we present the replacement rates available from FERS, CSRS, and private sector programs for five illustrative employees who are (1) age 55 with 30 years of service, (2) age 62 with 20 years of service, (3) age 65 with 20 years of service, (4) age 62 with 30 years of service, and (5) age 65 with 30 years of service and who retire with a final salary of $40,000. Unless otherwise indicated, the replacement rates are calculated using the assumption that employees in FERS and the private sector programs that include DC plans contributed amounts that are necessary to receive maximum employer contributions to their DC plans. However, separate replacement-rate calculations are also presented for each illustrative employee to show the effects of lower amounts of employee contributions to DC plans. The effects of cost-of-living adjustment practices on retirement program replacement rates after 10 and 20 years of retirement are also analyzed in this chapter."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Comparative Replacement Rates at Retirement", "paragraphs": ["With a replacement rate of 65 percent, FERS ranks first in a comparison of available benefits for employees who retire at age 55 with 30 years of service.

The private sector programs that have DB or DC plans only have available benefits averaging less than 30 percent of final salary. (See fig. 2.1.)", "The availability of unreduced DB plan benefits in FERS and CSRS for employees retiring at age 55 with 30 years of service is an advantage over most DB plans in the private sector because private sector plans usually impose reductions in accrued benefits for employees retiring at age 55, regardless of their number of years of service. Moreover, Social Security retirement benefits are not available to private sector retirees until they reach age 62, whereas the FERS\u2019 DB plan provides an annuity supplement equal to the estimated Social Security benefits that a retiree earned while employed by the federal government and that the retiree could receive at age 62.", "Because Social Security retirement benefits are available to retirees in FERS and the private sector programs at age 62 or older, the relative positions of the federal and private sector programs, in terms of replacement rates, change at age 62. Specifically, when the employee retires at age 62 with 20 years of service, FERS is no longer the dominant program, and CSRS drops from the second position to the last position. The FERS replacement rate of 66 percent is higher than the 63-percent average replacement rate of the private sector programs with both DB and DC plans. Private sector programs that include either a DB plan or a DC plan, but not both, have available replacement rates of about 40 percent, which is higher than the CSRS rate of 36 percent. (See fig. 2.2.)", "When an employee retires at age 65 with 20 years of service, the relative positions of the programs, in terms of replacement rates, are the same as at age 62, but the available replacement rates for all programs, except CSRS, are higher than at age 62. At age 65, replacement rates available to employees under FERS and the average of the private sector programs with both DB and DC plans are almost the same, 71.1 and 70.5 percent, respectively. For private sector programs with either a DB or DC plan, the average available replacement rate increases to almost 50 percent. The CSRS replacement rate remains the same at 36 percent. (See fig. 2.3.)", "Several factors cause replacement rates for FERS and private sector programs, on average, to increase between the ages of 62 and 65. Social Security benefits are reduced for employees who retire before age 65. Similarly, some private sector DB plans impose reductions in accrued benefits when employees retire before age 65. Finally, DC plan benefit amounts are larger at age 65 because account balances are paid out over shorter periods when employees retire at older ages. These factors do not apply to CSRS because (1) CSRS benefit amounts are not determined by employees\u2019 ages upon retirement at age 55 or older, (2) CSRS employees are not covered by Social Security through their federal employment, and (3) CSRS employees do not receive any employer-paid DC plan benefits. Therefore, after age 55, CSRS replacement rates are the same for all employees with the same years of service, regardless of the ages at which they retire.", "When an employee retires at age 62 or older with 30 years of service, the relative positions of the federal and private sector programs, in terms of replacement rates, change again. FERS and the private sector programs that include both DB and DC plans remain in the top two positions, but CSRS is no longer in the last position. The CSRS replacement rate moves just ahead of the averages of the replacement rates available from programs with DB or DC plans only. Some of the change in the CSRS position is due to the graduated accrual rates used for calculating benefit amounts under CSRS.", "For a 30-year career, 20 years are calculated at the highest rate; while for a 20-year career, only 10 years are calculated at the highest rate. Therefore, a 30-year career under CSRS yields a greater benefit than does a 20-year career.", "When the employee retires at age 62 with 30 years of service, CSRS has a replacement rate of 53 percent; while the averages of the replacement rates for the DB and DC plans only programs are about 50 percent.

The amounts that employees contribute to their DC plans have a major influence on the benefits they could receive from their DC plans. For example, employees retiring at age 62 with 30 years of service under FERS could expect to receive annual benefits of about 30 percent of their final salary from their TSP accounts if they had received the maximum employer contributions by contributing 5 percent of their salary to the TSP throughout their 30-year career.

Social Security retirement benefits are increased each year by the percentage increase in the CPI, which is used for inflation adjustment purposes. However, in the DB plan portion of private sector employers\u2019 programs, wide variation exists in how COLAs are provided. The adjustments tend to be ad hoc, and their size and frequency tend to vary by employer size. The contractor we used routinely tracks the COLAs given by 50 large companies, but neither we nor the contractor are aware of any data sources that accurately track COLAs given by private sector DB plans, overall. Using COLA data from the 50 companies, the contractor determined that employees who retired from the companies in 1985, had received, on average, a 4-percent benefit increase by 1994. These cumulative COLAs offset about 10 percent of the CPI increase during the 10-year period. For employees who retired in 1975, cumulative COLAs averaging 30 percent were given, which was about 15 percent of the CPI increase during the 20-year period from 1975 to 1994.

The adjustment is 2 percent if the CPI increase is between 2 and 3 percent. If the CPI increase is 3 percent or greater, the adjustment is equal to the CPI increase minus 1 percent.", "Like Social Security, the law calls for CSRS benefits to be adjusted annually by the percentage increase in the CPI. However, since 1980, several legislative provisions have often reduced, delayed, or skipped the scheduled CSRS COLAs. For example, in 1983, the CSRS COLA was delayed 1 month and was less than the increase in the CPI for nondisabled retirees under age 62; the 1984 COLA was delayed for 9 months; in 1986, the President and Congress decided not to grant any COLAs to federal retirees that year; and in fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996, the COLA payments were delayed until April of each of those years instead of the scheduled January payment dates. In 1995, we reported that the CSRS COLA delays and reductions during the 10-year period from 1985 to 1994 had caused the COLAs to cover about 80 percent of the CPI increase for the period. In figures 2.16 through 2.20, the bars labeled CSRS I represent the statutory policy of full adjustments for CSRS, and the bars labeled CSRS II represent the actual COLA practices during 1985 through 1994 when 80 percent of the CPI increase was covered.", "Because of the full COLAs provided for CSRS I, its replacement rates remain the same in constant dollars, regardless of the length of retirement. In contrast, the replacement rates available from FERS and private sector programs decline in constant dollars during retirement because only the Social Security portion of these programs is fully adjusted. Similarly, the limitations on COLAs under CSRS II cause retirees to lose purchasing power, or receive declining replacement rates, during their retirement years.", "While FERS makes greater immediate benefits available than CSRS when employees retire at age 55 with 30 years of service, FERS\u2019 smaller COLAscause its replacement rate to fall behind the CSRS I replacement rate after 20 years of retirement (i.e., the effective FERS replacement rate is 65 percent at retirement, declines to 57 percent after 10 years, and further declines to 49 percent after 20 years in comparison to the constant CSRS I replacement rate of 53 percent at retirement and thereafter).

The FERS replacement rate does not show an increase at 10 years after retirement because the FERS annuity supplement ceases at age 62 when Social Security retirement benefits are available. The FERS replacement rate for employees who retire at age 55 with 30 years of service also exceeds the CSRS II replacement rate after 20 years of retirement because, together, the FERS\u2019 higher replacement rate at retirement and the increases provided by COLAs in the FERS\u2019 DB plan and Social Security keep its replacement rate just above CSRS II with its COLA that covers 80 percent of the increase in the CPI.", "When retirement occurs at age 62 or older, Social Security retirement benefits are available immediately upon retirement for FERS and private sector retirees.

For example, one DB plan may use employees\u2019 5-year salary averages in benefit calculations, and a second DB plan may use employees\u2019 3-year salary averages. In this case, the salary average feature in the second plan appears better because it usually would produce higher salary averages.

CSRS imposes no such reductions; but it does permit employees to retire at age 55 under regular retirement provisions only if they have 30 or more years of service. Therefore, CSRS limits age 55 retirement eligibility to long-term, career employees. The average private sector program has no similar design feature, although the average program allows employees to retire on reduced benefits at age 55 with fewer than 30 years of service\u2014a feature that does not exist in CSRS. Most federal employees do not have 30 years of service by the time they are age 55, and, of those who do, many elect to retire later. As a result, the average CSRS retirement age is about 62.", "The lack of Social Security coverage for employees in CSRS is a major reason why the private sector programs in the contractor\u2019s database can provide higher replacement rates to employees who retire at age 62 or older. Moreover, CSRS employees do not participate in a DC plan to which their employer contributes. As this report shows, most private sector programs in the contractor\u2019s database included DC plans to which their employers contribute and from which employees can earn significant benefit amounts.", "CSRS was closed to new entrants at the end of 1983 and was replaced by FERS\u2014a completely restructured federal retirement program. FERS follows the model used by most of the private sector employers in the contractor\u2019s database: a three-part retirement package that includes Social Security, a DB plan, and a DC plan. As our findings illustrate, the FERS benefits from Social Security, the DB plan, and the government\u2019s automatic 1-percent contribution to the TSP alone are smaller than CSRS benefits for employees who retire at age 55. However, these FERS benefits can be greater than CSRS benefits for employees who retire at age 62 or older, even though FERS employees generally contribute the same total percentage of their salaries toward the cost of these benefits as CSRS employees contribute. By contributing to their DC plan, FERS employees can obtain greater benefits than are available from CSRS at all ages, but they will pay more to receive the greater benefit amounts.", "FERS continued CSRS\u2019 objective of encouraging employees to spend their working careers in federal service by making unreduced benefits available at age 55 only to employees who serve 30 or more years with the government. Consistent with this objective, FERS also provides an annuity supplement to career employees who retire before Social Security benefits are otherwise available. This feature is not commonly found in private sector programs and, along with the lack of reductions in accrued DB plan benefits for age 55 retirees in federal programs, the feature causes FERS replacement rates available at age 55 to exceed the replacement rates available from the private sector programs of all designs in the contractor\u2019s database. However, as with CSRS, FERS employees generally have been older than age 55 when they retired. FERS was designed to encourage, but not to require, longer careers by raising the age of earliest retirement eligibility to age 57 for employees born after 1969 and by increasing the DB plan benefit formula for employees who continue working to at least age 62.", "For employees who retire at age 62 or older, the total benefits available at retirement from all three parts of FERS are quite comparable to the average benefits available from private sector programs in the contractor\u2019s database that also have DB and DC plans in addition to Social Security. Because the COLA provision in the FERS\u2019 DB plan provides greater increases in benefits over time than do private sector DB plans on average, FERS retirees will fare better in times of high inflation when increases in the CPI will be greater.

We have modified the executive summary to specifically mention that many private sector programs use overtime, bonuses, or commissions in their benefit calculations.
