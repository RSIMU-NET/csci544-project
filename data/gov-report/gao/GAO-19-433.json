CMS enters into agreements with state survey agencies to conduct surveys of the state's homes and to investigate complaints and incidents. GAO analysis of CMS data found that, while relatively rare, abuse deficiencies cited in nursing homes more than doubled, increasing from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017, with the largest increase in severe cases. GAO also reviewed a representative sample of abuse deficiency narratives from 2016 through 2017. Physical and mental/verbal abuse occurred most often in nursing homes, followed by sexual abuse, and staff were more often the perpetrators of the abuse deficiencies cited. CMS cannot readily access information on abuse or perpetrator type in its data and, therefore, lacks key information critical to taking appropriate actions.", "GAO also found gaps in CMS oversight, including:", "Gaps in CMS processes that can result in delayed and missed referrals. Federal law requires nursing home staff to immediately report to law enforcement and the state survey agency reasonable suspicions of a crime that results in serious bodily injury to a resident. However, there is no equivalent requirement that the state survey agency make a timely referral for complaints it receives directly or through surveys it conducts. CMS also does not conduct oversight to ensure that state survey agencies are correctly referring abuse cases to law enforcement.", "Insufficient information collected on facility-reported incidents. CMS has not issued guidance on what nursing homes should include when they self-report abuse incidents to the state survey agencies. Officials from all of the state survey agencies in GAO's review said the facility-reported incidents can lack information needed to prioritize investigations and may result in state survey agencies not responding as quickly as needed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that CMS: require state survey agencies to submit data on abuse and perpetrator type; require state survey agencies to immediately refer to law enforcement any suspicion of a crime; and develop guidance on what abuse information nursing homes should self-report.

These residents often have physical  and cognitive limitations that can make them particularly vulnerable to  abuse. Abuse of nursing home residents can occur in many forms\u2014 including physical, mental, verbal, and sexual\u2014and can be committed by  staff, residents, or others in the nursing home. Little is known about the  full scope of nursing home abuse, as incidents of abuse may be  underreported. Any incident of abuse is a serious occurrence and could  result in potentially devastating consequences for residents, including  lasting mental anguish, serious injury, or death.", "Federal law mandates that nursing homes receiving Medicare and  Medicaid payments must ensure that residents are free from abuse. To  help ensure this, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),  an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  defines the quality standards that nursing homes must meet in order to  participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To monitor  compliance with these standards, CMS enters into agreements with  agencies in each state government\u2014known as state survey agencies\u2014 and oversees the work the state survey agencies do. This work includes  conducting required evaluations\u2014referred to as standard surveys\u2014 approximately once each year of all nursing homes in a state that  participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, as well as investigating  both complaints from the public and facility-reported incidents regarding  resident care or safety. When a state survey agency finds a nursing  home out of compliance with a federal standard, the home receives a  deficiency citation, also known as a deficiency.", "In addition to state survey agencies, other state-based agencies are  charged with protecting nursing home residents from abuse. These  agencies\u2019 roles, missions, and standards of evidence for determining  whether or not abuse occurred can vary by state. For example, Adult  Protective Services may also help ensure nursing home residents receive  quality care in a safe environment by investigating allegations of abuse.  Law enforcement can also play a role in protecting nursing home  residents from abuse and, in addition, Medicaid Fraud Control Units  (MFCU) in each state are tasked with investigating and prosecuting a  variety of health care-related crimes.", "We have previously reported on problems in nursing home quality,  including problems protecting residents from abuse and weaknesses in  CMS\u2019s oversight. For example, in multiple reports dating back to 1998, we  have identified weaknesses in federal and state activities designed to  correct quality problems in nursing homes. Specifically, in a 2002 report,  we found that CMS needed to do more to protect nursing home residents  from abuse and made five recommendations to help CMS facilitate the  reporting, investigation, and prevention of abuse in nursing homes. More  recently, in April 2019 we reported that CMS had failed to address gaps in  federal oversight of nursing home abuse investigations in Oregon that  persisted for at least 15 years until the Oregon state survey agency  changed its practices in October 2018. Further, a 2017 HHS Office of the  Inspector General (OIG) report found that CMS does not have adequate  procedures in place to ensure incidents of potential abuse in nursing  homes are identified and reported. In addition, news reports have  described concerning examples of incidents where nursing home  residents were abused.", "You asked us to review abuse of nursing home residents including,  among other issues, what CMS data reveal about the prevalence of  abuse and the extent to which CMS oversees nursing homes. In this  report, we:  1.  determine the trends and types of abuse occurring in nursing homes  2.  describe the risk factors for abuse and challenges facing stakeholder  agencies involved in investigating abuse in nursing homes, and  3.  evaluate CMS oversight intended to ensure that nursing home  residents are free from abuse.", "To determine the trends and types of abuse occurring in nursing homes in  recent years, we reviewed CMS guidance and analyzed CMS data from  2013 through 2017, which represented the most recent data for a 5-year  period at the time of our review. First, we reviewed the CMS State  Operations Manual in effect during our period of review to determine the  federal standards and associated deficiency codes related to resident  abuse. We focused our analysis on the deficiency code to be used by  state surveyors when a nursing home fails to keep a resident free from  abuse, which encompasses mental/verbal, sexual, or physical abuse.", "We analyzed data provided by CMS to identify the number and severity of  abuse deficiencies cited by surveyors in all 50 states and Washington  D.C. between 2013 and 2017. We then tracked (1) whether these abuse  deficiencies originated from a standard survey, complaint investigation, or  facility-reported incident investigation and (2) the enforcement actions  associated with these abuse deficiencies. Furthermore, we determined  the number of nursing homes that had one or more abuse deficiencies  from 2013 through 2017, as well as the homes with repeated abuse  deficiencies in multiple years and the characteristics of those homes.", "Finally, because abuse and perpetrator type are not readily identifiable in  CMS\u2019s data, we identified this information by reviewing a randomly  selected representative sample of 400 abuse deficiency narratives written  by state surveyors from 2016 through 2017 that describe the  substantiated abuse. Specifically, two separate reviewers independently  analyzed the text of each narrative and determined if the abuse was  physical, mental/verbal, or sexual and whether the perpetrators were  staff, residents, or others based on narrative descriptions written by state  surveyors. Any disagreements between the two reviewers were  resolved by a third independent reviewer. We assessed the reliability of  each of the datasets by checking for missing values and obvious errors  and discussing them with CMS officials who were knowledgeable about  the data. In the course of this assessment, we found some data  limitations. Specifically, CMS officials told us that some state survey  agencies may not have entered all facility-reported incidents into the CMS  database while other state survey agencies did. In a recent 2019 report,  we also found that the Oregon state survey agency was not entering all  abuse-related complaints or facility-reported incidents into the CMS  database\u2014a problem that could exist in other states. In addition, CMS  officials told us that it is possible there are additional incidents that may not have been represented in the abuse deficiency data during the period  of our review. Specifically, CMS officials noted that some incidents  resulting from resident altercations\u2014particularly those that do not show a  willful intent to harm\u2014may not be cited as an abuse deficiency by some  state survey agencies. We therefore consider the number of abuse  deficiencies that resulted from complaints or facility-reported incidents to  be a conservative estimate. After reviewing the possible limitations of  these data, we determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this reporting objective. (See app. I for additional details on  the scope and methodology of our data analyses.)", "To describe the risk factors for abuse and challenges facing stakeholder  agencies involved in investigating abuse in nursing homes, we  interviewed officials from a non-generalizable sample of five state survey  agencies\u2014Delaware, Georgia, Ohio, Oregon, and Virginia. We selected  these states for variation in geography, whether the states\u2019 Adult  Protective Services has oversight over nursing home residents, the  number of nursing homes in each state, CMS regional oversight, and  congressional interest. In addition to speaking to officials from state  survey agencies, we interviewed other stakeholders in these states,  including officials from each state\u2019s long-term care ombudsmen, law  enforcement, MFCUs, and, when appropriate, Adult Protective Services.  We also visited nursing homes and spoke to administrators and clinical  staff in each state. We selected these nursing homes to obtain variation in  factors such as bed count and profit or not-for-profit status. We asked  stakeholders to describe the risk factors for abuse and the challenges  involved in investigating abuse in nursing homes. In addition, we  interviewed officials from national organizations with knowledge of  nursing home abuse issues including the American Health Care  Association, National Consumer Voice, and the National Adult Protective  Services Association to learn more about the risk factors for abuse and  the challenges facing stakeholders involved in investigating abuse.", "To evaluate CMS oversight intended to ensure that nursing home  residents are free from abuse, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  CMS guidance, such as the State Operations Manual, that establishes  CMS and state survey agency oversight responsibilities for nursing  homes. We also interviewed officials at the CMS central office, the CMS regional offices that oversee the five state survey agencies in our review,  and the five state survey agencies themselves.

State survey agencies assess nursing homes using (1)  recurring standard surveys and (2) as-needed investigations.", "Standard surveys. State survey agencies are required by federal  law to perform unannounced, on-site standard surveys of every  nursing home receiving Medicare or Medicaid payment at least  every 15 months, with a statewide average frequency of every 12  months. These surveys are a comprehensive assessment  designed to determine whether nursing homes are complying with  Medicare and Medicaid quality standards.", "Investigations. In addition to standard surveys, state survey  agencies are required by federal law to investigate (1) complaints  submitted by residents, family members, friends, physicians, and  nursing home staff; and (2) \u201cfacility-reported incidents,\u201d including  incidents involving abuse of residents, that are self-reported by the  nursing homes. State survey agencies review the information  provided through these complaints and incidents and determine if  an on-site investigation is required. During this unannounced  investigation, the state surveyors assess available evidence to  determine whether the allegation can be substantiated. These  investigations offer the state survey agency the opportunity to  identify and correct care problems in a more timely manner than  through the standard surveys.", "If a surveyor determines that a nursing home violated a federal standard  during a survey or investigation, then a deficiency code specific to that  standard is cited. For instance, one deficiency code for abuse of residents  encompasses mental/verbal, sexual, or physical abuse; while a few  additional deficiency codes encompass abuse-related issues, such as a  failure by the nursing home to train staff on issues related to abuse. Cited  deficiencies are then classified into categories according to scope (the  number of residents potentially affected) and severity (the potential for or  occurrence of harm to residents). (See table 1.) State survey agencies  are required to enter data about deficiencies into CMS\u2019s survey database.  For most deficiencies, the nursing home is required to prepare a plan of  correction, and, depending on the scope and severity of the deficiency,  surveyors may re-visit the facility to ensure that the nursing home has  implemented its plan and corrected the deficiency. In any instances  where surveyors substantiate the occurrence of resident abuse, the state  survey agency is required to refer the case to three entities: 1) local law  enforcement; 2) the MFCU, if appropriate; and 3) the state\u2019s nurse aide  registry or other applicable professional licensure authority.", "When nursing homes are cited with deficiencies, federal enforcement  actions\u2014or penalties\u2014can be imposed to encourage homes to make  corrections.

Depending on the  scope and severity of the deficiency cited, the CMS regional office may  impose certain enforcement actions so that they are implemented  immediately. However, for other enforcement actions, the regional office  may provide the nursing home with an opportunity to correct the  deficiencies, which, if corrected before the scheduled effective date, can  result in the penalty not being implemented.

While abuse deficiencies are relatively  rare\u2014they comprise less than 1 percent of the total deficiencies in each  of the years we examined\u2014they became more common over the 5-year  period. Specifically, the number of abuse deficiencies cited more than  doubled\u2014from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017 (a 103.5 percent increase).  This trend for the abuse deficiencies is in contrast to the trend for all  deficiencies, which decreased about 1 percent between 2013 and 2017.

Specifically, 42.6 percent of the 875 abuse deficiencies  were categorized as causing actual harm or posing immediate jeopardy to  residents in 2017, compared to 31.9 percent of the 430 abuse  deficiencies in 2013. (See fig. 2.)", "In examining the types of survey or investigations conducted to identify  abuse deficiencies, we found that, from 2013 to 2017, the majority (about  two-thirds in each year) were identified through either a complaint  investigation or facility-reported incident investigation. In contrast, for all  types of deficiencies, we found the inverse\u2014the vast majority were  identified through a standard survey. This demonstrates the unique and  significant role that complaint and facility-reported incident investigations  have in identifying abuse deficiencies, because they allow for the  identification and correction of abuse in a more timely manner than a  standard survey. In fact, for the deficiencies for which we were able to  identify the source, the percentage of abuse deficiencies identified  through facility-reported incident investigations increased from 42.3  percent of the 430 abuse deficiencies in 2013 to 47.4 percent of the 875  abuse deficiencies in 2017.

Specifically, for each year from 2013 through 2017, we found that  about one-third of abuse deficiencies had an enforcement action imposed  but not implemented, and less than 8 percent of abuse deficiencies had  enforcement actions that were implemented against the nursing home.  This was fairly consistent over the 5-year period. For example, in 2017,  of the 875 abuse deficiencies cited, 275 (31.4 percent) resulted in  enforcement actions that were imposed but not implemented and 65 (7.4  percent) had enforcement actions that were implemented against the  nursing home. Furthermore, for abuse deficiencies cited at the most  severe levels\u2014that is, those causing actual harm or immediate jeopardy  to residents\u2014a smaller percentage of the deficiencies had an  enforcement action imposed but not implemented compared to all abuse  deficiencies, but a larger percentage were implemented.

In 2013, 394  nursing homes (2.7 percent of all surveyed nursing homes) had at least  one abuse deficiency compared to 821 nursing homes (5.6 percent of all  surveyed nursing homes) in 2017. A nursing home may have more than  one abuse deficiency cited in a single year, such as from a standard  survey early in the year and then a complaint investigation later in the  year. We found that in 2013, of the 394 nursing homes that had a total of  430 abuse deficiencies cited, 85 of the homes had two or more abuse  deficiencies that year. In 2017, of the 821 nursing homes that had 875  total abuse deficiencies cited, 155 had two or more that year.", "Further, across the 5-year period, we found that a small proportion of all  nursing homes with abuse deficiencies had them in multiple consecutive  years. Specifically, across all years, 2,214 total unique nursing homes  (13.6 percent of all surveyed nursing homes) had at least one abuse  deficiency.

In addition  to noting that cognitively impaired residents may be at an increased  risk of abuse, some stakeholders said that some cognitively impaired  residents may be more likely to be perpetrators of abuse as their  condition can have behavioral symptoms, such as physical  aggressiveness.", "Residents mixed with widely different age groups. Stakeholders in  four of the five states also noted that elderly nursing home residents  who are mixed with widely differing age groups, such as young adults  with mental illness, may be at a higher risk for incidents of abuse due  to the different characteristics of these groups. Combining these two  populations, which have differing needs, can also be challenging for  staff. For example, staff may have more experience caring for elderly  residents with complex needs, such as dementia, and they may not  have the necessary skills or training to care for needs of younger  residents, who require other types of complex care. This can create a  stressful environment for staff, which is a risk factor for staff as  potential perpetrators of abuse. Two stakeholders noted that younger  residents who may have mental illness can have conflicts with older  and frailer residents, potentially leading to abusive incidents between  residents.", "Nursing home staffing characteristics. Stakeholders we interviewed in  each of our five selected states noted that nursing homes with insufficient  staffing, inadequate staff training, and inadequate staff screening may be  at risk for abuse.", "Nursing homes with insufficient staff. Stakeholders in each of the  five states said that nursing homes with insufficient staff may be at  risk for abuse because there may not be enough staff attending to the  needs of residents. Stakeholders noted that nursing homes have  faced challenges hiring and retaining qualified staff and that, as a  result, existing staff can feel overworked, stressed, or exhausted,  which can lead to abusive behaviors. Staffing issues are not just risk  factors for staff as perpetrators of abuse, but they can also limit a staff  member\u2019s ability to identify and report abuse. For example, insufficient  staffing may mean that there are not enough available staff to notice  signs of abuse in a timely fashion, such as noticing a resident\u2019s  bruises before they heal.", "Nursing homes with inadequate staff training on abuse.", "Inadequate staff training on abuse was noted by stakeholders we  interviewed in four of the five states as a risk factor for abuse  because; for example, staff may not know how to diffuse challenging  situations with residents and identify and report abuse. As  previously noted, recognizing abuse can be challenging and, even  when abuse is identified, it is often not reported. Officials from all of  the nursing homes that we visited said that they provide training to  their staff on abuse, including on defining abuse, identifying or  detecting different types of abuse, and reporting abuse. Staff  members we spoke with at one nursing home said that, not only are  they trained to look for physical signs of abuse, such as bruising, but  they are also trained to observe changes in behavior that may be  warning signs for abuse, such as a resident suddenly withdrawing  from group activities. Staff at another nursing home said that they are  also taught to ask another staff member for assistance when they are  feeling frustrated or stressed by caring for a particular resident. In  contrast, staff at another nursing home noted the challenges of not  having these types of resources and said they are needed at their  facility.", "Nursing homes with inadequate staff screening. Stakeholders in  three of our five states said that inadequate staff screening can be a  risk factor for abuse. Some stakeholders said that a thorough  background screening can be time consuming. Further, because staff  screening through background checks and the nurse aide registry is  not coordinated across the country, there are gaps that could enable  individuals who committed crimes in one state to obtain employment  at a nursing home in another state, a concern that we previously  reported. Staff from a nursing home we visited said the prevention of  abuse \u201cstarts with hiring the right staff\u201d and noted the importance of  conducting background checks and checking references for  prospective employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Underreporting of Abuse, Cognitive Impairment of Victims, Lack of Nursing Home Cooperation, and Lack of Agency Coordination Pose Challenges for Abuse Investigations", "paragraphs": ["The key challenges for abuse investigations most frequently identified by  stakeholder groups in the five states we reviewed were underreporting of  abuse, cognitive impairment of victims, lack of cooperation from nursing  homes, and lack of agency coordination. (See table 5 for a description  of these challenges.) Officials we interviewed from national organizations  with knowledge of abuse in nursing homes also noted some of these  same challenges.", "Underreporting of abuse. Stakeholders in each of the five states in our  review noted that abuse in nursing homes may be underreported because  residents or their families feel uncomfortable or fear retaliation from  nursing home staff. For example, residents who were sexually abused  may feel ashamed or embarrassed to report these incidents. In addition,  residents may fear retaliation by the nursing home staff on whom they  depend, which might include substandard care, exclusion from activities,  or even eviction from the home. A fear of retaliation can also extend to  nursing home staff, who may witness abuse by another staff member, but  may be afraid to report it out of fear that they will lose their jobs or that  they will face retaliation from co-workers. This underreporting creates  challenges for investigators, who are unable to investigate if they do not  know that abuse has occurred.", "Cognitive impairment of victims. Stakeholders in each of the five states  in our review said that victims with cognitive impairment may not be able  to give statements regarding the abuse or may not be considered reliable  witnesses. For example, residents with dementia may not be able to  remember the details of an abusive incident, and their memory of the  details may deteriorate over the course of an investigation. Or, residents  with dementia may report abuse that stems from traumatic memories  from an incident that occurred earlier in their lives. One stakeholder said  this can be a challenge for investigations because they do not know how  much they can rely on a cognitively impaired resident\u2019s statement, making  it difficult for them to corroborate an abuse allegation. However, one  stakeholder noted that, while it can be difficult to interview abuse victims  with cognitive impairment, it is important to treat their allegations seriously  and with credibility. One law enforcement stakeholder noted that  interviews with these victims require special training.", "Lack of cooperation from some nursing homes. Stakeholders in each  of the five states in our review said that some nursing homes may  withhold, alter, or make it difficult for investigatory agencies to gain  access to necessary, timely, or accurate information about alleged abuse.  This may be, for example, because they may fear adverse publicity,  litigation, or penalties from the state or CMS. In addition, as noted  previously, nursing home staff may be fearful of losing their jobs.  Stakeholders said that nursing home staff who witnessed abuse may be  intentionally vague when interviewed by investigators; for example, by  saying they cannot recall an incident. Some stakeholders also noted that  nursing homes may delay investigators\u2019 access to patient records, or they  may even alter patient records in order to fill in information that should  have been documented but was not at the time of the incident. One  stakeholder we interviewed noted that the problem is not necessarily  widespread\u2014that some nursing homes are open about sharing  information while others can be more difficult. Another stakeholder noted  that a nursing home\u2019s cooperation can sometimes depend on the  seriousness of the allegation.", "Lack of agency coordination. Stakeholders in three of the five states in  our review said that having multiple agencies involved in investigations,  such as the state survey agency, law enforcement, the ombudsman, and,  in some states, Adult Protective Services, can create challenges,  including coordinating investigations and notifying one another about  investigation outcomes. One stakeholder said they sometimes begin an  investigation without realizing another investigatory agency has already  started its own investigation. Further, stakeholders in two of the five  states in our review said that CMS does not allow state survey agencies  to share important investigatory information with law enforcement.

As a  result, we found that CMS\u2019s data do not readily support CMS\u2019s  understanding of the types of abuse and perpetrators that are most  prevalent in nursing homes. CMS officials told us they believe that the  majority of abuse is committed by nursing home residents, and that  physical and sexual abuse were the most common types; officials said  they based this current understanding of abuse and perpetrator types on  professional experience, literature, and ad hoc analyses of deficiency  narrative descriptions. However, our review of a representative sample of  abuse deficiency narratives from 2016 and 2017 found that staff were  more often the perpetrators of deficiencies cited as abuse than residents  or others, and that physical and mental/verbal abuse occurred most often  in nursing homes, followed by sexual abuse. CMS officials noted that  some incidents resulting from resident altercations\u2014particularly those  that do not show a willful intent to harm\u2014may not have been cited as an  abuse deficiency by some state survey agencies and may have been  cited as other deficiencies not specified as abuse.

Additionally, CMS officials told us they  have not conducted a systematic review to gather information on abuse  and perpetrator type. This is inconsistent with federal internal control  standards directing management to use quality information to achieve  program objectives.

Two state survey agencies we spoke with said  they sometimes have to conduct significant follow-up with the nursing  homes to obtain the information they need to prioritize the incident for  investigation\u2014follow-up that delays and potentially negatively affects  investigations. For example, one state survey agency told us that a  facility reported abuse involving two residents but did not initially report  that the residents were injured, and that the facility did not file an  addendum to the facility-reported incident to indicate resident injury. As a  result of this incomplete information, the state survey agency did not  properly prioritize this incident response.", "Despite federal law requiring nursing homes to self-report allegations of  abuse, and covered individuals to report reasonable suspicions of crimes  against residents, CMS has not provided guidance on what information  should be included in these reports.

CMS officials told us in November 2018 that they have efforts  underway to examine guidance related to the information state survey  agencies need to appropriately triage these facility-reported incidents and  are developing a facility-reported incident template.

(See table 6.)", "Timing of abuse referrals. We found CMS\u2019s requirements for when state  survey agencies should report abuse to law enforcement and MFCUs lag  behind the federal requirements for when covered individuals should  make such referrals, and, as a result, referrals may be significantly  delayed. Specifically, federal law requires covered individuals to  immediately report reasonable suspicions of a crime against a resident  that results in serious bodily injury to law enforcement and the state  survey agency. Conversely, state survey agencies do not have to report  suspicions of crime identified on complaints submitted to, and surveys  conducted by, the state survey agency until the abuse has been  substantiated\u2014a process that can often take weeks or months. Officials from one law enforcement agency and two MFCUs that we interviewed  told us the delay in receiving referrals limits their ability to collect evidence  and prosecute cases\u2014for example, bedding associated with potential  sexual abuse may have been washed and wounds may have healed.  This is consistent with the findings of our 2002 report, where we  recommended that CMS should ensure that state survey agencies  immediately notify law enforcement or MFCUs when nursing homes  report allegations of physical or sexual abuse. One state survey agency  in our review established more stringent guidelines than CMS by requiring  the surveyors to notify law enforcement and the MFCU promptly upon  receiving a complaint of abuse. CMS officials told us their state survey  agency reporting requirements are based on a March 2002 policy. This is  inconsistent with standards for internal control, which state that  management should communicate quality information externally so that  external parties can help the entity achieve its objectives.", "Tracking of abuse referrals. In addition to delays in referring cases to  law enforcement and MFCUs, CMS officials also told us that CMS does  not conduct oversight to ensure that state survey agency referrals to law  enforcement and the MFCUs are occurring as required for substantiated  abuse, and, as a result, CMS cannot ensure that state survey agencies  are complying with reporting obligations. For example, an official from one  of the five state survey agencies we interviewed said they had never  made a referral to law enforcement or the MFCU, despite having  substantiated allegations of abuse. The state survey agency official told  us that they do not refer cases to law enforcement, and that law  enforcement referrals are the responsibility of the nursing home. This is  incompatible with CMS guidelines requiring that substantiated abuse be  referred to law enforcement; however, CMS officials told us that they do  not track whether state survey agencies make referrals to law enforcement and the MFCUs. This is inconsistent with federal standards  for internal control, which state that management should establish and  operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and  evaluate the results.", "Definition of substantiated abuse. We found confusion among some  state survey agencies about CMS\u2019s definition of what it means to  substantiate an allegation of abuse\u2014a challenge because substantiation  is a trigger in the investigation process, and CMS requires state survey  agencies to make referrals to law enforcement and staff registries when  abuse is substantiated by evidence. As a result, there is a potential for  substantiated abuse to not be reported and, subsequently, not referred to  law enforcement or MFCUs for criminal investigation. Two of the five state  survey agencies in our review told us they believed they could not  substantiate an allegation unless they could also cite a federal deficiency.  This is inconsistent with CMS\u2019s guidance, which says that state survey  agencies can substantiate that an allegation occurred without citing a  federal deficiency and that, subsequently, these substantiated allegations  must be referred to law enforcement and staff registries. For example,  according to CMS guidance, if the state survey agency investigated and  found evidence that a resident was abused, but the nursing home had  taken preventive actions against the deficient practice, the state survey  agency would then substantiate that the abuse occurred, but not cite a  deficiency. However, state survey agencies may decide not to  substantiate an abuse allegation verified by evidence if they believe no  deficiency should be cited, such as if the nursing home had taken  preventive action against the deficient practice, which could result in that  abuse going unreported and not referred to law enforcement, MFCUs, or  staff registries. Because substantiation of abuse is a critical trigger in  abuse investigations, confusion around its interpretation could prevent  these important next steps. CMS officials told us they are aware that the  state survey agencies have varying interpretations of what it means to  substantiate abuse. According to federal standards for internal control, management should internally communicate quality information to  achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.", "Information sharing. We also found that CMS\u2019s guidance on state  survey agency referrals contained in its State Operations Manual does  not specify what incident information can be shared with local law  enforcement, either in response to local law enforcement\u2019s request for  information or when the state survey agency refers substantiated findings  of abuse to local law enforcement. As a result, both state survey and  law enforcement agencies expressed confusion and frustration about  what information can be shared and said delays have occurred that can  impede law enforcement investigations. Officials from two state survey  agencies told us that CMS does not allow them to share any information  with law enforcement without a written request. For example, officials  from one state survey agency said that they cannot share the name of the  resident abused or the time when the incident occurred. One state survey  agency said that information sharing can be uneven, and told us that law  enforcement is required to share information with the state survey  agencies, but the state survey agencies do not share their investigatory  information with law enforcement. Officials from another state survey  agency wrote to CMS notifying CMS of a change in their state survey  agency protocol that would make the referral process timelier by providing  un-redacted survey records of substantiated abuse to local law  enforcement. However, in CMS\u2019s 2017 written response to the survey  agency, CMS told them that all written requests for these records must  continue to be forwarded to CMS for processing in accordance with the  federal Privacy Act.", "When we asked CMS officials what information state survey agencies can  share with law enforcement in a referral, CMS explained that scenarios  for requesting information can vary, and that CMS does not prescribe a  specific method as it depends on the needs of the investigation.

For  this examination, we reviewed CMS guidance and analyzed data from  2013 through 2017, which represented the most recent data for a 5-year  period at the time of our review. Specifically, we first reviewed the CMS  State Operations Manual\u2019s Appendix PP that was in effect during our  period of review to determine which federal standards and deficiency  codes were relevant to resident abuse. We focused our analysis on the  deficiency code to be used by state surveyors when a nursing home fails  to keep a resident free from abuse, which encompasses mental/verbal,  sexual, or physical abuse. Surveyors can also use other deficiency  codes for abuse-related issues, such as a failure by the nursing home to  train staff on issues related to abuse, either in conjunction with an abuse  deficiency or without an abuse deficiency. Since these abuse-related  deficiency codes do not necessarily represent incidents of abuse, but do  represent situations where a nursing home\u2019s inadequate policies could  leave residents vulnerable to abuse, we conducted a limited analysis on  the trends of these deficiencies, which is described in appendix II.", "For our analysis, we identified abuse deficiencies cited by surveyors in all  50 states and Washington, D.C., between 2013 and 2017, using data  provided by CMS from its Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced  Reports system.

We  compared the results for abuse deficiencies with the results for all types  of deficiencies in each year. To avoid over-counting deficiencies,  deficiencies that were for the same violation on the same day for the  same facility were counted as a single deficiency. We then tracked (1)  the origin of these abuse deficiencies and (2) enforcement actions  implemented against nursing homes with these abuse deficiencies.", "Origin of abuse deficiencies. To identify trends in the origin of those  abuse deficiencies\u2014that is, whether the deficiency originated from a  standard survey, complaint investigation, or a facility-reported incident  investigation\u2014we analyzed data provided by CMS from its Automated  Survey Processing Environment Complaint/Incident Tracking System.  Specifically, we matched the deficiencies with the complaint/incident  data using provider number, survey date, and deficiency code. We  found that some deficiencies were the result of a combination of  complaints, facility-reported incidents, surveys, or all three. We  counted those deficiencies as originating from each relevant category.", "Enforcement actions. To identify trends in the enforcement actions  imposed and implemented against nursing homes with abuse  deficiencies, we analyzed data provided by CMS from its Automated  Survey Processing Environment Enforcement Manager. Specifically,  we matched the deficiencies with the enforcement data using provider  number, survey date, case identification number, and deficiency code.  To avoid over-counting, deficiencies that share the same code and  case identification number were counted as a single deficiency. For  each year, we determined how many of the abuse deficiencies  resulted in enforcement actions imposed or implemented, the severity  of the abuse deficiencies with enforcement actions, and the types of  enforcement actions implemented.", "We then examined these abuse deficiencies to determine the number of  nursing homes that had abuse deficiencies, as well as the number of  homes with repeated abuse deficiencies cited across the 5 years and the  characteristics of those homes. We also determined the proportion of  surveyed nursing homes in a given year that had an abuse deficiency.", "Nursing homes that had repeated abuse deficiencies. Since a  nursing home can have more than one abuse deficiency cited in a  given year, we determined the number of surveyed nursing homes  each year that had at least one abuse deficiency, both nationally and  by state. For each of those nursing homes, we determined if the home  had an abuse deficiency repeated in multiple years and in two or more  consecutive years.", "Nursing home characteristics. We attempted to identify  commonalities among homes with multiple years of abuse  deficiencies, homes with only a single year with an abuse deficiency,  and surveyed homes without any abuse deficiencies throughout the 5- year period. Specifically, we matched deficiency data to CMS\u2019s  publicly available Provider of Services files and the Nursing Home  Compare Provider Information files for each nursing home; and we  examined bed size, non-profit or for-profit status, Five-Star Quality  Rating System overall rating, Special Focus Facility designation, and  urban or rural location.", "Finally, because abuse and perpetrator type are not readily identifiable in  CMS\u2019s data, we identified this information by reviewing the narratives  written by surveyors that describe the substantiated abuse. Specifically,  we obtained 1,557 narrative descriptions written by state surveyors for  abuse deficiencies cited in 2016 and 2017 provided by CMS from its  Automated Survey Processing Environment database. From that  universe of abuse deficiency narratives, we selected a randomly selected  representative sample of 400 narratives, and each narrative was  reviewed by two separate reviewers who independently analyzed the text  of each narrative to determine the abuse and perpetrator type according  to the definitions that CMS implemented on November 28, 2017, in its  State Operations Manual. Any disagreements between the two reviewers  were resolved by a third independent reviewer. (See table 7.) For those  narratives where the abuse type could not reasonably be categorized  under an existing CMS definition, reviewers had the option to mark  narratives as \u201cother.\u201d Furthermore, we analyzed the scope and severity  for each narrative within our sample.", "CMS\u2019s abuse deficiency code also included involuntary seclusion in the  time period we examined and is defined in its November 22, 2017,  guidance as \u201cseparation of a resident from other residents or from her/his  room or confinement to her/his room (with or without roommates) against  the resident\u2019s will, or the will of the resident representative.\u201d Our analysis  of the narrative descriptions found that 3 percent of the abuse deficiency  narratives in our sample were attributable to involuntary seclusion. We  were unable to categorize the abuse and perpetrator type for about 11  percent of the deficiency narratives in our sample, because we  determined the narrative description did not meet CMS\u2019s abuse definition.", "We assessed the reliability of each of the datasets by checking for  missing values and obvious errors and discussed them with CMS officials  who were knowledgeable about the data. In the course of this  assessment, we found some data limitations. Specifically, CMS officials  told us that some state survey agencies may not have entered all facility- reported incidents into the Automated Survey Processing Environment  Complaint/Incident Tracking System, while other state survey agencies  did. We also found underreporting, as noted in our 2019 report, where  the Oregon state survey agency was not entering all abuse-related  complaints or facility-reported incidents into this same database\u2014a  problem that could exist in other states. In addition, CMS officials told us  that it is possible there are additional incidents that may not have been  represented in the abuse deficiency data during the period of our review.  Specifically, CMS officials noted that some incidents resulting from  resident altercations\u2014particularly those that do not show a willful intent to  harm\u2014may not be cited as an abuse deficiency by some state survey  agencies.

Specifically,  abuse-related deficiencies increased by about 9.9 percent over the 5-year  period, from 4,899 deficiencies cited in 2013 to 5,383 deficiencies cited in  2017, but peaked in 2016 with 5,687 deficiencies. This increasing trend  for abuse-related deficiencies is in contrast to the slight decrease in all  deficiencies cited over the same period, but not nearly as high as the  103.5 percent increase in abuse deficiencies. In addition, the proportion  of abuse-related deficiencies cited at the highest levels of severity\u2014 deficiencies causing actual harm to residents or putting residents in  immediate jeopardy\u2014fluctuated throughout the 5-year period.  Specifically, about 6.1 percent of the 4,899 abuse-related deficiencies in  2013, about 5.6 percent of the 5,278 abuse-related deficiencies in 2015,  and about 7.8 percent of the 5,383 abuse-related deficiencies in 2017  caused actual harm or immediate jeopardy. (See fig. 7.)", "We also found that over half of the abuse-related deficiencies each year  were cited by surveyors as a result of standard surveys, and the rest were  cited by surveyors as a result of either complaint or facility-reported  incident investigations. This falls between what we found for abuse  deficiencies\u2014the majority were a result of either complaint or facility- reported incident investigations\u2014and all types of deficiencies\u2014the vast  majority were a result of standard surveys. Over the 5 years, similar to  abuse deficiencies and all types of deficiencies, the percentage of abuse- related deficiencies that resulted from standard surveys decreased while  the percentage that resulted from both complaint and facility-reported  incident investigations increased. Specifically, over the 5-year period, the  percentage of abuse-related deficiencies resulting from standard surveys  decreased by about 8.8 percentage points, complaint investigations  increased by about 3.6 percentage points, and facility-reported incident  investigations increased by about 5.3 percentage points.
