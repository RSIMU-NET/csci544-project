For example, the Department of Labor (Labor) processed 63 percent of applications in a timely manner in FY 2011, but 37 percent were processed after the deadline, including 7 percent that were approved less than 15 days before workers were needed. This left some employers little time for the second phase of the application process, which is managed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and for workers to obtain visas from the Department of State (State). Although workers can apply for visas online, most of the H-2A process involves paper handling, which contributes to processing delays. In addition, employers who need workers at different times of the season must repeat the entire process for each group of workers. Although the agencies lack data on the reasons for processing delays, employers reported delays due to increased scrutiny by Labor and DHS when these agencies implemented new rules and procedures intended to improve program integrity and protect workers. For example, in FY 2011, Labor notified 63 percent of employers that their applications required changes or additional documentation to comply with its new rules, up sharply from previous years.", "Federal agencies are taking steps to improve the H-2A application process. Labor and DHS are developing new electronic application systems, but both agencies\u0092 systems have been delayed. Labor also recently began using e-mail to resolve issues with employers, and all three agencies provided more information to employers to clarify program requirements. Even with these efforts, some employers view Labor\u0092s decisions as inconsistent. For example, some employers received different decisions about issues such as whether they can require workers to have experience in farm work and questioned the methods states used to decide whether the job qualifications in their applications were acceptable. We found states used different methods to determine acceptable qualifications, which is allowed under Labor\u0092s guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that (1) Labor and DHS use their new electronic application systems to collect data on reasons applications are delayed and use this information to improve the timeliness of application processing; (2) Labor allow employers to submit one application for groups of similar workers needed in a single season; and (3) Labor review and revise, as appropriate, its guidance to states regarding methods for determining the acceptability of employment practices in employers\u0092 applications. DHS and Labor agreed with the recommendation to collect additional data and Labor agreed with the recommendation to update its guidance. Labor disagreed with the recommendation it allow employers to apply once per season. GAO believes the recommendation is still valid and that a single application does not preclude timely testing of the labor market as workers are needed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s agricultural sector relies on hired farm workers to bring  products to market. Obtaining enough workers at the right time is critical,  especially for producers of crops with short harvest seasons. Because it  is difficult for some agricultural employers to find enough U.S. workers,  federal law allows these employers to apply for permission to hire foreign  workers on a temporary or seasonal basis and arrange for their entry into  the country under special visas, known as H-2A visas. About 55,000 H- 2A visas were issued in fiscal year 2011, according to the Department of  State (State). To ensure protections for workers and proper vetting of  these foreign workers before entry, state workforce agencies and three  federal agencies are involved in administering the H-2A process\u2014the  Departments of Labor (Labor), Homeland Security (DHS), and State.  Before employers can employ H-2A workers, they must apply for a  certification from Labor that a labor shortage exists in their particular case  and U.S. workers will not be adversely affected by hiring H-2A workers. If  Labor determines these conditions are met, an employer can submit a  petition to DHS to employ foreign workers. If DHS approves the petition,  foreign workers can apply to State for a H-2A visa. In 1997, we reviewed  the H-2A program and made recommendations to improve service to  employers and reduce the amount of time it takes federal agencies to  process employer applications for H-2A workers.implemented some of our recommendations, but questions about whether   Agencies have  the H-2A program meets employers\u2019 needs were raised in recent  congressional hearings. In response to your request, to identify ways to  expedite the application process while maintaining worker protections and  national security, we examined (1) what aspects of the application  process, if any, present challenges to agricultural employers, and (2) how  federal agencies have addressed any employer challenges with the  application process.", "To identify potential challenges employers experience when applying for  H-2A workers, we interviewed representatives from 25 employers and 12  agricultural employer associations. We identified these employers through  national employer associations and regional associations in the states we  visited. We also visited three states (New York, North Carolina, and  Washington), which we selected because they account for a sizable  proportion of all H-2A workers (about 24 percent of H-2A positions  certified in fiscal year 2011 according to data reported by Labor) and vary  in geographic location. Within each state, we interviewed a combination  of state workforce agency officials, representatives from agricultural  employer associations, employers, and farm worker advocates.  Information obtained from our site visits and employer interviews cannot  be generalized to all states or agricultural employers. To review the  timeliness of application processing, we analyzed data from Labor for  fiscal years 2006 through 2012 and from DHS for fiscal years 2006  through 2011. To assess the reliability of the data, we reviewed agency  documentation, interviewed Labor and DHS officials, tested the electronic  data, and compared our results with related information reported by the  agencies. Based on these reviews, we determined that the data used to  determine the timeliness of application processing were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. We reviewed Labor\u2019s data on the  number of H-2A workers employers requested and the number of H-2A  workers certified by Labor, and determined that these data were not  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. As a result, we did not report the  total number of H-2A workers requested and certified. We will issue a  separate management letter to Labor detailing our findings related to this  information. We also reviewed employer appeals of Labor\u2019s adverse  rulings to identify the reasons for the appeals and the extent to which  Labor\u2019s decisions were affirmed or reversed.the agencies to address employer challenges, we interviewed federal  officials who process H-2A applications at Labor, DHS, and State. We  also reviewed agency procedures, relevant federal laws and regulations,  and some recent legislative proposals to modify or replace the H-2A  program. We conducted this performance audit from October 2011 to  September 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

During World War I, the Congress authorized the issuance of rules  providing for the temporary admission of otherwise inadmissible aliens,  and this led to the establishment of a temporary farm labor program  designed to replace U.S. workers directly involved in the war effort.  Similarly, initially through an agreement with Mexico, a guest worker  program was authorized during World War II that brought in over 4 million  Mexican workers from 1942 to 1964, called \u201cbraceros\u201d to work on farms   Although the Bracero program expanded the farm  on a seasonal basis.labor supply, the program also affected domestic farm workers through  reduced wages and employment, according to a 2009 Congressional  Research Service report. The Bracero program has been criticized by  labor groups, which identified issues such as mistreatment of workers and  lax enforcement of work contracts. While the Bracero program was still in  effect, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA) established the  statutory authority for a guestworker program that included workers  performing temporary services or labor, known as \u201cH-2\u201d after the specific  provision of the law. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986  amended the INA and effectively divided the H-2 program into two  programs: the H-2A program expressly for agricultural employers and the  H-2B program expressly for nonagricultural employers.", "The H-2A program was created to help agricultural employers obtain an  adequate labor supply while also protecting the jobs, wages, and working  conditions of U.S. farm workers. The H-2A law and regulations contain  several requirements to protect U.S. workers from adverse effects  associated with the hiring of temporary foreign workers and to protect  foreign workers from exploitation. Under the program, employers must  provide H-2A workers a minimum level of wages, benefits, and working  conditions. For example, employers must pay a prescribed wage rate,  provide the workers housing that meets minimum standards for health  and safety, pay for workers\u2019 travel costs to and from their home country,  and guarantee workers will be paid for three-quarters of the work contract   (see table 1 for more information about the  even if less work is needed.conditions of employment that employers are expected to provide  workers).", "In fiscal year 2011, Labor received about 4,900 employer applications  requesting permission to hire H-2A workers. State issued about 55,000  H-2A visas in fiscal year 2011 and about 94 percent of these visas were  processed by Mexican posts, according to data reported by State.  Employers requested H-2A workers to help support the production of  various commodities, such as fruit, vegetables, tobacco, and grain. While  many of these employers requested help with general farm work, others  sought workers with special skills, such as sheepherders or combine  operators. Employers in some states rely more heavily on H-2A workers  to meet their labor needs. In fiscal year 2011, Labor reported that over  half of the H-2A positions it certified were located in five southeastern  states\u2014North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Kentucky.  Although California is the largest producer of agricultural products in the  country, the state is ranked thirteenth in its employment of H-2A workers,  according to a recent Labor report. H-2A workers are expected to work  temporarily and must leave the country once the temporary work contract  is complete, but may return in future years to meet employers\u2019 seasonal  needs under specific circumstances. In fiscal year 2011, about 27  percent of H-2A employers requested H-2A workers for 6 months or less  and about 73 percent of employers requested workers for 7 to 12 months.", "H-2A workers represent a small proportion of the approximately 1 million  hired agricultural workers that the U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates are in the United States, many of whom are not legally  authorized to work in the country (referred to as undocumented workers).

Labor is currently in the process of developing an online H-2A application  to add to its existing web-based filing system, but it has been delayed.", "Specifically, in October 2010, Labor began designing an online H-2A  application for employers that it planned to deploy in August 2011.", "However, Labor officials told us the online application was delayed  because the agency could not award the contract to develop it while  operating under a provisional budget based on a continuing resolution.  Since then, Labor completed the design of the online H-2A application  and in June 2012 awarded the contract to develop, test, and implement it.

According to Labor officials, the online  application will allow employers to create account profiles and check the  status of their H-2A applications. In addition, Labor officials said the  online H-2A application would also result in faster application processing,  reduced costs, better customer service, and improved data quality.", "DHS also plans to implement an online petition for H-2A workers, but the  agency has experienced delays and is in the process of developing a  schedule for completing this work. The agency planned to deploy an  online H-2A petition in October 2012 as part of its Transformation  Program, which aims to replace the paper-based systems currently used  to process petitions with an electronic system. However, the  Transformation Program itself has been delayed several times since its  inception in 2005, as we have previously reported, and officials told us  they have not started work on the online H-2A petition and do not know  when it will be completed. In prior work on the Transformation Program,  we found DHS was managing the program without specific acquisition  management controls, such as reliable schedules, which contributed to  missed milestones.

Specifically, Labor made changes to its review  process to informally resolve issues with employers and reduce  unnecessary delays and appeals. Labor officials told us that, in 2011,  they piloted using e-mail to communicate with employers in 10 states  about their H-2A applications. In March 2012, Labor began using e-mail  to communicate with employers in all states about their applications.  Labor also changed its procedures so that it can make corrections to  minor errors on an employer\u2019s H-2A application\u2014such as adding a  missing phone number\u2014after obtaining the employer\u2019s permission via e- mail to correct the error. In February 2011, Labor instituted a policy that  gives employers up to 5 additional days to submit required documentation  on their H-2A applications rather than automatically denying them  because all of the required documentation was not submitted by the  deadline.", "In addition to the changes outlined above, since implementing its new  regulations in March 2010, Labor provided employers with more guidance  about the requirements of the H-2A program in a variety of formats (see  table 3).", "Labor officials said these efforts resulted in improved timeliness and  fewer appeals in recent months. Our analysis of Labor\u2019s data showed that  the agency\u2019s timeliness remained relatively unchanged, although the  percentage of applications for which deficiency notices were issued and  the number of appealed decisions declined substantially over that period.  For the first half of fiscal year 2012, Labor processed 61 percent of  certified applications at least 30 days prior to the employer\u2019s date of need  and issued deficiency notices for 38 percent of employer applications.", "Sixty employer appeals were filed during the first half of fiscal year 2012.", "Several employers we interviewed reported that they did not understand  the H-2A program requirements because Labor\u2019s decisions seemed  inconsistent. A number of the inconsistencies employers cited concerned  job order terms and conditions, the acceptability of which varies by state.  Labor officials told us they strive for consistency and have many checks  in place to ensure consistent decisions. Specifically, they said analysts in  Labor\u2019s processing center follow detailed standard operating procedures  and the center has multiple quality assurance methods to ensure  consistency, including supervisory review, peer review, and a quarterly  quality assurance process.

GAO, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  GAO/AIMD-00.21.3.1 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 1999). state workforce agencies are directed to apply a prevailing practice  standard to determine whether the frequency with which an employer  intends to pay H-2A workers is acceptable, while states can use a more  subjective normal and common practice standard to determine whether  job qualifications, such as how much experience is required, are  acceptable (see table 4).", "In 1988, Labor provided states with an H-2A Program Handbook that  included guidance on how to make these decisions and encouraged  states to administer formal surveys to determine acceptable practices. If  the state workforce agency cannot use a formal survey, Labor\u2019s guidance  suggests states make these determinations using other information  sources, such as staff knowledge and experience, informal surveys,  reviews of job orders used by non-H-2A employers, or consultation with  experts in agriculture or farm worker advocates. In 2011, Labor began  posting results from states\u2019 prevailing practice surveys online to help  employers write job orders that are consistent with prevailing, normal, and  accepted practices.", "Labor\u2019s guidance to states for determining acceptable practices, however,  is broad and not prescriptive, leading states to apply varied methods,  some of which may be insufficient. For example, the Administrative Law  Judge who ruled on the Massachusetts apple and vegetable growers\u2019  appeal of Labor\u2019s initial decision to prohibit experience requirements did  not consider the Massachusetts state workforce agency\u2019s prevailing  practice survey in his ruling because of its design flaws. Further, two  employer representatives told us they considered state prevailing practice  surveys to be unreliable and inconsistent in their coverage. In addition,  officials in the three states we visited said they did not include questions  about certain terms and conditions in formal surveys and used different  methods to determine whether a particular practice was acceptable: two  states reviewed job orders filed by non-H-2A employers; the other state  informally surveyed non-H-2A employers in-person. One employer  representative expressed frustration that neighboring states used different  methods to determine acceptable practices for the same crop and that the  results differed.", "DHS also has taken several steps to improve employers\u2019 experience with  the H-2A application process. Specifically, the agency took steps to  expedite petitions for H-2A workers and provide more guidance to  employers. In October 2007, DHS directed its employees to expedite the  handling and adjudication of H-2A petitions. According to our analysis, the  agency\u2019s processing times have improved in recent years. From fiscal  year 2006 to fiscal year 2011, the percentage of petitions approved within  1 week increased from about 34 percent to 72 percent. At the same time,  the percentage of petitions that took 1 month or longer to approve  declined from about 11 percent to about 6 percent. In July 2010 and June  2011, DHS invited employers to participate in teleconferences to discuss  employers\u2019 difficulties with some of its new systems and procedures. In  addition, the agency posted summaries of the teleconferences and  answers to employers\u2019 frequently asked questions on its Web site.", "State has addressed employer concerns with the H-2A visa application  process by hosting face-to-face meetings with employers and other key  stakeholders, making improvements to its worker processing procedures,  and taking steps to increase the capacity of its Monterrey consulate to  process H-2A visas. In 2012, State officials said they reached out to  Labor to discuss H-2A related issues. They also said the two agencies  are formalizing working groups in part to improve information sharing.  State also meets with employers and other stakeholders at annual  meetings that bring together representatives from Labor, DHS, and State.  Officials from Labor and DHS, and State\u2019s contractor attended the most  recent of these meetings, held in Texas in January 2012. A representative  of an employer association who attended this meeting told us it was  helpful to have representatives from all three agencies there to answer  questions. After hearing at the January 2012 meeting that some  employers had difficulties with getting their Mexican H-2A workers  processed by their date of need, State directed employers with  approaching dates of need to request emergency appointments for their  workers to be processed at posts other than the Monterrey consulate.", "State officials noted that all Mexican posts have the capacity to process  H-2A visa applications and suggested that applicants can visit other posts  if it is difficult to get appointments at the Monterrey consulate. State also  developed new procedures to better enable them to handle large groups  of workers. In addition, State is expanding its Monterrey consulate, which  currently handles most of the H-2A visas processed.

Negotiating this largely paper-based process can be time consuming,  complex, and challenging for employers. The associated difficulties can  impose a burden on H-2A employers that is not borne by employers who  break the law and hire undocumented workers. Although Labor and DHS  have taken some steps to incorporate new technologies, delays in the  development of electronic application filing systems continue burdening  employers with paperwork and may be consuming more resources from  federal agencies than necessary. In addition, the absence of systems to  collect data on the reasons for processing delays makes it difficult for  these agencies to identify why employer applications are initially rejected,  to target their efforts to address the most important issues that challenge  employers, and to improve performance. Meanwhile, employers who  require workers at different points of the season must bear the additional  costs of submitting paperwork to multiple agencies for each set of  workers. In addition, employers continue to express confusion about how  state workforce agencies and Labor are applying Labor\u2019s new regulations.  Without additional clarification and transparency, employers may continue  to submit unacceptable paperwork that requires extra resources from all  parties to process.
