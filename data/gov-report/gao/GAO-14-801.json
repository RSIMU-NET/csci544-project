However, this global reach is being  increasingly challenged with potential adversaries now pursuing anti- access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies and capabilities designed to either  prevent an opposing force from entering an operational area (anti-access)  or limit an opposing force\u2019s freedom of action within an operational area  (area denial), according to DOD. For instance, potential adversaries could  challenge DOD\u2019s ability to deploy military forces by using ballistic and  cruise missiles to prevent U.S. forces from getting to an operational area  by attacking U.S. bases, ships, and logistics hubs. Similarly, potential  adversaries could use mines and guided rockets to limit U.S. freedom of  action once U.S. forces are in an area. DOD is increasingly focusing on  A2/AD challenges and issued the Joint Operational Access Concept  (JOAC) in 2012, which broadly describes how it will operate effectively in  an A2/AD environment to support development of the joint force of 2020,  as described by the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance.", "We issued two classified reports in 2013 focused on the A2/AD  capabilities of Iran and China and DOD\u2019s ability to overcome them.

According to the JOAC, the U.S. military will  continue to derive great benefit from its space and cyberspace  capabilities, but potential adversaries understand that and are  increasingly targeting those capabilities. Operating in the space and  cyberspace domains is also attractive to potential adversaries  because actions in those domains are often difficult to attribute.", "Posture Changes: The third trend is that the change in U.S. overseas  defense posture complicates the U.S. ability to obtain operational  access. Specifically, DOD has reduced the number of overseas  facilities and number of deployed forces, meaning that future  operations will likely require it to deploy over longer distances.", "According to the JOAC, the effect of these three trends is that potential  adversaries who may have once perceived that they could not stop U.S.  forces from deploying into an operational area are now adopting A2/AD  strategies. Figure 1 provides examples of anti-access and area denial  capabilities.", "The JOAC describes A2/AD challenges in the context of an adversary\u2019s  strategy rather than a list of technical capabilities that need to be  overcome. In general, the intent of an adversary that adopts an A2/AD  strategy is to convince and, if necessary and possible, compel the United  States to keep out of its affairs. At the most sophisticated level, an A2/AD  strategy is not a sequential series of actions using specific military  capabilities but rather an integrated and adaptive campaign using all  levers of national power and influence before, during, and after any actual  military conflict. Critical elements of an A2/AD strategy include keeping  U.S. forces as far away as possible and imposing steeper costs on the  United States than it is willing to bear.", "Militarily, an A2/AD environment is characterized by sophisticated  adversaries using asymmetric capabilities, such as electronic and cyber  warfare, space capabilities, advanced air defenses, missiles, and mines,  according to DOD. The advanced weapons and technologies are  characterized by their increasing precision and range, and are often  affordable and increasingly proliferated. Adversaries could range from a  high-end peer state that has integrated a wide range of domestically  produced advanced capabilities to states, including failed or failing states,  adopting a hybrid strategy that includes regular and irregular forces and a  number of sophisticated weapons and technology developed at home or  acquired abroad.

In the guidance, the Secretary of Defense established projecting power  despite A2/AD challenges as 1 of 10 primary DOD missions, noting that  countries such as Iran and China will continue to pursue capabilities such  as electronic and cyber warfare and ballistic and cruise missiles to  counter U.S. power projection capabilities and limit the operational access  of U.S. forces. Other primary missions, such as operating effectively in  cyberspace and space, deterring and defeating aggression, and providing  a stabilizing presence, are also relevant to overcoming A2/AD challenges.", "The 2014 QDR maintains the emphasis on overcoming A2/AD  challenges. It builds on the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance and  continues DOD\u2019s transition to focusing on future challenges during a time  of fiscal uncertainty.

Given future operational challenges, the  draft concept states that Army forces need to be agile, responsive,  adaptive, and regionally engaged across the globe, and be able to  conduct distributed operations. These distributed operations would  involve Army elements arriving from numerous directions and domains to  distributed locations in a joint operations area. According to the draft  concept, this operational approach, also discussed in the JOAC, could  help to overcome A2/AD challenges because the Army forces would be  more spread out and thus more difficult to target and defend against.

According to the JOAC, such activities include  multinational exercises, basing and support agreements, improving  overseas facilities, prepositioning supplies, and forward-deploying forces.  These types of activities help shape favorable access conditions. For  example, engagement activities such as combined training or exercises,  or improving a host-nation\u2019s infrastructure, help maintain and develop  good relationships with and improve the capabilities of allies and partners  that then may be called upon in the event of a crisis. Also, officials from  the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) and the U.S. Central Command  (CENTCOM) emphasized the importance of engagement activities in  gaining and maintaining access and stated that continued forward  presence of U.S. forces in their regions may help deter potential  adversaries and reassure allies and partners by signaling U.S.  commitment to that region. Moreover, DOD officials stated that having  Army and Marine Corps forces forward deployed conducting engagement  activities helps with access challenges because these forces are already  in theater and can respond more quickly if a crisis occurs than they could  if they had to deploy from the United States.", "Both the Army and Marine Corps are developing new approaches to their  engagement activities to help shape favorable access conditions. For  example, the Army is testing a new operational approach in 2014, called  Pacific Pathways, that changes the way the Army supplies forces for  engagement activities. Rather than sending a number of small units that  each conduct a single activity for a short period of time, under Pacific  Pathways the Army will send a fully-equipped, combat-trained, 700- soldier battalion-sized force to participate in two or three regional  exercises over the course of 90 days. Soldiers and their equipment would  travel by air and sea between engagements. Similarly, the Marine Corps  is also taking steps to enhance engagement activities and provide  forward presence. The Marine Corps is planning on having one-third of its  forces forward deployed. As part of this effort, the Marine Corps is  returning to the practice of rotational deployments, where units based in  the United States deploy to Japan or Australia for 6 months to train,  engage allies and partners in the region, and provide forward presence.  According to DOD officials, these approaches allow the forces to better  fulfill their respective missions while providing the combatant  commanders with more options for their employment.", "In addition, officials from CENTCOM, PACOM, and U.S. Special  Operations Command told us they are increasingly incorporating  engagement activities into their planning efforts. Moreover, the JOAC  states that combatant commanders will need to coordinate these efforts  with other U.S. agencies that are also conducting engagement activities.  In February 2013, we testified that as DOD continues to emphasize  engagement activities, to include building partner capacity, the need for  efficient and effective coordination with foreign partners and within the  U.S. government has become more important, in part because of fiscal  challenges, which can be exacerbated by overlapping or ineffective  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Entry Operations", "paragraphs": ["The Army and the Marine Corps both play a primary role in conducting  entry operations in an A2/AD environment, according to DOD.
