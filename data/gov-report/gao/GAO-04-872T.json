Both perspectives provide valuable insights. An adequacy perspective focuses on benefit levels and how well they maintain pre-retirement living standards. An equity perspective focuses on rates of return and other measures relating lifetime benefits to contributions. Both perspectives examine how their measures are distributed across earnings levels. However, equity measures take all benefits and taxes into account, which is difficult to calculate for reform proposals that rely on general revenue transfers because it is unclear who will bear the relative burden for those general revenues. The Social Security program's distributional effects reflect both program features and demographic patterns among its recipients. In addition to the benefit formula, disability benefits favor lower earners because disabled workers are more likely to be lower lifetime earners. In contrast, certain household patterns reduce the system's tilt toward lower earners, for example, when lower earners have high-earner spouses. The advantage for lower earners is also diminished by the fact that they may not live as long as higher earners and therefore would get benefits for fewer years on average. Proposals to alter the Social Security program would have different distributional effects, depending on their design. Model 2 of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security proposes new individual accounts, certain benefit reductions for all beneficiaries, and certain benefit enhancements for selected low earners and survivors. According to our simulations, the combined effect could result in lower earners receiving a greater relative share of all benefits than under the current system if all workers invest in the same portfolio."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss the potential effects of  selected Social Security reform proposals. Social Security not only  represents the foundation of our retirement income system; it also  provides millions of Americans with disability insurance and survivor\u2019s  benefits. As a result, Social Security provides benefits that are critical to  the current and future well-being of virtually all Americans. However, as I  have said in congressional testimonies over the past several years, the  system faces both solvency and sustainability challenges in the longer  term. The challenges of combating terrorism have come to the fore as  urgent claims on the federal budget. At the same time, Social Security\u2019s  long-term pressures on the budget have not diminished. Indeed, our long- range challenges are greater than ever. Without substantive reforms,  Social Security and Medicare are unsustainable, and their long-term  impact on the federal budget and the economy will be dramatic.", "Social Security faces a long-term structural financing shortfall largely  because people are living longer and having fewer children. According to  the 2004 intermediate\u2014or best-estimate\u2014assumptions of the Social  Security trustees, Social Security\u2019s annual benefit payments will exceed  annual cash revenues beginning in 2018, and it will be necessary to draw  on trust fund reserves to pay full benefits. To do this, the Treasury will  need to obtain cash for those redeemed securities either through  increased taxes and/or spending cuts and/or more borrowing from the  public. In 2042, the trust funds will be exhausted, and annual revenues will  only be sufficient to pay about 73 percent of benefits. As a result, some  combination of benefit and/or revenue changes will be needed to restore  the long-term solvency and sustainability of the program.", "Last July, I testified before this committee on the need for early action to  reform Social Security and specifically how failing to do so would place a  burden on younger generations, lower earners, and the disabled. In point  of fact, any reform proposal will have implications for how benefits and  related taxes are distributed across the entire population. Today, we are  issuing a report you requested to examine such distributional effects,  specifically those effects relative to various earnings levels. I hope my  testimony today will help illustrate the potential distributional effects of  Social Security reforms and will place such effects in a broader context.", "Before I summarize the findings from this analysis, let me first highlight a  number of important points in connection with our Social Security  challenge.", "Social Security reform is part of a broader fiscal and economic  challenge. If you look ahead in the federal budget, the combined Social  Security program (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability  Insurance), together with the rapidly growing health programs (Medicare  and Medicaid), will dominate the federal government\u2019s future fiscal  outlook. Absent reform, the nation will ultimately have to choose between  persistent, escalating federal deficits and debt, huge tax increases and/or  dramatic budget cuts.", "Focusing on trust fund solvency alone is not sufficient. We need to  put the program on a path toward sustainable solvency. Trust fund  solvency is an important concept, but focusing on trust fund solvency  alone can lead to a false sense of security about the overall condition of  the Social Security program. The size of the trust fund does not tell us  whether the program is sustainable\u2014that is, whether the government will  have the capacity to pay future claims or what else will have to be  squeezed to pay those claims. Aiming for sustainable solvency would  increase the chance that future policy makers would not have to face these  difficult questions on a recurring basis. Estimates of what it would take to  achieve 75-year trust fund solvency understate the extent of the problem  because the program\u2019s financial imbalance gets worse in the 76th and each  subsequent year.", "Solving Social Security\u2019s long-term financing problem is more  important and complex than simply making the numbers add up.  Social Security is an important and successful social program that affects  virtually every American family. It currently pays benefits to more than 46  million people, including retired workers, disabled workers, the spouses  and children of retired and disabled workers, and the survivors of  deceased workers. The number of individuals receiving benefits is  expected to grow to over 68 million by 2020. The program has been highly  effective at reducing the incidence of poverty among the elderly, and the  disability and survivor benefits have been critical to the financial well  being of millions of others.", "Acting sooner rather than later would help to ease the difficulty of  change. As I noted previously, the challenge of facing the imminent and  daunting budget pressure from Medicare, Medicaid, and OASDI increases  over time. Social Security will begin to constrain the budget long before  the trust funds are exhausted in 2042. The program\u2019s annual cash flow is  projected to be negative beginning in 2018. Social Security\u2019s annual cash  deficit will place increasing pressure on the rest of the budget to raise the  resources necessary to meet the program\u2019s costs. Waiting until Social  Security faces an immediate solvency crisis will limit the scope of feasible  solutions and could reduce the options to only those choices that are the  most difficult. Acting soon would allow changes to be phased in so the  individuals who are most likely to be affected, namely younger and future  workers, will have time to adjust their retirement planning while helping  to avoid related \u201cexpectation gaps.\u201d It would also help to ensure that the  \u201cmiracle of compounding\u201d works for us rather than against us. Finally,  acting soon reduces the likelihood that the Congress will have to choose  between imposing severe benefit cuts and unfairly burdening future  generations with the program\u2019s rising costs.", "To assist the Congress in its deliberations, GAO has developed criteria for  evaluating various Social Security reform proposals. These criteria aim to  balance financial and economic considerations with benefit adequacy and  equity issues and the administrative challenges associated with various  proposals.

The  various provisions include different ways, within the current program  structure, of reducing certain benefits, enhancing selected benefits, and  enhancing revenues. Certain reform provisions also include creating a new  system of individual retirement savings accounts with different account  contribution levels and different ways of adjusting Social Security defined  benefits to reflect the diversion of Social Security contributions into the  accounts.

In 1950, before the Social Security system was  mature, the ratio was 16.5:1. In the 1960s, the ratio averaged 4.2:1. Today it  is 3.3:1, and it is expected to drop to around 2.2:1 by 2030. The retirement  of the baby boom generation is not the only demographic challenge facing  the system. People are retiring early and living longer. A falling fertility  rate is the other principal factor underlying the growth in the elderly\u2019s  share of the population. In the 1960s, the fertility rate was an average of 3  children per woman. Today it is a little over 2, and by 2030 it is expected to  fall to 1.95 \u2014a rate that is below the level necessary to replace the  population.

However, it is also appropriate to consider whether  and how changes in pension and/or other government policies could  encourage longer workforce participation. To the extent that people  choose to work longer as they live longer, the increase in the share of life  spent in retirement would be slowed.

This growth in spending on federal  entitlements for retirees will become increasingly unsustainable over the  longer term, compounding an ongoing decline in budgetary flexibility.  Over the past few decades, spending on mandatory programs has  consumed an ever-increasing share of the federal budget. In 1964, prior to  the creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, spending for  mandatory programs plus net interest accounted for about 33 percent of  total federal spending. By 2004, this share had almost doubled to  approximately 61 percent of the budget.

These simulations continue to show that to move  into the future with no changes in federal retirement and health programs  is to envision a very different role for the federal government. Assuming,  for example, all expiring tax provisions are extended and discretionary  spending keeps pace with the economy, by midcentury federal revenues  may be adequate to pay no more than interest on the federal debt. To  obtain balance, massive spending cuts, tax increases, or some combination  of the two would be necessary. (See fig. 5.) Neither slowing the growth of  discretionary spending nor   This testimony is not about the complexities of Medicare, but it is  important to note that Medicare presents a much greater, more complex,  and more urgent fiscal challenge than does Social Security. Medicare  growth rates reflect not only a burgeoning beneficiary population, but also  the escalation of health care costs at rates well exceeding general rates of  inflation. Increases in the number and quality of health care services have  been fueled by the explosive growth of medical technology. Moreover, the  actual costs of health care consumption are not transparent. Third-party  payers generally insulate consumers from the cost of health care  decisions. These factors and others contribute to making Medicare a much  greater and more complex fiscal challenge than even Social Security. GAO  has developed a health care framework to help focus additional attention  on this important area and to help educate key policy makers and the  public on the current system and related challenges.", "Indeed, long-term budget flexibility is about more than Social Security and  Medicare. While these programs dominate the long-term outlook, they are  not the only federal programs or activities that bind the future. The federal  government undertakes a wide range of programs, responsibilities, and  activities that obligate it to future spending or create an expectation for  spending. GAO has described the range and measurement of such fiscal  exposures\u2014from explicit liabilities such as environmental cleanup  requirements to the more implicit obligations presented by life-cycle costs  of capital acquisition or disaster assistance. Making government fit the  challenges of the future will require not only dealing with the drivers\u2014 entitlements for the elderly\u2014but also looking at the range of federal  activities. A fundamental review of what the federal government does and  how it does it will be needed.", "At the same time it is important to look beyond the federal budget to the  economy as a whole.

Under the 2004  Trustees\u2019 intermediate estimates and CBO\u2019s long-term Medicaid estimates,  spending for these entitlement programs combined will grow to 15.6  percent of GDP in 2030 from today\u2019s 8.5 percent.

As a result, taking action  now to increase the future pool of resources is important. To echo Federal  Reserve Chairman Greenspan, the crucial issue of saving in our economy  relates to our ability to build an adequate capital stock to produce enough  goods and services in the future to accommodate both retirees and  workers in the future. The most direct way the federal government can  raise national saving is by increasing government saving, i.e., as the  economy returns to a higher growth path, a much more balanced and  disciplined fiscal policy that recognizes our long-term challenges can help  provide a strong foundation for future economic growth and can enhance  future budgetary flexibility. In the short term, we need to realize that we  are already facing a huge fiscal hole. The first thing that we should do is  stop digging.", "Taking action soon on Social Security would not only promote increased  budgetary flexibility in the future and stronger economic growth but  would also make the necessary action less dramatic than if we wait. Some  of the benefits of early action\u2014and the costs of delay\u2014can be seen in  figure 7. This compares what it would take to achieve actuarial balance at  different points in time by either raising payroll taxes or reducing  benefits. If we did nothing until 2042\u2014the year the Trust Funds are  estimated to be exhausted\u2014achieving actuarial balance would require  changes in benefits of 30 percent or changes in taxes of 43 percent. As  figure 7 shows, earlier action shrinks the size of the adjustment.", "Thus both sustainability concerns and solvency considerations drive us to  act sooner rather than later. Trust Fund exhaustion may be almost 40  years away, but the squeeze on the federal budget will begin as the baby  boom generation starts to retire.

As a former public trustee of Social Security and  Medicare, I am well aware of the central role these programs play in the  lives of millions of Americans. Social Security remains the foundation of  the nation\u2019s retirement system. It is also much more than just a retirement  program; it pays benefits to disabled workers and their dependents,  spouses and children of retired workers, and survivors of deceased  workers. Last year, Social Security paid almost $471 billion in benefits to  more than 47 million people. Since its inception, the program has  successfully reduced poverty among the elderly. In 1959, 35 percent of the  elderly were poor. In 2000, about 8 percent of beneficiaries aged 65 or  older were poor, and 48 percent would have been poor without Social  Security. It is precisely because the program is so deeply woven into the  fabric of our nation that any proposed reform must consider the program  in its entirety, rather than one aspect alone.

For example, if  offering individual choice and control is less important than maintaining  replacement rates for low-income workers, then a reform proposal  emphasizing adequacy considerations might be preferred.

If disabled and survivor benefits were not reduced  at all, reductions in other benefits would be deeper than shown in this  analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program\u2019s Distributional Effects Reflect Various Program Features and Demographic Patterns", "paragraphs": ["Social Security\u2019s distributional effects reflect program features, such as its  benefit formula, and demographic patterns among its recipients, such as  marriage between lower and higher earners. The retired worker benefit  formula favors lower earners by design, replacing about 50 percent of pre- retirement earnings at age 65 for an illustrative low earner but only about  30 percent of pre-retirement earnings for an illustrative high earner. (See  fig. 8.) The disability benefit formula also favors lower earners, and  disability recipients are disproportionately lower earners. Our simulations  suggest that for individuals born in 1985, compared with a hypothetical  program without disability insurance, Social Security\u2019s disability  provisions increase lifetime Social Security benefits for the bottom fifth of  earners by 43 percent, compared with 14 percent for the top fifth of  earners. The extent to which the benefit formula and disability benefits  favor lower earners may be offset to some degree by demographic  patterns. Household formation tends to reduce the system\u2019s tilt toward  lower earners because some of the lower-earning individuals helped by the  program live in high-income households. For example, many of the lower- earning individuals that the system favors through spouse and survivor  benefits actually live at some point in higher-income households because  of marriage. In our simulations, the ratio of benefits received to payroll  taxes contributed is higher for lower earners than for higher earners, but  this difference is reduced when we account for household formation. Also,  differences in mortality rates may reduce rates of return for lower earners,  as studies show they may not live as long as higher earners and therefore  would receive benefits for fewer years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distributional Effects Vary across Reform Proposals", "paragraphs": ["Alternative Social Security reform proposals would have different  distributional effects, reflecting the variety of provisions in them. The  various provisions include different ways, within the current program  structure, of reducing certain benefits, enhancing selected benefits, and  enhancing revenues. The various reform provisions also include creating a  new system of individual retirement savings accounts with different  account contribution levels and different ways of adjusting Social Security  defined benefits to reflect the diversion of Social Security contributions  into the accounts. Individually and in combination, these provisions would  affect the distribution of benefits and taxes relative to earnings levels.", "For example, Model 2 of the President\u2019s Commission to Strengthen Social  Security (CSSS) proposes a new system of voluntary individual accounts  along with a combination of certain benefit reductions for all beneficiaries  and selected benefit enhancements for selected low earners and survivors.  One of its provisions would reduce Social Security defined benefits  proportionally for all workers by modifying the benefit formula. At the  same time, benefits would be enhanced for certain lower earners and  surviving spouses, and 4 percentage points of individuals\u2019 payroll taxes (up  to a $1,000 annual limit) would be diverted into individual accounts.", "In contrast, a proposal offered by Peter Diamond and Peter Orszag would  also include a provision to reduce Social Security defined benefits  proportionally for all workers by modifying the benefit formula. It also has  provisions to enhance benefits for selected lower earners and surviving  spouses. However, it does not contain a provision for individual accounts,  and it does have a variety of provisions for enhancing revenues. The  Diamond-Orszag proposal also has other benefit reduction and benefit  enhancement provisions, such as modifying the benefit formula to reduce  benefits for higher earners only. Another provision would maintain  disability benefits and benefits for survivors of workers who die before  retirement in spite of the other benefit reductions.", "Also in contrast to CSSS Model 2, a proposal offered by Peter Ferrara  provides for a new system of voluntary individual accounts but does not  contain any provisions to make changes to Social Security defined  benefits, except for individuals participating in the individual accounts.  Moreover, it would provide for substantially larger contributions to the  accounts than would the CSSS Model 2 proposal. Under this provision,  individual account contributions would be a larger percentage of payroll  for lower earners than for higher earners. Also, for those who participate  in the accounts, Social Security defined benefits would be reduced to  reflect the payroll taxes redirected into the accounts; this account offset  uses a different formula than does CSSS Model 2.", "To illustrate the distributional effects of CSSS Model 2, we used a  microsimulation model to estimate benefits under it and under our  benchmark policy scenarios. We did not examine the distribution of equity  measures such as benefit-to-tax ratios or rates of return, because the  proposal\u2019s individual account feature requires general revenue transfers.   Since account participation is voluntary, we used two simulations to  examine the effects of the Model 2 provisions, one with universal account  participation (Model 2-100 percent) and one with no account participation  (Model 2-0 percent). We also assumed that all account participants would  invest in the same portfolios; consequently we did not capture any  distributional effect that might occur if lower earners were to make  different account participation or investment decisions than higher  earners.", "According to our simulations, the distribution of benefits under Model 2  could favor lower earners more than the distribution of benefits under  either currently promised or currently funded benefits. For example,  assuming universal account participation, households in the lowest fifth of  earnings may receive about 14 percent of all lifetime benefits under Model  2, compared with about 12.5 percent under the current program. (See fig.  9.)", "It should be noted that while the simulations suggest that the distribution  of benefits under Model 2 is more progressive than under the benchmarks,  this does not mean benefit levels are always higher for the bottom fifth  under Model 2. Progressivity is about how the \"pie\" is divided up, not  about how big the pie is.  So, while Model 2 may improve the relative  position of lower earners, it may not improve the adequacy of their  benefits. (See fig. 10.) According to our simulation, median household  lifetime benefits for the bottom fifth under Model 2-0 percent would be 3  percent higher than under the funded benefits scenario but 21 percent  lower than under the promised benefits scenario. Median household  lifetime benefits for the bottom fifth under Model 2-100 percent would be  26 percent higher than under the funded benefits scenario but 4 percent  lower than under the promised benefits scenario.", "We also simulated each of Model 2\u2019s core features, assuming 100 percent  participation in the individual accounts, to illustrate the distributional  effect of each feature. (See fig. 11.) First we simulated a version of Model  2-100 percent that included the individual accounts and the reductions in  Social Security defined benefits, but not the $1,000 cap on account  contributions or the enhanced benefits for low earners and survivors. Next  we simulated a version that included the defined-benefit reductions and  the individual accounts with the $1,000 cap on account contributions.  Finally, we simulated the complete Model 2-100 percent scenario, which  included the enhanced benefits to lower earners and survivors. While the  proposal\u2019s individual accounts and benefit reductions together may favor  higher earners, this is more than offset by a limit on account contributions  and the enhanced benefits for low earners and survivors. Again, this  assumes that all account participants would invest in the same portfolios.  However, if individuals\u2019 investment decisions varied by earnings level,  then the distribution of income from the accounts would differ from our  simulations.", "It should be emphasized that these simulations are only for individuals  born in 1985, and the distributional impact of Model 2 could be different  for individuals born in later years. For example, under the proposal, initial  Social Security defined benefits only grow with prices, while initial  benefits from account balances grow with wages. Since wages generally  grow faster than prices, Social Security defined benefits will decline as a  proportion of total benefits, reducing the importance of the progressive  benefit formula, disability benefits, and the enhanced benefits for low  earners and survivors.", "It should also be noted that the account feature of Model 2-100 percent  likely exposes recipients to greater financial risk. Greater exposure to risk  may not affect the shares of benefits received by the bottom and top fifths  of earnings. However, greater risk may be more problematic for lower  earners, who likely have fewer resources to fall back on if their accounts  perform poorly."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["By design, Social Security distributes benefits and contributions across  workers and their families in a variety of ways. These distributional effects  illustrate how the program balances the goal of helping ensure adequate  incomes with the goal of giving all workers a fair deal on their  contributions. Any changes to Social Security would potentially alter those  distributional effects and the balance between those goals. Therefore,  policy makers need to understand how to evaluate distributional effects of  alternative policies.", "Several key themes inform this understanding. First, it should be noted  that greater benefit progressivity is not the same thing as greater benefit  adequacy. Under some reform scenarios, Social Security could distribute  benefits more progressively than under current law while providing lower,  less adequate benefits. Secondly, our analysis illustrates that it that is  possible for some reform provisions that may not favor lower earners to  be counterbalanced by other, more favorable ones. Finally, benefit  progressivity is only one of several aspects of balancing adequacy and  equity. As our framework suggests, besides balancing adequacy and equity,  a proposal\u2019s effect on the economy and whether it achieves sustainable  solvency should also be considered, as well as how readily it could be  implemented and explained to the public.", "As we have noted in the past before this committee and elsewhere, a  comprehensive evaluation is needed that considers a range of effects  together. Focusing on comprehensive packages of reforms will enable us  to foster credibility and acceptance. This will help us avoid getting mired  in the details and losing sight of important interactive effects. It will help  build the bridges necessary to achieve consensus.", "The fundamental nature of the program\u2019s long-term financing challenge  means that timely action is needed. I believe it is possible to craft a  solution that will protect Social Security benefits for the nation\u2019s current  and near-term retirees, while ensuring that the system will be there for  future generations. Stated differently, I believe that it is possible to reform  Social Security in a way that will assure the program\u2019s solvency and  sustainability while exceeding the expectations of all generations of  Americans.  In this regard, the sooner we act, the greater the opportunity  to achieve this desirable outcome. It is my hope that we will think about  the unprecedented challenge facing future generations in our aging  society. We need to act now before the approaching demographic tidal  wave makes the imbalances more dramatic and meaningful reform less  feasible. We at GAO look forward to continuing to work with this  Committee and the Congress in addressing this and other important issues  facing our nation. In doing so, we will be true to our core values of  accountability, integrity, and reliability.", "Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, that concludes my  statement.
