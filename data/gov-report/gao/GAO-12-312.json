ACF\u0092s methodology for estimating Foster Care improper payments was approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2004 with the understanding that continuing efforts would be taken to improve the accuracy of ACF\u0092s estimates of improper payments in the ensuing years. ACF, however, continued to generally follow its initial methodology which, when compared to federal statistical guidance and internal control standards, GAO found to be deficient in all three phases of ACF\u0092s estimation methodology\u0097planning, selection, and evaluation.

However, the validity of ACF\u0092s reporting of reduced error rates is questionable. GAO found that ACF\u0092s ability to reliably assess the extent to which its corrective actions reduced improper payments was impaired by weaknesses in its requirements for state-level corrective actions. For example, ACF used the number of cases found in error rather than the dollar amount of improper payments identified to determine whether or not a state was required to implement corrective actions. As such, some states with higher improper payment dollar error rates were not required to implement actions to reduce these rates.

This population of Foster Care cases is drawn from AFCARS. However,  AFCARS does not contain any Title IV-E financial data that links a Title  IV-E payment amount to each case file. Lacking such payment data, ACF  relies on states to provide payment histories for all cases selected for  review. According to ACF, it was already using AFCARS to select  samples for the Title IV-E eligibility reviews prior to IPIA implementation.  Consistent with OMB\u2019s approval of its methodology, ACF opted to use  AFCARS data instead of creating or identifying a new data source for  meeting IPIA requirements.

According  to these standards and guidelines, probabilistic methods for survey  sampling are one of a variety of methods for sampling that give a known,  non-zero, probability of selection to each member of the target population.  The advantage of probabilistic sampling methods is that sampling error  can be calculated. For the purpose of making a valid estimate with a  measurable sampling error that represents a population, the sample must  be selected using probabilistic methods.

Based on our review of the sampling documentation  provided, ACF did not consider key factors such as variation in volume of  payments and dollars of payments across cases and states. In addition,  the population of data that ACF used to select its sample from is not  reliable because ACF\u2019s sampling methodology did not provide for up-front  data quality control procedures to (1) ensure that the population of cases  was complete prior to its sample selection and (2) identify inaccuracies in  the data field used for sample selection.", "During our review, we found that the population of Foster Care cases  from AFCARS contained inaccurate information on whether a case had  actually received a Title IV-E Foster Care maintenance payment during  the period under review, reflecting continuing concerns regarding the  accuracy and completeness of AFCARS data. Specifically, ACF had to  replace a high percentage of cases sampled from the database of Foster  Care cases for the fiscal year 2010 reporting period due to inaccurate  information in AFCARS.

Of the 298 over- sampled cases used to replace the cases initially selected, 63 cases  (more than 21 percent) then had to be replaced again because those  cases had also not received Title IV-E Foster Care maintenance  payments during the period under review.

However, the extent of  underpayments and duplicate or excessive payment errors identified  varied widely by state, and in some instances were not identified at all.  The lack of detailed procedures for identifying any such payment errors  may have contributed to the variation or whether the teams found any  errors.

Of the 21 states  where reviewers had identified underpayments, such payments ranged  from 1.3 percent to 12.0 percent of cases reviewed.

However, the significant  weaknesses discussed previously concerning ACF\u2019s estimation  methodology impaired the accuracy and completeness of ACF\u2019s reported  improper payment estimate for the Foster Care program. Further, we  found that ACF\u2019s ability to reliably assess the extent to which its  corrective actions reduced Foster Care program improper payments was  impaired by deficiencies in (1) its method for requiring when states  implement corrective actions and (2) information technology limitations  related to monitoring states\u2019 Foster Care program-related Single Audit  findings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Deficiencies in ACF\u2019s Requirements for State Foster Care Program Improper Payment Corrective Actions", "paragraphs": ["We identified three deficiencies in ACF\u2019s process for implementing plans  to reduce improper payments.", "ACF did not use reported improper payment error rates\u2014which are  based on the dollar amount of improper payments identified in a  sample of state Foster Care cases\u2014to determine whether or not a  state is required to implement corrective actions.", "ACF\u2019s measure for assessing corrective action effectiveness is  through performance on its secondary review of Title IV-E cases,  which has a more lenient passing standard than the primary review.", "Not all types of payment errors are required to be addressed in the  PIP.", "OMB\u2019s implementing guidance for IPIA requires that agencies put in place  a corrective action plan to reduce improper payments. In addition, ACF\u2019s  internal guidance requires states to implement corrective actions through  a PIP if, during the Title IV-E primary eligibility review, a state is found to  have 5 or more cases in error (exceeding 5 percent of the number of  cases reviewed). While ACF identifies state PIPs as a corrective action  strategy, it does not use the dollar-based estimated improper payments to  determine when a state is required to develop a PIP. Instead, ACF uses  the number of sample cases found in error to determine which states  should develop a PIP. Therefore, some states with improper payment  dollar error rates exceeding 5 percent were not required to implement  corrective actions to reduce these rates. For fiscal year 2010 reporting,  ACF used the results of 44 primary eligibility reviews and 7 secondary  reviews. Of the 44 state primary reviews, 13 had dollar-based estimated  improper payments greater than 5 percent; however, because ACF uses  case error rates as the determining factor for states\u2019 compliance with their  primary reviews, not all states were required to complete a PIP. Of the 13  states, ACF determined 7 were noncompliant in their primary eligibility  reviews because the case error rate exceeded ACF\u2019s threshold of 5  percent (more than 4 of the 80 cases were found in error) and thus, were  required to complete a PIP. The remaining 6 states were found  substantially compliant in their primary reviews as their case error rate  was below the established 5 percent threshold (4 or fewer cases were  found in error). The dollar-based improper payment rates for those 6  states ranged from 5.1 to 19.8 percent\u2014based on the percentage of  improper payment dollars found in the sample. Because improper  payment rates are not used in applying the PIP corrective action strategy,  ACF\u2019s method cannot effectively measure states\u2019 progress over time in  reducing improper payments. It also cannot effectively help determine  whether further action is needed to minimize future improper payments.  This limits the extent to which states are held accountable for the  reduction of improper payments in the Foster Care program.", "Upon a state\u2019s implementation of its PIP, ACF conducts a secondary  review to determine whether errors found during the primary review have  been addressed. The secondary review is ACF\u2019s principal tool to measure  a state\u2019s success in implementing actions to reduce Foster Care program  improper payments. These reviews carry the potential financial penalty of  an extrapolated disallowance of the state\u2019s federal share of Title IV-E  expenditures if the state is found to be noncompliant. However, because  ACF\u2019s error threshold to be found noncompliant with a secondary review  is twice as high as that of the primary review (10 percent versus 5  percent), it limits ACF\u2019s ability to provide an effective incentive for states  to focus continuing attention on causes of improper payments. Based on  our analysis of ACF\u2019s Title IV-E eligibility reviews, 27 states have had at  least one secondary review between 2002 and 2010. Of the 27 states that  received a secondary review, 26 states passed this review (meaning that  the error rates were below the ten percent threshold) and only 1 state  failed. Of the 26 states that passed, 13 states (50 percent) would have  failed if the primary review error threshold of 5 percent was in effect. Of  those 13 states, we found at least 3 states that passed the secondary  review with a case error rate over 10 percent because the reported  improper payment dollar based error rate was below 10 percent.", "The one state that failed its secondary review in 2003 received an  extrapolated disallowance in accordance with HHS regulations. Since the  eligibility reviews began in 2000, this is the only state found to be  noncompliant with its secondary review. While the extrapolated  disallowance is a financial penalty intended to encourage states to  address causes of improper payments, after incurring an extrapolated  disallowance, this state was again found to be noncompliant based on  ACF\u2019s subsequent review in 2006. As such, the state was again required  to develop and implement a PIP to address the causes of errors identified  in this review. After implementing this PIP, the state was subject to  another secondary review and was found to be compliant with a case  error rate of 6.67 percent and dollar error rate of 2.84 percent. However,  this state would have failed if the primary review error threshold of 5  percent was in effect.", "According to ACF officials, it established the 10 percent threshold for  compliance with secondary reviews in 2000 based on states\u2019 error rates  at that time which were between 15 percent and 17 percent (in terms of  both cases and dollars). ACF officials told us the 10 percent appeared to  be a target that states could meet to demonstrate reductions in improper  payments over time. Also, the baseline estimated improper payment error  rate reported for the Foster Care program in 2004 was 10.33 percent.  Since establishing the 10 percent threshold in 2000, ACF has not  conducted a review to validate the continuing propriety of the  performance metric. GAO\u2019s Internal Control Management and Evaluation  Tool provides that an agency should periodically review and validate the  propriety and integrity of both organizational and individual performance  measures and indicators. According to this tool, performance  measurement factors are to be evaluated to ensure they are linked to  mission, goals, and objectives, and that they are balanced and set  appropriate incentives for achieving goals while complying with law,  regulations, and ethical standards. For fiscal year 2010, ACF reported  that error rates for most of the states (33 of 51) were less than 5  percent.", "In addition, ACF\u2019s process for overseeing states\u2019 implementation of  improper payment reduction actions has other weaknesses.

Consequently, states\u2019  corrective action plans may not address all types of previously identified  payment errors. There is nothing in the guidance to prevent states from  addressing other areas in the PIP. However, based on our review of the  guidance for developing PIPs and discussions with Central Office and  regional office staff, underpayments and other non-eligibility errors and  eligibility errors outside of the period under review might not be  addressed in the PIP if these types of errors were not a factor in a state\u2019s  compliance.

HHS provided a summary of refinements that it had made to  its improper payment estimation methodology over the years and also  provided information on additional steps it planned to take. HHS stated  that our analysis would be a helpful resource as it continued to improve  its process. With regard to our seven recommendations to help improve  ACF\u2019s methodology to estimate improper payments and its corrective  action process, HHS generally concurred with four of the  recommendations and agreed to continue to study the remaining three  recommendations. HHS also provided technical comments that we  incorporated, as appropriate.", "HHS generally concurred with three recommendations we made related  to improving the improper payment estimation methodology for the Foster  Care program. Specifically, HHS generally agreed to (1) estimate and  report improper payments related to administrative costs, (2) provide  specific procedures to identify and report any underpayments and  duplicate or excessive payment errors, and (3) revise procedures for  calculating the aggregate state-level margins of error to derive an overall,  inflation adjusted, program estimate. HHS described several actions  currently under way to address these recommendations. Regarding the  first recommendation, HHS noted that it was continuing to pilot test the  Administrative Cost Reviews, described in this report, in fiscal year 2012;  however, HHS\u2019s response did not indicate when it expects these reviews  will be fully implemented. In its response to the second recommendation,  HHS stated that additional guidance for identifying and reporting  underpayments and duplicate or excessive payment errors will be  included in the updated Eligibility Review Guide and review instrument  during the fiscal year 2012 review cycle. For the third recommendation,  HHS stated that it can and will adjust its calculation to incorporate  individual state margins of error in aggregating the state-level estimates  into the national program estimate. However, HHS also stated that it will  seek to determine whether making this revision would add sufficient value  given that the estimate spans 3 years and that inflation is relatively low.  We maintain that both aggregating state-level margins of error and  factoring for inflation are needed to implement a statistically valid method  for estimating improper payments.", "For the other recommendation we made related to the improper payment  estimation methodology for the Foster Care program, HHS stated it would  continue to study our recommendation to develop and implement a  statistically valid Foster Care improper payment methodology based on  complete and accurate payment data. HHS agreed that it should use the  best data available. In its comments on our draft report, HHS  acknowledged that it would be optimal to conduct a separate data  collection to obtain a universe of Title IV-E payments, but stated that it  needs to balance the goal of appropriate measurement with the cost and  burden placed on states. HHS described the quality controls in place over  the AFCARS data to help ensure the information is complete and  accurate prior to selecting case samples for its Title IV-E eligibility  reviews, which form the basis for its Foster Care improper payment    estimate. Examples of such controls include automated system edit  checks within AFCARS, AFCARS Assessment Reviews, and other  outreach efforts to improve state AFCARS reporting. Our report describes  some of the steps ACF has taken to address AFCARS data quality, but  we also point out limitations in these efforts. For example, the AFCARS  Assessment Reviews are not conducted annually for all states and do not  address verifying the accuracy or completeness of the specific data  element that ACF uses to develop its population of foster care cases for  estimating improper payments. HHS also stated that its use of  oversample cases demonstrated that its sampling and oversampling  process is working properly to exclude cases that do not meet the  selection criteria. While this process would identify some cases that did  not meet ACF\u2019s selection criteria, our point in this report is that ACF\u2019s  extensive reliance on the use of oversampling in its methodology is  indicative that the population of cases could contain additional  inaccuracies that may not be identified through its existing process.  Further, as we stated in our report, neither we nor ACF were able to  determine the completeness of the universe of cases used to estimate  Foster Care improper payments, that is, whether all cases that had  actually received a Title IV-E payment were properly coded as such.  Thus, the issues we identified with ACF\u2019s sampling methodology,  provides limited assurance that the reported improper payment estimate  accurately and completely represents the extent of improper maintenance  payments in the Foster Care program.", "With respect to our three recommendations to help ensure corrective  strategies effectively reduce Foster Care improper payments, HHS  concurred with one recommendation related to establishing and  implementing procedures for periodic assessments of state-level  improper payment target levels. HHS also agreed to consider another  recommendation to develop and implement corrective action procedures  whenever a state\u2019s estimated improper payment dollar error rate exceeds  a specified target level for the program in conjunction with the  recommendation it concurred with to implement periodic assessments.  HHS highlighted several actions it plans to take to enhance its efforts to  reduce improper payments, such as taking steps to reexamine and  explore the feasibility for lowering the error rate threshold and considering  ways to enhance existing Eligibility Review Guide instructions to address  any eligibility review findings that involve improper payments not  specifically requiring development of a corrective action plan. HHS stated  that it plans to further study our recommendation to enhance ARTMS  reporting capabilities to provide data on the status of actions taken to  address Single Audit findings concerning states\u2019 Foster Care program  payments. HHS stated that the agency would study the value of potential  enhancements to ARTMS in light of the significant relevant data already  available (such as audit information by federal program, grantee name,  audit resolution status, and audit periods). Although these data elements  are currently available in ARTMS, search results are presented by  individual audit reports and include limited information. For example, the  search results provide only the number of findings associated with a  specific audit report but do not provide details of the individual audit  findings that would allow program managers to analyze, for example,  trends in the types of findings in states in order to ensure that any  systemic issues are addressed.

We reviewed  applicable states\u2019 PIPs for the period 2001 through 2010. We also  inquired of ACF officials from the Program Implementation Division  within the Children\u2019s Bureau about other monitoring activities in place  for states that did not have a PIP in place for IPIA reporting in fiscal  year 2010.", "Assessed compliance thresholds ACF uses to require states to  implement corrective actions against actual performance data to  assess the propriety of established performance measures. As part of  this analysis, we reviewed our internal control standards as guidance  to assess ACF\u2019s evaluation of states\u2019 efforts to implement corrective  actions.", "Conducted a walkthrough of ACF\u2019s Audit Resolution Tracking and  Monitoring System (ARTMS) to obtain an understanding of ACF\u2019s  monitoring activities to track and resolve state\u2019s Single Audit findings  for the Foster Care program. In addition, we interviewed officials in  ACF\u2019s Office of Information Services and the Division of Financial  Integrity located in the Central Office and selected representative  regional offices such as Regional Program Managers, and program  and fiscal specialists to determine how ARTMS is used to identify and  correct vulnerabilities that could lead to improper payments.", "Examined states\u2019 reported Single Audit findings for fiscal years 2008  through 2010 from ARTMS and a listing of HHS OIG reports on the  Foster Care program to identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses in  states\u2019 operations that may not have been identified through ACF\u2019s  Title IV-E eligibility reviews.", "Reviewed agency policies and procedures such as ACF\u2019s Title IV-E  Foster Care Eligibility Review Guide issued in March 2006 which  includes the Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility On-Site Review  Instrument and Instructions; ACF\u2019s user guide for ARTMS, version  1.2; and ACF\u2019s FY 2010 Corrective Action Plan to Reduce the  Estimate Rate of Improper Payments in the Foster Care Program,  dated November 12, 2010.", "In addition, we conducted site visits to three of ACF\u2019s ten regional  offices (Philadelphia, PA; Chicago, IL; and San Francisco, CA). These  three regional offices provided oversight of states who collectively  claimed over half of the total federal share of Foster Care payments  made in fiscal year 2009, the most recent data available at the time of  our review for site visit selection. We also selected these regional  offices to achieve variation in the numbers of error cases and amount  of disallowed claims found during Title IV-E eligibility reviews, which  ACF conducts to help ensure that states are claiming federal  reimbursement only for eligible children. One region represented the  highest number of error cases found in the Title IV-E eligibility reviews  and the highest maintenance payment disallowance. Another region  had the largest amount of foster care maintenance payments in fiscal  year 2009 and the states within this region had high improper  payment rates. Another region had a low number of error cases and  improper payment issues relative to the high amount of maintenance  payments it made to states in its purview. During these site visits, we  interviewed agency personnel such as program managers, regional  grants officers, and financial specialists to gain an understanding of  how Title IV-E eligibility reviews are conducted and how the regional  offices work with states on corrective actions and follow up on Single  Audit findings. We also inquired about other ACF monitoring activities  over states to address financial management weaknesses.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2011 through March  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions, based on our audit objectives.
