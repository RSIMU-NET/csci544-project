DOD conducted a limited evaluation to address the congressional concern about how well the services are administering their programs. The response consisted largely of program descriptions provided by the services.

The  Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB) program is intended to help the  services increase reenlistments in occupational specialties, such as  linguists and information technology specialists, that the Secretary of  Defense deems to be critical. Concerned about missing their overall  retention goals in the late 1990s, all the services expanded their use of  SRBs to help retain more enlisted personnel. As a result, the cost of the  program more than doubled\u2014from $308 million in fiscal 1997 to  $791 million in fiscal 2002. During the last few years, Congress also  approved DOD requests for basic pay increases above the rate of inflation  to address the services\u2019 retention concerns. Despite military pay increases  and improved overall retention, funding for the services\u2019 SRB budget is  expected to rise to over $800 million in fiscal year 2005. Moreover, about  one-third of all current reenlistments receive SRBs.", "To facilitate closer monitoring of the SRB program, congressional defense  committees requested our 1995 and 2002 reviews of the program. The  House Appropriations Committee also mandated our current review of  DOD's recently issued report on the program. In our 2002 report, we  identified several management and oversight concerns. For example, some  services were not using all the criteria they had established for selecting  occupational specialties to receive bonuses; the numbers of both  reenlistments and SRB-eligible specialties had grown substantially since  1998; and critical program guidance canceled in 1996 had not been  reissued. Among other things, we recommended that DOD conduct annual  reviews of the services\u2019 SRB programs as required by its directive. In  concurring with our recommendation, DOD noted that a future DOD  directive would not require formal annual reviews of the program. Rather,  these reviews would be accomplished through other means that we  concluded were very limited in scope. In our 1996 report, we also  raised concerns about SRB program management and oversight. Our  recommendations included that DOD (1) provide more explicit guidance  and criteria for determining SRB skills and (2) monitor the services\u2019  adherence to this guidance. DOD did not concur with either of these  recommendations.", "In a House Report accompanying the Department of Defense fiscal year  2003 appropriation bill, you expressed concern that DOD guidance and  oversight of the SRB program was limited and that \u201ca reassessment of the  program was warranted to ensure it is being managed efficiently.\u201d The  Committee directed the Secretary of Defense to report back to the  committee on five concerns and directed us to review and assess the DOD  report. Those five concerns were (1) effectiveness of the SRB program in  correcting retention shortfalls in critical occupations, (2) replacement  program guidance and how that guidance will ensure that the program  targets only critical specialties that impact readiness, (3) steps DOD  will take to match program execution with appropriated funding,  (4) evaluation of the process the services use to administer the program,  and (5) advantages and disadvantages of paying bonuses as a single lump  sum payment. DOD issued its report in May 2003. In introductory  remarks, DOD\u2019s report stated that the services manage their SRB  programs carefully, offer bonuses sparingly, have management standards  and practices to conduct a review of each skill receiving a bonus, and do  an excellent job tailoring their SRB programs to changing demands for  specific skills. Also, the need for flexibility in administering the program  was a theme present throughout DOD\u2019s report.", "In August 2003, we briefed your staff on our preliminary observations  of DOD\u2019s report. We provide our final assessment in this review. Our  objective was to determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s report thoroughly  addressed the five SRB program management concerns raised in the  congressional mandate.", "To conduct our work, we examined DOD\u2019s mandated report on its SRB  program, along with supporting documentation from the services and the  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). We also referred to our 2002  report and DOD\u2019s comments on that report. We conducted our review and  assessment from June through September 2003 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

The budget is estimated to grow to $803 million in fiscal year  2005, with most of the projected growth resulting from increases in the  Air Force SRB program budget. Our 2002 report noted that in fiscal year  2001 the Air Force extended reenlistment bonuses to 80 percent of  its specialties.", "In recent years, Congress has appropriated less money than the  services have requested for the SRB program. Based on our work, in  fiscal 2003 Congress appropriated $32 million less than DOD requested.  Congressional committees proposed further SRB budget reductions  during their reviews of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget request. The House  Appropriations Committee proposed a $44.6-million reduction; the Senate  Appropriations Committee, a $22-million reduction; and the Senate Armed  Services Committee, a $46-million reduction. The Senate Armed Services  Committee additionally noted concerns about proposed SRB program  budget increases at a time when overall retention rates are robust and the  benefits of military service are increasing overall. DOD appealed these  proposed reductions, noting that \u201cthe effects of an improving economy  and the waning emotional patriotic high of the decisive victory in  Operation Iraqi Freedom will combine to increase pressures on both  the recruiting and retention programs.\u201d For fiscal year 2004, Congress  appropriated $697 million for the SRB program, which was a reduction of  $38.6 million from the amount DOD requested.", "Despite increased use of the SRB program, DOD has cited continued  retention problems in specialized occupations such as air traffic  controller, linguist, and information technology specialist. A more  favorable picture is present with regard to overall retention. All of the  services reported that they met overall retention goals for fiscal year 2002  and, with the exception of the Air Force missing its retention goal for  second term airmen, expect to meet overall retention goals in fiscal year  2003. Further bolstering these retention expectations are recent survey  results showing improvements in servicemembers\u2019 attitudes toward  remaining in the military. For example, the 2002 DOD-wide status of forces  survey found that the career intent of military personnel had improved  between 1999 and 2002, rising from 50 to 58 percent. The survey results  showed that retention attitudes were particularly better for junior enlisted  (up 11 percent) and junior officers (up 13 percent). In addition, the 2002  Air Force-wide quality of life survey found that 66 percent of enlisted  personnel reported they would make the Air Force a career, which is an  increase from 58 percent, reported in 1997. According to DOD officials,  the effects of more recent events such as extended deployments and other  higher operations tempo issues could change servicemembers\u2019 attitudes  toward remaining in the military.", "Congressionally approved reforms in basic pay implemented during the  last 3 years were intended in part to address retention problems,  particularly with mid-grade enlisted personnel. In the 2002 Quadrennial  Review of Military Compensation, DOD attributed the increased use of  SRBs in the late 1990s to a growing pay discrepancy between civilians  and the mid-career enlisted force. For that period, the review noted an  increased use of bonuses for personnel with 10 to 14 years of service. DOD  noted that while bonuses are a very important compensation tool, their  use is intended for specific purposes and for relatively short periods  of time. According to that review, bonuses are appropriate for use within  particular skill categories, not as a tool for resolving military and  civilian pay differentials across an entire segment of the force. The  report noted that widespread pay differentials should be remedied  through pay table restructuring. Pay table restructuring began in fiscal  year 2001, and additional military pay adjustments have been approved  in subsequent budgets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Report Did Not Thoroughly Address Congressional Concerns", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s May 2003 report did not thoroughly address four of the five  congressional concerns about effective and efficient management of  the SRB program.

Second, DOD did not permit us to review the draft guidance, but\u2014based  on DOD\u2019s comments on our 2002 SRB report, excerpts of draft criteria  contained in DOD\u2019s mandated report, and our discussions with DOD  officials\u2014the replacement guidance could expand the SRB program by  giving the services more flexibility in designating occupations as critical  and either eliminate or weaken the requirement for annual SRB program  reviews. Third, OSD did not outline steps to match program execution to  appropriated funding as the mandate required; instead, OSD reiterated the  need for program-execution flexibility. Fourth, OSD\u2019s evaluation of the  services\u2019 administration of their SRBs program was limited, relied largely  on service-provided descriptions, and did not use consistent procedures  and metrics.

In response to  one of the other four congressional concerns, DOD stated that the \u201cintent  of retention bonuses is to influence personnel inventories in specific  situations in which less costly methods have proven inadequate or  impractical.\u201d The report did not, however, document what methods had  been used previously or the cost-effectiveness of those methods in  achieving desired retention levels.", "Also absent from the report was a discussion of how key factors influence  the current use of SRBs. Examples of key factors include the effects of  changes in the basic pay, overall retention rates, and civilian  unemployment. For example:    Despite increasing basic pay to address the discrepancy between military  and civilian pay noted in the 2002 Quadrennial Review of Military  Compensation, the budgets for the SRB program are projected to grow to  $803 million in fiscal year 2005. In comments received on our preliminary  observations briefing, DOD officials noted that our use of constant 2004  dollars in our budget trend analysis did not fully account for the effects of  the basic pay changes that exceeded the inflation level and thus increased  the size of individual bonuses. At the same time, future SRB program  budgets do not show decreases that might be expected as these pay table  changes address overall military-civilian pay discrepancies and problems  identified within various pay grades.", "The report did not address the extent to which recent higher levels of  overall retention offer opportunities for reducing the number of  occupations eligible for SRBs or the bonus amounts awarded for  reenlistment. DOD officials have noted that all of the services met or  exceeded their aggregate retention goals in fiscal year 2002 and that strong  overall retention is expected to continue. However, they cited retention  shortfalls in some occupational specialties as areas of concern. Although a  generally positive aggregate retention climate might present DOD with  opportunities to curtail use of its SRB program, the report did not discuss  under what conditions reductions in the program might or might not be  appropriate at this time.", "Despite noting a relationship between civilian unemployment rates  and military retention, DOD\u2019s report did not indicate whether civilian  unemployment\u2014which is at a 9-year high\u2014might result in the need for  fewer SRBs being offered and possibly at lower bonus levels. One study  cited in DOD\u2019s report noted that there is a relationship between higher  unemployment rates and improved overall military retention. In part of its  answer to concern three, DOD noted that changes in the economy and  labor market drive changes in actual reenlistment rates. Just as periods of  relatively lower civilian unemployment might suggest the need for greater  use of the SRB program, periods of relatively higher unemployment might  conversely suggest less need for SRBs. Despite civilian unemployment  being at its highest rate in several years, the SRB program budget is  projected to increase in fiscal year 2005.", "Instead of directly addressing program effectiveness and efficiency,  the 2003 report discussed the general benefits of using bonuses to  retain military personnel. DOD\u2019s report cited numerous studies that  demonstrated or postulated this effect. However, findings from some  studies may not be readily generalized to the way that the SRB program  is currently managed or to the economic conditions that currently exist.  More specifically, some studies used outdated retention data obtained in  the mid-1970s or were performed in a very different retention environment  (e.g., the increase in force size during the 1980s and the large draw-down  of military forces in the 1990s). Even given our concerns about some of the  findings, we believe DOD presented sufficient support for its conclusion  that bonuses can be effective in promoting retention. A largely  unaddressed, but more pertinent issue is how effectively and efficiently  DOD applied this tool to improve retention in critical occupations under  recent and current economic conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Replacement Program Guidance Not Issued but Proposed Changes Could Weaken Controls for Targeting SRBs", "paragraphs": ["DOD did not permit us to review the draft guidance that will replace the  current DOD directive and the DOD instruction canceled in 1996. Our  findings for this concern are based on DOD\u2019s comments on our 2002 SRB  report, excerpts of draft criteria contained in DOD\u2019s mandated report, and  our discussions with DOD officials. Changes to the guidance could lower  the threshold required for designating occupations as critical and may  eliminate or weaken the requirement for formal annual reviews of the  SRB program.", "DOD\u2019s planned changes to the replacement guidance could provide the  services with greater flexibility for designating a specialty as critical but  could weaken the controls for targeting the specialties receiving SRBs  by lowering the threshold required for making such a designation. The  canceled 1996 instruction required the services to consider five criteria  before designating a specialty critical and making it eligible for SRBs,  but DOD\u2019s 2003 report stated that the revised program instruction would  require occupations to meet a lower threshold\u2014meeting \u201cat least\u201d one of  five criteria. For the period since 1996 when the instruction was canceled,  our 2002 report found that, in some cases, the services had already been  using only one of the five criteria to designate occupations for inclusion in  the program. This allowed the services to define broadly what constituted  a critical occupation and included more occupations than would have  likely qualified if all five criteria had been considered.", "DOD\u2019s planned changes could also eliminate or weaken the requirement  for formal annual reviews of the SRB program and thereby weaken the  ability of Congress and DOD to monitor the program and ensure that it  targets only critical specialties. To implement the SRB program, DOD  Directive 1304.21 assigns specific responsibilities for administering the  program to the OSD and to the service Secretaries. According to this  directive, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management  Policy, under the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness, is responsible for annually reviewing and evaluating the  services\u2019 enlisted personnel bonus programs in conjunction with the  annual budget cycle. These reviews are to include an assessment of the  criteria used for designating critical military specialties. As a result of  these reviews, the OSD is to make the revisions needed to attain specific  policy objectives. Our 2002 report found that DOD had not conducted any  of the required annual program reviews since 1991. In its response to our  2002 SRB report, DOD stated that it plans to eliminate those requirements  from the replacement guidance. More recently, a DOD official stated that  the new guidance will require periodic reviews, but neither the frequency  nor the details of how these reviews would be conducted was explained.  In its report to Congress, DOD maintained that much of the SRB program  oversight takes place during ongoing internal service program budget  reviews. In contrast, we concluded in our 2002 report that those program  budget reviews were limited in scope and did not provide the detailed  evaluation needed to ensure the program was being implemented as  intended. A more in-depth discussion of the current limited oversight is  provided when we discuss DOD\u2019s response to the fourth concern.", "In contrast to the previously mentioned changes, DOD\u2019s report noted  some steps that we believe could strengthen controls on the SRB program.  According to the report, the new SRB program instruction will (1) require  the services to establish parameters to define \u201ccritical shortages\u201d and  (2) base those requirements on factors such as the potential impact of a  shortage on mission accomplishment. In addition, DOD has recently  established a working group that has been tasked with developing a  \u201ccommon understanding and definition of critical skills.\u201d Previously, we  found that DOD had not clearly defined the criteria the services were to  use in designating critical occupations since the SRB program instruction  was canceled in 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Report Outlined No New Steps to Match Program Execution with Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Contrary to the mandate, DOD\u2019s 2003 report did not outline steps that  it will take to match program execution with appropriated funding.  Instead, DOD stated that the services need execution flexibility and have  operated consistent with the law and within the overall Military Personnel  appropriation. Our trend analysis in current year dollars showed that the  services spent a combined total of $259 million more than Congress  appropriated for the SRB program in fiscal years 1999-2002. DOD\u2019s use  of this flexibility has resulted in the services overspending their SRB  budgets by as much as $111 million in a single year\u2014fiscal year 2001.  More recently, two of the services stayed within their appropriated  budgets. In fiscal year 2002, the Air Force and Marine Corps spent,  respectively, $26 million and $4 million less than their fiscal year 2002 SRB  appropriation. However, the Army and Navy exceeded their appropriated  SRB budgets by $38 million and $21 million, respectively.", "DOD noted that the services can reallocate funds within the Military  Personnel appropriation without seeking congressional authority. In the  report, DOD did not agree with the congressional concern that program  expenditures needed to match funding levels appropriated specifically for  the SRB program. Rather, DOD maintained that monies were available  from other parts of the Military Personnel appropriation if a service  needed additional SRB funding in a fiscal year. DOD\u2019s response noted that  budget submission timelines require reenlistment forecasts up to 2 years  prior to execution and that intervening changes in the economy and labor  market can add uncertainty and drive changes in actual reenlistment rates.  Using the services in-year, or current estimates\u2014created during the year  of program execution\u2014we found that the services had exceeded their  fiscal year 1999-2002 estimates for the number of expected SRB  reenlistments by a combined total of 32,466 personnel. Furthermore, our  current trend analysis on their budget justifications showed that for the  Army and Navy, reallocation or reprogramming of funds had become a  reoccurring pattern of activity.

We generally concur with DOD\u2019s observations about the  positive and negative aspects of using lump sum bonuses. DOD\u2019s report  cited a 1985 GAO study that found lump sum payments had three main  advantages: more cost-effective, better visibility to Congress, and more  adaptable to budget cuts than paying bonuses incrementally. The 2003  DOD report cited another important consideration in awarding bonuses  in lump sum payments. Because enlisted personnel prefer \u201cup-front\u201d  payments and are willing to receive less money initially than more money  offered in the future, we believe that the federal government could reenlist  more personnel for the same amount of money if bonuses were paid in a  lump sum.", "DOD cited several disadvantages to using a lump sum payment option. For  example, there are significant up-front costs associated with paying both  lump sum SRB payments in the implementation year and completing the  anniversary payments for SRBs awarded previously. The first year of  change would require the largest budget increase, and each subsequent  transition year would become less costly. The implementation of a lump  sum SRB program could become cost neutral over the long term if  bonuses paid in a lump sum eliminated the need for equal amounts of  anniversary payments in succeeding years. It could even save money if  sufficient reenlistees were attracted with less money because up-front  compensation\u2014even if less\u2014is more attractive than compensation  promised in the future.", "DOD\u2019s report addressed other potential disadvantages of using a lump sum  payment method. These include the possibility that a recipient will fail to  stay in the military for the full reenlistment period after receiving a bonus  and the problem associated with recouping all or part of bonus amounts  from personnel who do not complete their obligated term of service.  Despite these disadvantages, our 1985 report stated our support for the  use of lump sum retention bonuses. The Marine Corps began using the  lump sum payment option for its SRB program in fiscal year 2001 and is  the only service currently using this payment method. In February 2004,  the Marine Corps expects to have preliminary results from an evaluation  of its use of lump sum payments.", "Although not required by the mandate to do so, DOD and the services  could have made the response to concern five more informative for  Congress by identifying alternative strategies for implementing the lump  sum option and estimating the costs of each strategy for each service.

For example, we reviewed the eight studies cited in DOD\u2019s response to  concern one in the mandate. In addition, we reviewed information  provided by each of the services, as well as past GAO and DOD reports on  the SRB program. We compared findings from these past reports to DOD\u2019s  mandated responses to assess the validity of what was presented. We  updated the program budget analysis from our 2002 review using budget  data contained in DOD\u2019s Military Personnel budget justification books  prepared for Congress. We sought to review updated SRB program  guidance, but DOD indicated that these pre-decisional documents would  not be released until the final versions had been approved.", "We met with DOD officials to update information obtained during our 2002  review of the SRB program. Interviews were primarily conducted with  officials in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness because these officials were the primary authors of DOD\u2019s  report. We also met with personnel responsible for administering the  services\u2019 SRB programs. We obtained updated retention data contained in  prepared statements used by DOD during congressional hearings. We also  reviewed the results of DOD\u2019s 2002 status of forces survey and the Air  Force\u2019s 2002 quality of life survey.", "We conducted our review from June through September 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
