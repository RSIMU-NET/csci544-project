However, the extent of these effects is uncertain and depends, according to stakeholders, on several other factors, such as market conditions and prices.", "Production . One study GAO reviewed found that oil and gas production could decrease by less than 2 percent per year if royalty rates increased from their current 12.5 percent to 22.5 percent, based on fiscal year 2016 production data. Another study stated the effect on production could be \u201cnegligible\u201d over 10 years if royalty rates increased to 18.75 percent, particularly if the increased federal royalty rate remained equal to or below the royalty rates for production on state or private lands. Regarding coal, one study suggested that raising the federal royalty rate for coal to 17 percent would decrease production on federal lands by up to 3 percent after changes were fully implemented after 2025, while a second study said that increasing the effective rate\u2014the rate actually paid by companies after processing and transportation allowances have been factored in, along with any royalty rate reductions\u2014might decrease production on federal lands by less than 1 percent per year. Some stakeholders said that several other factors could influence the extent to which oil, gas, and coal production might decline. For example, some stakeholders said current market conditions, the cost advantages of different resources, and the regulatory burden associated with production on federal lands could influence the extent to which production might decline.", "Revenue . The oil and gas studies that GAO reviewed estimated that raising the federal royalty rate could increase net federal revenue between $5 million and $38 million per year. One of the studies stated that net federal revenue would increase under three scenarios that modeled raising the royalty rate from the current 12.5 percent to 16.67 percent, 18.75 percent, or 22.5 percent, while the other study noted that the effect on federal revenue would initially be small but would increase over time. Both coal studies suggested that a higher royalty rate could lead to an increase in federal revenues. One of the studies suggested that raising the royalty rate to 17 percent or 29 percent might increase federal revenue by up to $365 million per year after 2025. The other study suggested that increasing the effective rate could bring in an additional $141 million per year in royalty revenue. Stakeholders GAO interviewed cited other factors that could influence the extent to which raising federal royalty rates could increase revenues\u2014in particular, how bonus bids, another revenue source, could be affected. Some of the stakeholders stated that companies would be more likely to offer lower bids to obtain a lease for the rights to extract resources if they had to pay higher royalties."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Production of oil, gas, and coal on federal lands is an important part of the  nation\u2019s energy portfolio and generates billions of dollars annually in  revenue for the federal government. In fiscal year 2016, the Department  of the Interior (Interior) reported collecting about $2.5 billion associated  with onshore oil, gas, and coal production on federal lands. These  revenues came primarily from royalties paid on the value of the resources  produced.

During that time, we have made recommendations to  Interior related to oil, gas, and coal royalties. Although it has not met the criteria for removal from our High-Risk List, Interior has taken some steps  to strengthen how it manages federal oil and gas resources. For  example, Interior adopted regulations that provide BLM with the flexibility  to make timely changes to onshore oil and gas royalty rates, as we  recommended in December 2013. In addition, after we recommended in  December 2013 that BLM revise its guidance regarding management of  the coal program, the agency revised its guidance to better ensure it  obtains a fair market value for federal coal resources.", "Interior has undertaken other actions intended to improve its  management of federal oil, gas, and coal resources. For example, in  2016, BLM began preparing a programmatic environmental impact  statement of the federal coal program that included reviewing an option to  raise the federal royalty rate, among other alternatives. Work on the  programmatic environmental impact statement was terminated in March  2017, and in the same month, the Secretary of the Interior signed a  charter establishing a Royalty Policy Committee to provide regular advice  on the fair market value of federal and Indian mineral and energy leases  and the collection of revenues from them. In reexamining aspects of how  it collects revenues associated with oil, gas, and coal production on  federal lands, BLM has solicited and received public comments.

BLM offers for lease parcels of land nominated by  industry and the public, as well as some parcels that BLM itself identifies.  If BLM receives any bids, called bonus bids, on an offered lease that are  at or above a minimum acceptable bid amount, the lease is awarded to  the highest bidder, and, for oil and gas, a lump-sum payment in the  amount of the bid is due to ONRR when BLM issues the lease. For coal,  the winning bidder pays the bonus bid in five equal payments, with one of  the payments being paid at the time of the lease sale. For oil and gas  leases, BLM requires a uniform national minimum acceptable bid of $2  per acre. For coal leases, BLM requires a minimum bid of $100 per acre, and the bid must meet or exceed BLM\u2019s estimate of the fair market  value of the lease.", "In addition to the competitive bidding process, companies may obtain  leases through two additional processes. For oil and gas, tracts of land  that do not receive a bid in the initial offer are made available  noncompetitively the next day and remain available for noncompetitive  leasing for a period of 2 years after the initial competitive auction, with  priority given to offers based on the date and time of filing. For coal,  companies may request that a certain amount of contiguous land be  added to an existing lease in what is called a lease modification  process. Lands acquired through lease modification are added to the  existing lease without a competitive bidding process, but the federal  government must receive the fair market value of the lease of the added  lands either by cash payment or adjustment of the royalty applicable to  the lands added to the lease.", "Leases specify a rental rate\u2014a fixed annual charge until production  begins on the leased land, or, when no production occurs, until the end of  the period specified in the lease. For oil and gas leases, generally the  rental rate is $1.50 per acre for the first 5 years and $2 per acre each  year thereafter. For coal, the rental rate is at least $3 per acre. Oil and  gas parcels are generally leased for a primary term of 10 years, but lease  terms may be extended if, for example, oil or gas is produced in paying  quantities. Coal parcels are leased for an initial 20-year period and may  be extended if certain conditions are met."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Royalty Rates for Federal and Nonfederal Lands", "paragraphs": ["Once production of the resource starts, the federal government is to  receive royalty payments based on a percentage of the value of  production\u2014known as the royalty rate. For onshore oil and gas leases,  the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 sets the royalty rate for competitive  leases at not less than 12.5 percent of the amount or value of  production. However, until January 2017, BLM regulations generally  established a fixed royalty rate of 12.5 percent. For noncompetitive  leases, the act, as amended, sets the royalty rate at a fixed rate of 12.5  percent. For coal, royalty rates depend on the type of mine\u2014surface or  underground. BLM is authorized to establish royalty rates above 12.5  percent for surface mines, but according to agency officials, BLM  generally sets the rate at 12.5 percent, the statutory and regulatory  minimum royalty rate. For underground mines, BLM sets the rate at 8  percent, the rate prescribed in regulation. Royalties for oil and gas are  calculated based on the value of the resource at the wellhead, and any  deductions or allowances are taken after the royalty rate is applied. For  coal, certain costs are deducted from the price of coal at the first point of  sale, including transportation and processing allowances, before the  amount is calculated for royalty purposes. The royalty rate paid by the  coal company after such allowable deductions have been factored in,  along with any royalty rate reductions, is called the effective royalty rate.", "Federal royalty rates differ from the royalty rates that state governments  charge for production on state lands and the rates that companies pay for  production on private lands.

According to state officials, as of  March 2017, royalty rates for oil and gas production charged by these  states vary but tend to be higher than federal royalty rates, while royalty  rates for coal production charged by these states are generally the same  as federal rates. Less is known about the royalty rates for production on  private lands because of the proprietary nature of lease contracts, but a  few published reports suggest that private royalty rates range from 12.5  percent to 25 percent for oil and gas production and from 3 percent to 10  percent for coal production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Production on Federal and Nonfederal Lands", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2016, approximately 157 million barrels of oil, 3.14 trillion  cubic feet of gas, and 295 million tons of coal were produced on federal  lands, according to ONRR data.

The federal government collected  approximately $2.5 billion in gross revenue from the production of these  resources on federal lands in fiscal year 2016. The majority of this  revenue generally has come from royalties\u2014about $2 billion, or 80  percent of total revenues in fiscal year 2016. As figure 1 shows,  royalties comprised a larger percentage of the total revenue from oil and  gas production than from coal production in 2016.

Overall oil and gas production has increased after decades of  decline or general stability\u2014between 2008 and 2016, total U.S. oil  production increased by 77 percent and gas production increased by 35  percent. During that same period, federal onshore oil production  increased by 59 percent while federal onshore gas production declined by  18 percent. According to EIA, almost all of the increase in overall oil and  gas production has centered on oil and gas plays located in shale and  other tight rock formations, spurred by advances in production  technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.  However, as figure 2 shows, major tight oil and shale gas plays\u2014those  plays that, according to EIA data, have represented more than 90 percent  of growth in oil and gas development from 2011 to 2016\u2014are mostly  located on nonfederal lands.

Federal coal production declined 19  percent from 2008 to 2015, while total U.S. coal production declined more  than 23 percent in the same period. According to EIA, the decline in  total U.S. coal production can be attributed to a lower international  demand for coal, increased environmental regulations, and low natural  gas prices (natural gas is an alternative for coal in the electricity market).  As figure 3 shows, about 5 percent of the major coal basins in the  contiguous United States overlapped federal lands in 2013, according to  our analysis of EIA and U.S. Geological Survey data.

Increasing royalty rates would increase the  total costs for producers, thus making production on federal lands less  attractive to companies, according to some stakeholders. Companies  may respond by producing less on federal lands and more on nonfederal  lands. However, stakeholders disagreed about the extent to which  production could decrease because they said other factors may influence  energy companies\u2019 development decisions.", "Oil and gas. We identified two studies\u2014one by the CBO and one by  Enegis, LLC\u2014that modeled the effects of different policy scenarios on oil  and gas production on federal lands. Both studies suggested that a  higher royalty rate could decrease production on federal lands by either a  small amount or not at all. The CBO study concluded that raising the  royalty rate to 18.75 percent would lead to \u201creductions in production   would be small or even negligible\u201d over 10 years, particularly if the  increased federal royalty rate remained equal to or below the royalty rates  for production on state or private lands. As discussed above, the current  12.5 percent federal royalty rate is generally the same or lower than rates  charged by the six states in which more than 90 percent of federal oil and  gas was produced in fiscal year 2015. In addition, the Enegis, LLC, study  showed that demand for new federal competitive leases\u2014or the extent to  which oil and gas companies would compete for new leases\u2014would  generally decrease over 25 years if the royalty rate were raised to 16.67  percent, 18.75 percent, or 22.5 percent. For each of these three royalty  rate increases, the study examined several different scenarios that varied  with respect to key factors, including company costs and company  responses. The study showed declines in production under all scenarios  except those in which companies completely absorbed the higher costs  resulting from higher royalty rates. In scenarios in which companies could  absorb the costs\u2014potentially in market conditions in which higher oil and  gas prices help buffer companies from the effects of increased royalty  rates\u2014there would be no change in production levels. The three  increased royalty rates modeled resulted in oil production declines  ranging from 0 barrels to approximately 70 million barrels over 25 years  (or, about 2.8 million barrels per year\u2014the equivalent of about 1.8  percent of fiscal year 2016 onshore federal oil production). The three  increased royalty rates modeled also resulted in gas production declines  over 25 years ranging from 0 cubic feet to 85 billion cubic feet (or about  3.4 billion cubic feet per year\u2014the equivalent of less than 1 percent of  onshore federal gas production in fiscal year 2016).", "Coal. We also identified two studies that analyzed the effects of different  policy scenarios on coal production on federal lands. The first study, by  the CEA, examined how raising the federal royalty rate could affect coal  production on federal lands after 2025 using a series of scenarios.  Under the first scenario, equivalent to raising royalty rates to 17 percent in  2025, the study predicted that federal production would decrease by 3  percent once the changes were fully implemented. The other two  scenarios, each equivalent to raising royalty rates to 29 percent in 2025,  predicted that federal production would decrease by 7 percent. The  second study, by Mark Haggerty, Megan Lawson, and Jason Pearcy,  modeled an increase in the effective royalty rate, which is the rate  companies actually pay after processing and transportation allowances  are factored in. The study found that the modeled increase in the  effective royalty rate led to a decrease in federal coal production of less  than 1 percent per year.", "Results of the two studies differed in how an increase in coal royalty rates  might affect nonfederal coal production. The CEA study determined that  an increase in federal royalty rates would raise the national price of coal,  improving the competitiveness of nonfederal coal and slightly increasing  nonfederal coal production. According to the CEA study, coal mines in  Wyoming and Montana\u2014representing more than 86 percent of federal  coal production in fiscal year 2015\u2014are some of the largest, most  productive, and lowest-cost mines. According to EIA, in 2015 the average  market price of coal from the Appalachian region, which comes primarily  from production on state and private lands, was $60.61 per ton, while the  average market price of coal from the Powder River Basin, where the  majority of federal coal is produced, was $13.12 per ton.", "We previously reported that underground mining, which is mostly  concentrated in the eastern region, is more costly than surface mining,  resulting in a higher sale price. At the same time, eastern coal has more  heat, or energy, content per ton than western coal, which raises the value  of eastern coal. CEA concluded that raising the royalty rate would  decrease this price gap between Appalachian and Powder River Basin  coal, thus making Appalachian and other nonfederal coal slightly more  competitive.", "The study by Haggerty, Lawson, and Pearcy states that substitution  between federal and nonfederal coal could occur, but is unlikely for  several reasons, including federal ownership in western states and the  inherent difference in the qualities of coal. The study states that  substitution between federal and nonfederal coal could occur if federal  and nonfederal coal are in close proximity. However, the authors note that  where federal ownership of coal dominates, in states like Wyoming,  Montana, and Colorado where the majority of federal coal is produced,  states tend to adopt federal policy changes. Also according to the study,  transportation from the mine to the power plant is highly specialized, and  power plants are engineered to maximize efficiency of the specific type of  coal in the region. Switching from one type of coal to another could  involve substantial conversion costs for coal power plants.", "Stakeholders we interviewed suggested that several factors could  influence the extent to which oil, gas, and coal production might be  affected if federal royalty rates were increased, including the following.", "Market conditions and prices. Some stakeholders noted that market  conditions and prices play an important role in determining whether  raising federal royalty rates could affect production on federal lands.  BLM officials suggested that raising federal royalty rates is less likely  to have a negative effect on production when oil and gas prices are  high. For example, increasing royalty rates from 12.5 percent to 16.67  percent would increase the cost of producing oil by about $2 a barrel  at oil prices as of March 2017. In addition, according to a few  stakeholders we interviewed and a 2015 report by the Congressional  Research Service, any negative effect on production from higher rates  could be limited to or affect areas with marginal oil and gas wells,  which are usually wells with low production rates and/or higher  production costs. As for coal, some stakeholders said that in an  already challenging market, increased costs could further discourage  production. According to EIA data, total U.S. coal production declined  23 percent from 2008 to 2015. In a 2012 report, we found that various  market and regulatory factors may influence the future use of coal,  including the price of natural gas, demand for electricity, and  environmental regulations. A few stakeholders we interviewed said  there has been little interest in further coal development in their  regions, which include the western and midwestern regions of the  country. Since fiscal year 2012, the number of coal lease sales on  federal lands has generally declined. We previously reported that  there was limited competition for coal leases because of the  significant capital investment and time required; additionally, from  January 2016 to March 2017 the Secretary of the Interior placed a  pause on significant new federal coal leasing decisions, with limited  exemptions and exclusions.", "Cost advantages of different resources. A few stakeholders told us  that the competitiveness of federal lands for development depends  less on the royalty rate charged and more on the location of the best  resources\u2014such as areas with low exploration and production costs.  For example, as discussed above, most of the areas with major U.S.  tight oil and shale gas plays and major U.S. coal basins do not  overlap with federal lands. A few stakeholders suggested that an  increase in the federal royalty rates for coal would not cause  companies to switch from federal to nonfederal coal because of the  cost advantages of federal coal, which is primarily concentrated in  surface mines in the West. According to EIA data, all coal extracted  from the Powder River Basin in 2015 was from surface mining, which  we previously reported has lower extraction and production costs. In  contrast, the majority of coal production from the Appalachian region  in 2015 was from underground production, which we previously  reported is more costly to extract. Increasing the royalty rate on  federal lands would not cause operators to switch from federal to  nonfederal coal, according to a few stakeholders, because companies  producing coal on federal lands would still have a cost advantage over  companies producing coal on nonfederal lands.", "Regulatory burden of federal development. Some stakeholders we  spoke with stated that there is already a higher regulatory burden for  oil and gas companies to develop resources on federal lands than on  nonfederal lands, and one stakeholder noted that an increase in  federal royalty rates would decrease the competitiveness of federal  lands versus state or private lands. In addition, BLM officials noted  that about half the public comments BLM received through its 2015  Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking also noted there is a higher  regulatory burden on federal lands. According to BLM officials, when  federal and nonfederal coal are located on adjoining tracts the cost of  production will be identical unless the nonfederal land has a different  royalty rate, which officials say is unlikely. Assuming the royalty rate is  the same, officials stated that the main difference between federal and  nonfederal coal is the additional regulatory burden of producing on  federal lands. In addition, a few stakeholders stated that companies  may avoid mining federal lands for coal when possible in order to  avoid the required environmental assessments, which add time to the  leasing process.", "Officials from two state offices we interviewed said that the history of  increasing royalty rates for oil and gas production on state lands suggests  that increasing the federal royalty rate would not have a clear impact on  production. In particular, officials from Colorado and Texas said that they  have raised their state royalty rates without a significant effect on  production on state lands. In February 2016, Colorado increased its  royalty rate for oil and gas production from 16.67 percent to 20 percent,  and, according to state officials, there had been no slowdown in interest  in new leases as of August 2016. In fact, Colorado state officials said they  were unsure whether the higher royalty rate played much of a role in  companies\u2019 decision making. Additionally, Texas officials told us that over  30 years ago, Texas began charging a 25-percent royalty for most oil and gas leases on state lands, and this increase has not had a noticeable  impact on production or leasing. Officials at BLM said about half of the  public comments they received through BLM\u2019s 2015 Advance Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking suggested that an increase in royalty rates would  not have a clear impact on production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies and Stakeholders Suggest Raising Federal Royalty Rates Could Increase Federal Revenues", "paragraphs": ["Raising federal royalty rates for onshore oil, gas, and coal could increase  overall federal revenues, according to studies we reviewed and  stakeholders we interviewed. Higher rates could have two opposing  effects on federal revenues. First, as discussed above, raising royalty  rates could lead to decreased production on federal lands, and,  consequently, decreased revenues. Second, revenues would increase on  any production that does occur because of higher royalty rates on that  production. The studies we reviewed show that raising federal royalty  rates could increase federal revenues for oil, gas, and coal. Some  stakeholders we interviewed said any effects on federal revenue would  depend on how increasing royalty rates for oil, gas, and coal would affect  bonus bid revenue, while others said overall market conditions, among  other factors, need to be considered.", "Oil and gas. The studies we reviewed for oil and gas estimate that  raising the federal royalty rate could increase net federal revenue  between $5 million and $38 million per year (equivalent to around 0.7  percent to around 5.2 percent of net oil and gas royalties in fiscal year  2016). According to the CBO study, the effect on federal revenue would  initially be small but would increase over time because a change in the  royalty rate would apply only to new leases and the affected parcels  would not go into production immediately. For example, CBO found that 6  percent of royalties collected in 2013 came from leases issued in the  previous 10 years. CBO estimated that if the royalty rate for onshore oil  and gas parcels were raised from 12.5 percent to 18.75 percent, net  federal revenue would increase by $200 million over the first 10 years,  and potentially by much more over the following decade, depending on  market conditions. Similarly, according to the Enegis study, net federal  revenues would increase under the scenarios that modeled raising the  royalty rate to 16.67 percent, 18.75 percent, or 22.5 percent. Under  these scenarios, estimated increases in net federal revenue range from  $125 million to $939 million over 25 years.", "Coal. Both studies for coal also suggested that a higher royalty rate could  lead to an increase in federal revenues. For example, the modeling  scenarios in the CEA study that raised the royalty rate to the equivalent of  17 percent or 29 percent predicted a range of increases in government  revenues from $0 to $730 million annually after 2025, with approximately  half of that revenue going to the federal government. By comparison, in  fiscal year 2016, the federal government collected more than $536 million  in coal royalty payments, according to ONRR data. The revenue range  included zero to take into account the possibility that bonus bids could be  lost entirely, but the study stated that this was an extremely conservative  assumption, and that the increase in royalty revenue would be vastly  larger than any decrease in bonus bid revenue. The study by Haggerty,  Lawson, and Pearcy suggested that total average royalty revenues could  increase by $141 million per year if the effective royalty rate were raised.  This study did not consider the effect on bonus bid revenue from a royalty  rate increase.", "Stakeholders we interviewed also suggested that the effect on bonus bid  revenue could influence the extent to which raising federal royalty rates  would increase revenues from oil, gas, and coal production. For example,  some stakeholders stated that companies would be more likely to offer  lower bonus bids if they had to pay higher royalty payments, but a few  stakeholders believed that the net impact on federal revenue would be  minimal because royalties are a more significant portion of total revenues  than bonus bids. For oil and gas, royalties could offset losses from other  revenue sources, such as bonus bids and rents. Although royalties also  constitute the majority of revenue for coal, bonus bids represent a larger  percentage of total revenue in comparison with oil and gas revenue. For  example, in fiscal year 2016 only 8 percent of total revenue from oil and  gas development on federal lands was from bonus bids, while in the  same year the comparable figure for coal was 42 percent. However, a few  stakeholders said that any decrease in bonus bids from an increase in  coal royalty rates would likely be offset by a larger increase in royalty  revenue.", "In addition, BLM officials stated that raising the royalty rate could make  some federal coal uneconomical to mine, resulting in fewer royalty  payments to the federal government. BLM officials stated that an operator  can justify a capital investment to produce coal on federal lands if the  potential for revenue outweighs the cost of production. According to  officials, increasing the royalty rate would add to the cost of production,  which could cause an operator to bypass federal coal, thus causing the  government to miss out on revenue. As discussed above, some  stakeholders said any effects on federal revenue would depend on how  increasing royalty rates for oil, gas, and coal would affect bonus bid  revenue, and others said overall market conditions, among other factors,  need to be considered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Interior for review and comment.
