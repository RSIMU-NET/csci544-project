The standards also require that authority and responsibility for internal controls be clearly defined. CMS oversight had weaknesses in each of these areas. As a result, CMS did not know if its control efforts were focused on areas of greatest risk. CMS also was not effectively implementing the controls it had in place. Furthermore, managers had not established performance standards for financial oversight activities, particularly their expenditure review activity. Limited data were collected to assess regional financial analyst performance in overseeing state internal controls and expenditures. In addition, the CMS audit resolution procedures did not collect enough information on the status of audit findings or ensure that audit findings were resolved promptly.

Although it is one federal program, Medicaid consists of  56 distinct state-level programs\u2013one for each state, territory, Puerto Rico,  and the District of Columbia.", "Each of the states has a designated Medicaid agency that administers the  Medicaid program. The federal government matches state Medicaid  spending for medical assistance according to a formula based on each  state\u2019s per capita income.  The federal share can range from 50 to 83 cents  of every state dollar spent.", "In accordance with the Medicaid statute and within broad federal  guidelines, each state establishes its own eligibility standards; determines  the type, amount, duration, and scope of covered services; sets payment  rates; and develops its administrative structure. Each state Medicaid  agency is also responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate  internal control structure to ensure that the Medicaid program is managed  with integrity and in compliance with applicable law. States are required to  describe the nature and scope of their programs in comprehensive written  plans submitted to CMS\u2013with federal funding for state Medicaid services  contingent on CMS approval of the plans.  This approval hinges on whether  CMS determines that state Medicaid plans meet all applicable federal laws  and regulations.", "At the federal level, the Center for Medicaid and State Operations (CMSO)  within CMS is responsible for approving state Medicaid plans, working  with the states on program integrity and other program administration  functions, and overseeing state financial management and internal control  processes.  CMSO shares Medicaid program administration and financial  management responsibilities with the 10 CMS regional offices (RO). The  Division of Financial Management (DFM), within CMSO\u2019s Finance, Systems  and Quality Group, has primary responsibility for Medicaid financial  management.  DFM, in conjunction with the 10 regions, establishes and  maintains the internal control structure for Medicaid financial management  and state oversight.", "As is the case for all major federal agency programs, the internal control  structure established by CMS for Medicaid should meet requirements of  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Management  Accountability and Control, and the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government.  According to Circular A-123, management controls  are the organization policies and procedures used to reasonably ensure  that programs are protected from waste, fraud, and mismanagement and  achieve their intended results.  Establishing good management controls  requires, according to the circular, that agency managers take systematic  and proactive measures to implement appropriate management controls,  assess the adequacy of the controls, identify needed improvements, and  take corresponding corrective action. The Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government includes five standards that provide a roadmap  for agencies to establish control for all aspects of their operations and a  basis against which agencies\u2019 control structures can be evaluated.

Some of the key  oversight activities performed by regional analysts are (1) reviewing state  quarterly budget estimates and expenditure reports, (2) preparing decision  reports that document approvals for federal reimbursement and  reimbursement deferral actions, (3) providing technical assistance to states  on financial matters, and (4) serving as liaison to the states and audit  entities. DFM staff in headquarters rely on regional decision reports to help  determine and issue state grant awards.", "States submit various federal reporting forms that provide regional  financial analysts with the budget and expenditure data to execute their  financial management and oversight responsibilities.  When the State  Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was created through the  Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to provide health insurance to children of low- income families who would not qualify for Medicaid, states have been  required to submit expenditure and budget data on both Medicaid and  SCHIP.

We selected the five regions  based on geographical dispersion across the country and based on the  total amount of Medicaid expenditures processed by each region.  The  five regions were collectively responsible for overseeing more than half  of the total Medicaid expenditures for fiscal year 2000. We discussed  recent program changes, which significantly increased financial  management oversight activities for regional analysts. We questioned  staff about the extent to which certain activities, such as focused  financial management reviews, were conducted and reviewed any  reports and corresponding workpapers that were available.  Key CMS  financial managers at headquarters in Baltimore were also interviewed  to gain a comprehensive understanding of overall financial management  objectives for the Medicaid program.  We also discussed performance  and budget reporting as well as efforts to coordinate with state auditors.", "We administered a Web-based survey to regional financial management  members to gain a better understanding of the control activities being  performed by regional offices.  The survey was sent to all regional office  branch chiefs and staff classified as financial analysts who are  responsible for overseeing state financial management and internal  controls for Medicaid. All of the 11 branch chiefs responded and 59 of  the 65 analysts responded, for a 92 percent response rate\u2014the 6  analysts who did not respond were from one regional office.  The  survey obtained information on how oversight for Medicaid financial  management is designed and implemented, as well as the frontline staff  perspective on effectiveness.  Survey respondents answered questions  relating to review procedures performed, use of state single audits,  follow-up of audit findings, and communications with state auditors and  offices of inspectors general. Many of the questions asked the analysts  to respond based on their performance of activities for the period from  October 1, 1999, through the date of the survey. The practical difficulties  in conducting any survey can introduce errors, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors.  We included steps in both the data collection and  data analysis to minimize such nonsampling errors. Multiple versions of  the questionnaire were pretested with regional financial analysts before  the final survey was administered.  A 92 percent response rate was  achieved, and the respondents directly entered the responses into the  database via the Internet survey.  Data checks were performed and a  second independent analyst reviewed computer analyses.", "We obtained and reviewed CMS documents and manuals that described  current financial oversight activities and performance reporting  previously used to monitor oversight.  We reviewed audit reports that  included findings related to Medicaid financial management, including  the CMS/HCFA financial reports for fiscal years 1998 through 2000 and  Single Audit Act reports for fiscal years 1999 and 2000.  To help judge  the adequacy of CMS\u2019s Medicaid financial management oversight  process, we evaluated CMS oversight against the comptroller general\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.

However, until recently, the oversight  process that CMS used for Medicaid expenditures did not include  assessments that identified the areas of greatest risk of improper  payments.  Therefore, CMS did not have the requisite assurance that its  control activities were focused on areas of greatest risk.  In addition, the  controls that were in place were not effectively implemented. As a result,  CMS was not deploying its limited oversight resources efficiently and  effectively to detect improper expenditures.  CMS managers recognized the  deficiencies of its oversight and began efforts in April 2001 to develop a  risk-based approach and revise control activities.

Despite  repeated auditor recommendations, CMS had not developed and  implemented a systematic risk assessment method in its oversight process  to help ensure that states expend federal funds in accordance with laws  and to identify amounts inappropriately claimed for federal  reimbursement.  In April 2001, CMS took action to develop a risk  assessment; however, this analysis has not yet been used to deploy  resources to areas of greatest risk and requires several improvements to  enhance its usefulness in the oversight process.", "Since 1998, financial auditors responsible for the annual financial  statement audit of Medicaid expenditures have recommended that CMS  implement a risk-based approach for overseeing state internal control  processes and reviewing expenditures.  In performing audits of CMS\u2019s  financial statements for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, auditors have  noted that CMS failed to institute an oversight process that effectively  reduced the risk that inappropriate expenditures could be claimed and  paid. In addition, the auditors identified internal control weaknesses that  increased the risk of improper payments.  These weaknesses included (1) a  significant reduction in the level of detailed analysis performed by regional  financial analysts in reviewing state Medicaid expenses, (2) minimal review  of state Medicaid financial information systems, and (3) lack of a  methodology for estimating the range of Medicaid improper payments on a  national level.", "CMS Medicaid officials attributed most of the weaknesses identified by the  auditors to reductions in staff resources and the multiple oversight  activities that its staff is responsible for carrying out.  According to  Medicaid financial managers, changes in the Medicaid program since fiscal  year 1998, specifically the addition of  SCHIP, created additional oversight  responsibilities for CMS financial management staff.  Particularly, financial  analysts are required to handle more state inquiries regarding technical  financial issues that must be addressed promptly.  At the same time,  however, financial analyst resources previously devoted to oversight  activities declined. Medicaid financial managers provided us with data to  show that from fiscal year 1992 to September 2000, full-time equivalent  (FTE) positions for regional financial staffs declined by 32 percent from 95  to approximately 65 FTEs.  At the same time, federal Medicaid  expenditures increased 74 percent from $69 billion to $120 billion. On  average, each of the 64 regional financial analysts is now responsible for  reviewing almost $1.9 billion in federal Medicaid expenditures each fiscal  year as compared to an average of about $0.7 billion a decade ago.

Managers stated that the Medicaid financial oversight process had been  based on the presumption that financial analysts adequately applied the  inherent knowledge of program risks acquired from years of experience in  reviewing state Medicaid expenditures and providing technical assistance  to states in operating their Medicaid programs.  However, as Medicaid  program expenditures have increased, CMS managers acknowledged that  they needed to revise their oversight approach.  As a result, during our  review, CMS began in April 2001 to develop a risk-based approach for  determining how best to deploy its resources in reviewing Medicaid  expenditures.", "The Medicaid risk assessment effort required each regional office to  provide data on the states and territories in its jurisdiction based on  regional analyst experience and knowledge.  For each type of Medicaid  service and administrative expense, the Medicaid risk analysis estimates  the likelihood of risk based on the dollar amount expended annually and  measures the significance of risk based on factors such as unclear federal  payment policy, state payment involving county and local government, and  results of federal audits. The risk analysis provides a risk score for each  state that is intended to specify the Medicaid service and administrative  expense categories that are of greatest risk for improper payments in the  state.", "Medicaid financial managers also tabulated a national risk score for each  type of Medicaid service and administrative expense using the state risk  scores. However, CMS had not taken steps to use the risk analysis in  deploying its regional financial oversight resources.  Medicaid financial  managers in headquarters and the regional offices plan to develop work  plans that will allocate resources based on the risks identified from its  analysis.  CMS expects to implement these work plans in reviewing the  state\u2019s quarterly expenditure reports for fiscal year 2003.", "In evaluating the Medicaid risk analysis, we considered strategies that  leading organizations used in successfully implementing risk management  processes.  Two such strategies, which are included in our executive guide,  Strategies to Manage Improper Payments are as follows.", "Information developed from risk assessments should help form the  foundation or basis upon which management can determine the nature  and type of corrective actions needed, and should give management  baseline data for measuring progress in reducing payment inaccuracies  and other errors.", "Management should reassess risks on a recurring basis to evaluate the  impact of changing conditions, both external and internal, on program  operations.", "While the Medicaid risk analysis is a good start, we identified several  improvements that should be made to the assessment before it is used in  deploying resources.  The issues we identified could hinder the quality of  baseline information gathered and, accordingly, affect management\u2019s  ability to thoroughly reassess risks and measure the impact of corrective  actions on a recurring basis. First, the analysis does not sufficiently take  into account state financial oversight activities in assessing the risks for  improper payments in each state. Regional financial analysts were  instructed to rate the adequacy of each state Medicaid agency\u2019s financial  oversight as one of the risk factors in determining the likelihood and  significance of risk in each state.  The analysts were instructed to consider  whether a state regularly reviews claims submitted by local government  entities that provide Medicaid services and whether state audits were  conducted regularly. However, the analysts were not specifically instructed  to consider states\u2019 use of (1) prepayment edits and reviews to help prevent  improper payments, (2) screening procedures to prevent dishonest  providers from entering the Medicaid program, (3) postpayment reviews to  detect inappropriate payments after the fact, and (4) payment accuracy  studies to measure the extent of improper payments.", "Several states have implemented cost-effective prevention efforts to  protect Medicaid program dollars, such as prepayment computer \u201cedits,\u201d  manual reviews of claims before payment, and thoroughly checking the  credentials of individuals applying to be program providers.  Table 3 shows  examples of prepayment reviews currently being used by some states.", "Many states have also developed postpayment detection systems and  payment accuracy studies to improve their ability to detect, investigate,  and measure potential improper payments. Kentucky and Washington, for  example, have hired private contractors to develop or use advanced  computer systems to analyze claims payment data that identified several  million dollars in overpayments.  Table 4 describes these and other state  postpayment efforts and related program savings.", "While regional financial analysts may know about many activities like these  from performing their oversight responsibilities, analysts or staff in the  Division of Financial Management did not collect and document  information on the nature and results of each state\u2019s financial oversight  activities.  Without such information being documented, CMS did not have  a complete picture or profile of the level of risk for improper payments in  each state and thus did not have comprehensive information to determine  the appropriate level of federal oversight that should be applied.", "A second deficiency we found in the Medicaid risk analysis is that it did not  specifically integrate information about state fraud and abuse prevention  efforts in making risk assessments for each state.  Regional financial  analysts were instructed to report on the level of regional oversight of each  state\u2019s Medicaid finances as one of the risk factors in determining the  likelihood and significance of risk in each state. Specifically, analysts were  instructed to consider the last time the regional office or HHS/OIG  conducted a review or audit.  However, the analysts were not specifically  instructed to consider results from reviews of state efforts to prevent fraud  and abuse recently conducted under the CMS Medicaid Alliance for  Program Safeguards.", "In 1997, CMS established the Medicaid Alliance for Program Safeguards  staffed with program analysts from the 10 CMS regions and staff within the  Policy Coordination and Planning Group of the Center for Medicaid and  State Operations. The initiative was started to aid states in their program  integrity efforts. Since its inception, a fraud statute Web site has been  established and seminars on innovations and obstacles in safeguarding  Medicaid have been developed.  In fiscal year 2000, regional staff  conducted structured site reviews of program safeguards in eight states,  and in fiscal year 2001 reviews were conducted in another eight states.  Plans are to perform reviews in additional states until all states are  covered.  These reviews examined how state Medicaid agencies identify  and address potential fraud or abuse, whether state agencies are complying  with appropriate laws and regulations\u2014such as how they check to ensure  that only qualified providers participate in the program\u2014and potential  areas for improvement.  CMS would gain valuable information from these  reviews to more accurately assess the level of risk for improper payments  in these 16 states and the appropriate level of federal oversight required.", "A third deficiency we found is that the Medicaid risk analysis did not  include mechanisms to ensure that such analysis would be conducted  continuously in directing financial oversight. Agency managers should have  methods in place to revisit risk analysis to determine where risks have  decreased and where new risks have emerged, as identified risks are  addressed and control activities are changed.  As such, risk analysis should  be iterative. Medicaid financial managers had not determined how they  would continuously revise and update their Medicaid risk analysis.", "Finally, the Medicaid risk analysis would be strengthened if states were  systematically estimating the level of improper payments in their programs.  Identifying the dollar amount of improper payments is a critical step in  determining where the greatest problems exist and the most cost-beneficial  approach to addressing the problems.  CMS management has recognized  this and has begun efforts to develop an approach for estimating improper  Medicaid payments.  In September 2001, nine states responded to a CMS  solicitation to participate in pilot studies to develop payment accuracy  measurement methodologies. The objective is to assess whether it is  feasible to develop a single methodology that could be used by the diverse  state Medicaid programs and to explore the feasibility of estimating the  range of improper Medicaid payments on a national level. Each of the nine  states involved is developing a different measurement methodology.  CMS  has assigned a senior Medicaid manager with responsibility for directing  this effort.  According to this manager, CMS has hired a consultant  experienced in program integrity reviews to oversee the state pilots.  CMS  managers expect the states to complete the pilots during fiscal year 2003,  after which time the consultant and the Medicaid manager plan to select  several of the state methodologies as test cases for fiscal year 2004. It is  important that CMS continues to place emphasis on development of these  payment accuracy reviews on a state-by-state basis and ultimately on a  national level, since this is a key baseline measure for managing improper  payments in the Medicaid program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Control Activities Were Not Effectively Implemented", "paragraphs": ["The comptroller general\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government states that managers must establish adequate control  activities to address identified risks and ensure that program objectives are  met.

Control activities are an integral part of an  organization\u2019s efforts to address risks that lead to fraud and error.  For the  Medicaid program, both the states and federal government share  responsibility for ensuring that adequate control activities are in place. The  control activities that CMS had in place to oversee state internal controls  and help ensure the propriety of Medicaid expenditures were not  effectively implemented.

Table 5 summarizes the control activities that regional  analysts are responsible for carrying out.", "As Medicaid expenditures have grown and resources devoted to Medicaid  financial oversight have decreased, regional financial analysts have faced  significant challenges in monitoring state internal controls, providing  technical assistance, scrutinizing expenditures, and following up on audit  findings for all state Medicaid programs.  In an attempt to address these  challenges, in 1994 regional offices began refocusing oversight activities  from emphasizing detailed review of Medicaid expenditure data to  increasing the level of technical assistance provided to states.  However,  auditors of CMS financial statements found that, as a result, regional  offices were not providing appropriate review and oversight of state  Medicaid programs.  As mentioned previously, auditors have reported since  1998 that regional offices significantly reduced or inconsistently performed  control activities to detect potential errors and irregularities in state  expenditures, thus increasing the risk that errors and misappropriation  could occur and go undetected.  In our review, we found that these  weaknesses were still present.", "In August 2001, we conducted a survey of regional financial analysts to  obtain their perspectives on the design and implementation of the Medicaid  financial oversight process, covering the period from October 1, 1999,  through the date of the survey.  In comments to the survey, some regional  analysts indicated that they were inundated with responsibility for multiple  control activities and unable to perform them effectively.  Our survey asked  the analysts to rate each of the control activities that they perform in terms  of how important they believe the activity is in overseeing state Medicaid  programs. The activity rated most important was quarterly expenditure  reviews performed on-site at state Medicaid agencies; 89 percent rated the  activity as having the \u201chighest\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d level of importance\u201483 percent  \u201chighest\u201d and 6 percent  \u201chigh.\u201d  However, when asked about the adequacy  in which they performed on-site expenditure reviews, almost 36 percent  rated the adequacy of their performance \u201cinadequate\u201d or \u201cmarginal\u201d\u201413  percent inadequate and 23 percent marginal.  In discussions with regional  financial analysts during our site visits and in comments to our survey,  many financial analysts attributed deficiencies in quarterly reviews to  inadequate staff resources, the low priority placed on financial  management oversight, lack of training, and conflicting priorities.", "During our site visits we interviewed 11 regional financial analysts  responsible for overseeing the five states that accounted for over  $70 billion in Medicaid expenditures in fiscal year 2000. We reviewed these  analysts\u2019 workpapers related to their review of quarterly expenditure  reports submitted for the quarter ended December 31, 2000. Workpapers  prepared for three of the states to document their reviews did not contain  sufficient evidence that expenditures had been traced to original  documents.  Instead, the analysts had checked information against  summary schedules prepared by the states. Without proper documentation,  there is little assurance that these reviews are being adequately performed.", "Survey respondents also rated activities to (1) defer and disallow Medicaid  expenditures and (2) perform in-depth analysis of specific Medicaid costs  where problems have been found (i.e., focused financial management  reviews) as important in overseeing the propriety of Medicaid  expenditures.  Some 89 percent of analysts rated deferral and disallowance  determinations as having \u201chighest\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d level of importance and  focused financial management reviews were rated by 77 percent as  \u201chighest\u201d or \u201chigh.\u201d Data provided by CMS indicate, however, that the  amount of Medicaid expenditures disallowed by regional analysts has  declined in years after 1996, when oversight emphasis shifted from detailed  reviews, and so did the number of focused financial management reviews  conducted each year.  For example, from 1990 through 1993, analysts  disallowed on average $239 million annually in expenditures reported by  states for federal reimbursement.  However, from fiscal years 1997 through  2000, analysts disallowed on average about $43 million annually, which  represents an 82 percent decline from previous years.  Also, during these  periods, Medicaid expenditures went from an average of $58 billion  annually to $106 billion annually\u2014an increase of 83 percent.", "Similarly, focused financial management reviews have declined.  Focused  financial management reviews generally involve selecting a sample of paid  claims for review related to certain types of Medicaid services provided.  These reviews have been useful in identifying unallowable costs outside of  those detected through the review of quarterly expenditure reports as well  as deficiencies in states\u2019 financial management policies. According to CMS  managers, in fiscal year 1992, analysts performed approximately 90 in- depth reviews of specific Medicaid issues that identified approximately  $216 million in unallowable Medicaid costs.  In fiscal year 2000, analysts  only performed eight focused financial management reviews, but these  reviews resulted in almost $45 million in disallowed costs\u2014an average of  about $5.6 million per review.  As demonstrated, this control activity is  effective in detecting unallowable Medicaid costs; however, it must be  consistently performed for cost savings to be discovered.", "According to the director of DFM, the division is taking actions to improve  oversight by beginning a comprehensive assessment of CMS\u2019s Medicaid  oversight activities.  The division would like to increase several oversight  activities, such as focused financial management reviews, to address the  risks identified in CMS\u2019s new risk-based approach.  However, Medicaid  financial managers are concerned that efforts to effectively address  identified risks may be hindered without additional oversight resources.  In  the interim, CMS plans to use the current oversight process (i.e., quarterly  expenditure reviews and technical assistance) for targeting those Medicaid  issues that the new risk analysis identifies.", "In assessing what steps CMS could take to more efficiently and effectively  carry out its responsibility on the federal level for helping ensure the  propriety of Medicaid finances, we considered strategies that other entities  have used in successfully addressing risks that lead to fraud, error, or  improper payments.  As discussed in our executive guide on strategies to  manage improper payments, key strategies include taking action to select appropriate control activities based on an analysis of the specific  risks facing the organization, taking into consideration the nature of the  organization and the environment in which it operates; perform a cost-benefit analysis of potential control activities before  implementation to ensure that the cost of the activities is not greater  than the benefit; and contract out activities to firms that specialize in specific areas like  neural networking, where in-house expertise is not available.", "Our executive guide points out that many organizations have implemented  control techniques, including data mining, data sharing, and neural  networking, to address identified risk areas and help ensure that program  objectives are met. These techniques could help CMS better utilize its  limited resources in applying effective oversight of Medicaid finances at the  federal level.", "Some state Medicaid agencies have already implemented data mining, data  sharing, and neural networking techniques to carry out their  responsibilities on the state level for ensuring Medicaid program integrity.", "State auditors and HHS/OIG staff have also had success using these  techniques in overseeing state Medicaid programs.  However, resources  devoted to protecting Medicaid program integrity and the use of these  techniques varies significantly by state.  From a federal standpoint, CMS  should take into consideration the control activities performed at the state  level in designing its Medicaid financial oversight control activities. CMS  should use the results from states that are already using data mining, data  sharing, and neural networking techniques in determining the extent and  type of control techniques that its regional financial analysts should use in  overseeing each state.  And, for states where these techniques are not being  used, CMS should consider using these tools in its oversight process.", "As illustrated in the following examples, data mining, data sharing, and  neural networking techniques have been shown to achieve significant  savings by identifying and detecting improper payments that have been  made.", "Data mining is a technique in which relationships among data are  analyzed to discover new patterns, associations, or sequences.  The  incidence of improper payments among Medicaid claims can, if  sufficiently analyzed and related to other Medicaid data, reveal a  correlation with a particular health care provider or providers.  Using  data mining software, the Illinois Department of Public Aid, in  partnership with HHS/OIG, identified 232 hospital transfers that may  have been miscoded as discharges, creating a potential overpayment of  $1.7 million.", "Data sharing allows entities to compare information from different  sources to help ensure that Medicaid expenditures are appropriate.  Data sharing is particularly useful in confirming the initial or continuing  eligibility of participants and in identifying improper payments that have  already been made.  We recently reported on a data sharing project  called the Public Assistance Reporting Information System interstate  match (PARIS) that has identified millions of dollars in costs savings for  states. PARIS helps states share information on public assistance  programs, such as Food Stamps and eligibility data for Medicaid, to  identify individuals who may be receiving benefits in more than one  state simultaneously.  Using the PARIS data match for the first time in  1997, Maryland identified numerous individuals who no longer lived in  the state but on whose behalf the state was continuing to pay a Medicaid  managed care organization (MCO) as part of the MCO\u2019s prospective  monthly payment.  The match identified $7.3 million in savings for the  Medicaid program.", "Neural networking is a technique used to extract and analyze data.  A  neural network is intended to simulate the way a brain processes  information, learns, and remembers.  For example, this technique can  help identify perpetrators of both known and unknown fraud schemes  through the analysis of utilization trends, patterns, and complex  interrelationships in the data.  In 1997, the Texas legislature mandated  the use of neural networks in the Medicaid program.  Large volumes of  medical claims and patient and provider history data are examined  using neural network technology to identify fraudulent patterns.  The  Texas Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Detection System used neural  networking to recover $3.4 million in fiscal year 2000.", "Based on consultations with state auditors, we noted that some auditors  are performing audits that incorporate the advanced oversight techniques  described above.  New York and Texas are instituting data sharing and  matching techniques at the state level to confirm initial eligibility of  Medicaid participants and to identify improper payments that have already  been made.  Texas is using private contractors to design, develop, install,  and train staff to use a system intended to integrate detection and  investigation capabilities.  This system includes a neural network that will  allow the state to uncover potentially problematic payment patterns.", "Similarly, a large portion of the audit work that the HHS/OIG conducts to  oversee the Medicaid expenditures for Massachusetts, Ohio, and Maine is  conducted through electronic data matches of Medicaid claims data  contained in the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS). MSIS is  the primary source of Medicaid program statistical information. As of the  date of our report, 47 states were submitting Medicaid data electronically  to MSIS.  Information that the HHS/OIG finds as a result of electronic data  matches is subsequently made available to regions and states for additional  detailed work.", "CMS managers acknowledge that systems like MSIS could provide them  with the capabilities to implement more advanced control techniques.

While the guide strongly encouraged regional analysts to  complete all of its procedures, it did not mandate that analysts do so.

Headquarters managers expressed concern that despite  recent efforts to develop risk analysis and implement work plans that  allocate resources based on identified risks, regional managers will still  have the authority to decide how oversight resources are used.  Given the  multiple oversight activities that regional financial analysts are responsible  for, headquarters managers have no assurance that review areas included  in the work plans will be given priority in each region.  Headquarters  managers may experience similar difficulties in reestablishing performance  reporting.

Several analysts we spoke with during site  visits did not think the risk assessment effort was useful because they felt  that they were already aware of the risks within the states that they were  responsible for and did not need a formal assessment to identify the risks.  In addition, some said that they resented the headquarters managers trying  to tell them where they needed to focus their efforts.  In our survey, we  asked regional financial analysts to rate the importance of the risk  assessment, staff time allocation effort, and review guide updates to overall  financial oversight.
