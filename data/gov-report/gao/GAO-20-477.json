In the Foreign Service, average promotion rates were lower for racial or ethnic minorities in early to mid career, but differences were generally not statistically significant when GAO controlled for various factors.", "USAID has previously identified underrepresentation of specific groups in its workforce, but staffing gaps, partly due to a lack of senior leadership attention, prevent the agency from consistently performing required Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) activities. The Office of Civil Rights and Diversity (OCRD), responsible for USAID's EEO program, has been significantly understaffed. Vacancy rates in most OCRD divisions were 50 percent or higher in November 2019 and, despite attempts to hire more staff, remained at 30 to 50 percent as of April 2020. These staffing gaps have limited OCRD's capacity to process EEO complaints and investigations within mandated timeframes and analyze USAID's demographic data. Staffing gaps also prevented OCRD from submitting required reporting on the status of its EEO program in fiscal year 2018. A lack of consistent leadership in OCRD as well as a lack of senior USAID leadership attention to diversity has contributed to OCRD's staffing gaps.

USAID\u2019s recent efforts to fill staff vacancies within various  OCRD divisions could help increase OCRD\u2019s capacity to perform its  required EEO functions. However, such capacity will not be fully  demonstrated until OCRD can consistently ensure timely processing of  EEO complaints and investigations, regular analysis of workforce  demographics for trends, and regular submission of required MD-715  reports. Further, sustained attention to diversity efforts from USAID\u2019s  senior leadership would help ensure that OCRD has the capacity to  perform its required EEO functions.
