DOD developed initial force structure plans to establish the Command; however, it did not use critical practices of strategic planning, such as the alignment of activities and resources and the involvement of stakeholders in decision-making processes when developing these plans. As a result of limitations in the strategic planning process, the Command has identified several force structure challenges that will likely affect the Command's ability to perform its full range of responsibilities, and is working to revise its force structure. Although preliminary steps have been taken, the Marine Corps has not developed a strategic human capital approach to manage the critical skills and competencies required of personnel in its special operations command. While the Command has identified some skills needed to perform special operations missions, it has not conducted a comprehensive analysis to determine all of the critical skills and incremental training required of personnel in its special operations forces units. These analyses are critical to the Marine Corps' efforts to develop a strategic human capital approach for the management of personnel in its special operations forces units. Without the benefit of these analyses, the Marine Corps has developed an interim policy to assign some personnel to special operations forces units for extended tour lengths to account for the additional training and skills; however, the policy is inconsistent with the Command's goal for the permanent assignment of some personnel within the special operations community. Until the Command completes an analysis to identify and document the critical skills and competencies needed by its future workforce to perform its full range of special operations missions, the Marine Corps will not have a sound basis for developing or evaluating alternative strategic human capital approaches for managing personnel assigned to its special operations forces units. USSOCOM does not have a sound basis for determining whether the Command's training programs are preparing units for their missions because it has not established common training standards for many special operations skills and it has not formally evaluated whether these programs prepare units to be fully interoperable with other special operations forces. The Command is providing training to its forces that is based on training programs for conventional units that were assigned some special operations missions prior to the Command's activation and incorporates the training that USSOCOM's other service components provide to their forces. However, USSOCOM has not validated that the training for Marine Corps forces prepares them to be fully interoperable with DOD's other special operations forces. Without an evaluation, USSOCOM cannot demonstrate the needed assurances that Marine Corps forces are fully interoperable with its other forces, which may jeopardize the success of future joint missions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1987, the Department of Defense (DOD) established the U.S. Special  Operations Command (USSOCOM) with a primary mission to provide  trained and combat-ready special operations forces to the department\u2019s  geographic combatant commanders. These forces differ from  conventional forces in that they are specially organized, trained, and  equipped to conduct operations in hostile or politically sensitive  environments and they employ military capabilities that are not present in  conventional military forces. Subsequent to its activation, USSOCOM  assumed operational control of existing units from the Army, Navy, and  Air Force. However, the Marine Corps did not assign any of its forces to  USSOCOM, citing a need to retain the flexibility needed to perform its  missions. Instead, the Marine Corps created a program to deploy forces to  the geographic combatant commands that were trained to perform some  special operations missions.", "With the onset of the war on terrorism, DOD has greatly expanded the role  of USSOCOM. As part of its strategy for this war, the department has  relied on special operations forces to conduct military operations in the  ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. In addition, special operations  forces have performed other types of military tasks, such as training and  advising foreign military forces in a number of countries around the world,  in order to build the capabilities of partner nations to combat terrorists  more effectively within their own borders. To meet these commitments,  special operations forces have experienced a substantial increase in  deployments. For example, we reported in July 2006 that from fiscal year  2000 through fiscal year 2005, the average weekly number of special  operations forces personnel who deployed to the department\u2019s geographic  combatant commands increased by 64 percent. DOD recognizes that it  needs additional special operations forces to defeat terrorist networks and  has sought to increase the number of these forces. One department  initiative to increase the number of special operations forces has been to  integrate Marine Corps forces into USSOCOM. In 2005, the Secretary of  Defense requested that the Marine Corps and USSOCOM develop plans to  establish a Marine Corps service component to integrate Marine Corps  forces within the special operations community. In October 2005, the  Secretary of Defense approved the establishment of a Marine Corps  special operations command (Command) as a service component to  USSOCOM.", "The Marine Corps activated its special operations command in February  2006, and in August 2006 began deploying special operations forces units  to conduct missions for the geographic combatant commanders. On the  basis of initial department guidance, the Marine Corps special operations  command will be comprised of approximately 2,600 Marines and Navy  personnel to train foreign military forces and conduct other special  operations missions. According to current plans, the Command will be  fully operationally capable by the end of fiscal year 2008. At DOD\u2019s  request, the Congress has provided the Marine Corps and USSOCOM with  regular and supplemental appropriations in fiscal years 2006 and 2007  totaling $509.5 million (excluding military personnel costs) to establish the  Marine Corps special operations command. In addition, the Marine Corps  and USSOCOM have projected funding needs for the Command totaling  $907.8 million for fiscal years 2008 through 2013.", "While USSOCOM is responsible for monitoring the status of its personnel,  it does not have authority over personnel management issues such as  recruiting, retention, or the assignment of servicemembers in special  operations forces units. Instead, personnel management is the  responsibility of each military service, and each service handles those  responsibilities differently. For example, the Marine Corps is assigning  personnel to its special operations command from a variety of career  fields, such as reconnaissance and intelligence, and plans to rotate these  personnel between special operations forces units and conventional force  units. This policy is in contrast to the management of some special  operations forces personnel in the other military services. The Army, for  example, has established separate career fields for Special Forces and  Civil Affairs soldiers and in fiscal year 2007, the Navy established a  separate career field for SEALs. Once assigned to the Command,  personnel will be provided with additional training for the skills that are  required to perform special operations missions. In general, the Marine  Corps will retain the responsibility for providing training for basic Marine  Corps skills to personnel who are assigned to its special operations forces  units. USSOCOM, through its Marine Corps service component command,  is responsible for providing training for special operations-unique skills to  Marine Corps personnel in these units.", "We prepared this report under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to  conduct evaluations on his own initiative. Our objective was to evaluate  DOD\u2019s efforts to establish a Marine Corps special operations command.  Specifically, we assessed the extent to which (1) the Marine Corps special  operations command has identified the force structure needed to perform  its mission, (2) the Marine Corps has developed a strategic human capital  approach to manage the critical skills and competencies required of  personnel in its special operations command, and (3) USSOCOM has  determined whether Marine Corps special operations forces training  programs are preparing these forces for assigned missions.", "To assess the extent to which the Marine Corps special operations  command has identified the force structure needed to perform its mission,  we identified and reviewed reports related to the department\u2019s efforts to  increase the size of special operations forces by integrating Marine Corps  forces into USSOCOM. We analyzed available internal DOD  documentation such as briefings, guidance, and memoranda that identified  DOD\u2019s plans and time frames for establishing the Marine Corps special  operations command. We discussed DOD\u2019s decision-making processes for  developing force structure plans for the new Command with officials from  the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the Joint Staff; Headquarters,  Marine Corps; USSOCOM; and the geographic combatant commands. We  also reviewed documents and interviewed officials with the Marine Corps  special operations command to determine the force structure challenges  the Command has identified and the plans that are being developed to  revise its force structure. To assess the extent to which the Marine Corps  has developed a strategic human capital approach to manage the critical  skills and competencies required of personnel in its special operations  forces units, we analyzed relevant Marine Corps policies for assigning  personnel to conventional force units and to special operations forces  units. We conducted interviews with officials from Headquarters, Marine  Corps, who are responsible for managing personnel assigned to the Marine  Corps special operations command. To better understand the unique  personnel needs of the Marine Corps special operations command, we  interviewed officials from the Command to discuss the specialized skills  and training that are required by personnel who are assigned to special  operations forces units to perform the Command\u2019s assigned missions. To  assess the extent to which USSOCOM has determined whether Marine  Corps special operations forces training programs are preparing these  forces for assigned missions, we examined relevant laws and DOD  doctrine related to the responsibilities of the Marine Corps and USSOCOM  for training special operations forces personnel. We reviewed available  documents that detail training programs for Marine Corps special  operations forces. We collected and analyzed documents related to  USSOCOM\u2019s evaluations of Marine Corps special operations forces  training, and we discussed the efforts that have been taken by the Marine  Corps special operations command and USSOCOM to assess the  effectiveness of these training programs. Our assessment of data reliability  concluded that the data used to support this review were sufficiently  reliable to answer our objectives.

For example, the Marine Corps has activated  the headquarters of its special operations command, established some of  its special operations forces units\u2014including 4 special operations  companies and 12 foreign military training teams to date\u2014and deployed  these units to conduct special operations missions. However, the initial  force structure plans for the Command were not developed using critical  practices of effective strategic planning. According to officials from the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, USSOCOM, and the Marine Corps, the  Secretary of Defense directed that the Marine Corps establish a special  operations command to meet the growing demand for special operations  forces in the war on terrorism. The Secretary of Defense, with input from  the Marine Corps, determined that 2,516 personnel was an appropriate size  for the Command based on the assumptions that the Command was to be  staffed within the existing Marine Corps end-strength, and the  establishment of the Command could not significantly affect the Marine  Corps budget. Marine Corps planners then based the composition and  number of Marine Corps special operations forces units on existing units  within the service that had trained to perform similar missions in the past.  For example, Marine Corps officials told us that the force structure plans  for its special operations companies were modeled after a Maritime  Special Purpose Force, which had previously trained to conduct some  special operations missions for conventional Marine Corps units.  Additionally, Marine Corps officials told us the initial force structure plan  to establish nine special operations companies was based on the need to  accommodate the deployment schedule of its Marine Expeditionary Units.  The initial force structure plan also included the transfer of the Foreign  Military Training Unit from the conventional force to its special operations  command. Using this existing force structure, the Marine Corps planned to  establish 24 foreign military training teams under its special operations  command.", "DOD did not fully incorporate critical practices of effective strategic  planning when it developed these initial force structure plans for the  Marine Corps special operations command. We have previously reported  that strategic planning is important to ensure that an organization\u2019s  activities support its strategic goals. Effective planning principles, such as  those embodied in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  and used by leading organizations, require federal agencies to set strategic  goals and develop strategic plans to accomplish those goals. Our prior  work has identified several critical practices for effective strategic  planning, including the alignment of activities and resources to meet  organizational missions and stakeholder involvement. Our prior work has  shown that leading organizations recognize that an organization\u2019s  activities, core processes, and resources must be aligned to support its  mission and help it achieve its goals. Organizations should assess the  extent to which their programs and activities contribute to meeting their  mission and desired outcomes. In addition, successful organizations base  their strategic planning, to a large extent, on the interests and expectations  of their stakeholders. Stakeholder involvement is important to help  agencies ensure that their efforts and resources are targeted at the highest  priorities. Just as important, involving stakeholders in strategic planning  efforts can help create a basic understanding among the stakeholders of  the competing demands that confront most agencies, the limited resources  available to them, and how those demands and resources require careful  and continuous balancing.", "However, in our review of the planning process that preceded the  establishment of the Marine Corps special operations command, we found  the Command\u2019s activities and resources were not fully aligned with the  organization\u2019s mission. For example, although the alignment of activities  and resources to meet organizational missions, a critical practice of  effective strategic planning, should include an analysis of the number of  personnel required for an organization to accomplish its missions, Marine  Corps officials stated that the size of the Marine Corps special operations  command (2,516 personnel) was not determined through an analysis of the  Command\u2019s assigned missions. Specifically, neither the Office of the  Secretary of Defense nor the Marine Corps conducted a comprehensive,  data-driven analysis to determine the number of personnel needed to meet  the Marine Corps special operations command\u2019s mission requirements that  directly tied the number of personnel authorized for the Command with its  assigned missions. USSOCOM did not provide official mission guidance to  the Marine Corps until October 2006, almost 1 year after the Command\u2019s  personnel authorizations had been determined. In the absence of specific  guidance, Marine Corps planners did not conduct a comprehensive, data- driven analysis to determine the number of personnel needed to meet the  Marine Corps special operations command\u2019s full range of mission  requirements. Our prior work has shown that valid and reliable data on the  number of employees required to meet an agency\u2019s needs are critical  because human capital shortfalls can threaten an agency\u2019s ability to  perform its missions efficiently and effectively.", "The alignment of activities and resources should also include an analysis  of the number and composition of Marine Corps special operations forces  units. However, the Marine Corps did not determine the number and  composition of its special operations forces units based on specific  guidance from USSOCOM. Although the Marine Corps special operations  command was established as the Marine Corps service component under  USSOCOM, USSOCOM did not provide guidance to Marine Corps planners  on the full range of missions assigned to the Command, or on the number  of special operations forces that the Marine Corps needed to provide. Both  USSOCOM and Marine Corps officials reported that USSOCOM provided  only informal guidance to Marine Corps planners on the core tasks that  would be assigned to Marine Corps special operations forces units.  According to Marine Corps officials involved in the planning for the  Marine Corps special operations command, the informal guidance did not  prioritize the core tasks to focus Marine Corps planning efforts, and the  guidance did not identify the required capacity for specific capabilities  within the Command.", "The official guidance that USSOCOM provided to the Marine Corps special  operations command in October 2006 contained a complete list of  missions the Command would be expected to perform. However, the  guidance did not prioritize these missions to focus the Command\u2019s  planning efforts. Additionally, the guidance did not establish milestones  and benchmarks that the Command could use to determine when, and to  what level of proficiency, Marine Corps special operations forces units  should be able to perform all of their assigned missions. In the absence of  specific guidance, Marine Corps officials told us the initial force structure  plan to establish nine special operations companies was not based on a  USSOCOM requirement for the number of these companies. Moreover,  while the decision to transfer the foreign military training teams to the  Marine Corps special operations command met the Command\u2019s mission to  provide USSOCOM with a foreign internal defense capability, the decision  on the number of teams needed by the Command to meet USSOCOM\u2019s  mission requirements was left to the Marine Corps. Marine Corps officials  also told us that in the absence of clear guidance on the required capacity  for support personnel within the Command, Marine Corps planners  prioritized the assignment of personnel in warfighter positions in special  operations forces units over positions in support units. Specifically,  because planners were basing the Command\u2019s force structure decisions on  the personnel limit established by DOD, the Marine Corps exchanged  positions related to support functions within the Command for positions  in its warfighter units. Support functions such as vehicle maintenance,  motor transportation, intelligence operations, communication support,  and engineering support provide important and necessary support to  Marine Corps special operations forces units, as well as other special  operations forces units in USSOCOM\u2019s other service components.", "Furthermore, we found a lack of involvement by some key stakeholders in  the establishment of the Marine Corps special operations command. For  example, the special operations components with the department\u2019s  geographic combatant commands\u2014which are responsible for  commanding special operations forces around the world\u2014were not  involved in the process to establish the Marine Corps special operations  command or in the decisions to target the service\u2019s resources to their  highest priorities and mission requirements. Officials with the U.S. Pacific  Command\u2019s special operations command who are responsible for  functions such as operations and planning told us they provided little input  into the planning process to help determine how Marine Corps special  operations forces units should be organized and what capabilities were  needed in these units to meet the mission requirements of the geographic  combatant commands. Similarly, officials from the U.S. Central  Command\u2019s special operations command who were responsible for  operations and planning in that command told us they were not included  in the planning process that preceded the establishment of the Marine  Corps special operations command. In particular, officials told us they  were not involved in the decisions regarding the types of missions that  Marine Corps special operations forces units would need to perform,  although as we noted in our July 2006 report on special operations forces  deployment trends, 85 percent of all fiscal year 2005 special operations  forces deployments were to the U.S. Central Command\u2019s area of  responsibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations in Strategic Planning Process Led to Force Structure Challenges, although Plans Are Being Revised to Address These Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Marine Corps special operations command has identified several force  structure challenges that stem from limitations in DOD\u2019s strategic planning  process that will likely affect its ability to perform its full range of  responsibilities, and the Command is revising its force structure plans to  address these challenges. For example, the Command has determined that  the number and composition of its special operations forces units are not  aligned with the Command\u2019s mission requirements. In particular, the  Command has identified shortages in positions such as authorized  intelligence personnel, which will affect the Command\u2019s ability to  simultaneously provide intelligence support to Marine Corps special  operations forces and USSOCOM. Moreover, according to Marine Corps  special operations command officials, the limited number of personnel  available to perform support functions will prevent the Command from  effectively performing all of its mission requirements. To illustrate this  point, Marine Corps special operations command officials told us that the  initial force structure plans for the Command call for less than one  support person available for every person assigned to a warfighter  position. According to Command officials, this ratio is less than what  would be expected for a command of similar size and assigned missions.  Officials said an expected ratio for a command such as theirs would be at  least two support personnel to one warfighter, and therefore their goal is  to adjust the force structure to meet this ratio.", "In addition, Marine Corps special operations command officials reported  that the number of positions authorized for support personnel will also  affect the Command\u2019s ability to meet its responsibilities to organize, train,  and equip Marine Corps special operations forces. Officials stated the  number of personnel assigned to its command elements, such as the  headquarters and the staffs of the subordinate units, is insufficient to  effectively accomplish these responsibilities. Current force structure plans  authorize approximately 780 military personnel and 33 civilian personnel  for the Command\u2019s headquarters and the staffs of its major subordinate  units.", "At the time of our work, the Marine Corps special operations command  was developing several proposals to significantly revise its force structure  to address the challenges stemming from the limitations in the planning  process and to better align the Command to meet USSOCOM\u2019s mission  guidance. These revisions would adjust the number and size of the  Command\u2019s warfighter units to better meet mission requirements.  Additionally, if approved, some of the positions made available through  the revisions could be used to remedy shortfalls in personnel who perform  support functions such as personnel management, training, logistics,  intelligence, and budget-related activities. Command officials told us these  proposals would likely mitigate many of the challenges that have resulted  from the lack of a comprehensive strategic planning process, but they  acknowledged that many of the decisions that are needed to implement  the force structure changes will be made by Headquarters, Marine Corps.  In order to move forward with its proposals, the Command is working to  complete several analyses of the personnel and funding requirements that  are tied to these proposed force structure changes. It has set milestones  for when these analyses should be completed in order to determine  whether any additional funding or personnel would be required. However,  the Command expects to be able to implement these proposals within the  funding levels already identified and planned for future fiscal years.

Officials told us the Command had not yet identified the full range of  training that will be provided in this course in order to establish a  minimum level of special operations skills for the Command\u2019s warfighters.  Additionally, the Marine Corps special operations command has not fully  identified the advanced skills and training necessary to support some of  the Command\u2019s more complex special operations missions, such as  counterterrorism, information operations, and unconventional warfare.

Officials  told us there is broad agreement within the Command that personnel  assigned to operational positions in its warfighter units require specialized  training in critical skills needed to perform special operations missions,  and should therefore be strategically managed to meet the Command\u2019s  mission requirements. These personnel include enlisted reconnaissance  and communications Marines assigned to the Marine Special Operations  Battalions and infantry Marines assigned to the Marine Special Operations  Advisor Group, as well as some officers assigned to these units. At the  time of our review, however, we found that the Command had not yet  determined which additional positions should also be filled by personnel  who are strategically managed. In particular, we were told by officials  from the Command\u2019s headquarters that a determination has not yet been  made as to whether personnel who deploy with warfighter units to provide  critical combat support, such as intelligence personnel, require specialized  skills and training that are incremental to the training provided in  conventional force units. For example, officials have not yet decided  whether intelligence personnel should attend the initial training course  that is under development. However, the Marine Special Operations  School plans to provide these personnel with specialized intelligence  training to enable them to support certain sensitive special operations  missions in support of deploying units. Officials acknowledge that until the  Command determines the extent to which support personnel require  specialized skills and training to perform their missions, the Command  cannot fully identify which positions should be filled by personnel who are  strategically managed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Marine Corps Has Developed an Interim Policy to Manage Personnel in Its Special Operations Command, but It Lacks Consensus on a Strategic Human Capital Approach", "paragraphs": ["To address the personnel needs of the Marine Corps special operations  command, Headquarters, Marine Corps, has established an interim policy  that provides for extended assignments of some personnel in special  operations forces units; however, the absence of a comprehensive analysis  of the critical skills and training required of personnel in special  operations forces units has contributed to a lack of consensus within the  Marine Corps on a strategic human capital approach to manage these  personnel. The extended assignments apply to Marines who are beyond  their first term of enlistment, which is typically 3 to 5 years, and who are  assigned to one of the Marine Corps special operations command\u2019s  warfighter, training, or intelligence units. The policy directs that these  personnel will be assigned to the Command for 48 months, in part, to  account for the additional training provided to personnel in these units.", "According to officials at Headquarters, Marine Corps, and the Marine  Corps special operations command, the 48-month assignment policy is  designed to retain designated personnel within special operations forces  units long enough to complete at least two deployments. All other Marines  will be assigned to the Command for approximately 36 months, which is a  typical tour length for Marines in conventional force units.", "The interim policy also addresses a concern that personnel assigned to  special operations forces units will have opportunities for career  progression. In general, Marines are managed according to established  career progression models for their respective career fields. These career  progression models identify the experiences, skills, and professional  military education necessary for personnel to be competitive for  promotion to the next grade. For example, as personnel are promoted to a  higher grade, they are typically placed in positions with increased  responsibilities that are consistent with their career progression models in  order to remain competitive for further promotion. The Marine Corps has  not established a separate career field for special operations forces  personnel; instead, the Marine Corps is assigning personnel from a variety  of career fields, such as reconnaissance, to its special operations forces  units. However, the current structure of the Marine Corps special  operations command cannot support long-term assignments of personnel  within the Command, in some cases, due to limited opportunities for  progression into positions with increased responsibilities. For example,  our analysis of the Marine Corps special operations command\u2019s force  structure shows that the Command is authorized 76 percent fewer  reconnaissance positions for personnel in the grade of E-7 as compared to  the number of reconnaissance positions for personnel in the grade of E-6.  The Marine Corps has established targets for the promotion of  reconnaissance personnel to the grade of E-7 after they have spent  approximately 5 years in the grade of E-6. As a result, many  reconnaissance personnel who are promoted to E-7 while assigned to a  special operations forces unit will need to be reassigned to the  conventional force in order to move into an E-7 position and remain  competitive for further promotion.", "The interim policy is also consistent with the approved plan to increase  the authorized end-strength of the Marine Corps. In January 2007, the  President approved plans to increase the active duty end-strength of the  Marine Corps from 179,000 in fiscal year 2006 to 202,000 by fiscal year  2011. This plan includes growth in the number and size of conventional  force units and is intended to reduce the stress on frequently deployed  units, such as intelligence units, by achieving a 1 to 2 deployment to home  station ratio for these units. Marine Corps officials associated with units  that will be affected by these increases, such as reconnaissance and  intelligence units, told us that the rotation of personnel from Marine Corps  special operations units back into the conventional force is important to  help ensure that conventional force units are staffed with experienced and  mature personnel. For example, our analysis of Marine Corps data shows  that by fiscal year 2009, the Marine Corps will increase the servicewide  requirement for enlisted counterintelligence/human intelligence personnel  by 50 percent above fiscal year 2006 levels. Although the Marine Corps is  adjusting its accession, training, and retention strategies to meet the  increased requirement for enlisted counterintelligence/human intelligence  personnel, officials stated the rotation of these experienced personnel  from the Marine Corps special operations command back into the  conventional force can help meet the increased personnel needs of  conventional intelligence units, while also ensuring that conventional  force units have an understanding of special operations tactics,  techniques, and procedures. Additionally, officials told us the rotation of  personnel from special operations forces units to conventional force units  supports the Marine Corps\u2019 process for prioritizing the assignment of  personnel to units that are preparing for deployments to Iraq and other  war on terrorism requirements.", "Notwithstanding the intended outcome of the interim policy, Marine Corps  special operations command officials told us that the policy might impact  the Command\u2019s ability to prepare its forces to conduct the full range of its  assigned missions and that the policy is inconsistent with the Command\u2019s  stated goal for the permanent assignment of personnel in its special  operations forces units. In congressional testimony, the Commander of the  Marine Corps special operations command specified his goal to develop a  personnel management strategy that would retain some personnel within  the special operations community for the duration of their careers.  Officials from the Command told us that a substantial investment of time  and resources is required to train personnel in special operations forces  units on the critical skills needed to perform special operations missions.  For example, Marine Corps special operations forces personnel will  receive in-depth training to develop foreign language proficiency and  cultural awareness, which is consistent with DOD\u2019s requirement to  increase the capacity of special operations forces to perform more  demanding and specialized tasks during long-duration, indirect, and  clandestine operations in politically sensitive environments. However,  these officials believe that the Command\u2019s ability to develop and sustain  these skills over time will be hampered if its special operations forces  units experience high personnel turnover. In addition, according to  USSOCOM doctrine, personnel must be assigned to a special operations  forces unit for at least 4 years in order to be fully trained in some  advanced special operations skills. Consequently, officials from the  Command have determined that limited duration assignments would  challenge the Command\u2019s ability to develop the capability to conduct more  complex special operations core tasks, and to retain fully trained  personnel long enough to use their skills during deployments. The Marine  Corps special operations command has determined that to achieve its goal  of permanent personnel assignments within the special operations  community, it requires a separate career field for its warfighter personnel.  According to officials from the Command, a separate career field would  allow the Marine Corps to manage these personnel based on a career  progression model that reflects the experiences, skills, and professional  military education that are relevant to special operations missions.  Moreover, according to officials from the Command, the establishment of  a special operations forces career field would allow the Marine Corps to  develop and sustain a population of trained and qualified personnel, while  providing the Command and USSOCOM with a more appropriate return on  the investment in training personnel to perform special operations  missions.", "The Command\u2019s goal for the permanent assignment of some special  operations forces personnel is also consistent with USSOCOM\u2019s current  and projected needs for special operations forces personnel. USSOCOM  has identified the retention of experienced personnel who possess  specialized skills and training as a key component in its strategy to support  the war on terrorism. In its vision of how special operations forces will  meet long-term national strategic and military objectives, USSOCOM has  identified the need for a comprehensive special operations forces career  management system to facilitate the progression of these personnel  through increasing levels of responsibility within the special operations  community. In addition, senior USSOCOM officials have expressed  support for an assignment policy that allows Marine Corps personnel to  remain within the special operations community for the duration of their  careers.", "Headquarters, Marine Corps, plans to review its interim policy for  assigning personnel to its special operations command annually to  determine whether it meets the mission requirements of the Command.  Additionally, the Commandant of the Marine Corps recently directed  Headquarters, Marine Corps, to study the assignment policies for  personnel in certain Army special operations forces units who rotate  between conventional Army units and special operations forces units.  According to a Headquarters, Marine Corps, official, one purpose of this  study is to evaluate whether a similar management strategy may be  applied to personnel in Marine Corps special operations forces units.  Notwithstanding these efforts, officials with Headquarters, Marine Corps,  and the Marine Corps special operations command acknowledge that the  analysis of the critical skills and training required of personnel in the  Command\u2019s special operations forces units is a necessary step in the  development of a strategic human capital approach to the management of  these personnel. Until the Marine Corps special operations command  completes a comprehensive analysis to identify and document the critical  skills and additional training needed by its future workforce to perform  the Command\u2019s full range of assigned special operations missions, the  Marine Corps will not have a sound basis for developing or evaluating  alternative strategic human capital approaches for the management of  personnel assigned to its special operations forces units."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USSOCOM Does Not Have a Sound Basis for Determining Whether Marine Corps Special Operations Forces Training Programs Prepare Units for Missions", "paragraphs": ["USSOCOM does not have a sound basis for determining whether Marine  Corps special operations forces training programs are preparing units for  their missions because it has not established common training standards  for many special operations skills and it has not formally evaluated  whether these programs will prepare units to be fully interoperable with  DOD\u2019s other special operations forces. The Marine Corps special  operations command has provided training for its forces that is based on  training that was provided to conventional units that were assigned some  special operations missions prior to the activation of the Command, and  by selectively incorporating the training that USSOCOM\u2019s other service  components provide to their forces. However, USSOCOM has not formally  validated that the training used to prepare Marine Corps special  operations forces meets special operations standards and is effective in  training Marine Corps special operations forces to be fully interoperable  with the department\u2019s other special operations forces."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Marine Corps Special Operations Command Has Implemented Programs to Train Personnel to Perform Special Operations Missions", "paragraphs": ["The Marine Corps special operations command has taken several actions  to implement programs to fulfill its responsibility for training personnel to  perform special operations missions. For example, the Command operates  the Marine Special Operations School, which has recently finalized plans  for a training pipeline to initially screen all of the Marines and Sailors  identified for assignment to the Command to determine their suitability for  such assignments. Once the initial screening is completed, personnel who  volunteer for assignments in one of the Command\u2019s warfighter units\u2014 such as the Marine Special Operations Battalions and the Marine Special  Operations Advisor Group\u2014will undergo an additional assessment that  measures mental and physical qualifications. As indicated by the  Command\u2019s plans, personnel who successfully complete this assessment  will be provided with additional baseline special operations training prior  to being assigned to one of the Command\u2019s warfighter units.", "The Marine Special Operations School also provides training to personnel  in special operations companies. This training consists of both classroom  instruction and the practical application of specialized skills. For example,  the school has provided training to personnel in skills such as precision  shooting, close quarters battle, and special reconnaissance techniques. In  addition, the school\u2019s instructors conduct exercises to train the special  operations companies on the unit\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures, as  well as predeployment training events, to certify the companies are  capable of performing the primary special operations missions assigned to  these units.", "The Command\u2019s Marine Special Operations Advisor Group has also  developed a comprehensive training program designed to build the  individual and collective skills required to perform the unit\u2019s mission to  provide military training and advisor support to foreign forces. The  program includes individual training for skills such as light infantry tactics  and cultural and language training, as well as training for advanced skills  in functional areas such as communications, intelligence, and medical  training. The training program culminates with a capstone training event  that evaluates the proficiency of personnel in mission-essential skills. The  training event is used as a means of certifying that these units are trained  to perform their assigned missions.", "In addition, Marine Corps special operations companies and Marine  Special Operations Advisor Group teams conduct unit training to prepare  for the missions that will be performed during deployments. According to  officials with these units, this training is tailored to prepare personnel for  the specific tasks that will likely be performed during the deployment. For  example, officials stated that unit training may include enhanced language  and cultural awareness training for specific countries and training in  environmental terrains where these units will be deployed.", "Marine Corps special operations forces have used conventional Marine  Corps training standards to prepare personnel and units to conduct some  special operations missions. Officials with the Marine Corps special  operations command and its subordinate units told us that its special  operations forces units have trained personnel in some skills based on the  training programs for conventional units that were assigned some special  operations missions prior to the activation of the Command. For example,  according to Marine Corps policy, the service formerly deployed specially  organized, trained, and equipped forces as part of the Marine  Expeditionary Units that were capable of conducting some special  operations missions, such as direct action operations. Officials with the  Marine Corps special operations command and the Marine Corps Special  Operations Battalions told us that the special operations companies have  been provided with training for skills such as urban sniper, specialized  demolitions, and dynamic assault that is based largely on the training and  standards for these skills that were established for conventional Marine  Corps forces.", "For other skills, Marine Corps special operations forces personnel have  reviewed and incorporated the training plans that USSOCOM\u2019s Army,  Navy, and Air Force service components use to prepare their special  operations forces. Marine Corps special operations command officials told  us that conventional Marine Corps units are not typically trained in many  of the advanced skills required to perform some special operations  missions, such as counterterrorism and unconventional warfare. To  develop programs to train personnel on the skills required to perform  these and other special operations missions, Marine Corps special  operations forces have incorporated the training and standards from the  training publications of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, the  Naval Special Warfare Command, and the Air Force Special Operations  Command. However, according to a senior USSOCOM official, Marine  Corps special operations forces have had the discretion to select the  standards to use when training forces to perform special operations skills.", "During our review, we met with servicemembers who had recently  completed deployments with Marine Corps special operations forces units  as well as with servicemembers who were preparing for planned  deployments. In general, these servicemembers told us that they believed  they were adequately trained and prepared to perform their assigned  missions. Team leaders with the Marine Special Operations Advisor  Group, for example, stated that they received sufficient guidance to  properly plan and execute special operations missions during deployments  to train and advise foreign military forces. However, at the time of our  work, the Marine Corps special operations companies that participated in  the first deployments of these units had not yet completed their  deployments. As a result, we were unable to discuss whether the training  that was provided was adequate to fully meet their mission requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USSOCOM Has Not Formally Validated That Marine Corps Training Meets Special Operations Forces Standards and Prepares Forces to Be Fully Interoperable with Other Forces", "paragraphs": ["USSOCOM has not formally validated that the training used to prepare  Marine Corps forces meets special operations standards and prepares  forces to be fully interoperable with the department\u2019s other special  operations forces. The Marine Corps special operations command has  made progress in developing and implementing training programs for  Marine Corps special operations forces. However, the Command has not  used common training standards for special operations skills because  USSOCOM has not developed common training standards for many skills,  although work to establish common standards is ongoing. USSOCOM  officials stated the headquarters and the service components are working  to develop common training standards, where appropriate, because  USSOCOM recognizes that the service-specific training conducted for  advanced special operations skills may not optimize opportunities for  commonality, jointness, or efficiency. In addition, USSOCOM officials told  us that common training standards would further promote  departmentwide interoperability goals, address potential safety concerns,  and provide greater assurances to future joint force commanders that  special operations forces are trained to similar standards.", "Our prior work has shown that the lack of commonality in training  standards for joint operations creates potentially hazardous conditions on  the battlefield. For example, we reported in 2003 that the military services  and the special operations community did not use common standards to  train personnel to control air support of ground forces. In particular, we  found that the standards for these personnel in special operations units  differed among the Army, Navy, and Air Force because personnel were  required to meet their service-specific training requirements, which led to  hesitation by commanders in Afghanistan to employ some special  operations forces personnel to direct air support of ground forces. In  2005, USSOCOM established minimum standards for training, qualifying,  evaluating, and certifying special operations forces personnel who control  air support of ground forces.", "USSOCOM formalized a process in 2006 to establish and validate common  training standards for special operations skills. As part of this process,  USSOCOM established a working group comprised of representatives from  USSOCOM and each service component to determine the baseline tasks  that define the training standard and the service component training  requirements for special operations skills. According to a USSOCOM  official, the working group first identified the common training  requirements and standards for the skills of military free fall and combat  dive. In addition, USSOCOM and its service components are working  incrementally to identify common training standards for other special  operations skills, such as the training required for personnel assigned to  combined joint special operations task forces. However, officials with  USSOCOM and the Marine Corps special operations command told us the  process to establish common training standards for applicable special  operations skills will likely take a considerable amount of time to  complete due to the number of advanced special operations skills and the  challenge of building consensus among the service components on what  constitutes a common training standard.", "Furthermore, USSOCOM has not formally validated whether the training  used to prepare Marine Corps forces meets special operations standards  and prepares forces to be fully interoperable with the department\u2019s other  special operations forces. USSOCOM has taken some limited steps to  evaluate the training provided to Marine Corps special operations forces.  In November 2006, for example, USSOCOM representatives attended a  training exercise on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton for a Marine  special operations company that was preparing for an upcoming  deployment. In addition, USSOCOM representatives observed training  exercises in February 2007 for Marine Special Operations Advisor Group  teams that were preparing to deploy. A USSOCOM official told us that the  purpose of these evaluations was to observe some of the planned training  tasks and focus on areas where USSOCOM could assist the Marine Corps  special operations command in future training exercises. However,  USSOCOM has not formally assessed the training programs used by the  Marine Corps special operations command to prepare its forces for  deployments, despite the fact that USSOCOM is responsible for evaluating  the effectiveness of all training programs and ensuring the interoperability  of all of DOD\u2019s special operations forces. Our review of the reports  prepared for USSOCOM leadership and provided to Marine Corps  personnel showed that they did not contain a formal evaluation of the  training content and they did not provide an assessment of the standards  used during the training to determine whether the training was in  accordance with special operations forces standards.", "Officials with the Marine Corps special operations command and its  subordinate units told us that USSOCOM has not been extensively  involved in the development of Marine Corps special operations forces  training programs and the performance standards used to train Marine  Corps special operations forces.

These officials told us the service component  commander has the primary responsibility for establishing training  programs and certifying that special operations forces are capable of  performing special operations missions prior to deployments. In addition,  a USSOCOM official stated that any training-related issues affecting the  readiness of special operations forces are identified in readiness reports  and are discussed during monthly meetings between senior USSOCOM  leadership and the service component commanders. However, without  common training standards for special operations skills or a formal  validation of the training used to prepare Marine Corps special operations  forces for planned deployments in the near term, USSOCOM cannot  demonstrate the needed assurances to the geographic combatant  commanders that Marine Corps special operations forces are trained to  special operations forces standards and that these forces meet  departmentwide interoperability goals for special operations forces,  thereby potentially affecting the success of future joint operations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since activating a Marine Corps component to USSOCOM, the Marine  Corps has made considerable progress integrating into the special  operations force structure, and several Marine Corps units have  successfully completed deployments to train foreign military forces\u2014a  key focus area in DOD\u2019s strategy for the war on terrorism.

We examined available documents that detail training  programs for Marine Corps special operations forces. We interviewed  officials from the Marine Corps special operations command and  USSOCOM to discuss the processes used to identify and select training  standards for special operations skills. We collected and analyzed  documents related to USSOCOM\u2019s evaluations of Marine Corps special  operations forces training, and we discussed the efforts that have been  taken by the Marine Corps special operations command and USSOCOM to  assess the effectiveness of these training programs. We conducted our  work from August 2006 through July 2007 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Using our assessment of data  reliability, we concluded that the data used to support this review were  sufficiently reliable to answer our objectives. We interviewed the source of  these data to determine how data accuracy was ensured, and we discussed  their data collection methods, standard operating procedures, and other  internal control measures.", "We interviewed officials and obtained documentation at the following  locations:    Office of the Secretary of Defense    Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and    Force Structure, Resources, and Assessment Directorate, J8   U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters (Combat Development Command)    U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters (Installations and Logistics  Department)", "U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters (Intelligence Department)    U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)", "U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters (Plans, Policies, and Operations)    U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters (Programs and Resources)    U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters (Training and Education Command)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Carole Coffey, Assistant Director;  Renee Brown; Jason Jackson; David Malkin; Karen Thornton; and Matthew  Ullengren also made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
