In fiscal year 2014, IGs reported 38 programs accounting for $100.6 billion in estimated improper payments as responsible for instances of noncompliance. Agency noncompliance for fiscal year 2014 was largely due to agencies failing to meet improper payment reduction targets or to report improper payment error rates at less than 10 percent for all programs. If the 5 agencies with programs exceeding 10 percent error rates had reported error rates under the threshold set in IPERA, the government-wide improper payment estimate would have been $23.1 billion, or 18.6 percent, lower.", "In addition, 18 programs at 9 agencies were reported as noncompliant with IPERA criteria by their agencies' IGs for at least 3 consecutive years as of fiscal year 2014. Agencies with programs reported as noncompliant for 3 consecutive years are required to submit proposals to Congress to reauthorize the programs or change the statutes that established them. However, GAO found that only 3 agencies submitted such information to Congress. When agencies do not report to Congress as required, Congress is limited in its ability to monitor the implementation of IPERA and ensure that its intent is being fulfilled.", "Certain IGs also did not fully adhere to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance or statutory requirements for IPERA reporting for fiscal year 2014 by either failing to (1) clearly state the agency's compliance status overall and with each of the six criteria, (2) report on programs designated high priority by OMB as necessary, or (3) report compliance determinations for disaster relief programs. In the past year, OMB has made efforts to clarify its guidance to IGs. To determine if IGs made changes in response to OMB's efforts and deficiencies identified in GAO's preliminary findings shared with them, GAO reviewed select fiscal year 2015 IPERA reports issued by IGs in May 2016.

OMB is directed by statute to provide guidance to  federal agencies on estimating, reporting, reducing, and recovering  improper payments, and has also issued guidance to agencies on  improving improper payment estimates as required by IPERIA.", "In October 2014, OMB issued new guidance on improper payments that  changed certain requirements for fiscal year 2014 reporting, such as  extending the reporting period for IG IPERA reports and also eliminating  an additional criterion for IGs to assess whether agencies have reported  on efforts to recapture improper payments. Per this guidance, an  agency\u2019s IG is required to submit a report on its assessment of the  agency\u2019s compliance with the criteria listed in IPERA, as applicable, to the  head of the agency, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs, the House Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform, the Comptroller General, and the OMB Controller  within 180 days of the publication of the agency\u2019s annual PAR or AFR.", "IPERA states that if an IG reports that an agency is not in compliance  with any of the IPERA criteria for 1 fiscal year, the agency head must  submit a plan to appropriate congressional committees and OMB  describing the actions that the agency will take to come into compliance.  If an agency is found noncompliant with respect to the same program for  2 consecutive years, IPERA directs OMB to review the program and  determine if additional funding would help bring the program into  compliance and, if so, directs the agency to use any available  reprogramming or transfer authority, or request further reprogramming or  transfer authority from Congress, to aid in the program\u2019s remediation  efforts. For programs determined to be noncompliant for more than 3  consecutive years, the agency is required by IPERA to submit to  Congress within 30 days of the IG\u2019s report either (1) a reauthorization  proposal for the program or (2) proposed statutory changes necessary to  bring the program or activity into compliance. In addition, OMB\u2019s  guidance stipulates that OMB may require agencies that are  noncompliant to complete additional requirements. For example, OMB  could require that the agency re-evaluate or re-prioritize its corrective  actions, intensify and expand existing corrective action plans, or  implement or pilot new tools and methods to prevent improper payments.", "OMB is required to annually identify a list of high-priority federal programs  in need of greater oversight and review. In general, OMB has  implemented this requirement by designating high-priority programs  based on a threshold of $750 million in estimated improper payments for  a given year. OMB guidance directs IGs at executive branch agencies  with high-priority programs, as part of their annual compliance reviews, to  (1) evaluate the agency\u2019s assessment of risk level and quality of the  improper payment methodology for estimation; (2) determine the extent of  oversight needed; and (3) provide the agency with recommendations, as  necessary, for improving its methodology, internal controls, or level of  program access and participation.", "In addition to the laws and guidance noted above, the Disaster Relief  Appropriations Act, 2013 requires that all programs receiving funds  appropriated by that act be deemed susceptible to significant improper  payments, which consequently requires the agencies responsible for  these programs to estimate improper payments, implement corrective  actions, and report on their results for these programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IGs Reported a Decrease in Compliance with IPERA Criteria Caused Primarily by Agencies\u2019 Failure to Meet Improper Payment Reduction Targets", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2014, 15 of the 24 CFO Act agency IGs reported their  agencies as noncompliant with one or more of the IPERA Section 3  criteria.

Specifically, 10 agencies  published reduction targets but failed to meet them, and 1 agency\u2014the  Department of Labor (DOL)\u2014failed to comply because it did not publish  an improper payment reduction target rate for its Unemployment  Insurance benefit program. DOL IG reported that the agency did not  publish an annual reduction target for this program because DOL was  awaiting additional guidance and consultation regarding estimation  methodology with OMB. Other IGs reported that factors affecting  compliance with this criterion included challenges in maintaining  adequate and complete supporting documentation and conducting  adequate reviews.

HHS reported that new legislative requirements for  its Medicare Fee-for-Service and Medicaid programs contributed to the  programs\u2019 noncompliance. The USDA IG also reported that a flawed  sampling method for USDA\u2019s Federal Crop Insurance Corporation  Program Fund resulted in its failure to meet its reduction target because  one program component reported a 27 percent error rate. Anomalies in  samples for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health  Administration\u2019s Civilian Health and Medical Program were considered by  the agency to be the cause for noncompliance in meeting reduction  targets because such sampling issues disproportionately skewed  improper payment error rates upwards.", "IG reports also indicated that an agency\u2019s failure to meet reduction  targets may not necessarily suggest that the agency was not adequately  monitoring its programs\u2019 improper payments. For example, the VA, Small  Business Administration (SBA), and USDA IGs reported increases in  improper payment error rates because of factors such as improved  sampling and emphasis on training, which enhanced their agencies\u2019  ability to detect improper payments.

Although  IPERA requirements apply to the head of each executive agency, we only  reviewed reports of those agencies designated as CFO Act agencies  because these agencies represented over 99 percent of the total  government-wide improper payments reported in fiscal year 2014.", "To address our first objective, we identified the requirements that  agencies must meet by reviewing the Improper Payments Information Act  of 2002, as amended; IPERA; and OMB guidance. We analyzed CFO  Act agency IGs\u2019 fiscal year 2014 IPERA reports, which were the most  current reports available at the beginning of our review, and summarized  information related to agency compliance with IPERA criteria and  identified common findings and related causes for improper payments, as  reported by the IGs.

To summarize the CFO Act agencies\u2019 noncompliant programs for  fiscal years 2011 through 2014, we compared data from the IG IPERA  reports and agencies\u2019 performance and accountability reports (PAR) and  agency financial reports (AFR) for those years. We also determined the  programs responsible for noncompliance over this period by analyzing  and summarizing the determinations made in the IG reports.

To determine if agencies responsible for  these noncompliant programs had submitted either proposals for  reauthorization or statutory changes to Congress, we interviewed and  requested information from relevant agency offices of chief financial  officer in coordination with the agency IGs.

For agencies reporting  improper payment estimates for disaster relief funding, we reviewed the  Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 and determined whether the  agencies listed therein reported improper payment estimates and whether  their IGs reported compliance determinations for those programs in their  fiscal year 2014 IPERA reports.", "We also compared the structure and content of the fiscal year 2014 IG  reports to that required by IPERA and OMB Memorandum M-15-02.  Further, we reviewed the improper payments reporting contained in the  AFRs and PARs of the CFO Act agencies for fiscal year 2014 to ensure  that certain IG compliance determinations for some criteria agreed to our  observations. Specifically, in each fiscal year 2014 CFO Act agency AFR  or PAR, we determined whether the following IPERA Section 3 criteria  were met for each program assessed to be at risk for significant improper  payments: (1) corrective action plans were reported, (2) annual reduction  targets were published and met, and (3) a gross improper payment  estimate of less than 10 percent was reported for each program. For the  remaining criteria related to publishing the required information in the  PAR or AFR, conducting risk assessments, and publishing improper  payment estimates for programs deemed susceptible to significant  improper payments, we did not make conclusions but relied on the IGs\u2019  judgments of compliance and noncompliance. IGs gave their respective  agencies the opportunity to comment on their fiscal year 2014 IPERA  compliance reports, and we reviewed all agency and IG responses. To  determine if certain IGs corrected deficiencies identified in preliminary  GAO findings shared with them and followed OMB guidance for fiscal  year 2015 reporting, we reviewed the fiscal year 2015 IPERA reports  issued in May 2016 by the seven IGs in whose fiscal year 2014 reports  we identified deficiencies. We determined that the conclusions in the IGs\u2019  reports were sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 to June 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: CFO Act Agencies and Programs Reported as Noncompliant under IPERA by IGs for Fiscal Year 2014", "paragraphs": ["Table 9 lists the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 agencies and their  programs that their inspectors general reported in fiscal year 2014 were  noncompliant with the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act  of 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Reported Improper Payment Estimates by Agency and Program/Activity for Fiscal Year 2015", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Table 10 lists reported improper payment estimates by agency and program or activity for fiscal year 2015.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of the Interior Office of Inspector General", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of State Office of Inspector General", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Comments from the General Services Administration Office of Inspector General", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management Office of Inspector General", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XII: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIII: Comments from the Office of Management and Budget", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Philip McIntyre (Assistant  Director), Laura Bednar (Auditor-in-Charge), Maria Belaval, Wilfred  Holloway, Jason Kelly, Jason Kirwan, and Ricky A.
