But behind this  simple arithmetic are a host of demand and supply factors that influence  cattle prices and the costs of raising cattle.  For instance, the outcome for  producers depends on how consumer tastes affect the demand and price  for beef.  Producers\u2019 fortunes also hinge on how weather affects the supply  and cost of forage and feed grains.  The long biological cycle for cattle  means that producers have to make supply decisions about herd size long  before animals are sold and prices are known.  International trade in cattle  and beef, competition from poultry, pork, and other protein sources for a  place in the consumer\u2019s shopping cart, and household income are also  among the many demand factors that influence cattle prices and producers\u2019  incomes.", "In addition, structural changes that have been reshaping segments of the  industry are affecting cattle demand and supply.  The four largest  meatpacking firms now slaughter more than 80 percent of all steers and  heifers, compared with 36 percent 20 years ago.  Agreements between  producers and meatpackers stipulating prices, number of cattle, and quality  considerations are becoming more commonplace.  Technological changes  now enable packers to deliver shelf-ready products to grocers. Information  technology is being used to conduct live-cattle auctions on the Internet. All  these developments and more potentially influence the demand and supply  of cattle, directly or indirectly affecting cattle prices and producers\u2019  incomes.", "Many demand and supply factors can be considered in developing a model,  or logical framework, to explain cattle prices and producers\u2019 incomes.  Which of these factors to include depends on the model\u2019s purpose or the  specific questions it is intended to answer.  Data availability and the results  of testing how well various factors explain prices and incomes also  determine which factors to include in a model.  Modeling frameworks can  range from highly complex mathematical formulations to less formal  meetings of the mind among a panel of experts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SUPPL SUPPLY Y SUPPL SUPPLY", "paragraphs": ["Feedlots specialize in feeding steers and heifers a concentrated diet of corn  and other grains before the animals are slaughtered at the meatpacking  plant.  Typically, animals remain in feedlots until they weigh 950 to 1,250  pounds. Greater demand for these fed cattle, resulting from increased  demand for beef, has a ripple effect throughout other cattle production  stages.  To supply more cattle to meatpackers, feedlots need more cattle  from stocker or growing operations, which in many cases are integrated  with cow-calf producers.  Most of the calves that cow-calf producers  supply for beef production are placed in these growing operations, where  they take on weight while they pasture on grass and other forages.  These  feeder cattle are sent to feedlots when they weigh between 500 and 750  pounds (fig. 3 shows such cattle feeding at a feedlot trough).  Increased  demand for these feeder cattle by feedlots puts upward pressure on feeder  cattle prices.", "In the face of increased demand, cow-calf producers raise more calves,  sometimes relying on seedstock operators, who supply more breeding  stock, such as bulls. Calves are usually weaned from cows when they weigh  about 500 pounds. Figure 4 traces the movement of animals from breeding  to processing and consumption.  Thus, as the effects of an increase in  consumer demand for beef unfold, prices, signaling this change in demand,  eventually rise along the chain, depending on the strength of demand and  the availability of supply, as depicted in figure 5.  Figure 6 outlines the  changes in retail beef, boxed beef, and slaughter prices from 1974 through  1999.", "Important connections exist also between the cattle and beef industry and  other sectors of the economy.  Some of the closest connections are with  products that compete with beef, such as poultry and pork.  Other close  connections are with critical inputs to the cattle and beef industry, such as  feed grains.  Because the cattle and beef industry is a major user of feed  grains, beef production is also affected by grain supplies and prices.  Feed  is a major cost component in cow-calf production.   In addition, foreign  demand and supply of beef and cattle interact with domestic demand and  supply in determining cattle prices and producers\u2019 incomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Structural and Technological Changes in the Cattle and Beef Industry", "paragraphs": ["The demand and supply relationships connecting various segments of the  cattle and beef industry are changing in a number of ways.  Some of the  structural changes relate to how meatpackers procure cattle.  Historically,  cattle were bought and sold in a spot market.  Most sales occurred at  terminal markets and auctions with cattle ready for delivery on sale.  More  recently, this activity has shifted to feedlots, where packers purchase cattle  directly from cattle owners or feedlot managers.  Cattle procurement no  longer relies solely on the spot market and now involves closer ties  between packers and feedlots.  Three procurement methods involving such  closer ties are marketing agreements, forward contracts, and packer fed  cattle.", "In a marketing agreement, a feedlot may sell cattle to a packer according to  a prearranged schedule and price.  Such agreements generally involve  ongoing relationships between feedlots and packers for the sale of cattle  rather than a single transaction.   Prices paid for cattle are often determined  by a formula, which may be based on prices paid for other cattle  slaughtered at the meatpacker\u2019s plant or publicly reported prices.  In  addition, price premiums and discounts may be paid that are based on  cattle quality.", "In a forward contract, the packer and seller agree on future delivery of  cattle, typically using a formula based on futures prices or publicly  reported prices to set the contract\u2019s base price. When the price is based on  futures prices, the parties agree on a differential from futures prices, called  the price basis.  Premiums and discounts are applied for differences in  cattle quality.  Typically, feedlots and packers agree on delivery month,  specific cattle to be delivered, cattle quality standards, and the price basis.", "Packers also slaughter cattle that they own themselves and feed in feedlots.   Packers may also share ownership of cattle with individuals or feedlots  where the cattle are fed.   This arrangement, called vertical integration,  goes a step further, supplanting the coordinated exchange relationship  between feedlots and packers that characterizes marketing agreements and  forward contracts with the meatpacker\u2019s outright ownership of the cattle.   Vertical integration also occurs when a single entity has ownership control  of animal production, processing, and marketing beef products.", "Tying cattle prices to quality is called value-based pricing.  It derives from  the belief that traditional cattle pricing, relying on animal weight, does not  adequately relay consumer preferences for quality and attendant price  signals to producers. Grade and yield pricing is frequently used, which  applies price premiums and discounts to a predetermined base price  according to carcass attributes.  Another slight variation is grid pricing, in  which a base price is determined after the transaction between buyer and  seller has been negotiated.  In addition, some beef packers use the  wholesale value of beef to determine the price they are willing to pay for  cattle.", "What effect vertical coordination\u2014through marketing agreements and  forward contracts, vertical integration, and value-based pricing\u2014is having  on cattle prices and producers\u2019 incomes has been debated by various  industry analysts.  For instance, some believe that marketing agreements  and forward contracts have adversely affected prices paid for cattle bought  in the spot market, while others hold that producers benefit from these  arrangements.  Some research suggests that rising levels of vertical  coordination and integration can be traced to consolidation in the  meatpacking and feedlot sectors.", "Another feature of structural change in the cattle and beef industry has  been the consolidation of the meatpacking sector into fewer firms  operating large production facilities able to slaughter half a million or more  steers and heifers per year.  Large plants accounted for less than 25 percent  of steer and heifer slaughter in 1980 but more than 75 percent in 1995.  A  recent USDA study found that economies of scale help explain this  increase in consolidation and market concentration in the meatpacking  sector. USDA also found that large facilities are fabricating more meat  products because they can do so at lower cost than meat wholesalers and  retailers, the traditional carcass buyers.", "Market concentration measures total sales of the largest firms in a specific  market or industry.  The four largest meatpacking firms accounted for 36  percent of total commercial slaughter in 1980, 72 percent in 1990, and 81  percent in 1999, as seen in figure 7, which therefore can be seen as  illustrating a rise in market concentration in the meatpacking sector over  that period of time. Some analysts are concerned that greater  concentration has led to fewer meatpackers bidding for cattle and offering  lower prices.   Others hold that technological change and cost economies  are the most important factors driving the meatpacking sector and that  market power associated with concentration has played a relatively minor  role in determining cattle prices.", "Technological changes in the cattle and beef industry, according to USDA,  are becoming an underlying cause of economies of scale in meatpacking.   In a development directly affecting packers, retailers, and consumers,  packaging and processing technology has enabled meatpackers to move  from supplying boxed beef to firms that specialize in further processing to  directly supplying case-ready meats, convenience products, often seasoned  and marinated, and precooked products for immediate retail sale.  In  contrast, in the early 1970s, meatpacking plants were typically engaged  only in slaughter, sending carcasses to wholesalers and retailers for  processing into retail products.  Packers have also begun marketing their  products electronically.", "Another technological development that affects packers and producers  directly is the electronic measurement of animal carcass quality, making it  easier for packers to determine the grade and other characteristics of  carcasses.  In another development affecting producers and packers, cattle  marketing has begun on the Internet. Cattle feeding through feed additives  and computerized onsite feedmills and feeding operations represents yet  more technological innovation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Beef\u2019s Competition from Other Meats", "paragraphs": ["The consumption of beef and other meats has changed over time.  A USDA  study concluded that decreased demand for beef was a major reason for  the larger increase in market concentration in the beef industry than in the  pork industry. According to USDA, decreased demand for beef was an  important incentive for meatpacking firms to seek cost savings through  larger plants.  As shown in figure 8, per capita beef consumption began  falling in the mid-1970s but leveled off in the 1990s. During these two  decades, per capita poultry consumption rose steadily while per capita  pork consumption remained relatively stable.

Beef exports rose from less than 1  percent of U.S. beef consumption in 1970 to 9 percent in 1999, seen in  figure 11. Beef imports, in contrast, have ranged between 7 percent and 11  percent of U.S. commercial production since 1970, seen in figure 12.", "The United States imports more cattle than it exports, as seen in figure 13.   The nations from which it imports cattle\u2014Canada and Mexico\u2014are, for all  practical purposes, the same nations to which it exports cattle.

The actions of individual producers to \u201ctime the market\u201d by  building up their herds in advance of expected cyclical peaks in cattle  prices can also shape the cattle cycle.  As figure 16 shows, cattle  inventories have at times reached peak numbers before associated peaks in  beef production, and while the number of cattle has fallen, beef production  has risen.

Models can also  be designed to answer questions about the effects of structural change and  international trade, to name two.", "Another critical issue determining the type of modeling has to do with  judgments about how successful a model will be in answering relevant  questions.

In some cases, it also depends on the ability to isolate  cause and effect in the model\u2014for instance, being able to pinpoint what  caused the decline in per capita beef consumption.  Being able to  accurately define and estimate cause and effect in a model is complicated  by the possibility of multiple causes and the challenge of isolating each  one\u2019s effect.   Limited knowledge about the processes being studied and  changes in demand and supply relationships over time are important  hurdles, as well.  Success is also contingent on the quality of previous  research.", "Models can consist of a single equation representing the link between  current and past values of a variable for short-term forecasting purposes to  frameworks consisting of many interrelated equations.

One  of the strengths of the Delphi method is its flexibility.  Rather than  employing face-to-face discussion, we used a version that incorporated an  iterative and controlled feedback process, administering a series of three  questionnaires over the Internet.  We used this approach to eliminate the  potential bias associated with live group discussions.  The biasing effects of  live discussions can include the dominance of individuals and group  pressure for conformity.   Moreover, by creating a virtual panel, we were  able to include many more experts than we could have with an actual  panel.

Neither type of model is detailed enough to project  cattle prices or address the effects of structural changes associated with  market concentration, marketing agreements, and forward contracts in the  cattle and beef industry.", "When investigating domestic injury claims, ITC economists use COMPAS, a  partial equilibrium model.  COMPAS was designed to estimate how  importers\u2019 selling of a specific product below its fair price would affect  price, sales, and revenue of that product in the competing domestic sector.   Selling imports at less than fair value is sometimes referred to as  dumping.  COMPAS is also used to estimate the effects of governments\u2019  subsidizing exports.  To do so, COMPAS uses a standardized methodology,  beginning with a supply and demand framework and assuming less than  perfect substitutability between domestic and imported products.  Values  of demand and supply parameters needed to assess the effects of dumping  are often obtained from other researchers\u2019 estimates.  ITC typically uses a  range of estimated values for these parameters to reflect uncertainty.  ITC  commissioners may consider the results of this analysis in their  deliberations. However, according to ITC officials, commissioners rely on  the specifics of legal statutes and the record of facts collected during ITC\u2019s  investigation in reaching their decisions rather than on model results in  assessing injury.", "ITC injury investigations involving dumping and subsidies must adhere to  specific statutory criteria, procedures and time periods.  The process  starts with an interested party filing a petition with ITC and the Department  of Commerce.  For both dumping and subsidies investigations, ITC must  make a preliminary determination of whether there is a \u201creasonable  indication\u201d that an industry is materially injured or threatened with  material injury by the imports in question.  If ITC\u2019s determination is  negative, the investigation ends.  If it is affirmative, the investigation  continues and Commerce makes a preliminary determination of whether  there has been dumping or subsidies and, if so, a preliminary calculation of  what the dumping or subsidy margin would be.  Commerce continues the  investigation, regardless of its preliminary findings, and makes a final  determination of dumping or subsidies and a final calculation of margins.   If Commerce\u2019s final determination is affirmative, ITC continues its  investigation and makes a final determination of material injury or threat of  material injury.", "Recently, COMPAS was used, in response to a 1998 petition by the  Ranchers\u2013Cattlemen Action Legal Foundation and others, to investigate  Canadian and Mexican cattle alleged to have been sold in the United States  at less than fair value.  ITC staff used a range of estimates representing  supply, demand, and product substitution relationships in the U.S. cattle  market.  These estimates, along with data on market share, Commerce\u2019s  dumping margins, transportation costs, and tariffs, were incorporated in  COMPAS to analyze the likely effects of unfair pricing of cattle imports on  the U.S. cattle industry.  In the absence of dumping, ITC estimated U.S  prices would have been between 0.2 percent and 1.8 percent higher, U.S.  cattle producers\u2019 revenue would have been from 0.3 percent to 1.8 percent  higher, and U.S. cattle producers\u2019 output would have been between 0 and  0.4 percent higher. The commissioners determined that the industry was  not materially injured or threatened with material injury by these imports.", "This 1998 investigation reveals some limitations in the COMPAS model for  analyzing problems in the cattle and beef industry.  ITC\u2019s estimates of the  effects of these imports relied on the value of the dumping margin  Commerce determined and on supply and demand price elasticities  (parties to the investigation are requested to provide feedback on these  values and other expert sources are consulted).  In the absence of a  dumping investigation and data on a dumping margin, COMPAS cannot be  readily applied to assess the effect of an import quantity surge.   Furthermore, while COMPAS can be used to estimate the effect of price  changes in the cattle or beef sector, the model does not explicitly link  downstream beef-sector effects to the upstream cattle sector.  COMPAS  also does not explicitly account for changes in concentration in the  meatpacking industry, marketing agreements, and forward contracts.", "The ITC 1998 investigation reveals other analytical issues.  To account for  uncertainty about the values of key parameters used in COMPAS, such as  price elasticity or sensitivity of U.S. demand and supply of cattle and the  extent to which imported cattle can be substituted for U.S. cattle, ITC used  a fairly wide range of estimates for the parameters.  In addition, while ITC  was informed that imports affected some U.S. producers and regions more  than others, published data at this level of detail are often unavailable, and  most studies that have estimated price sensitivities used national data.", "ITC uses various models to carry out other economic studies examining the  effects of broad trade policy changes, such as NAFTA.  For example, ITC  issued a study in 1997 on the effect of NAFTA and the Uruguay Round on  U.S. trade of cattle and beef with Canada and Mexico, using an  econometric model that estimated effects on trade volume, but did not  estimate or predict effects on U.S. cattle prices. ITC has also used  computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to assess the likely effects  on various sectors of the U.S. economy from major trade liberalization.

Overall, research conducted  by or for the Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Administration  (GIPSA), a USDA  agency, has not found conclusive evidence linking these  changes to domestic cattle price changes. For example, GIPSA reported  in 1996 that the findings of an extensive literature review were inconclusive  concerning the effects of concentration, primarily because of limitations in  methods or data in the research reviewed. This report also stated that  while the body of evidence from the literature was insufficient to support a  finding of noncompetitive behavior, GIPSA also could not conclude that the  industry is competitive.  The study recommended that future research  focus more directly on data disaggregation at the firm and plant levels to  provide a better understanding of the dynamics of individual firm behavior  and rivalry between firms.", "Assessing competitiveness from available data was also difficult in an ERS  study on the causes and effects of consolidation and  concentration.  While this analysis did not support conclusions about the exercise of  market power by beef packers, even though no other manufacturing  industry showed as large an increase in concentration since the U.S.  Bureau of the Census began regularly publishing concentration data in  1947, it also concluded that models need to be improved to more fully  incorporate relevant determinants of company behavior.  Difficulty in  assessing the competitiveness from available data held true for another  study entitled Effects of Concentration on Prices Paid for Cattle,  contracted for by GIPSA.  The study\u2019s summary states: \u201cThe analysis did  not support any conclusions about the exercise of market power by beef  packers. It appears that improved models are needed to more fully  incorporate relevant determinants of firms\u2019 behavior\u201d.", "The ERS study, using data from the Census of Manufacturers for 1963\u201392,  found that meatpackers had shifted toward larger plants that annually  slaughtered at least half a million steers and heifers. The study found that  scale economies were modest but extensive.  The largest meatpacking  plants maintained only small cost advantages (1 to 3 percent) over smaller  plants, but these modest scale economies appeared to extend throughout  all sizes of 1992 plants.  According to ERS, if larger meatpackers realize  lower costs, then concentration, by reducing industry costs, can lead to  improved prices for consumers and livestock producers. However,  because meatpackers face fewer competitors, they could reduce prices  paid to livestock producers, and they might be able to raise meat prices  charged to wholesalers and retailers.", "Another study, sponsored by GIPSA, examined the underlying cost  relationship believed to motivate packer behavior. This study used  monthly cost and revenue data for 1992\u201393 from a GIPSA survey of the 43  largest U.S. beef packing plants.  Estimates from this study indicated  significant cost economies and little if any depression of cattle prices or  excess profitability in the meatpacking industry.", "GIPSA has also studied the effects on cattle prices of the greater use of  marketing agreements and forward contracts.  Some of these studies have  found an inverse or negative relationship between captive supplies, which  encompass marketing agreements and forward contracts, and spot market  prices, but none has yet shown that captive supplies cause low spot or cash  market prices.  For example, GIPSA entered into a cooperative agreement  in March 1998 with economists from two universities. The agreement was  to conduct an econometric analysis of Texas cattle data to determine  whether marketing agreements and other contracting methods for  procuring cattle (captive supplies) had an adverse effect on the prices paid  for cattle on the spot market.

USDA first  obtains average retail prices from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which  collects them to calculate the consumer price index (CPI).  The bureau  collects regular and sales prices from grocery stores and averages these  prices, regardless of the amount purchased at each price.  Then, USDA  weights these prices by each cut\u2019s proportion of a cattle carcass.  As a  result, USDA does not report retail prices on the basis of actual consumer  purchases of beef products.

To reduce the amount of data being  withheld, USDA recently announced a new confidentiality guideline; it  believes that had this guideline been in place earlier, less than 2 percent of  the daily swine and cattle reports would have been withheld from  publication during that period.", "The panelists also offered general and specific comments about how the  government can help address the issues it identified in table 7.
