Among other services, they provide skilled nursing and supportive care to older individuals who do not need the intensive medical care provided by hospitals, but for whom receiving such care at home is no longer feasible. An estimated 43 percent of Americans who passed their 65th birthday in 1990 will use a nursing home at some time in their lives. In 1997, there were more than 17,000 nursing homes in the United States with over 1.7 million beds. The federal government, through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, paid these homes nearly $28 billion in 1997.", "In 1997, a lawyer and an investigator raised allegations to your Committee that 3,113 residents died in 971 California nursing homes in 1993 as a result of malnutrition, dehydration, and other serious conditions for which they did not receive acceptable care. Poor nutrition, dehydration, and improper care of incontinent and immobile residents can result in bedsores (pressure sores) or urinary tract infections, which, if not properly treated, can lead to more serious infection and death. The federal government, through the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), and the state of California, through its Department of Health Services (DHS), share oversight responsibilities for California nursing homes that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To assess compliance with federal standards, DHS relies primarily on a yearly standard survey conducted by nurses or other staff with medical or social service backgrounds who review the care and services provided by the homes. California has more than 1,400 nursing homes, with over 141,000 resident beds. The Medicare and Medicaid programs paid these homes approximately $2 billion in 1997.", "Concerned about the life-threatening potential of these conditions, you asked us to (1) examine, through a medical record review, whether these allegations had merit and whether serious care problems currently exist; (2) review the adequacy of federal and state efforts in monitoring nursing home care through annual surveys; and (3) assess the effectiveness of federal and state efforts to enforce sustained compliance with federal nursing home requirements.", "To address the allegations pertaining to the acceptability of care in 1993, two registered nurses, one with a doctoral degree in gerontological nursing and the other with a master\u2019s degree in the same field, and both with clinical expertise in nursing home care and data abstraction, conducted a clinical review of the medical records for a sample of residents included in the allegations. Using clinical practice guidelines, published research, and professional judgment concerning acceptable nursing home care, the nurses determined whether residents received acceptable or unacceptable care. Their work was further reviewed by another registered nurse on our staff with experience working in nursing homes and judging whether care met acceptable clinical standards. This second review focused specifically on a critical examination of all cases in which the first team of registered nurses identified residents as having had unacceptable care. Our registered nurse also discussed some of the cases with physicians and additional registered nurses specializing in geriatric care to further clarify whether care was acceptable or unacceptable. From this second review, we excluded all questionable cases from the final unacceptable care group. Because of our sampling method, the results of this analysis of medical records pertaining to deaths in 1993 cannot be generalized to the universe of all residents in California nursing homes operating then or now.", "To assess the adequacy of federal and state efforts in monitoring nursing home care, we (1) reviewed federal and state data that showed the results of surveys, complaint investigations, and enforcement actions taken from 1995 to 1998; (2) accompanied state surveyors during their regularly scheduled annual survey of two nursing homes and, with the help of a second team of registered nurses experienced in assessing nursing home care, conducted a concurrent survey of care at these two homes; and (3) interviewed officials from nursing homes, DHS, HCFA, nursing home industry associations, and advocacy groups.

The law requires HCFA to contract with state agencies to survey nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid. In California, DHS performs nursing home oversight, and its authority is specifically defined in state and federal laws and regulations. As part of this role, DHS (1) licenses nursing homes to do business in California; (2) certifies to the federal government, by conducting reviews of nursing homes, that the homes are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid payment; and (3) investigates complaints about care provided in the licensed homes.", "To assess nursing home compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, DHS relies on two types of reviews\u2014the standard survey and the complaint investigation. The standard survey, which must be conducted no less than once every 15 months at each home, entails a team of state surveyors spending several days on site conducting a broad review of care and services with regard to meeting the assessed needs of the residents. The complaint investigation entails conducting a targeted review with regard to a specific complaint filed against a home. California state law mandates that a complaint must be investigated within 2 to 10 days, depending on the seriousness of the infraction being alleged.

For example, under HCFA regulations, a home is to be cited for \u201csubstandard quality of care\u201d when it has certain deficiencies exceeding a particular severity and scope level. Receiving a substandard rating is significant because, depending on a home\u2019s past performance, such a rating can prompt stronger enforcement actions than are typically taken under HCFA policy.", "The deficiencies that can warrant a substandard rating involve federal requirements related to quality of care, quality of life, and resident behavior and facility practices. Any of these types of deficiencies involving immediate jeopardy to resident health and safety results in a substandard rating. In addition, these types of deficiencies lead to a substandard rating if they are of the following severity and scope combinations: a pattern of or widespread actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy; or a widespread potential for more than minimal harm that is not immediate jeopardy, with no actual harm."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Serious Care Problems Found in Many Nursing Homes Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["The work of our expert nurses indicates that some of California\u2019s nursing home residents who died in 1993 received unacceptable care that, in certain cases, endangered their health and safety.

Their deaths were alleged to have been caused by unacceptable nursing home care. The 3,113 cases of alleged unacceptable care were distributed across nearly three-fourths of California\u2019s nursing homes in 1993. However, to avoid selecting isolated instances of such deaths, our cases were drawn from about 5 percent of California\u2019s homes that had at least five of the allegedly avoidable deaths.

The examples in figure 1 illustrate the nature of the care problems we identified.", "In other cases we reviewed from 1993, the care documented in the medical record was acceptable. For example, when nursing home staff recognized that a resident was having difficulty swallowing food, they changed her diet to pureed food and placed the resident in a restorative feeding program, where she received additional help in eating. Although the resident later refused all food and liquid and eventually died of dehydration, our expert reviewers concluded that the nursing home staff provided acceptable care during the resident\u2019s 4-month stay in the home.

Because many California homes were reviewed in the same month\u2014sometimes almost the same week\u2014year after year, homes could often predict the timing of their next survey and, if inclined, prepare to cover up problems that may normally exist at other times. For example, a home that may routinely operate with too few staff could temporarily augment its staff during the period of the survey in order to mask an otherwise serious deficiency in staffing levels.

When we discussed these observations with California DHS officials, they acknowledged that a review of survey scheduling showed that the timing of some homes\u2019 surveys had not varied by more than a week or so for several cycles. DHS officials have since instructed district office managers to schedule surveys in a way that reduces their predictability.", "The issue of the predictable timing of surveys is long-standing. In the mid-1980s, the Institute of Medicine recommended adjusting the timing of surveys to make them less predictable and maximize the element of surprise. It suggested that standard surveys be conducted between 9 and 15 months after the previous standard survey. In OBRA 87, the Congress established a civil monetary penalty to be levied against an individual who notifies a nursing home about the time or date of an impending survey. In 1995, HCFA issued guidance to states to keep the timing of the standard survey unpredictable by ensuring that all surveys are unannounced. However, the guidance is silent on varying the survey cycle as a way to reduce the predictability of these reviews.", "Since the guidance was issued, two studies have found that regular timing of surveys is still a problem. The National State Auditors Association found that in nine states it studied, the timing of inspections in some states was around the same date every year, which allowed nursing homes to predict when their survey would occur. Similarly, nursing home advocates in 41 states and the District of Columbia polled by HCFA noted that the predictability of surveys was a continuing problem.

In our visits to two facilities during their annual surveys, we arranged for our team of registered nurses to accompany the state surveyors and conduct concurrent surveys designed specifically to identify quality-of-care problems. Our survey methodology differed from the methodology specified by HCFA guidance and used by state surveyors in three major ways: (1) we selected a stratified, random sample of a much larger number of cases to review, including vulnerable populations such as new admissions and those at risk for pressure sores; (2) we collected uniform information on those cases using a structured protocol for observations, chart review, and staff interviews; and (3) we compared the results from those cases at each facility with data collected under the same sampling method at more than 60 other nursing homes nationwide, and then targeted our case review in areas where we identified a facilitywide pattern that could denote poor care.

Third, the information our surveyors collected from medical record reviews, staff interviews, and data analyses was entered into a structured format and compared with similar information from more than 60 other homes nationwide. This allowed our surveyors to pinpoint areas where care seemed problematic and review those cases thoroughly.", "HCFA policy establishes the procedures, or protocol, that state surveyors must follow in conducting a home\u2019s standard survey. Selecting cases for review is an activity that occurs early in the standard survey of a home to identify potential instances of poor care. At the beginning of a standard survey, the nursing home administrator must supply surveyors with documents that specify, among other things, a census of residents by medical condition, such as numbers of individuals with pressure sores, indwelling catheters, and physical restraints. The state surveyors use this information to select the majority of cases for particular scrutiny during the survey. They may add to the list of cases after observing residents and talking with nursing home staff.", "HCFA\u2019s protocol for selecting cases does not call for taking a random sample of sufficient size, however, and relies primarily on the use of professional expertise and judgment, based on numerous criteria that HCFA offers as guidance. While professional judgment is an essential component in identifying poor care, the nonrandom nature of the sample and its insufficient size precludes the state surveyor from easily determining the prevalence of the problems identified.", "The protocol our surveyors used for sampling allowed them to cast a wider net. Specifically, they took random samples of three groups of residents to target cases in which poor care would be most likely to surface. The three groups sampled were classified as \u201cnew admissions,\u201d \u201clong stays\u201d (residents more than 105 days into their stay), and \u201csentinel events\u201d (residents whose medical conditions put them at the greatest risk for poor outcomes). By stratifying the sample and taking a random selection of a sufficient number of each group, our surveyors could project the results of the samples to all residents in the home, thus assessing the potential prevalence of their initial review findings. For each resident in the sample, the survey team collected information from observations, chart reviews, and staff interviews assessing 75 elements reflecting quality-of-care outcomes. Our surveyors then profiled these findings\u2014that is, they compared the data from the sampled cases with data collected under the same sampling method at more than 60 nursing homes in other states.", "Analyzing data collected from the cases sampled, our survey team compared a home\u2019s rate of poor outcomes against the rates determined for the homes in other states. For example, they found that, at the two homes discussed, the rate of pressure sores was 27 percent and 21 percent of each home\u2019s total residents, whereas the comparison homes\u2019 average rate was roughly 8 percent. Being able to compare rates of medical conditions in a nursing home, such as the percentage of residents with pressure sores, allows the surveyor to determine whether the home is an outlier in comparison with other homes. Our surveyors then used this information to review residents\u2019 care regarding specific conditions to determine whether the poor outcome rates were due to unacceptable care or were justifiable because of other factors.", "HCFA has just begun to implement a requirement for all nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid to transmit electronically certain data they maintain on residents\u2019 health and functional status. Having this information in computerized form could provide surveyors better access to residents\u2019 outcome data, thus potentially enhancing surveyors\u2019 ability to select cases for review more systematically and quickly.

The immediate referral contrasts with the practice of first granting homes a grace period to correct cited deficiencies. To qualify for immediate referral, homes must be cited for violations in the immediate jeopardy category or be rated as a \u201cpoor performer.\u201d HCFA\u2019s definition of poor performer itself is circumscribed such that the definition applies to relatively few homes. A home must have been cited on its current standard survey for substandard quality of care and have been cited in one of its two previous standard surveys for substandard quality of care or immediate jeopardy violations. Homes cited for cases of actual harm to residents\u2014if assessed at the isolated level\u2014do not satisfy HCFA\u2019s criteria for the substandard quality-of-care classification. Since July 1995, when the federal enforcement scheme established in OBRA 87 took effect, about 25 California homes have been designated as poor performers and 59 homes have been cited for immediate jeopardy deficiencies. HCFA guidance permits the state to broaden the definition of poor performer, but California has chosen not to do so.", "Even homes immediately referred for sanctioning do not necessarily receive sanctions that take effect. Among California homes HCFA considers to have the most serious deficiencies that immediately jeopardize resident health and safety, only about half had any sanctions that actually took effect. If homes come into substantial compliance before sanctioning is scheduled to take effect, HCFA rescinds the sanction.", "In principle, sanctions imposed against a home remain in effect until the home corrects the deficiencies cited and until state surveyors find, after an on-site review (called a \u201crevisit\u201d) that the home has resumed substantial compliance status. HCFA\u2019s guidance on revisits allows states to forgo an on-site visit and accept a home\u2019s report of resumed compliance status if the home\u2019s deficiencies are not more serious than the \u201cpotential for harm\u201d range and do not constitute substandard care. HCFA officials told us this policy was put into place because of resource constraints. In California, however, this policy has been applied even to some of the immediate referral homes that continue to have deficiencies that put them out of substantial compliance upon revisit. Thus, our review of certain enforcement cases showed that HCFA failed to ensure that homes with a record of posing the greatest danger to residents had, in fact, resumed substantial compliance.", "For example, in the case of one home immediately referred for sanctioning, DHS surveyors made a few on-site reviews, but HCFA twice accepted the home\u2019s self-reported statement of compliance without requesting DHS to revisit and independently verify that the home had fully corrected its deficiencies. Specifically, in an October 1996 survey, DHS cited the home for immediate jeopardy and actual harm violations, including improper pressure sore treatment, medication errors, insufficient nursing staff, and an inadequate infection control program. By early November 1996, however, surveyors had found in an on-site review that the problems had abated but had not fully ceased. A week later, the home reported itself to HCFA as resuming substantial compliance. HCFA accepted this report without further on-site review.", "About 6 months later (May 1997), in the home\u2019s next standard survey, DHS found violations that warranted designating the home a poor performer. On a revisit to check compliance in July 1997, surveyors found new but less serious deficiencies. In August 1997, however, when the home reported itself in compliance, HCFA accepted the report without further verification. Between October 1996 and August 1997, HCFA imposed several sanctions but lifted them each time it accepted the home\u2019s unverified report of resumed compliance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Widely Granted Grace Periods Lead to Amnesty for Serious Violators", "paragraphs": ["According to HCFA guidance, noncompliant homes that are not classified in the immediate jeopardy or poor performer categories do not meet HCFA\u2019s criteria for immediate referral for sanctioning, even though residents may have suffered actual harm. Following this guidance, California\u2019s DHS first notifies these homes of the sanctions it will recommend imposing unless the home resumes compliance. DHS revisits the homes where residents have suffered actual harm or worse to ensure that compliance has been achieved. In practice, on the basis of HCFA\u2019s guidance, the state will forward notification of the recommended sanctions to HCFA only if the home fails to correct the deficiencies cited within a 30- to 45-day grace period allowed by HCFA. Although California\u2019s DHS regulators have the option of referring the home immediately for disciplinary action, the accepted practice under HCFA\u2019s guidance is to first allow the home to return to compliance status within the specified grace period.", "HCFA policy permits granting a grace period to this group of noncompliant homes, regardless of their past performance. Between July 1995 and May 1998, California\u2019s DHS gave about 98 percent of noncompliant homes a grace period to correct deficiencies. For nearly the same period (July 1995 to April 1998), the rate of noncompliant homes receiving a grace period nationwide was 99 percent, indicating that the practice of granting a grace period to nearly all noncompliant homes is common across all states.", "Moreover, data we analyzed on actions taken against California homes cited repeatedly for harming residents suggest that DHS does not take into account a home\u2019s compliance history when determining whether to impose intermediate sanctions. Of the 122 homes in our analysis cited repeatedly for harming residents, 73 percent were not federally sanctioned. In the case of such homes\u2014cited in consecutive surveys for actual harm or immediate jeopardy violations\u2014granting a grace period with no further disciplinary action appears to be a highly questionable practice. Table 2 illustrates a home with the same violations cited 4 years in a row\u2014thus not sustaining compliance from one standard survey to the next\u2014and still receiving a grace period to correct its deficiencies after each survey.", "Although HCFA has the authority to terminate homes from participation in Medicare and Medicaid if they fail to resume compliance, termination rarely occurs and is not as final as the term implies. In the recent past, California\u2019s terminated homes have rarely closed for good. Of the 16 homes terminated in the 1995 to 1998 time period, 14 have been reinstated. Eleven have been reinstated under the same ownership they had before termination. Of the 14 reinstated homes, at least six have been cited since their reinstatement with new deficiencies that harmed residents, such as failure to prevent avoidable accidents, failure to prevent avoidable weight loss, and improper treatment of pressure sores.", "A home that reapplies for participation is required to have two consecutive on-site reviews\u2014called reasonable assurance surveys\u2014within 6 months to determine whether it is in substantial compliance with federal regulations before its eligibility to bill federal programs can be reinstated. However, HCFA has not always ensured that homes are in substantial compliance before reinstatement. For example, one home terminated on April 15, 1997, had two reasonable assurance surveys on April 25 and May 28, 1997. Although the nursing home was not in substantial compliance at the time of the second survey, HCFA considered the deficiencies minor enough to reinstate the home on June 5, 1997. The consequence of termination\u2014stopping reimbursement for the home\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries\u2014was in effect for no longer than 3 weeks.", "About 3 months after reinstatement, however, the home was cited for harming residents. DHS surveyors investigating a complaint found immediate jeopardy violations as a result of a dangerously low number of nursing home staff. In addition, surveyors cited the facility for providing substandard care. Residents who could not move independently, some with pressure sores, were left sitting in urine and feces for long periods of time; some residents were not getting proper care for urinary tract infections; and surveyors cited the home\u2019s infection control program as inadequate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "California DHS Pilots Alternative Enforcement Procedures Targeting a Small Group of Most Seriously Deficient Homes", "paragraphs": ["By 1997, California DHS officials recognized that the state, in combination with HCFA\u2019s regional office, had not dealt effectively with persistently and seriously noncompliant nursing homes using the OBRA 87 enforcement process. The process discouraged immediate application of enforcement actions. It allowed nursing homes to come back into compliance for a short period of time, escaping enforcement action altogether. In many instances, though, homes did not sustain compliance for a significant period of time. Therefore, in July 1998 and with HCFA\u2019s agreement, DHS began a \u201cfocused enforcement\u201d process that combines state and federal authority and action, targeting providers with the worst compliance records for special attention.", "As a start, DHS has identified about 34 homes with the worst compliance histories\u2014generally two in each of its districts. Officials intend to conduct standard surveys of these homes about every 6 months rather than every 9 to 15 months. In addition, DHS intends to conduct more complete on-site reviews of facilities for all complaints received about these homes. DHS and HCFA told us that they do not intend to accept such homes\u2019 self-reports of compliance without a revisit. DHS officials told us that the agency is developing procedures\u2014consistent with HCFA regulations implementing OBRA 87 reforms\u2014to ensure that, where appropriate, the state will immediately recommend and HCFA will impose civil monetary penalties and other strong sanctions to bring such homes into compliance and keep them compliant. For focused enforcement homes unable to sustain compliance, state officials plan to revoke their state licenses and recommend termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, DHS plans to screen the compliance history of facilities by owner\u2014both in California and nationally\u2014before granting new licenses to operate nursing homes in the state.

In a number of cases, this responsibility has not been met in California. We and state surveyors found cases in which residents who needed help were not provided basic care\u2014not helped to eat or drink; not kept dry and clean; not repositioned to prevent pressure sores; not monitored for the development of urinary tract infections; and not given pain medication when needed. When such basic care is not provided, residents may suffer unnecessarily.", "As serious as the identified care problems are, weaknesses in federal and state oversight of nursing homes raise the possibility that many care problems escape the scrutiny of surveyors. Homes can prepare for surveyors\u2019 annual visits because of the visits\u2019 predictable timing. Homes can also adjust resident records to improve the overall impression of the home\u2019s care. In addition, DHS surveyors may overlook significant findings because the federal survey protocol they follow does not rely on an adequate sample for detecting potential problems and their prevalence. Together, these factors can mask significant care problems from the view of federal and state regulators.", "Furthermore, HCFA needs to reconsider its enforcement approach toward homes with serious, recurring violations. Federal policies allowing a grace period to correct deficiencies and to accept a home\u2019s report of compliance without an on-site review can be useful policies, given resource constraints, when applied to homes with less serious problems. However, even with resource constraints, HCFA and DHS need to ensure that their enforcement efforts are directed to homes with serious and recurring violations and that policies developed for homes with less serious problems are not applied to them.", "Under current policies and practices, noncompliant homes that DHS identifies as having harmed or put residents in immediate danger have little incentive to sustain compliance, once achieved, because they may face no consequences for their next episode of noncompliance. Our findings regarding homes that repeatedly harmed residents or were reinstated after termination suggest that the goal of sustained compliance has not been met.

HCFA concurred with the recommendation to eliminate the grace period for homes with repeated serious violations and agreed that having a more scientifically selected and larger case review sample would improve the ability of surveyors to detect poor care in nursing homes. HCFA also agreed to change its revisit policy for homes that are seriously noncompliant.", "HCFA agreed in principle that quality of care needs to be monitored outside the bounds of an annual, standard survey and acknowledged that certain factors can affect the predictability of surveys. These factors include the time of day and day of week the survey begins as well as the timing of surveys for homes in a given locale. Based on its analysis of certain OSCAR data, however, HCFA disagreed that states are not varying their survey schedules. We believe that basing a conclusion about the predictability of the annual survey primarily on analysis of OSCAR data is problematic, given weaknesses we identified in the classification of surveys entered into the database. Given these questions we raised, HCFA agreed to review the validity of the OSCAR data. HCFA also raised concerns\u2014as did DHS\u2014that segmenting the survey into two or more reviews would make it less effective and more expensive. We believe that segmenting the survey could largely eliminate concern about predictability and, by increasing the frequency of surveyors\u2019 visits to homes, could provide more opportunity to observe problematic homes and initiate broader reviews when warranted. These advantages should be evaluated relative to the potential disadvantages that concern HCFA.", "DHS officials generally agreed with our findings and recommendations. They attributed many of the problems in the current survey and enforcement process to federal policy directives that, they maintain, have weakened states\u2019 ability to oversee quality of care and quality of life in nursing homes. In its comments, DHS has also suggested a number of additional changes it believes would improve the federal survey and enforcement process. These include adding a waiting period before homes terminated from Medicare and Medicaid could be reinstated in the programs, changing HCFA\u2019s definitions of scope of violations and of substandard care to more realistically reflect the seriousness of poor care, changing HCFA\u2019s revisit policy for homes that are not in substantial compliance, developing a peer review of survey and enforcement practices in different regions, improving the database used for enforcement tracking, and more fully funding survey and enforcement activities for the state.", "Some reviewers questioned whether the scope of our clinical review of 1993 records and concurrent review of nursing homes was sufficient to permit drawing conclusions about the current condition of all California nursing homes.

More specifically, we assessed (1) whether, as alleged, residents who died in 1993 from certain causes had received unacceptable care that could have endangered their health and safety, and whether serious care problems currently exist; (2) the adequacy of federal and state efforts in monitoring nursing home care through annual surveys; and (3) the effectiveness of federal and state efforts to enforce sustained compliance with federal nursing home requirements.", "We reviewed the medical records of a sample of the 3,113 residents alleged to have died avoidable deaths in 1993 in 971 California nursing homes from malnutrition, dehydration, urinary tract infection (UTI), bowel obstruction, or bedsores (pressure sores). We met with those making the allegations, and from them we obtained copies of the death certificates of the 3,113 residents. To select our sample, we eliminated residents with UTI who did not also suffer from septicemia (the presence of bacteria and toxins in the blood), because if these conditions are not present, UTI is generally not lethal. We assumed that if care was a problem in a home, more than one resident would have been affected. We therefore excluded death certificates for residents of homes with (1) fewer than five such deaths and (2) for such deaths, a deaths-to-total-beds ratio of less than 5 percent. That left a universe of 546 residents at 72 homes. In addition, we eliminated residents who died in counties having few nursing homes. After these exclusions, our universe became 446 residents at 59 homes, from which we selected a preliminary sample of 75 residents from 15 homes. Fourteen of these homes were freestanding and one was a hospital-based nursing home. Because we selected from residents of homes with five or more such deaths in certain counties, our results cannot be generalized to the universe of all residents in California nursing homes who died of the same causes in 1993.", "To review the medical records, we used two registered nurses with advanced degrees in gerontological nursing and with expertise in clinical nursing home care and data abstraction. To guide them, another registered nurse on our staff developed a detailed structured data collection instrument. The nurses\u2019 work was reviewed by the registered nurse on our staff, who has experience working in nursing homes and judging whether care met acceptable clinical standards. This second review focused on a critical examination of all cases where the first team of registered nurses identified residents as having unacceptable care, in order to exclude any cases that might be questionable rather than unacceptable. The registered nurse on our staff also discussed some of the cases with physicians and additional registered nurses specializing in geriatric care to further clarify whether care was acceptable. We excluded all questionable cases from the unacceptable care group. Because of the time needed to thoroughly review each resident\u2019s complete clinical history (some were more than 600 pages), the nurses reviewed 62 of the 75 records initially selected from 1993.", "To determine the extent of deficiencies identified by state surveyors in California nursing homes since July 1995, and to identify enforcement actions taken in response to the deficiencies, we used two databases. The first, HCFA\u2019s On-Line Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) System, contains information about violations of federal requirements that a home has received in its last four surveys. The second, the Automated Certification and Licensing Administrative Information Management System (ACLAIMS) database, is maintained by California\u2019s DHS and contains information on each home\u2019s violations of state requirements. In addition, we used data that HCFA\u2019s San Francisco regional office maintains separately from OSCAR on federal sanctions imposed.", "In OSCAR, we identified 1,445 California homes that had survey data after July 1, 1995\u2014the date the new OBRA 87 scope and severity system went into effect. If a nursing home at a particular address had more than one provider number, we included in our analysis only one of the provider numbers to represent that home. Of the 1,445 California homes, 1,370 of those homes (95 percent) had at least two surveys entered into the OSCAR database since July 1995. Information in the OSCAR database is constantly being updated. We downloaded OSCAR data on February 26, 1998, to get a fixed database for our analysis of 1,370 homes. We also continued to work with OSCAR on-line as necessary, for example, to download survey reports on particular homes. The nursing homes we analyzed included Medicare and Medicaid dually certified facilities, Medicare-only facilities, Medicaid-only facilities, and both freestanding and hospital-based facilities. To develop information shown in figures 2 and 3, we combined information from both the OSCAR and ACLAIMS databases.", "We did not conduct a thorough assessment of the validity or reliability of either OSCAR or ACLAIMS. We did determine, however, that OSCAR excludes data that could be useful in obtaining a complete picture of a nursing home\u2019s history of deficiencies. For example, serious violations of state requirements discovered during complaint investigations are not routinely shown as federal deficiencies in OSCAR. Other information, such as the seriousness and extent of identified deficiencies, were missing from OSCAR in some cases. We found instances of missing information in 282 of the 1,370 homes in our analysis. The effect of these omissions from the database, we believe, is an understatement of documented deficiencies in OSCAR.", "To assess the effectiveness of the survey process, we accompanied California state surveyors on annual standard surveys conducted at two homes.
