As a practical matter, there  may not be openings at particular hard-language posts at the same time  junior officers are being assigned to their first and second tours. The  requirements for tenure, which include a variety of regions and jobs for  junior officers to prepare them for careers as Foreign Service generalists,  are also a major consideration. The emphasis on career development and  achieving tenure sometimes limits the department\u2019s ability to train and  deploy a sufficient number of officers with the needed training in hard  languages to do their jobs, according to several headquarters officials. For  example, officials in one of State\u2019s geographic bureaus stated that some  hard languages require a level-2 speaking proficiency, for which officers  may get from 24 to 26 weeks of language training. However, if junior  officers spend a longer period of time in training, they could be at a  disadvantage for tenure at the first year of eligibility because they would  have a narrower range of on-the-job experiences on which tenure decisions  are based. Security requirements are also a consideration when assigning  junior officers overseas. According to State officials, junior officers with  hard language skills are sometimes precluded from serving at a post where  they can use their hard language skills for diplomatic security reasons,  such as having an immediate family member or close ties with individuals  in a country. In fiscal year 2003, 8 percent, or 38 of the 468 new Foreign  Service generalists State hired, were precluded from serving at hard  language posts for security reasons. However, because of Privacy Act  restrictions and some unavailable data, State could only provide partial  information about the foreign language skills of these new hires. As a  result, we are unable to determine how many of these preclusions were  also hard-language speakers.", "Our analysis was limited to an officer\u2019s first two tours. State officials noted  that when a new hire possesses strong language skills already, the  employee and department may consciously use the first two tours to  develop additional skills rather than existing ones.

To alleviate this situation, State is developing pilot programs to provide  some officers with additional training in hard languages by sending them to  training overseas. In one such pilot, an officer would spend a year studying  Arabic at the FSI field school in Tunis prior to being sent to an Arabic- speaking post, according to an official of the Bureau of Near Eastern  Affairs.

The FSI\u2019s training did not include grant writing, program  management, and basic supervisory skills, they said, and was not a viable  substitute for overseas training. Moreover, about 58 percent of the officers  responding to a GAO survey reported that the amount of time available for  public diplomacy training was inadequate. Furthermore, State\u2019s Inspector  General reported that public affairs officers in Africa were often first-tour  or entry-level officers with no prior public diplomacy experience and as  such, their mistakes in dealing with the media have embarrassed the post.  First-tour officers have also displayed poor judgment by not seeking advice  from experienced local staff, the IG said. FSI has revised its public  diplomacy training to address some of these issues. As of September 2003,  public diplomacy officers are receiving from 9 to 19 weeks of training  (depending upon the duties of their assignment) before they are sent to a  post.

Officials explained that while the  position had been designated as a junior officer position, it still required an  individual with significant related experience. Unfortunately, the junior  officer assigned to this position did not have the requisite work experience  or knowledge. Another official said that placing junior officers in positions  formerly held by mid-level officers was not achieving the same results as  hiring people with directly related management experience.

To calculate the percentage of junior  officers in each of the three categories, we divided the category total by the  number of new hires with hard language ability for whom information was  available about two tours.

State overstated our conclusions.

Furthermore, we did not describe the workforce planning  process as \u201crobust\u201d and the recruiting program as \u201cdynamic.\u201d We  reported that State used elements of workforce planning to determine  its Foreign Service staffing needs, junior officers stated that the exam  tested for the skills they used on the job, and State officials believed the  department was hiring and assigning junior officers overseas with the  skills they needed to do the job.  2. While we reported on State\u2019s processes for recruiting, hiring, and  assigning new staff, we did not conclude that these processes are the  best way to meet mission requirements. There may be other ways to  accomplish State\u2019s mission, but an evaluation of alternatives was  beyond the scope of this report. 3. We did not conclude that the department is successfully meeting its  staffing needs through the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative. We  concluded that State had met its hiring targets for Foreign Service  generalists in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Also, State officials told us  that it would take 9 to 10 years to eliminate its mid-level staffing gap.  We did not assess whether this gap could be closed more quickly. 4. State mischaracterized what we wrote and thus did not address the  second part of our recommendation. State further commented that our  approach, which focused on six specific languages, was too narrow and  implied that we believe increasing the number of speakers of selected  languages will address diplomatic readiness needs. We focused on the  six languages because of their strategic importance and findings from  previous GAO reports that lack of staff proficient in these languages  hinders diplomatic readiness. Moreover, senior officials at the U.S.  embassy in Russia told us that some junior officers lacked sufficient  Russian skills to effectively do their jobs. 5. We are not suggesting that State supplant training as its main avenue  for achieving its language goals as State\u2019s comments infer. However, we  believe that State should explore as many avenues as possible to  eliminate its gaps in officers with proficiency in hard-to-learn  languages.  6. The intent of our analysis of the assignment of junior officers with  preexisting hard language skills was to show the extent to which those  officers were assigned to posts where they could use those skills. We  had no basis to conclude that the results were positive as State  commented. State also commented that we did not review officers\u2019  assignments beyond their first two tours. We did not go beyond the first  two tours because the scope of our review was the recruitment and  assignment of junior officers. However, we have incorporated the  department\u2019s statements that many skills officers bring to the Foreign  Service will be used throughout their careers, not just in the first two  tours.  7. State wrote that the department is making considerable progress in  recruiting for language skills, along with all required skills. However, as  we have previously noted, State has not set numerical targets for the  number of individuals with hard language ability it aims to hire.  Moreover, the department does not maintain data to demonstrate how  many junior officers with hard language skills were hired as a direct  result of its outreach efforts. 8. State commented that we understated the contribution that rotational  assignments make toward accomplishing mission goals. We disagree.  The report provides several examples of the benefits of the rotations.  However, a number of officials raised the issue of increased  supervisory requirements as a concern. 9. State commented that it is already addressing the first part of our  recommendation that it maintain data on its efforts to recruit speakers  of hard-to-learn languages.
