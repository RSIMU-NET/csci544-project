GAO's work on cost estimating has found that a reliable cost estimate is critical to any program by providing the basis for informed decision making. The Nuclear Weapons Council--the joint activity of DOD and DOE for nuclear weapons programs--is responsible for coordinating budget matters related to nuclear weapons programs between the departments, and is engaging in an effort to broadly synchronize nuclear weapons life-extension programs with delivery-system modernization efforts, but has not asked either department to provide estimates of the total system cost. In the absence of such a request, neither department is developing total cost estimates. Further, DOD's plan to study ICBM follow-on options does not include the council as a stakeholder to synchronize the missile and warhead efforts to help ensure that the study considers an enterprise-wide perspective. Without timely cost estimates and updates on the status of the ICBM follow-on study, the council may be unable to provide guidance and direction on the study, or consider its implications and potential effects on other nuclear weapons modernization efforts.", "DOD and DOE have prepared a long-term plan that incorporates interoperable warheads into the stockpile, and although they have begun studying the feasibility of designing such a warhead, the Navy has had limited participation thus far. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review recommended the Nuclear Weapons Council study the development of an interoperable warhead that could be deployed on both Air Force and Navy ballistic missiles, and the council has requested the Air Force, Navy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to commit resources to the study. Although the Air Force and NNSA have been examining warhead concepts, the Navy has not fully engaged in the effort because (1) other, ongoing modernization programs are higher Navy priorities, and (2) it has concerns about changing the design of the warhead. The Navy's further participation is uncertain because it has not identified the resources needed to continue with the program once the study is completed, if the interoperable warhead is adopted. Consequently, the Navy will be poorly positioned to perform the more-detailed analyses needed to validate the approved design, potentially resulting in program delays. The Nuclear Weapons Council guidelines governing nuclear weapons refurbishments, and the corresponding DOD instruction, do not require the Air Force and Navy to align their programs and resources before beginning joint-service warhead studies. For example, DOD's instruction states that the military departments are to develop procedures for certain joint DOD-DOE activities, but it is unclear about aligning their programs and resources with each other. If the guidance and DOD instruction are not updated, the services may not be prepared to participate in future joint-service studies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations to provide complete cost estimates to the Nuclear Weapons Council and improve synchronization between DOD and DOE; to identify long-term Navy funding to support the interoperable warhead life-extension program; and to issue or revise existing DOD and Nuclear Weapons Council guidance.

We  discussed and confirmed our approach with officials from the Office of the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office,  Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters,  Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategic and  Tactical Systems, Air Force Global Strike Command, Air Force Nuclear  Weapons Center, and Air Force A10.", "To determine the extent to which DOD and NNSA have explored the  feasibility of incorporating an interoperable warhead concept into the  long-term nuclear weapons stockpile plan, we examined both the long- term plan and effort to date to implement the W78/88-1 life-extension  program. We analyzed the Nuclear Weapons Council\u2019s preliminary  baseline plan for the nuclear weapons stockpile for the next 25 years,  including options that the council considered in adopting the baseline  plan. We obtained and reviewed key briefings from U.S. Strategic  Command, and interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, U.S. Strategic Command, NNSA, Air Force Nuclear Weapons  Center, and Navy Strategic Systems Programs. We discussed possible  uncertainties and risks about the baseline plan with officials from the  Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters;  U.S. Strategic Command; Air Force; and Navy. Turning to our analysis of  the W78/88-1 life-extension program, we used criteria drawn from the  2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report and from the U.S. Strategic  Command\u2019s 2010 Joint Requirements Study for a Common Life  Extension Program for the Mk12A/W78-1 and Mk5/W88-1, and the  Procedural Guideline for the Phase 6.X Process, to evaluate the extent to  which the Air Force and Navy have aligned their programs and resources  to support this effort. To perform this analysis, we  reviewed documentation for the W78/88-1 life-extension program,  including memorandums from the Air Force, Navy, NNSA, and  Nuclear Weapons Council; identified and reviewed key Air Force and NNSA briefings that  identified potential design options for the W78/88-1 life-extension  program; reviewed DOD, NNSA, and W78/88-1 Project Officer Group and  subgroup charters, as well as Air Force, Navy, and NNSA budget  documents; reviewed the Navy\u2019s perspective on stockpile modernization by  interviewing senior officials from Navy Strategic Systems Programs,  Navy N514, and NNSA\u2019s federal program manager for Navy  warheads; interviewed the Air Force lead project officer and NNSA federal  program manager for the W78/88-1 life-extension program, at Kirtland  Air Force Base, New Mexico; interviewed NNSA officials involved in the management of the W78  and W88 warheads; and met with DOD officials, including officials from the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters; Joint Staff J8; and  U.S. Strategic Command.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2012 to June 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, key contributors to this report  included Penney Harwell Caramia, Assistant Director; David M.
