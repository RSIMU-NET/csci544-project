As you know, the Results Act was one of the major steps the Congress has taken in recent years to fundamentally change the way federal agencies go about their work. The Results Act requires agencies to clearly define their missions, set goals, measure performance, and report on their accomplishments. One of the act\u2019s major milestones\u2014submission to the Congress by federal agencies of strategic plans that define their missions and set goals\u2014is less than 2 weeks away.", "With fiscal year 1996 spending of over $38 billion, VA is responsible for administering laws that provide numerous types of benefits to many of the nation\u2019s 26 million veterans and their dependents and survivors. These benefits include medical care, disability compensation, pensions, rehabilitation assistance, education benefits, home loan benefits, insurance coverage, and burial benefits. My statement today will address the progress VA has made in developing its strategic plan and the challenges VA continues to face in implementing the Results Act. My observations are based on our review of VA\u2019s June 1997 draft strategic plan and have been updated to reflect revisions VA made between June 1997 and its latest version, dated August 15, 1997. evaluation schedule; and contains inadequately developed discussions of external factors and the need to coordinate with other federal agencies.", "VA is aware that it has much work to do to fully implement the Results Act and considers its strategic planning\u2014including conducting program evaluations and developing results-oriented goals\u2014to be a long-term effort. Some of this work is identified in the current draft strategic plan. VA\u2019s success in implementing the Results Act will depend on how successful it is in ensuring that its strategic plan focuses on results and how well it integrates its plan with the plans of other federal agencies. The Congress will continue to play an important role in consulting with VA in developing results-oriented goals and overseeing VA\u2019s efforts to successfully implement the Results Act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Purpose and Requirements of the Results Act", "paragraphs": ["The Results Act is the centerpiece of a statutory framework to improve federal agencies\u2019 management activities. The Results Act was designed to focus federal agencies\u2019 attention from the amounts of money they spend or the size of their workloads to the results of their programs. Agencies are expected to base goals on their results-oriented missions, develop strategies for achieving their goals, and measure actual performance against the goals.", "The Results Act requires agencies to consult with the Congress in developing their strategic plans. This gives the Congress the opportunity to help ensure that their missions and goals are focused on results, are consistent with programs\u2019 authorizing laws, and are reasonable in light of fiscal constraints. The products of this consultation should be clearer guidance to agencies on their missions and goals and better information to help the Congress choose among programs, consider alternative ways to achieve results, and assess how well agencies are achieving them. fiscal year 1999 budget submissions, which were due to OMB by September 8, 1997. OMB, in turn, is required to include a governmentwide performance plan in the President\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget submission to the Congress.

The latest version is clearer and easier to follow, more complete, and better organized to focus more on results and less on process. At the same time, VA has still not fully addressed some of the key elements required by the Results Act; the draft plan has a lack of goals focused on the results of VA programs for veterans and their families, such as assisting veterans in readjusting to civilian life; limited discussions of external factors beyond VA\u2019s control that could affect its achievement of goals; a lack of program evaluations to support the development of results-oriented goals; and insufficient plans to identify and meet needs to coordinate VA programs with those of other federal agencies.", "The draft strategic plan, acknowledging that three of these four elements (results-oriented goals, program evaluations, and agency coordination) have not been fully addressed, does plan to address them. VA has indicated that it views strategic planning as a long-term process and intends to continue refining its strategic plan in consultation with the Congress, veterans service organizations, and other stakeholders.", "Another challenge for VA is to improve its financial and information technology management, so that the agency\u2019s ongoing planning efforts under the Results Act will be based on the best possible information. VA\u2019s draft strategic plan addresses several financial and information technology issues, such as the need for cost accounting systems for VA programs and the need to improve VA\u2019s capital asset planning."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improvements From the June 1997 Draft Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["results. VA officials indicated that, based on consultations with staff from the House and Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs committees, which included input from GAO, the draft strategic plan would be revised to make it clearer, more complete, and more results-oriented. The August 15, 1997, version reflects significant progress in these areas.", "Instead of presenting four overall goals, three of which were process-oriented, VA has reorganized its draft strategic plan into two sections. The first section, entitled \u201cHonor, Care, and Compensate Veterans in Recognition of Their Sacrifices for America,\u201d is intended to incorporate VA\u2019s results-oriented strategic goals. The second section, entitled \u201cManagement Strategies,\u201d incorporates the three other general goals, related to customer service, workforce development, and taxpayer return on investment. In addition, VA has filled significant gaps in the discussions of program goals. The largest gap in the June 1997 draft was the lack of goals for four of the five major veterans benefit programs. The current plan includes goals for each of these programs, stating them in terms of ensuring that VA benefit programs meet veterans\u2019 needs. Finally, the reorganized draft plan increases the emphasis on results. The June 1997 draft appeared to make such process-oriented goals as improving customer service and speeding claims processing equivalent to more results-oriented goals such as improving veterans\u2019 health care. In the August 1997 version, the process-oriented goals remain but have been placed in their own process-oriented section supplementing the plan\u2019s results orientation.", "At the same time, VA believes that the process-oriented portions of the plan are important as a guide to VA\u2019s management. It considers customer service very important because VA\u2019s focus is on providing services to veterans and their families. The Assistant Secretary for Policy and Planning, in written comments on a draft of our July 1997 letter, stated that VA continues to believe \u201cthat processes and operations are important to serving veterans and [VA] will continue to place appropriate emphasis on the areas of customer service, workforce development, and management issues.\u201d VA also contends that the Results Act does not preclude process-oriented goals from its strategic plan. We agree that many of the process issues VA raises are important to its efficient and effective operation and can be included in VA\u2019s strategic plan as long as they are integrated with the plan\u2019s primary focus on results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Results-Oriented Goals for Major VA Programs", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps the most significant deficiency in VA\u2019s draft strategic plan, in both the June 1997 and current versions, is the lack of results-oriented goals for major VA programs, particularly for benefit programs. While discussions of goals for benefit programs have been added to the current version, they are placeholders for results-oriented goals that have not yet been developed. The general goals for 4 of the 5 the major benefit program areas\u2014compensation and pensions, education, vocational rehabilitation, and housing credit assistance\u2014are stated in terms of ensuring that VA is meeting the needs of veterans and their families. The objectives supporting VA\u2019s general goal for its compensation and pension area are to (1) evaluate compensation and pension programs to determine their effectiveness in meeting the needs of veterans and their beneficiaries; and (2) modify these programs, as appropriate. For the three other major benefit program areas, the objectives suggest possible results-oriented goals and are supported by strategies aimed at evaluating and improving programs. For example, the objectives under vocational rehabilitation include increasing the number of disabled veterans who acquire and maintain suitable employment and are considered to be rehabilitated. The strategies under this objective include evaluating the vocational rehabilitation needs of eligible veterans and evaluating the effect of VA\u2019s vocational rehabilitation program on the quality of participants\u2019 lives.", "VA has noted that developing results-oriented goals will be difficult until program evaluations have been completed. Given the program evaluation time periods stated in the draft strategic plan, which calls for evaluations to continue through fiscal year 2002, results-oriented goals may not be developed for some programs for several years. Another difficulty VA has cited is that, for many VA programs, congressional statements of the program purposes and expected results are vague or nonexistent. VA officials cited VA\u2019s medical research and insurance programs as examples of programs with unclear purposes. This is an area where VA and the Congress can make progress in further consultations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Discussion of External Factors", "paragraphs": ["individual goals generally did not link demographic changes in the veteran population to VA\u2019s goals.", "VA\u2019s current draft has added discussions of the implications of demographic changes on VA programs. For example, VA notes that the death rate for veterans is increasing, which will lead VA to explore various options for meeting increased demands for burials in VA and state veterans\u2019 cemeteries. Meanwhile, the goal to ensure that VA\u2019s burial programs meet the needs of veterans and their families is accompanied by a detailed list of specific cemetery construction and land acquisition projects and by a specific target for expanding burials in state veterans\u2019 cemeteries. The discussion of external factors related to this goal focuses on the Congress\u2019 willingness to fund VA\u2019s proposed projects and the cooperation of the states in participating in the State Cemetery Grants Program. What is missing in the draft is a link between the projected increase in veteran deaths and the proposed schedule of specific cemetery projects. Similarly, we recently reported that National Cemetery System strategic planning does not tie goals for expanding cemetery capacity to veterans\u2019 mortality rates and their preferences for specific burial options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Program Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["We noted that the goals in VA\u2019s June 1997 draft strategic plan were not supported by formal program evaluations. Evaluations can be an important source of information for helping the Congress and others ensure that agency goals are valid and reasonable, providing baselines for agencies to use in developing performance measures and performance goals, and identifying factors likely to affect agency performance. As noted above, VA cites the lack of completed evaluations as a reason for not providing results-oriented goals for many of its programs.", "The first general goal of VA\u2019s plan is to conduct program evaluations over a period of several years. VA plans to identify distinct programs in each of its 10 major program areas and then prioritize evaluations of these programs in consultation with the Congress, veterans\u2019 service organizations, and other stakeholders. VA expects to complete this prioritization sometime in fiscal year 1998, complete the highest-priority evaluations by the end of fiscal year 2000, and complete at least one evaluation in each of the 10 major program areas by fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Coordination With Other Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["In our comments on the June 1997 draft strategic plan, we noted that VA has not clearly identified the areas where its programs overlap with those of other federal agencies, nor has it coordinated its strategic planning efforts with those of other agencies. Three areas where such coordination is needed (and the relevant key federal agencies) are employment training (Department of Labor), substance abuse (departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development), and telemedicine (Department of Defense).", "In addition, we noted that VA relies on other federal agencies for information; for example, VA needs service records from the Department of Defense to help determine whether veterans have service-connected disabilities and to help establish their eligibility for Montgomery G.I. Bill benefits.", "VA\u2019s current draft strategic plan addresses the need to improve coordination with other federal agencies and state governments. This will involve (1) identifying overlaps and links with other federal agencies, (2) enhancing and improving communications links with other agencies, and (3) keeping state directors of veterans\u2019 affairs and other state officials apprised of VA benefits and programs and of opportunities for collaboration and coordination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial and Information Technology Improvement Goals in VA\u2019s Draft Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["As we noted in our comments on VA\u2019s June 1997 draft strategic plan, VA has made progress in financial management and information technology. Like other federal agencies, VA needs accurate and reliable information to support executive branch and congressional decision-making. The \u201cManagement Strategies\u201d section of VA\u2019s current draft strategic plan addresses some financial management and information technology issues. Since VA has identified the need to devote a portion of its strategic plan to process-oriented goals, it is appropriate that some of these goals should focus on improving its management in these areas. much of its costs were attributable to each of the benefit programs it administers. According to the plan, this system would include two cost accounting systems already in development: VHA\u2019s Decision Support System (DSS) and VBA\u2019s Activity Based Costing (ABC) system.", "Another goal in the current draft plan is to establish a VA capital policy that ensures that capital investments, including capital information technology investments, reflect the most efficient and effective use of VA\u2019s resources. Achieving this goal involves developing a VA-wide Agency Capital Plan and establishing a VA Capital Investment Board to generate policies for capital investments and to review proposed capital investments based on VA\u2019s mission and priorities.", "Still another goal is designed to address the need for VA-wide information technology management to facilitate VA\u2019s ability to function as a unified department. Achieving of this goal involves developing a VA-wide information technology strategic plan and a portfolio of prioritized information technology capital investments. In addition, the plan calls for the promotion of crosscutting VA information technology initiatives in order to improve services to veterans.", "The draft plan\u2019s discussion of information technology addresses one of the information technology issues we have identified as high-risk throughout the federal government\u2014the year-2000 computer problem. Unless corrections are made by January 1, 2000, VA\u2019s computers may be unable to cope with dates in 2000, which could prevent VA from making accurate and timely benefit payments to veterans.
