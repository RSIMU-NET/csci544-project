Taxpayers reported on whether they had health care coverage, had an exemption from the coverage requirement, or owed a tax penalty (the SRP). Most taxpayers who received coverage through a health insurance marketplace were also eligible for an advance PTC to make their coverage more affordable. Marketplace customers can choose to have the PTC paid in advance to their insurance company or may claim all of the credit when they file their tax returns. GAO was asked to review IRS implementation of the individual shared responsibility and PTC tax provisions.", "Among other objectives, this report examines (1) IRS's implementation of these PPACA requirements; and (2) IRS efforts to collaborate with key external stakeholders.

Complete marketplace data for the 2014 coverage year were due to IRS in January, but due to marketplace delays in transmitting the data and IRS technical difficulties with processing the data for matching, as of March 21, 2015, IRS had complete data available for verification of taxpayer PTC claims for 4 of the 51 marketplace states (i.e., the 50 states and the District of Columbia). IRS does not know whether these challenges are a single year or an ongoing problem. According to IRS officials, IRS checks the formatting, but not the accuracy of the data. Although IRS implemented contingency plans to compensate for missing and inaccurate data, those processes were more burdensome for taxpayers. Assessing whether the problems with the timeliness and reliability of the marketplace data are expected to be an ongoing challenge, rather than just a first-year problem, would help IRS understand how it can use the data effectively and better target contingency plans.", "IRS does not know the total amount of advance PTC payments made to insurers for 2014 marketplace policies because marketplace data are incomplete. Without this information, IRS does not know the aggregate amount of advance PTC that taxpayers should have reported on 2014 tax returns.

IRS worked to collaborate and communicate with external stakeholders to implement PPACA requirements for tax year 2014. However, several external stakeholders GAO spoke with reported challenges with IRS collaboration efforts, such as not receiving certain IRS guidance in time for stakeholders to have complete information at the beginning of the filing season. IRS is evaluating opportunities for improving return processing and the taxpayer experience, but is not evaluating its collaboration efforts. Without an assessment of its efforts to collaborate and communicate with key external stakeholders, challenges in implementing the 2014 PPACA requirements that relied on these groups could also affect new requirements taking effect in 2015, including new information reporting requirements for the State-based Marketplaces, issuers of coverage, and applicable large employers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommendations include that IRS (1) assess whether marketplace data delays are an ongoing problem, (2) assess the reliability of the data for IRS matching, (3) work with CMS to get complete data and track the aggregate gap between advance PTC paid and reported, and (4) evaluate its collaboration efforts.

For tax year 2015 tax returns, IRS plans to begin  implementing additional PPACA provisions that will expand its capability  to verify compliance with the health care coverage requirements by using  information reported by health issuers and employers.

Verification of whether a  taxpayer received approval for a marketplace-granted exemption is  dependent on the marketplaces reporting this information to IRS.

However, according to IRS  officials, as of May 31, 2015, IRS had exemption data available for return  processing for 13 of the 51 marketplace states and did not have  exemption data for the remaining 38 states. Some marketplaces  experienced delays in completing the review and approval process for  applicants who applied for an exemption. The delay in marketplace  approval process for exemption applications left affected taxpayers  without the information they needed to complete Form 8965, Health  Coverage Exemptions, which taxpayers claiming a marketplace-granted  exemption must attach to their tax return. In light of the potential for  pending marketplace exemption applications, in the instructions to Form  8965, IRS instructed affected taxpayers to write \u201cpending\u201d on the Form  8965; the instructions did not direct taxpayers to file amended tax returns  once the marketplaces processed their exemption applications. In  addition to delays in marketplace processing of exemption applications,  there were delays in IRS receiving exemption data from the  marketplaces. IRS experienced technical problems processing exemption  data from the marketplaces. According to IRS officials, IRS systems  wrongly returned an error code when the marketplaces transmitted  exemption data to IRS. Initially, IRS advised the marketplaces that they  could wait to submit the exemption data until IRS addressed this technical  problem. In mid-March 2015 IRS advised the marketplaces to submit the  data despite the problem.", "Verification of the shared responsibility payment. Verification of  whether taxpayers owe an SRP, as well as how much they owe, is  dependent on IRS having complete data on whether taxpayers had  qualifying health care coverage for the full year, and whether they had an  exemption for part or all of the year. Without information on health care  coverage from issuers and large employers\u2014on Forms 1095-B and 1095- C, respectively\u2014and without information on exemptions granted by the  marketplaces, IRS is unable to perform automated post-filing compliance  procedures through comparing this third-party information to individual  income tax return reporting. For tax year 2014 returns, IRS plans to  perform limited post-filing compliance procedures for SRP in specific  circumstances. For example, IRS may pursue collection procedures for  taxpayers who do not pay the SRP amounts they report on their tax  returns. In addition, IRS may review and recalculate self-reported SRP  amounts for tax returns selected for examination for reasons other than  the SRP.", "Silent returns. Some taxpayers filed 2014 tax returns that did not report  health coverage information, claim an exemption, or report an SRP. IRS  refers to these cases as silent returns. According to IRS officials, one  reason for silent returns is that some taxpayers could be claimed as a  dependent on another return. According to preliminary filing season  data, as of May 28, 2015, more than 11 million taxpayers filed silent  returns (see table 2).", "IRS officials estimated that about 58 percent of the silent returns posted  as of the end of May 2015 were from filers who reported that they could  be claimed as dependents on another return. One reason a taxpayer  might file a silent return could be the first-year challenge of understanding  the complex new shared responsibility reporting requirement. IRS goals  include encouraging voluntary compliance with tax responsibilities and its  mission includes enforcing the law with integrity and fairness to all. IRS  has various tools that it can use to enhance taxpayer understanding and  encourage compliance with new reporting requirements. According to IRS  officials, IRS has solicited feedback from paid preparers and tax software  companies and will consider their input to help determine changes to the  Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions instructions that could facilitate  more accurate reporting. Additional tools are also available. Most tax  returns are filed using tax software and IRS provides guidance to tax  software companies regarding changes to filing requirements. Officials  from a tax software company told us that with clear policy instruction from  IRS and sufficient time, they could design their tax software to prevent  taxpayers from omitting required health coverage information on their  returns. For tax year 2014 the company\u2019s tax software guided, but did not  require, taxpayers to report health coverage information. IRS can also  issue soft notices\u2014IRS letters to taxpayers that are designed to serve as  an educational tool and improve voluntary compliance, and generally do  not require taxpayers to respond to IRS. In the past, IRS has used soft  notices to correct errors and collect funds without initiating an  examination.", "According to IRS officials, certain tools used to encourage compliance  with other requirements are not available to address silent returns.

As illustrated in figure 3, at the time of  filing (i.e., before any refund is issued), IRS\u2019s new Affordable Care Act  Verification Service (AVS) system compares the information taxpayers  reported on their tax return to information the marketplaces provided,  potentially identifying math errors or discrepancies with the marketplace  data. For example, AVS may identify cases where a marketplace  reported that a taxpayer received the advanced PTC, but the taxpayer did  not report it on his or her tax return. In another example, AVS may detect  cases where taxpayers claim the PTC on their tax returns, but are  ineligible because they were not enrolled in a marketplace plan.

While IRS uses  the more comprehensive EPD data transmission as the primary  source of marketplace data for pre-refund compliance checks on PTC  claims, in the absence of EPD information, according to IRS  procedures, IRS may use the 1095-A data transmitted by the  marketplaces to verify taxpayer PTC claims.

Some state officials acknowledged that as they approached the end of  December 2014, they placed a higher priority on processing consumer  applications for marketplace coverage for 2015, as opposed to ensuring  they were ready to transmit the January EPD or 1095-A files to IRS. State  and CMS officials also noted that issuing paper Forms 1095-A to  taxpayers by the February 2, 2015, deadline was also a higher priority  than the January data transmissions to IRS. In addition to these issues,  some state marketplace officials noted that they were impacted by what  they described as IRS\u2019s limited windows of availability for testing the data  exchange process in advance of the filing season. However, CMS  officials responsible for the FFM told us that the availability of IRS  systems for testing was not a problem for them. They stated that CMS did  not have the resources to send both monthly and annual reporting in  January. The CMS officials explained that CMS may experience similar  challenges next year. They said that, although the resource constraints  were in part related to the first-year development of the information  technology systems, the volume of processing needed to transmit both  monthly and annual reports in January presents a longer-term challenge.", "Delays in IRS processing of marketplace EPD submissions also  contributed to IRS having incomplete marketplace information available  for AVS matching with tax returns for most of the filing season. According  to IRS officials, once IRS receives the marketplace submissions, IRS  must process the data to make them available for matching. IRS officials  told us that IRS processing of the data submissions it received in  February was delayed because IRS needed to implement an internal  technical system change during that time. Therefore, complete data from  the majority of marketplaces was not available for matching until the last  week in March 2015. Specifically, as of March 21, 2015, according to IRS  documentation, IRS had processed and made available for verification of  taxpayer PTC claims complete coverage data for the entire January 2014  to December 2014 tax year for 4 of the 51 marketplace states. Incomplete  data, which did not include data for the month of December 2014, were  processed and available for 38 marketplace states. For the remaining 9  marketplace states, no usable 2014 EPD information was processed and  available for PTC verification. The marketplace data that were processed  and available to IRS for matching as of March 21, 2015, provided PTC  information on approximately 3.1 million tax households; IRS expected  that about 4.4 million tax households would be represented once the  marketplace information was complete. In late March 2015, according to  IRS documentation, it had processed additional EPD files to make them  available for matching so that, as of March 29, 2015, IRS had complete  2014 EPD data available for 46 of the 51 marketplace states, but it had  incomplete data for two states and no EPD data for the other three states.

Although these contingency processes  enabled IRS to process tax returns with PTC claims without complete  marketplace data, the processes did not fully mitigate the impacts on  taxpayers. In the absence of complete EPD from all marketplaces, early  in the filing season IRS suspended processing more than 24,000 tax  returns for a week or more. In prior work we found that using the  correspondence process for resolving discrepancy cases imposes a  burden on taxpayers as it requires them to provide documentation in  response to IRS\u2019s post-filing notices and then wait for IRS to  communicate the results of its review.
