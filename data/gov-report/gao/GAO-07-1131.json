Although air passenger inspections were integrated within CBP, the fees supporting these inspections were created and are still governed by separate, dissimilar authorizing legislation. Two fee amounts are set in statute and one is set by regulation; all are collected by the airlines, deposited into three separate accounts and distributed among the agencies. As a result, the fees are administered and overseen by a complicated network of executive branch agencies and congressional committees, creating a series of challenges. For example, neither CBP nor ICE know whether the fees collected are recovering the full cost of the immigration inspection activities or whether the fees are properly divided between them, because ICE does not have finalized cost calculations for its inspection-related activities. In addition, certain passengers are exempt from some fees but not others, making it difficult for agencies to administer the fees. Further, although airports and airlines play an important role in facilitating inspections and the process of collecting and remitting the fees, opportunities for two-way communication are fragmented and limited, reducing stakeholder buy-in and acceptance of the fees and contributing to confusion about how the three fees work and what activities they may fund. Other challenges are due to the statutory structure of the individual passenger inspection fees. For example, the customs inspection fees are available for limited purposes: not all reimbursable activities may be associated with inspections, and not all inspection activities are reimbursable. However, CBP officials said even if the customs fees were spent on inspection-related activities, they still would only recover about 72 percent of costs in fiscal year 2006. Therefore, customs inspection-related activities are mainly funded by appropriations from general revenues. Further, without auditing each airline, CBP cannot independently verify the amount owed by airlines, partly because airlines are required to remit the fees based on ticket sales rather than passengers transported. CBP said it is developing a legislative proposal that would address these and other challenges by requiring airlines to remit based on passengers transported, but airline industry stakeholders said this change would complicate their collection process and create substantial transition costs. Although a number of options for addressing these fees have been raised, regardless of whether these fees are consolidated in whole, in part, or not at all, certain problems specific to the individual fees can and should be resolved first, and in a manner consistent with principles of effective user fee design, on which GAO has previously reported. Moreover, although partly or fully consolidating the fees under DHS's authority could provide opportunities to address some of the many challenges identified in this report, consolidation in-and-of-itself will not solve all of the problems we have identified."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["International air passengers arriving in the United States are subject to an  inspection to ensure they possess legal entry and immigration documents  and do not bring in contraband, such as illegal drugs, counterfeit goods, or  harmful pests and prohibited agriculture products.

Efficiency: An efficient user fee is set at a rate that is in proportion to  the cost that the user imposes on the program.   Revenue Adequacy: The revenue adequacy of a fee is determined by  its ability to cover the costs of the program over time.

APHIS adjusts  fees under this authority through the federal regulatory process by public  notice and comment on proposed rates and implementing regulations in  the federal register. In contrast, the customs passenger inspection fee  statute is the most restrictive of these three fee statutes. It limits both the  fee that may be charged and the set of activities for which collections may  reimburse appropriations. Somewhere between these two margins is the  immigration fee statute. It is available to refund any appropriation for  expenses incurred in providing immigration inspection and preinspection  services, but it limits the fee that may be charged. While both the  immigration and customs statutes contain language that fees equal or be  reasonably related to the cost of services, the two statutes actually  prescribe an exact amount in law to be charged for their respective  inspection services.

Principles of  effective user fee design suggest that user fees should be set at a rate to  cover allowable costs as a way of ensuring the fee is as efficient as  possible. Instead, however, ICE officials said they rely on appropriated  funds to cover the gap between fee collections and costs. By law, ICE uses  appropriated money for fee-reimbursable expenses and then refunds the  appropriations when user fees are received. They are also permitted to use  appropriations if fees are insufficient to cover inspection costs. ICE  officials said that although they have not finalized their activity cost  analysis, the preliminary data shows that ICE\u2019s current portion of the fee  collections is not sufficient to fully refund the appropriations used and  demonstrates that ICE should receive a greater proportion of the  immigration user fee funds. CBP officials do not agree with the  preliminary assessment. CBP officials told us that the immigration fee  collections CBP receives are sufficient to cover the cost of CBP\u2019s  immigration-related reimbursable activities. In fact, CBP\u2019s data show that  its portion of the immigration fee collections were 1 percent more than  CBP\u2019s immigration inspection costs for fiscal year 2006. Until ICE  completes its cost analysis, it will not be known whether the immigration  fee is set at a rate that covers the total cost of both CBP and ICE\u2019s  immigration activities.", "CBP and APHIS disagree on how future collections should be estimated  and how the fees are subsequently distributed. CBP and APHIS use  different rates of passenger volume increases to calculate the costs of  covered activities. APHIS\u2014the agency responsible for setting the  agriculture fee\u2014estimates future international air passenger volumes by  extrapolating historical growth, whereas CBP primarily uses Federal  Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) passenger volume forecast and collection  trends. In the December 2004 interim rule for the January 2005 fee  adjustment, for example, APHIS forecast passenger volume to increase by  1.18 percent per year for fiscal years 2005 through 2010, which was the  average volume increase for fiscal years 1999 through 2003. In contrast,  CBP projected a 4.7 to 4.8 percent annual growth. The resulting higher  passenger volume estimate leads to higher total collections estimates by  CBP than the one APHIS uses. CBP officials said that in 2004, 2005, and  2006 actual collections were higher than APHIS\u2019s forecast by $17 million,  $11 million, and $12 million, respectively. CBP officials said 2007  collections to-date are also $13 million higher than forecasted, and APHIS  officials told us they would make additional transfers to CBP to distribute  the extra collections. CBP officials said that if the agriculture fee estimates  tracked actual collections better, CBP would receive more money earlier  in the year rather than toward the end of the fiscal year, which would  allow CBP to better plan for its use. However, APHIS officials said the  more conservative forecasting approach was appropriate since they do not  receive appropriations for these activities and must be able to provide the  services even if fee collections should decline.

CBP  and APHIS, and CBP and ICE signed a memorandum of agreement   (MOA) / memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishing a process for  fee distribution. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 requires an agreement  between the Secretaries governing the transfer of agriculture user fee  funds from the Department of Agriculture to DHS for DHS\u2019s agriculture  quarantine inspection activities. The most recent MOA, dated 2007,  documents the fee distribution: 60.64 percent of total agriculture  passenger inspection fees were allotted to CBP and 39.36 percent to  APHIS. Per the MOA, APHIS transfers CBP\u2019s portion via a bimonthly  transfer. Although we reported in May 2006 that APHIS did not always  make regular transfers to CBP, we found that these issues have generally  been resolved. The CBP/ICE memo allotted 82.63 percent of total  immigration fee collections to CBP and 17.37 percent to ICE, and required  CBP to submit monthly warrants to the Treasury to initiate the distribution  of the immigration fees between ICE and CBP.", "However, the extent, quality, and results of agency coordination differ.  The CBP/APHIS MOA requires the agencies to periodically exchange cost  information. Specifically, CBP is required to submit to APHIS at the end of  each quarter an accounting of the costs of its agriculture quarantine  inspection activities. APHIS is also required to submit to CBP a quarterly  and annual report on both agriculture user fee collections by activity and  associated costs of the agriculture quarantine inspection fees. Officials  told us that these requirements are important to help them address issues  such as changing workloads and costs, and the MOA has been updated  accordingly. CBP and APHIS\u2019s experience is consistent with our past work  on agency coordination, which states that optimal coordination requires  agencies to establish compatible policies and procedures and  communicate frequently. Such communication is critical, as evidenced by  our recent report on APHIS and CBP management coordination issues,  which found that the agencies\u2019 coordination problems sometimes result in  operational weaknesses that increase the vulnerability of United States  agriculture to foreign pests and disease. In contrast, the CBP/ICE MOU is  much less specific and lacks important elements present in the  CBP/APHIS MOA. For example, the CBP/ICE MOU only states that, \u201cICE  and CBP agree to provide each other reports on the total amounts of  immigration user fees received to ensure that such receipts are equitably  split.\u201d ICE officials said the MOU was primarily intended to set up the  initial transfer of immigration fee collections from the newly formed ICE  to CBP and was not designed to address how CBP and ICE would  regularly coordinate on the immigration fee.", "Even if agencies generate complete cost data and agree on how to divide  collections between them, the precise activities associated with  inspections\u2014and the costs of those activities\u2014can change over time.  Legislation, regulations, or agency agreements governing a fee should  ideally contain a mechanism for adjusting user fee rates that is flexible and  timely enough to allow for periodic review and, as appropriate,  adjustment. The CBP/APHIS MOA requires both agencies to appoint Chief  Budget Liaisons who must hold \u201cquarterly and annual face-to-face  meetings where both parties would share and analyze their respective  program costs \u2026 \u201d so that the proportions can be reviewed and adjusted  as appropriate. Through this coordination, CBP received an additional 1.31  percent in agricultural passenger inspection fees, pursuant to approval by  both agencies, after actual fee collections exceeded projections. ICE  officials told us that, at the time of the transition to DHS, ICE requested  that the MOU be renegotiated every 2 years; however, the CBP/ICE MOU  does not include any provision to renegotiate, and CBP and ICE officials  have not regularly met to discuss potential adjustments to each agency\u2019s  portion of the fee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distributing Fees among Agencies Has Implications for Agency Budget Execution", "paragraphs": ["Airlines remit collections of the customs and immigration user fees to CBP  and the agriculture fees to APHIS.

For example, on December 9, 2004, APHIS  published an interim final rule in the Federal Register proposing to  increase the agriculture passenger inspection fee from $3.10 in 2004 to  $4.95 in 2005 and to $5.00 per passenger for 2006 to 2010. The change was  effective January 1, 2005, although comments received by February 7,  2005, would be considered before the final rule was issued. In another  instance, APHIS eliminated the fee exemption for passengers originating in  Canada by means of an interim final rule published in the Federal Register  in August 2006, which stated that it was effective November 24, 2006, and  comments received by November 24, 2006, would be considered.", "APHIS\u2019s use of the \u201cgood cause\u201d exemptions to issue interim final rules  limits stakeholder input. Stakeholders said they do not feel their  comments are taken into account since the Department of Agriculture  adjusts the fee before even soliciting feedback and the final rule matches  the interim one regardless of stakeholder feedback. Furthermore, we have  previously reported that nonfederal stakeholders believe relying solely on  notice and comment through the Federal Register is insufficient for  obtaining stakeholder input. When agencies do not effectively  communicate their analysis and results, they miss the opportunity to  obtain meaningful comments that could affect the outcome of their  regulatory changes. Without showing the underlying analysis, the agencies\u2019  conclusions may lack credibility.", "ICE and APHIS officials told us that air travel stakeholders have little  information on their respective activities and fees and generally do not  understand how these fees work or what they are intended to fund. As we  will discuss in the next section, CBP stakeholders also do not have a clear  understanding of how the customs fee works and what activities it may  fund. For example, officials said the agriculture quarantine inspection  function has become less transparent to air passengers and stakeholders  since CBP officers all wear the same uniform and conduct the primary  customs, immigration, and agriculture quarantine inspections\u2014and not all  passengers are identified for an agriculture-related secondary inspection.  Similarly, many of the inspection activities retained by APHIS and ICE are  not visible to most passengers or stakeholders during the actual inspection  process.", "Stakeholders said the Advisory Committee meetings had declined in value  since INS ran them because cost and full time equivalent (FTE)  information is no longer provided. CBP officials said that in the post- September 11 environment, airport inspector staffing information is \u201claw- enforcement sensitive\u201d and therefore not shared with airports and airlines.  Airport, airline, and industry officials said they have requested information  about passenger inspection activities or the cost of these activities. As a  result, they feel they lack data necessary to know whether the passenger  inspection fees are set fairly or accurately, or are being spent on the  appropriate activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Specific Aspects of the Individual Passenger Inspection Fees Should Be Addressed Prior to or in Concert with Any Consolidation Effort", "paragraphs": ["Some difficulties with these fees arise not because the fees are separate  but because of factors that are specific to the individual passenger  inspection fees. First of all, by statute, the customs fees are available for  limited purposes. Not all of these purposes are associated with conducting  inspections, and not all inspection activities are reimbursable. Even if all  the costs were reimburseable, according to CBP, the fees collected still  would not cover the full inspection costs. This misalignment, coupled with  the problems in stakeholder communication described in the previous  section, have created confusion and misunderstandings, and in some cases  the misimpression among stakeholders that CBP in particular is using the  air passenger fee collections inappropriately. Furthermore, the collection  process itself is complex and presents challenges for CBP and the airlines.  Finally, the tools provided to the agencies to ensure the airlines\u2019  compliance are not applied consistently and, contrary to strategies  associated with effective incentives and penalties, do not provide  progressively stronger disincentives for noncompliance (i.e., a graduated  penalty system)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "There Is a Disconnect between What Customs User Fees Can Pay for and Activities Involved in Customs Inspections", "paragraphs": ["The activities that can be funded by passenger inspection collections vary  among the fees and are specified in statute. Principles of effective user fee  design suggest that fees should be aligned with the costs of the activities  for which the fee is collected. The agriculture and immigration statutes  generally permit the Secretaries of Agriculture and Homeland Security to  cover costs associated with agricultural and immigration inspection  activities. In contrast, the customs user fee collections are available for  limited purposes. Under the customs authorizing statute, passenger  inspection fee collections are only available to reimburse appropriations  for a limited, prioritized set of activities, including general deficit  reduction, overtime and premium pay, retirement and disability  contributions, preclearance services, and foreign language proficiency  awards. Customs inspection-related activities that occur while a CBP  officer is earning overtime, premium pay, or during preclearance can be  funded by the user fees, but the customs fee is not authorized to fund  customs-inspection activities that occur beyond these times. Moreover,  the customs air passenger fee can be used for overtime and premium pay  as well as retirement and disability contributions for CBP officers for time  spent conducting inspections regardless of whether the CBP officers are  inspecting passengers at air, sea, or land ports of entry. Therefore, under  current law not all activities that may be funded from the customs fee (see  table 4) are necessarily associated with conducting air passenger  inspections (see table 5), and not all inspection activities are reimbursable,  that is, can be covered by funds from the user fee account.", "50 full-time equivalent inspectional positions to provide preclearance services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airlines Collect Fees When Tickets Are Sold Rather Than When Passengers Travel, Which Makes It Difficult for Agencies to Verify Collection and Payment", "paragraphs": ["Despite a unified collection process for the three fees, CBP faces  challenges in verifying individual passenger payment and accurately  determining each airline\u2019s liability. By law, the ticket seller (i.e., the airline  or ticket agent) must collect the applicable passenger inspection fees from  the passenger at the time the ticket is sold. Tickets can be sold up to a  year in advance, and CBP has no independent documentation on which to  calculate liability. Therefore, CBP cannot match the fees paid to individual  passengers. The only way CBP can independently confirm that  passengers traveling to the United States have paid the requisite inspection  fees is through postremittance audits. To remedy this, CBP would like to  move to a system wherein airlines remit fees based on the passengers  transported into the United States. CBP could then track the remittances  to the number of passengers per flight by comparing them to the airplane  manifest data and \u201conboard\u201d counts that airlines already provide to CBP.  According to CBP officials, if the fees were remitted based on passengers  transported, there would be little need for auditing carrier remittance  since CBP would be able to automatically calculate and verify airline  liability.", "Airline and Air Transport Association (ATA) officials with whom we spoke  said that changing from a ticket-based collection system to a passenger- transported collection system poses challenges to airlines. First, the airline  that transports the passenger is not always the airline that sold the ticket.  This means that in a manifest-based system the airline responsible for  remitting a fee might not be the airline that collected it from the passenger.  Nearly all United States airlines use the \u201cinterlining\u201d system, in which one  airline can contract with another to provide transportation for one or more  segments of a passenger\u2019s journey. Under the current ticket-based  collection system, on an interlined ticket the airline that sells the ticket  remits the fee, regardless of which airline transports the passenger into the  United States. For example, a passenger who purchases a Madrid-Paris- New York ticket from ABC airline pays the fee to ABC airline even if he  flies ABC from Madrid to Paris and XYZ from Paris to New York. Airline  ABC is liable for the fee and remits it to the U.S. government. However,  under CBP\u2019s original proposed passenger-transported system, the liability  for remitting the fee would fall on airline XYZ\u2014the airline that brought the  passenger into the country\u2014even though ABC airline sold the ticket and  collected the fee. As a result, airline XYZ\u2014the airline that transported the  passenger into the United States\u2014would have to ensure not only that ABC  paid airline XYZ for the ticket but also that it collected and transferred the  correct fees.", "According to CBP officials many foreign-owned airlines already remit the  fees based on passengers transported, though these payments are in  violation of the statute, and the International Air Transport Association  (IATA) reports that the manifest-based remittance system is common in  other countries that collect similar fees. Nevertheless, airlines and ATA  officials said that transition costs would be significant\u2014though limited to  the first year\u2014because airlines begin selling tickets for a flight 1 year in  advance, and as a result they would have to maintain two separate  remittance systems\u2014ticket-based and passenger-transported-based\u2014for a  full year. Airlines question the need for such a change. Officials from two  major airlines noted that CBP\u2019s audits put their remittance error rate at  less than 1 percent. CBP officials concur that for the six to seven major  domestic airlines the remittance error rate is extremely low, but as we will  discuss, error and timely remittance rates for small and medium-sized  airlines are more problematic. A shift to a passenger-transported system  would, they argue, increase the ability of CBP\u2019s finance office to determine  the compliance of smaller airlines and potentially reduce CBP\u2019s audit  costs.", "In addition, the airlines also see fee collection as a cost they incur over  and above the cost of the audits. To help offset collection costs, airlines  are permitted to keep the \u201cinterest float\u201d\u2014that is, the interest income that  accrues between the quarterly remittances. Airline representatives view  this as minimal for two reasons. First, in the recent era of low interest  rates, the interest float is small; airline officials told us that it covered as  little as 38 percent of collection costs. This would decline even further if  CBP moves to monthly remittance as it suggests it will in its legislative  proposal. Second, airline and airline industry officials said credit card  transaction fees averaging 2.15 percent on the total transaction\u2014including  taxes and fees as well as the ticket price\u2014further reduce the benefit.  Another user fee collected by airlines on behalf of the government\u2014the  passenger facility charges (PFC)\u2014has a provision that is designed to  compensate for the actual cost of collections, in addition to the interest  float. The airlines told us they would prefer this type of direct  compensation for their collection role, similar to the PFC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance Tools Do Not Provide a Graduated Penalty System to Encourage Airline Remittance", "paragraphs": ["The tools used to ensure airline compliance do not provide optimal  incentives for airlines to make accurate and timely payments. We have  previously reported that rewards and penalties should correspond to  performance. Although each fee contains enforcement mechanisms  meant to encourage airlines to remit the correct fee amount on time\u2014 namely the carrier bond associated with the customs fee, the denial of  landing rights for the customs and immigration fees, and the penalties and  interest associated with the agriculture and immigration fees\u2014none are  designed in this manner. For the customs fee, CBP is authorized to require  airlines to maintain a carrier bond, which is used both to enforce payment  of inspection fees and to encourage airlines to comply with inspection- related requirements, such as submitting complete Advance Passenger  Information System (APIS) data prior to takeoff. In addition, airlines that  do not remit the customs fee timely\u2014or not at all\u2014are charged liquidated  damages for breach of bond conditions that are equal to twice the fee  amount owed for each violation, whether it is the first violation or a repeat  violation. CBP officials said they have issued liquidated damages against  20\u201325 airlines on average per quarter since 2003 for late payment or  nonpayment.", "For the immigration and agriculture fees, the agencies may require airlines  to pay interest and penalties because of late payment or nonpayment. CBP  officials said the interest and penalty rates charged for late payments are  set by the Treasury Department and do not provide for increasing interest  or penalty rates, or both, for repeated instances of late or nonpayment.  Thus an airline that repeatedly pays late\u2014or not at all\u2014is charged the  same interest and penalty amount each time, which may just offset the  interest the airline earned by not remitting user fee collections in the first  place. Therefore, CBP officials said the penalty is not high enough to  discourage violations.", "CBP is also authorized to deny landing rights if the airline does not remit  customs and immigration fees. However, this tool suffers from the very  opposite design flaw: it is perceived to be too severe to invoke. CBP  officials said that denying landing rights is such a severe penalty that its  very existence\u2014infrequent application notwithstanding\u2014is effective  enough to discourage late payment or nonpayment of passenger  inspection fees by the airlines. However, even in cases of carrier  nonremittance or chronic late remittance, CBP officials said CBP has  threatened to use this authority to deny landing rights on four occasions\u2014 twice against the same airline\u2014in nearly 20 years. Three of these instances  occurred in 2007. We have previously reported that penalties may lose  their effectiveness and credibility over time if they are not executed  consistently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Does Not Employ a Systematic Process for Selecting Airlines for Audit", "paragraphs": ["Officials said there is no standard set of criteria used to guide the selection  of airlines for audit. The audit function for all three inspection fees is  consolidated within CBP\u2019s Office of Regulatory Audit, and all audits cover  all three fees. Approximately 385 airlines remit immigration and  agriculture fees, and 290 airlines remit the customs fee. CBP audits about  50 carriers annually to test for compliance. CBP\u2019s Office of Finance  recommends airlines for audit based on a number of factors, including  whether a carrier\u2019s remittance dropped substantially from one quarter to  the next, news articles about changes in flights or airline financial issues,  and prior audit findings. Experience and judgment also come into play.  Officials are responsible for processing the same airlines\u2019 payments every  quarter and become \u201cexperts\u201d on those airlines and the normal trends in  their remittances. Although this flexibility and individualized  understanding of the airlines is important, we have previously reported  that developing internal controls is key to minimizing the risks that may  prevent an agency from meeting its objective. Documenting selection  criteria could also protect the agency when experienced officials leave the  agency. CBP officials told us that although the larger airlines generally  present a much lower risk of noncompliance or incomplete remittance,  they are audited every couple of years because the record-keeping  requirements are so burdensome. In addition, if CBP audited a large airline  only once every 5 years, the audit would be very resource-intensive.  Nevertheless, the fact that there is significantly more volatility in  compliance by small and mid-sized airlines and those offering seasonal  flights means they require more audit attention. For context, in a 5-year  sample of 16 airlines, the 11 airlines with the smallest passenger volume  rate remitted the passenger inspection fees late 35 times.

Moreover, the statutory structure does not permit the administering  agencies to easily verify collection and payment, and the customs fee does  not permit reimbursement for many activities directly associated with air  passenger inspections. These issues should be considered regardless of  whether the fees are consolidated.", "As discussed earlier, we have previously reported on a number of  principles that could inform efforts such as these to redesign or  consolidate these fees.

Furthermore,  agencies will be less able to develop and maintain the partnerships  necessary to collect and distribute the fees as efficiently and effectively as  possible.", "The lack of complete cost data and regular, formal opportunities to share  such information can prevent the agencies from addressing existing issues,  including differences in forecasting assumptions and lack of agreement on  activity costs, standardized audit selection criteria, and the design and  implementation of a graduated penalty system to encourage and enforce  airline compliance.", "More broadly, if agencies cannot determine whether these fees are  recovering costs, Congress cannot be sure that resources are allocated to  the activities it most values.", "Likewise, without substantive, transparent coordination between agencies  and stakeholders, agencies will not be able to effectively address  administrative burdens such as disparate airline record-keeping  requirements among the fees.", "The principles of effective user fee design discussed earlier in this report  can both offer a framework for considering the implications of various  statutory structures and help clarify and illuminate the trade-offs  associated with various policy choices available to Congress associated  with amending the individual statutes related to passenger inspection fees  or consolidating all or part of them into a single passenger inspection fee.
