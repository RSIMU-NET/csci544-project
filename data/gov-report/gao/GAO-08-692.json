This has raised concerns, given that these two types of investments have qualified for exemptions from federal regulations, and could present more risk to retirement assets than traditional investments. To better understand this trend and its implications, GAO was asked to examine (1) the extent to which plans invest in hedge funds and private equity; (2) the potential benefits and challenges of hedge fund investments; (3) the potential benefits and challenges of private equity investments; and (4) what mechanisms regulate and monitor pension plan investments in hedge funds and private equity. To answer these questions GAO interviewed relevant federal agencies, public and private pension plans, industry groups and investment professionals, and analyzed available survey data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to several recent surveys of private and public sector plans, investments in hedge funds and private equity generally comprise a small share of total plan assets, but a considerable and growing number of plans have such investments. Available survey data of mid to large-size plans indicate that between 21 and 27 percent invest in hedge funds while over 40 percent invest in private equity; such investments are more prevalent among larger plans, as shown below. The extent of investment in hedge funds and private equity by plans with less than $200 million in total assets is unknown. Pension plans invest in hedge funds to obtain a number of potential benefits, such as returns greater than the stock market and stable returns on investment. However, hedge funds also pose challenges and risks beyond those posed by traditional investments. For example, some investors may have little information on funds' underlying assets and their values, which limits the opportunity for oversight. Plan representatives said they take steps to mitigate these and other challenges, but doing so requires resourcesbeyond the means of some plans. Pension plans primarily invest in private equity funds to attain returns superior to the stock market. Pension plan officials GAO spoke with generally had a long history of investing in private equity and said such investments have met expectations for returns. However, these investments present several challenges, such as wide variation in performance among funds, and the resources required to mitigate these challenges may be too substantial for some plans. The federal government does not specifically limit or monitor private sector plan investment in hedge funds or private equity, and state approaches to public plans vary. Under federal law, fiduciaries must comply with a standard of prudence, but no explicit restrictions on hedge funds or private equity exist. Although a federal advisory council recommended that the Department of Labor (Labor) develop guidance for plans to use in investing in hedge funds, Labor has not yet done so. While most states also rely on a standard of investor prudence, some also have legislation that restricts or prohibits plan investment in hedge funds or private equity. For example, one state prohibits plans below a certain size from investing directly in hedge funds."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Millions of Americans rely on defined benefit pension plans for their  financial well-being after their working years.

Historically, public and private sector pension plans have primarily  invested in traditional investments such as stocks and bonds; however,  recent press reports indicate that plans are increasingly investing in  \u201calternative\u201d investments such as hedge funds and private equity funds.", "While there is no statutory definition of hedge funds, the phrase \u201chedge  fund\u201d is commonly used to refer to a pooled investment vehicle that is  privately organized and administered by professional managers, and that  often engages in active trading of various types of securities and  commodity futures and options contracts. Similarly, private equity funds  are not statutorily defined, but are generally considered privately managed  investment pools administered by professional managers, who typically  make long-term investments in private companies, taking a controlling  interest with the aim of increasing the value of these companies through  such strategies as improved operations or developing new products. Both  hedge funds and private equity funds may be managed so as to be exempt  from certain aspects of federal securities law and regulation that apply to  other investment pools such as mutual funds.", "Pension plan investments in hedge funds and private equity have been  controversial for a number of reasons. While hedge funds investments are  made mainly by relatively wealthy individuals and institutional investors,  the recent increase in pension plan investments in hedge funds indirectly  exposes people of modest incomes to the risks of hedge fund investing.  This has been cited as a concern because a pension plan that experiences  substantial losses as a result of a hedge fund investment may be unable to  meet its obligations to pensioners. The perceived riskiness of hedge funds  and the collapse of some of these funds in recent years have led some  industry experts and union officials to express concern about plan  investments in such vehicles, including the appropriate steps plan officials  should take in conducting proper due diligence. A further cause for their  concern is the ability of hedge funds and private equity funds to qualify for  exemptions from certain aspects of federal securities law and regulations  that apply to other investment pools.", "In order to better understand the extent to which defined benefit pension  plans invest in hedge funds and private equity and the implications of such  investments for the security of pension plan assets, you asked us to  examine the extent and nature of defined benefit pension plans\u2019  investments in these alternative investments. Specifically, you asked us to  address the following questions:  1.  To what extent do public and private sector pension plans invest in  hedge funds and private equity funds?  2.  What are the potential benefits, risks, and challenges pension plans  face in making hedge fund investments, and how do plans address the  risks and challenges?  3.  What are the potential benefits, risks, and challenges pension plans  face in making private equity fund investments, and how do plans  address the risks and challenges?  4.  What mechanisms regulate and monitor pension plan investments in  hedge funds and private equity funds?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed relevant literature and survey  data and conducted in-depth interviews with pension plan representatives  and industry experts. We obtained and analyzed data on the extent of  pension plan investments in hedge funds and private equity from private  organizations such as Greenwich Associates, Pensions & Investments,  and Pyramis Global Advisors. Although these surveys had several  limitations\u2014 for example, the survey data generally represent the holdings  of larger pension plans\u2014we determined they were sufficiently reliable for  purposes of our study. To answer the second and third questions, we  conducted in-depth interviews with representatives of 26 public and  private sector DB pension plans and, where possible, obtained and  reviewed supporting documentation. These plans were selected based on  several criteria, including the range of investment in hedge funds and  private equity and the amount of total plan assets. We also interviewed  officials of regulatory agencies, relevant industry organizations,  investment consulting firms, and other national experts. To identify state  and federal regulatory and monitoring policies, we interviewed officials at  the Department of Labor (Labor) and representatives of relevant agencies  in selected states, and reviewed relevant policy documents. We contacted  regulators in 11 states, including the 10 states with the largest amount of  public pension assets according to the National Association of State  Retirement Administrators (NASRA) Public Funds Survey data.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2007 to July 2008, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Millions of current and future retirees rely on private or public DB pension  plans, which promise to pay retirement benefits that are generally based  on an employee\u2019s salary and years of service. The financial condition of  these plans\u2014and hence their ability to pay promised retirement benefits  when such benefits are due\u2014depends on adequate contributions from  employers and, in some cases, employees, as well as prudent investments  that preserve principal and yield an adequate rate of return over time. The  plan sponsor must make required contributions to the plan that are  intended to ensure it is adequately funded to pay promised benefits. To  maintain and increase plan assets, fiduciaries of public and private sector  pension plans invest in assets that are expected to grow in value or yield  income. In making investments, DB plan managers consider a plan\u2019s  benefit payment requirements and balance the desire to maximize return  on investment and the desire to limit the overall risk to the investment  portfolio to an acceptable level. In doing so, plan fiduciaries invest in  various categories of assets classes, which traditionally have consisted  mainly of stocks and bonds. Stocks offer relatively high expected long- term returns at the risk of considerable volatility, that is, the likelihood of  significant short-term losses or gains. On the other hand, bonds and other  fixed income investments offer a steady income stream and relatively low  volatility, but lower expected long-term returns. Different proportions of  these two asset classes will, therefore, provide different degrees of risk  and expected return on investment. Pension fiduciaries may also invest in  other asset classes or trading strategies, such as hedge funds and private  equity, which are generally considered to be riskier investments, so long as  such investments are prudent.", "Private sector pension plan investment decisions must comply with the  provisions of ERISA, which stipulates fiduciary standards based on the  principle of a prudent man standard. Under ERISA, plan sponsors and  other fiduciaries must (1) act solely in the interest of the plan participants  and beneficiaries and in accordance with plan documents; (2) invest with  the care, skill, and diligence of a prudent person with knowledge of such  matters; and (3) diversify plan investments to minimize the risk of large  losses. Under ERISA, the prudence of any individual investment is  considered in the context of the total plan portfolio, rather than in  isolation. Hence, a relatively risky investment may be considered prudent,  if it is part of a broader strategy to balance the risk and expected return to  the portfolio. In addition to plan sponsors, under the ERISA definition of a  fiduciary, any other person that has discretionary authority or control over  a plan asset is subject to ERISA\u2019s fiduciary standards. The Employee  Benefit Security Administration (EBSA) at Labor is responsible for  enforcing these provisions of ERISA, as well as educating and assisting  retired workers and plan sponsors. Another federal agency, the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), collects premiums from federally  insured plans in order to insure the benefits of retirees if a plan terminates  without sufficient assets to pay promised benefits.", "In the public sector, governments have established pension plans at state,  county, and municipal levels, as well as for particular categories of  employees, such as police officers, fire fighters, and teachers. The  structure of public pension plan systems can differ considerably from state  to state. In some states, most or all public employees are covered by a  single consolidated DB retirement plan, while in other states many  retirement plans exist for various units of government and employee  groups. Public sector DB plans are not subject to funding, vesting and  most other requirements applicable to private sector DB plans under  ERISA, but must follow requirements established for them under  applicable state law. While states generally have adopted standards  essentially identical to the ERISA prudent man standard, specific  provisions of law and regulation vary from state to state. Public plans are  also not insured by the PBGC, but could call upon state or local taxpayers  in the event of a funding shortfall."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hedge Funds Use Broad Range of Investment Strategies to Achieve Desired Return", "paragraphs": ["Although there is no statutory or universally accepted definition of hedge  funds, the term is commonly used to describe pooled investment vehicles  that are privately organized and administered by professional managers  and that often engage in active trading of various types of securities,  commodity futures, options contracts, and other investment vehicles. In  recent years, hedge funds have grown rapidly. As we reported in January  2008, according to industry estimates, from 1998 to early 2007, the number  of funds grew from more than 3,000 to more than 9,000 and assets under  management from more than $200 billion to more than $2 trillion globally.", "Hedge funds also have received considerable media attention as a result of  the high-profile collapse of several hedge funds, and consequent losses  suffered by investors in these funds. Although hedge funds have the  reputation of being risky investment vehicles that seek exceptional returns  on investment, this was not their original purpose, and is not true of all  hedge funds today. Founded in the 1940s, one of the first hedge funds  invested in equities and used leverage and short selling to protect or  \u201chedge\u201d the portfolio from its exposure to movements in the stock  market. Over time, hedge funds diversified their investment portfolios and  engaged in a wider variety of investment strategies. Because hedge funds  are typically exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act  of 1940, they are generally not subject to the same federal securities  regulations as mutual funds. They may invest in a wide variety of financial  instruments, including stocks and bonds, currencies, futures contracts,  and other assets. Hedge funds tend to be opportunistic in seeking positive  returns while avoiding loss of principal, and retaining considerable  strategic flexibility. Unlike a mutual fund, which must strictly abide by the  detailed investment policy and other limitations specified in its  prospectus, most hedge funds specify broad objectives and authorize  multiple strategies. As a result, most hedge fund trading strategies are  dynamic, often changing rapidly to adjust to market conditions.", "Hedge funds are typically structured and operated as limited partnerships  or limited liability companies exempt from certain registration, disclosure  and other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, Investment Company Act of 1940, and Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 that apply in connection to other investment pools,  such as mutual funds. For example, to allow them to qualify for various  exemptions under such laws, hedge funds usually limit the number of  investors, refrain from advertising to the general public, and solicit fund  participation only from large institutions and wealthy individuals. The  presumption is that investors in hedge funds have the sophistication to  understand the risks involved in investing in them and the resources to  absorb any losses they may suffer. Although many workers may be  impacted by any losses resulting from pension fund investment in hedge  funds, a pension plan counts as a single investor that does not prevent a  hedge fund from qualifying for the various statutory exemptions.", "Individuals and institutions may also invest in hedge funds through funds  of hedge funds, which are investment funds that buy shares of multiple  underlying hedge funds. Fund of funds managers invest in other hedge  funds rather than trade directly in the financial markets, and thus offer  investors broader exposure to different hedge fund managers and  strategies.

Although there are some similarities in the structure of  hedge funds and private equity funds, the investment strategies employed  are different. Unlike many hedge funds, private equity funds typically  make longer-term investments in private companies and seek to obtain  financial returns not through particular trading strategies and techniques,  but through long-term appreciation based on corporate stewardship,  improved operating processes and financial restructuring of those  companies, which may involve a merger or acquisition of companies.  Private equity is generally considered to involve a substantially higher  degree of risk than traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds, for a  higher return.", "While strategies of private equity funds vary, most funds target either  venture capital or buy-out opportunities. Venture capital funds invest in  young companies often developing a new product or technology. Private  equity fund managers may provide expertise to a fledgling company to  help it advance toward a position suitable for an initial public offering.  Buyout funds generally invest in larger established companies in order to  add value, in part, by increasing efficiencies and, in some cases,  consolidating resources by merging complementary businesses or  technologies. For both venture capital and buy-out strategies, investors  hope to profit when the company is eventually sold, either when offered to  the public or when sold to another investor or company. Each private  equity fund generally focuses on only one type of investment opportunity,  usually specializing in either venture capital or buyout and often  specializing further in terms of industry or geographical area. Investment  in private equity has grown considerably over recent decades. According  to a venture capital industry organization, the amount of capital raised by  private equity funds grew from just over $2 billion in 1980 to about $207  billion in 2007; while the number of private equity funds grew from 56 to  432 funds over the same time period.", "As with hedge funds, private equity funds operate as privately managed  investment pools and have generally not been subject to Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) examinations. Pension plans typically invest  in private equity through limited partnerships in which the general partner  develops an investment strategy and limited partners provide the large  majority of the capital. After creating a new fund and raising capital from  the limited partners, the general partner begins to invest in companies that  will make up the fund portfolio (see fig. 1). Limited partners have both  limited control over the underlying investments and also limited liability  for potential debts incurred by the general partners through the fund.", "Similar to hedge funds, private equity funds may be structured to qualify  for exemptions from certain registration and disclosure requirements of  federal securities laws; for example, by refraining from advertising to the  general public.

As figure 5 illustrates, an  annual return of 12 percent falls to about 7.6 percent after fees are  deducted. Several pension plans cited the costly fee structure fees as a  major drawback to hedge fund investing. For example, representatives of  one plan that had not invested in hedge funds said that they are focused on  minimizing transaction costs of their investment program, and the hedge  fund fee structure would likely not be worth the expense. On the other  hand, an official of another plan noted that, as long as hedge funds add  value net of fees, they found the higher fees acceptable.", "Because many hedge funds may own thinly traded securities and  derivatives whose valuation can be complex, and in some cases subjective,  a plan may not be able to obtain timely information on the value of assets  owned by a hedge fund. Further, hedge fund managers may decline to  disclose information on asset holdings and the net value of individual  assets largely because release of such information could compromise their  trading advantage. In addition, even if hedge fund managers were to  provide detailed positions, plan sponsors might be unable to fully analyze  and assess the prospective return and risk of a hedge fund. As a  consequence, a plan may not be able to independently ascertain the value  of its hedge fund investment or fully assess the degree of investment risk  posed by its hedge fund investment. Although we noted in January 2008  that hedge funds have improved disclosure and transparency about their  operations due to the demands of institutional investors, several pension  plans cited limited transparency as a prime reason they had chosen not to  invest in hedge funds. For example, representatives of one plan told us  that they had considered investing in hedge funds several years ago, but  that most of the hedge funds it contacted would not provide position-level  information, and that they were reluctant to make such an investment  without this information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Liquidity Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Hedge funds offer investors relatively limited liquidity, that is, investors  may not be able to redeem a hedge fund investment on demand because of  a hedge fund\u2019s redemption policy.

For example,  liquidity limitations can inhibit a plan\u2019s ability to minimize a hedge fund  investment loss. As one state official noted after a state fund had suffered  losses in the wake of the 2006 collapse of Amaranth, even when a plan  learns that a hedge fund is losing value, various lockup provisions often  make it difficult to promptly withdraw from the investment. Further, an  investor\u2019s rights with regard to cashing out may not be entirely clear from  the written contract. According to an investigative study by a Grand Jury  of one pension plan\u2019s experience with a failed hedge fund, the contracts  can be dense with legal language, which may make understanding of basic  terms and conditions difficult, especially with regard to withdrawal  provisions.

According to a report by an investment  consulting firm, because many hedge funds engage in active, complex, and  sometimes heavily leveraged trading, a failure of operational functions  such as processing or clearing one or more trades may have grave  consequences for the overall position of the hedge fund. Concerns about  some operational issues were noted by SEC in a 2003 report on the  implications of the growth of hedge funds. For example, the 2003 report  noted that SEC had instituted a significant and growing number of  enforcement actions involving hedge fund fraud in the preceding 5 years.  Further, SEC noted that while some hedge funds had adopted sound  internal controls and compliance practices, in many other cases, controls  may be very informal, and may not be adequate for the amount of assets  under management.

A single private  equity fund generally invests in only about 10 to 15 companies, often in the  same sector. The risks associated with such concentrated, undiversified  funds may be compounded by particular aspects of the buyout and venture  capital sectors. Fund managers in the buyout sector generally invest using  leverage to seek greater returns but such investments also increase  investment risks. In the venture capital sector, fund managers typically  make smaller investments in companies that may have a limited track  record and rely on technological development and growing the company\u2019s  commercial capacity for success.

According to EBSA officials, there have been several investigations and  enforcement actions in recent years that involved investments in hedge  funds and private equity, but these investments have not raised significant  concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Selected States Regulate and Monitor Investments of Public Sector Plans Using Varying Approaches", "paragraphs": ["Our state pension plan contacts indicated that, in recent years, state  regulation of public pension plan investments has become generally more  flexible. According to a NASRA official, state regulation of public pension  plan investments has gradually become less restrictive and more reliant on  fiduciary prudence standards. This official noted that, for example,  blanket prohibitions on investments such as international stocks or real  estate have given way to permission for a wider range of investments.  Some of our state contacts described this shift over time from a  prescriptive list of authorized investments (\u201clegal lists\u201d) and asset  allocation limits to a more flexible approach, such as adoption of the  prudent man standard.", "Of the state pension plan officials we contacted in 11 states, officials in 7  states indicated that applicable state law imposes restrictions on the  ability of public pension plans to invest in hedge funds and/or private  equity, as seen in table 2. Among these seven states, the restriction may  be in the form of (i) a provision applicable to investments in hedge funds  or private equity funds specifically, (ii) an exclusive list of permissible of  investments that is not likely to capture hedge funds or private equity  investments, or (iii) a provision that restricts investments in certain  categories of assets that, because of the typical structure or investment  strategy of hedge funds or private equity funds, are likely to apply to  investments in such funds.", "Some of the selected states have, through statute or regulation, established  explicit limitations on the amount that pension plans can invest in hedge  funds or private equity. For example, under Texas law, the Teacher  Retirement System of Texas (TRS)\u2014the largest public pension plan in  Texas\u2014is statutorily limited to investing no more than 5 percent of the  plan\u2019s total assets in hedge funds. According to a Texas Pension Review  Board official, the statute codified TRS\u2019s ability to invest in hedge funds  while at the same time limiting the amount TRS can invest in hedge funds.  According to a TRS official, this law was a compromise between TRS\u2019s  desire to invest more broadly in hedge funds and some state legislators  who were concerned about the possible risks of hedge funds. Other  states we reviewed have comparable limitations for public plans.", "The Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u2019 Public Employee Retirement  Administration Commission (PERAC) has established a detailed set of  limitations and guidance, with particular limitations on smaller public  plans. In Massachusetts, public plans with less than $250 million in assets  may not invest in hedge funds directly, but they may invest through a state- managed hedge fund investment pool (see table 3). According to a PERAC  official, this limitation exists because hedge funds are relatively new  investments for pension plans and because they require high levels of due  diligence and expertise that may be excessive for smaller plans. PERAC  also limits and offers guidance to larger public plans, emphasizing  diversification, to help limit a plan\u2019s exposure to potential losses from  hedge fund failures. According to a PERAC official, the group is less strict  about private equity investments because private equity is a more familiar  asset class among the state\u2019s public plans. Public plans with less than $25  million in assets may invest up to three percent of assets in private equity  and plans with more than $25 million may invest up to 5 percent of assets  in private equity. PERAC requires plans of either size to obtain PERAC  permission before investing in private equity above those levels.", "Some of the selected states have instituted \u201clegal lists\u201d of authorized  investments for pension plans that do not specifically include investments  in hedge funds or private equity funds as authorized assets. According to a  NASRA official, this was the dominant regulatory approach of state  pension investment 40 years ago, and while some states have moved away  from this approach, others have continued to maintain legal lists. Illinois  has established a legal list of assets that does not include interests in  hedge funds or private equity funds, in which certain smaller plans that  cover police officers and fire fighters are authorized to invest. Large  statewide plans, such those managed by the Illinois State Board of  Investment, are governed by a prudent man standard, which does not  explicitly restrict investment of pension assets in any particular  investment. In some instances, states allow a certain percentage of plan  assets to be invested in assets that do not qualify under one of the  authorized categories on the legal list. For example, the New York State  Common Retirement Fund is governed by a legal list, but the state allows  the plan to invest up to 25 percent of its assets in investments not  otherwise permitted by the legal list.", "Finally, public pension plan investments in hedge funds are prohibited or  limited in some states by laws restricting pension plan investment in  certain investment vehicles or trading strategies. For example, the North  Carolina Retirement system can not invest more than 10 percent of plan  assets in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations. Similarly,  before new legislation broadening investment authority went into effect in  April 2008, the Wisconsin Retirement System could not invest assets in  vehicles that trade options or engage in short selling, two techniques  commonly used by hedge funds. However, with the new statutory  authority, the Wisconsin Retirement System may use any investment  strategy that meets its prudent investor standard.", "States we contacted take a variety of approaches to overseeing and  monitoring public pension plan investment. In Massachusetts, before  conducting a hedge fund manager search, public plans must first obtain  PERAC approval and provide the agency with a summary of the plan\u2019s  objectives, strategies, and goals in hedge fund investing. PERAC requires  pension plans to document the major due diligence steps taken in the  hedge fund manager selection process. In addition, prospective hedge fund  managers must submit detailed information to PERAC regarding their key  personnel, assets under management, investment strategy and process,  risk controls, past performance, and organizational structure. Finally,  hedge fund managers must also submit quarterly performance and strategy  review reports directly to PERAC. Officials in other states we contacted  may review hedge fund and private equity investments as part of a broader  oversight approach. For example, the Ohio Retirement Study Council  reviews the five large statewide public retirement funds semiannually to  evaluate a plan\u2019s investment policies and objectives, asset allocations  decisions, and risk and return assumptions. In California, individual  pension boards have sole and exclusive authority over investment  decisions; however, they ensure public information on investment  decisions and fund performance, including detailed reports of alternative  investments, are publicly available."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Available data indicate that pension plans have increasingly invested in  hedge funds and have continued to invest in private equity to complement  their traditional investments in stocks and bonds. Further, these data  indicate that individual plans\u2019 hedge fund or private equity investments  typically comprise a small share of total plan assets. However, data are  generally not available on the extent to which smaller pension plans have  made such investments. Because such investments require a degree of  fiduciary effort well beyond that required by more traditional investments,  this can be a difficult challenge for plans, especially smaller plans. Smaller  plans may not have the expertise or financial resources to be fully aware  of these challenges, or have the ability to address them through  negotiations, due diligence, and monitoring. In light of this, such  investments may not be appropriate for some pension plans.", "Although plans are responsible for making prudent choices when investing  in any asset, EBSA also has a role in helping to ensure that pension plan  sponsors fulfill their fiduciary duties in managing pension plans that are  subject to ERISA. This can include educating employers and service  providers about their fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA. Many private  sector plans are insured by the PBGC, which guarantees most benefits  when an underfunded plan terminates; however, public sector plans are  not insured and may call upon state or local taxpayers to overcome  funding shortfalls.", "The importance of educating investors about the special challenges  presented by hedge funds has been recognized by a number of  organizations. For example, in 2006, the ERISA Advisory Council  recommended that Labor publish guidance about the unique features of  hedge funds and matters for consideration in their use by qualified plans.  To date, EBSA has not acted on this recommendation. More recently, in  April 2008, the Investors\u2019 Committee formed by the President\u2019s Working  Group on Financial Markets published draft best practices for investors in  hedge funds. This guidance will be applicable to a broad range of  investors, such as public and private pension plans, endowments,  foundations, and wealthy individuals. EBSA can further enhance the  usefulness of this document by ensuring that the guidance is interpreted in  light of the fiduciary responsibilities that ERISA places on private sector  plans. For example, EBSA could outline the implications of a hedge fund\u2019s  or fund of funds\u2019 limited transparency on the fiduciary duty of prudent  oversight. EBSA can also reflect on the implications of these best practices  for some plans\u2014especially smaller plans\u2014that might not have the  resources to take actions consistent with the best practices, and thus  would be at risk of making imprudent investments in hedge funds. While  EBSA is not tasked with offering guidance to public sector plans, such  plans may nonetheless benefit from such guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that all plan fiduciaries can better assess their ability to invest in  hedge funds and private equity, and to ensure that those that choose to  make such investments are better prepared to meet these challenges, we  recommend that the Secretary of Labor provide guidance specifically  designed for qualified plans under ERISA. This guidance should include  such things as (1) an outline of the unique challenges of investing in hedge  funds and private equity; (2) a description of steps that plans should take  to address these challenges and help meet ERISA requirements; and (3) an  explanation of the implications of these challenges and steps for smaller  plans. In doing so, the Secretary may be able to draw extensively from  existing sources, such as the finalized best practices document that will be  published in 2008 by the Investors\u2019 Committee formed by the President\u2019s  Working Group on Financial Markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft copy of this report to the Department of Labor, PBGC,  the Department of the Treasury, the SEC, and the Federal Reserve Bank  for their review and comment.

With regard to our recommendation, Labor stated  that providing more specific guidance on investments in hedge funds and  private equity may present challenges. Specifically, Labor noted that given  the lack of uniformity among hedge funds, private equity funds, and their  underlying investments, it may prove difficult to develop comprehensive  and useful guidance for plan fiduciaries. Nonetheless, Labor agreed to  consider the feasibility of developing such guidance. Labor\u2019s formal  comments are reproduced in appendix III.", "We agree that the lack of uniformity among hedge funds or private equity  funds may pose challenges to Labor. However, we do not believe it will be  an insurmountable obstacle to developing guidance for plan sponsors.  Indeed, the lack of uniformity among hedge funds and private equity funds  is itself an important issue to convey to fiduciaries, and highlights the need  for an extensive due diligence process preceding any investment.  Additionally, as we state in the recommendation, Labor\u2019s efforts can be  facilitated through use of existing best practices documents, such as the  best practices for investors in hedge funds document that will be  published in the summer of 2008 by the Investors\u2019 Committee formed by  the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets.", "The PBGC also provided formal comments, which are reproduced in  appendix IV.

To what extent do public and private sector pension plans invest in  hedge funds and private equity funds?  2.  What are the potential benefits, risks, and challenges pension plans  face in making hedge fund investments, and how do plans address the  risks and challenges?  3.  What are the potential benefits, risks, and challenges pension plans  face in making private equity fund investments, and how do plans  address the risks and challenges?  4.  What mechanisms regulate and monitor pension plan investments in  hedge funds and private equity funds?", "To answer the first question, we obtained and analyzed survey data of  private and public sector defined benefit (DB) plans on the extent of plan  investments in hedge funds and private equity from three private  organizations: Greenwich Associates, Pensions & Investments, and  Pyramis Global Advisors. We identified the three surveys through our  literature review and interviews with plan representatives and industry  experts. As seen in table 4, the surveys varied in the number and size of  plans surveyed. Using the available survey data, we determined the  percentage of plans surveyed that reported investments in hedge funds or  private equity. Using data from Greenwich Associates, we also determined  the percentage of plans surveyed that invested in hedge funds or private  equity by category of plan size, measured by total plan assets. We further  examined data from each survey on the size of allocations to hedge funds  or private equity as a share of total plan assets. Using the Pensions &  Investments data, we analyzed allocations to these investments for  individual plans and calculated the average allocation for hedge funds and  private equity, separately, among all plans surveyed that reported these  investments. The Greenwich Associates and Pyramis data reported the  size of allocations to hedge funds or private equity as an average for all  plans surveyed. Through our research and interviews, we were not able to  identify any relevant surveys that included plans with less than $200  million in total assets.", "While the information collected by each of the surveys is limited in some  ways, we conducted a data reliability assessment of each survey and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of this  study. These surveys did not specifically define the terms hedge fund and  private equity; rather, respondents reported allocations based on their own  classifications. Pensions & Investments reported private equity in three  mutually-exclusive categories\u2014buyout, venture capital, and an \u201cother\u201d  private equity category, which includes investments such as mezzanine  financing and private equity investments traded on the secondary market.  Data from all three surveys are reflective only of the plans surveyed and  cannot be generalized to all plans.", "To answer the second and third questions, we conducted in-depth  interviews with representatives of 26 private and public sector DB plans,  listed in table 5, from June 2007 to January 2008 and, where possible,  obtained and reviewed supporting documentation. Interviews related to  hedge fund investments were conducted from June 2007 to December  2007. Interviews related to private equity investments were conducted  from October 2007 to January 2008. The interviews with plan  representatives were conducted using a semi-structured interview format,  which included open-ended questions on the following topics, asked  separately about hedge funds or private equity: the plan\u2019s history of  investment in hedge funds or private equity; the plan\u2019s experiences with  these investments to date; the plan\u2019s expected benefits from these  investments; challenges the plan has faced with these investments; and  steps the plan has taken to mitigate these challenges, including due  diligence and ongoing monitoring. We interviewed five plans that did not  invest in hedge funds to discuss the reasons the plan decided not have  such investments. We also interviewed officials of government agencies,  relevant industry organizations, investment consulting firms, and other  national experts listed in appendix II. In addition, we interviewed officials  from the Arizona State Retirement System and Missouri Local Government  Employees\u2019 Retirement System to discuss the recent decision of these  plans to invest in private equity.", "The plans we interviewed were selected based on several criteria. We  attempted to select plans that varied in the size of allocations to hedge  funds and private equity as a share of total plan assets. We also attempted  to select plans with a range of total plan assets, as outlined in table 6. We  identified these plans using data from the Pensions & Investments 2006  survey and through our interviews with industry experts.", "To identify and analyze the regulation of public DB pension investments  by states we consulted officials at the Department of Labor and  representatives of relevant agencies in selected states, and reviewed  relevant policy documents. The states we selected included the 10 states  with the largest public pension assets according to our review of the  National Association of State Retirement Administrators (NASRA) Public  Funds Survey data listed in table 7. We also included Massachusetts  because our previous contact with that state produced valuable  information for this objective. Those states chosen based on the size of  plan assets were: California, New York, Texas, Ohio, Florida, Illinois,  Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and North Carolina.
