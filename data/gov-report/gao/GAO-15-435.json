This report discusses (1) the governance changes and their implementation; (2) FHLBank boards' diversity; (3) FHLBank and FHFA efforts to improve diversity; and (4) community lending programs and boards' oversight of them. GAO analyzed FHLBank data and reviewed bylaws, policies, board meeting minutes, and regulations. GAO also reviewed previous work on diversity in the financial services industry, as well as literature on governance and diversity, and surveyed all 189 FHLBank directors serving in 2014 (with a 94 percent response rate).

Among other things, HERA required that independent directors on the FHLBank boards be elected by member institutions (for example, commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, and insurance companies) rather than appointed by the regulator. HERA also added certain skill requirements, removed compensation caps, and created a new regulator for the system, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). FHFA fully implemented the governance changes through two rules in 2009 and 2010. Board directors, FHLBank representatives, and others generally view HERA's governance changes as positive because the changes give FHLBank boards' greater control over nominees and help ensure that candidates have specific skills and experience.", "Women and minority representation on FHLBank boards is limited (see figure). A woman chaired 1 of 12 FHLBank boards in 2014, but no racial or ethnic minorities did. Most women and racial or ethnic minorities were independent directors rather than member directors. Directors' skill sets were more diverse. For example, member directors responding to GAO's survey were more likely than independent directors to report having skills in accounting and banking. Independent directors were more likely to report having skills in project development, community and economic development, and affordable housing.", "Women and Minority Representation on Federal Home Loan Bank Boards, 2014", "FHLBanks and FHFA have taken steps to increase board diversity. Since HERA's enactment, FHLBanks and their boards have developed processes to identify and nominate independent directors. GAO found that these processes generally followed several commonly cited practices for improving diversity, such as diversifying the applicant pools for directors. A 2009 FHFA rule encourages FHLBanks to consider diversity when selecting candidates, and a 2015 rule requires the FHLBanks to report information on board diversity in their annual reports. FHFA plans to begin evaluating board data and other information on outreach activities related to board diversity.", "Community lending varies across the FHLBanks. For example, 6 of the 12 FHLBanks offer unique community lending programs in addition to the system-wide programs. Under the Community Investment Program, which provides funds for housing and economic development, 4 of the 12 FHLBanks used the funds for economic development in 2014. FHLBanks have committees that are responsible for overseeing these activities, and, according to GAO survey results, directors serving on these committees have greater responsibility for overseeing community lending programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2014, over 7,300 financial institutions were members of the Federal  Home Loan Bank System (FHLBank System) and had approximately  $570 billion in loans, known as advances, outstanding. The System\u2019s  mission is to serve as a reliable source of liquidity for members (financial  institutions such as commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, and  insurance companies) in support of housing finance and community  lending. To carry out its mission, the FHLBank System issues debt in  capital markets, generally at relatively favorable rates due to its status as  a government-sponsored enterprise, and each FHLBank makes loans  known as advances to its member financial institutions. The Housing and  Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008 elevated the importance of  diversity at the FHLBanks in an effort to promote a diverse workforce.  HERA required that each FHLBank create an Office of Minority and  Women Inclusion or designate an office of the FHLBank to perform those  duties. Although this requirement mainly focused on improving diversity of  the FHLBanks\u2019 workforces and among its vendors, corporate governance  organizations and others have highlighted the importance of achieving a  diverse boardroom that can leverage different perspectives and  backgrounds in order to strengthen corporate governance. As the U.S.  workforce has become increasingly diverse, many private and public  sector organizations have recognized the importance of recruiting and  retaining minority and women candidates for key positions. However,  diversity in key management-level positions in the financial services  industry and in boardrooms continues to raise questions.

For the purposes of  this report, the concept of diversity includes representation by gender,  race, ethnicity, and can encompass differences in backgrounds, skill sets,  and experience.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, including  information about FHLBank governance in the Federal Home Loan Bank  Act (Bank Act); the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA); the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; HERA;  and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  (Dodd-Frank Act). Additionally, we reviewed FHFA\u2019s regulations,  including final rules on director eligibility, elections, and compensation,  and interviewed FHFA officials to determine the extent to which HERA\u2019s  changes to governance had been implemented. Because demographic  information was not publicly available for FHLBank board directors, we  requested information from the FHLBanks. Specifically, we sent a request  to each FHLBank to collect data on the number of men, women, racial or  ethnic minorities, non-racial or nonethnic minorities, and the total number  of board directors who served during 2014. The responses we received  from the FHLBanks were generally based on observation.

We  selected these FHLBanks using several criteria, including asset size,  number of member institutions, information about female and minority  representation on boards (as available), amount of community and  economic development lending activity, and location. For each of the six  FHLBanks, we held group interviews with bank management and staff  and representatives from the FHLBanks\u2019 advisory councils, which provide  advice to the FHLBank boards on affordable housing and community  lending.

We compared FHLBanks\u2019 and FHFA\u2019s diversity  practices against some commonly cited practices for increasing board  diversity. To identify commonly cited practices to improve board diversity,  we performed a literature review of corporate governance and diversity  studies and reviewed our previous work on diversity in the financial  industry and on Federal Reserve Bank boards. We also reviewed studies  and interviewed representatives from corporate governance organizations  and academic researchers, including Catalyst, The Conference Board,  the National Association of Corporate Directors, Stanford University\u2019s  Rock Center for Corporate Governance, and Harvard Business School.  We selected those practices that were most applicable to FHLBanks and  FHFA.", "We reviewed available information and FHFA data on affordable housing  and community and economic development programs.

One board director commented that the required skills help the  nominating committees to search more broadly for good individuals.  Another commented that HERA\u2019s skill requirements are broad enough to  enable the boards to build varied skill sets to match emerging challenges,  for instance, to nominate attorneys who understand SEC regulations\u2014a  skill that many member directors may not have.", "Representatives from all six FHLBanks we interviewed said that removing  compensation caps was a positive change, mainly because the  FHLBanks could now make compensation commensurate with the time  commitment required of board directors. Before HERA, compensation  varied by position on the board (chair, vice chair, all other directors) but  was capped across all 12 FHLBanks (see table 3). According to our  analysis of FHFA data, the annual compensation for board directors  across the 12 FHLBanks has increased significantly since HERA. For  example, in 2013 the average chair, vice chair, and director  compensation amounts were roughly three times the pre-HERA amounts.", "FHLBank representatives noted that compensation was now more  competitive with compensation on private sector boards and would help  attract and retain qualified individuals.

They  said that this learning curve was especially steep during the directors\u2019 first  1 or 2 years and that the additional time allowed directors to gain more in- depth knowledge about FHLBank operations. Our board director survey  results showed that the majority of board directors who provided  comments (87 percent) supported the longer term length. For example,  in response to our request for their thoughts on the change, several board  directors noted that because of the level of complexity associated with  FHLBanks, longer term lengths helped with continuity of experience on  the board. Additionally, as part of their survey responses about thoughts  on the expanded term length, a few directors pointed out that many  individuals were familiar with publicly traded companies but that the  FHLBanks\u2019 cooperative structure was a unique business model.

Accordingly, we found that almost all member directors reported working  in the banking and finance industry, and that they primarily held executive  management positions. Our survey found independent directors reported  greater industry sector representation and different types of occupations.  For example, roughly a quarter of independent directors reported working  in industries other than banking and finance, including industries such as  community and economic development, affordable housing, state and  local government, and real estate.

For example, only a few directorships are  open for election each year because director turnover is limited. FHFA  determines the size of each FHLBank\u2019s board (in consultation with the  bank), and FHFA officials told us that they had been seeking to limit the  number of directors on each board to prevent the boards from becoming  too large. Consequently, board size has decreased for some FHLBanks,  resulting in fewer open seats for new independent directors who may  bring diverse perspectives. Further, HERA mandates that directors serve  4-year terms. By statute, directors continued after HERA to be permitted  to serve up to three consecutive terms, which after the HERA extension,  resulted in total term lengths of 12 years for some directors. Given the 12- year term lengths, opportunities for new directors to join the boards are  limited. Additionally, because directors can serve three consecutive full  terms, many boards nominate incumbent independent directors for  reelection, and these nominees may run unopposed. FHFA officials cited  these challenges and acknowledged that the low turnover and term  lengths, in particular, meant that increasing diversity would take time.", "Other statutory requirements may also hinder efforts to change the  composition of FHLBank boards. As previously discussed, HERA defines  the composition of the board. At least a majority of the board must be  member directors, with not fewer than two-fifths independent directors (40  percent). While the FHLBank boards nominate independent directors,  member directors are nominated by the member institutions within the  FHLBank district, limiting the boards\u2019 role in selecting these directors.  FHFA told us that the agency was aware of the potential difficulty of  identifying diverse candidates for member directors and noted that  increased board diversity would likely come from independent directors.  Further, geographic requirements also affect the selection of board  directors. For example, statute requires at least one member director per  state. Additionally, statute requires that member directors be officers or  directors of a member institution located in the district in which the  FHLBank is located and that independent directors be residents of the  district.", "Additionally, boards must balance efforts to increase racial or ethnic and  gender diversity with other qualities, such as HERA skill requirements,  SEC expertise, and other needs of the boards. For example, board  directors from the Atlanta and Des Moines FHLBank boards stated that  their boards had been seeking individuals with risk management  expertise in an effort to satisfy HERA requirements. Further, FHLBank  management and SEC officials noted the importance of finding  candidates with SEC expertise, because the FHLBanks are SEC  registrants. SEC officials explained that the process of registering with  SEC caused the FHLBanks to improve their accounting and  organizational systems and added that board directors assumed personal  liability risk for the FHLBanks. In terms of other board needs, three board  directors from the Pittsburgh FHLBank board told us that their board was  specifically looking for candidates with insurance expertise. This need to  balance traditional gender and racial or ethnic diversity with required skills  and other board needs has limited efforts to increase women and minority  representation on boards. FHFA officials noted the overall lack of diversity  in the financial services sector, including at FHLBank member institutions,  as increasing the challenges facing efforts to improve board diversity. The  representation of women and racial or ethnic minorities on financial  services companies\u2019 boards was limited as well. For example, according  to The Conference Board\u2019s 2013 survey of financial services companies\u2019  boards, roughly 14 percent of board directors were women and fewer  than 10 percent were racial or ethnic minorities.

We  selected practices from our prior work and from those cited by  representatives of corporate governance organizations and academic  researchers that we determined were most applicable to FHLBank  boards. As described later, these practices include making diversity a  priority, conducting a skills and needs assessment, targeting diverse  candidates, seeking new ways to find candidates, and disclosing diversity  practices. Our review of all 12 FHLBanks\u2019 bylaws, policies and  procedures, SEC filings, board meeting minutes, and interviews with  FHLBank representatives at 6 FHLBanks showed that boards consider  diversity in a variety of ways that correspond to these practices.

For  example, the FHLBank of Boston\u2019s bylaws state that when making  nominations, the board may consider factors including any experience on  the board, qualifications, skills, and experience that could strengthen the  board, and diversity. The FHLBank of Dallas reported that the board  considers diversity important to a well-rounded board of directors able to  meet its fiduciary responsibilities to the bank\u2019s members and staff.

Our review found all 12 FHLBank boards  used a skills matrix either annually or on an as-needed basis\u2014for  example, to help identify the types of independent candidates to consider.  Additionally, several board directors noted that their board\u2019s use of a skill  matrix or needs assessment helped in identifying desired skills and  experiences for potential nominees, including those required for  independent directors under HERA, and additional experiences such as  in the insurance or information technology industries. Board directors  from the FHLBanks of Atlanta and Pittsburgh told us they included  diversity as part of their matrix (in addition to skills). Several corporate  governance and diversity organizations have cited a skills matrix as a tool  that boards can use to facilitate assessments of board needs in terms of  skills and diversity.", "Targeting diverse candidates: In our review of FHLBank board minutes  and interviews with board directors, we found that some FHLBank boards  explicitly discussed targeted efforts to add women or minority candidates  to their boards. For example, the chair of the board of the FHLBank of  Des Moines discussed finding a Native American director candidate  because the FHLBank district had a significant Native American  population. In our review of FHLBank board meeting minutes, we found  that several boards had discussed the need to consider women and  minority representation in the nomination process and had referenced  presentations by FHFA OMWI staff or FHFA\u2019s rule as it was proposed in  June 2014 as among their reasons for doing so. Representatives from  corporate governance organizations and academic researchers cited the  practice of setting broad targets or goals for increasing the number of  women and minority directors on boards as one way boards could  increase diversity and ensure that they were taking steps to consider a  diverse array of candidates.", "Seeking new ways to find candidates: The FHLBanks have taken  several steps to diversify their applicant pools for directors. Nine of the 12  FHLBanks post information about their board director nomination and  election processes on their websites. The FHLBank of Boston specifically  encourages women and minority candidates to apply. Additionally, 7  FHLBanks reported that they sometimes consulted with outside groups to  help solicit nominees, including organizations representing affordable  housing, economic development, and consumer or community interests.  The FHLBank of Topeka reported using a search firm, and the FHLBank  of Seattle reported using director databases to identify independent  director candidates for nomination. The FHLBank of Pittsburgh conducted  outreach with organizations such as Executive Women International and  Hispanic and African American Chambers of Commerce to seek out  diverse applicants. Further, directors from the FHLBank boards of Dallas  and Seattle reported using social media platforms to help attract  candidates.

Also, as  noted earlier, the FHLBanks consult with their advisory councils about  potential nominees for independent directors. Board directors from 4 of  the 6 FHLBanks we met with told us that advisory council members  themselves had been nominated and subsequently elected to their  boards. Board directors from three FHLBanks we interviewed told us that  their advisory councils also provided them with information about potential  candidates. For example, staff from the FHLBank of Atlanta told us that  their board relied heavily on the advisory council to identify qualified,  diverse candidates for independent director positions. These activities are  in line with practices cited by representatives from corporate governance  organizations and academic researchers, which reported that increasing  board diversity could require current directors to reach out beyond the  typical pool of applicants or their own personal networks to find qualified  women and minority candidates. They cited several steps boards could  take to find these candidates, such as partnering with outside  organizations, using search firms to identify a broader pool of candidates,  and creating nominating committees to focus on the selection of  candidates.", "Disclosing diversity practices: Some FHLBanks disclose the board\u2019s  diversity policies and the way they consider diversity in nominating and  selecting directors. We found that the boards of three FHLBanks (Atlanta,  New York, and Seattle) had adopted public statements on board diversity  and inclusion that they published on their websites. The statements noted  that the FHLBanks encouraged the consideration of diversity (including  gender, minority status, and disability classifications) in soliciting and  nominating director candidates. In its 2014 public election announcement,  the FHLBank of San Francisco\u2019s board stated it would consider, among  other things, the overall composition of the board, the diverse  communities of the FHLBank\u2019s district, and other factors it believes would  contribute to a diverse, balanced, and effective board. In addition, 3 of the  12 FHLBanks stated in their annual SEC 10-K filings that their boards   One of these  considered diversity in nominating independent directors. FHLBanks, the FHLBank of Pittsburgh, noted that board directors should  also consider diversity when nominating candidates for member director  positions. These factors could be seen as additional attributes that  enhanced traditional qualifications for board directors, according to the  financial statements. Some representatives from corporate governance  organizations and academic researchers have said that the disclosure of  companies\u2019 diversity policies and the way they consider diversity in  nominating and selecting directors could increase the representation of  women and minorities on boards, particularly if they were required to do  so by a regulator or an exchange.", "In 2009, SEC issued a rule requiring public companies to disclose whether, and if so  how, they consider diversity when nominating candidates for director.

In the 2010 rule, FHFA stated that  FHLBanks\u2019 policies and procedures should encourage the consideration  of diversity. FHFA created an OMWI in January 2011 to promote  diversity and the inclusion of women and minorities in all FHLBank  activities, including the promotion of diversity on FHLBank boards.

The final rule states that current FHFA regulations require  FHLBanks to implement policies that encourage the consideration of  diversity in the nomination or selection of nominees for board directors.  The rule states the FHLBanks are required to report on board diversity  data and outreach efforts in their annual reports to OMWI, beginning  September 30, 2015. FHFA officials also told us that although  FHLBanks could interpret diversity broadly and might seek other types of  diversity on their boards, the OMWI focuses on the representation of  women and minorities, and OMWI expected FHLBanks to have diversity  outreach programs that targeted these two groups.

For example, our 2011 report  on governance practices at the Federal Reserve Banks found that each  bank submitted demographic information that directors provided  voluntarily. Moreover in our April 2013 report on OMWIs, we found that  not all OMWIs were reporting on the outcomes of their diversity practices.  As a result, we recommended that the federal financial regulators collect  data and report on measurement outcomes as part of their reports to  Congress in order to enhance their own diversity initiatives.

FHLBank  representatives and five survey respondents commented that both the  CIP and CICA program had outdated eligibility criteria and regulatory  requirements\u2014for example, they said that statutory limits on eligible  incomes impacted the volume of applicants. Thirty-eight percent of  respondents noted that statutory limitations affected community  lending. However, 33 percent of respondents did not view statutory  limitations as a limiting factor, and 29 percent of respondents were not  sure if statutory limitations were a limiting factor.", "Funding and the availability of developers: Two frequently  mentioned factors affecting community lending were the availability of  funds to meet the number of requests from member institutions and  the availability of developers and other lenders. Our survey results  showed that 47 percent of respondents thought the availability of  funds to meet the number of requests from members was a limitation.  In addition, 43 percent of respondents stated that the availability of  developers and other lenders to fund community and economic  development activities limited this type of lending. Seven survey  respondents commented that there were a limited number of  developers as a result of the economic downturn.", "FHLBanks\u2019 collateral requirements: According to 41 percent of  respondents to our survey of board directors, collateral requirements  were a limitation on community lending activities.

We  recently reported on issues affecting nondepository CDFIs\u2019 ability to  become members of the FHLBank System and found that collateral  requirements could prevent many of these institutions from becoming  members. CDFIs\u2019 primary mission is to provide capital and  development services to economically distressed communities  underserved by conventional financial institutions. FHLBank  representatives and board directors we spoke with from all six  FHLBanks generally said that they had discussed expanding the pool  of eligible collateral in response to industry needs but that it was  important to closely monitor any associated risks. They also told us  that the FHLBanks were focused on valuing collateral appropriately  and taking the needs of their members into consideration.", "Financial position of the FHLBanks: According to our survey of  2014 board directors, 23 percent of respondents indicated that the  financial position of their FHLBank affected community lending.  Representatives from two of the six FHLBanks (Des Moines and  Dallas) we spoke with told us that demand for advances had dropped  in recent years because their members had seen an increase in  deposits, further limiting their ability to expand their support of  community lending. Total outstanding advances across the FHLBank  System in 2014 represented an 11 percent decline from their 2009  levels.

This exception expired at the end of 2010. While this  exception was not widely used across the FHLBank System, some  FHLBanks found it to be successful in increasing community lending.  For example, the FHLBank of Atlanta used the exception to restore a  hotel and revitalize a hospital in its district.

To help ensure that we collected  a range of perspectives, we selected these locations based on several  criteria, including asset size, number of member institutions, female and  minority representation on boards, community and economic  development lending activity, and location. We conducted these  interviews to learn more about board governance and diversity practices  and how the board and bank management oversee FHLBank policies and  programs. We generally conducted in-person interviews with officials at  four of the six FHLBanks except in specific cases where we could not  schedule in-person interviews and held teleconferences for the two  remaining FHLBanks. For each of the six locations, we held group  interviews with FHLBank management and community investment staff  and a separate group interview with representatives from the FHLBanks\u2019  advisory councils. The interviews with FHLBank management and staff  were conducted jointly. Generally, the number of representatives from  FHLBank management and staff differed by FHLBank because we  allowed the FHLBanks to determine who should be present based on the  questions we sent in advance, but in all cases the FHLBank\u2019s corporate  secretary participated. For our interviews with advisory councils, we  generally interviewed the chair and vice-chair of the advisory council in  addition to other advisory council representatives.

We presented at the Council of FHLBanks\u2019  September 2014 meeting to encourage board directors to participate in  the survey. As a final step, we contacted the corporate secretaries at  each of the FHLBanks and asked for their preference on whether we  should send a final reminder e-mail or conduct telephone calls to all  nonrespondents. Based on their preferences, we made phone calls to  some of the nonrespondents and sent the remaining nonrespondents a  fourth and final e-mail reminder about the survey. Because this survey  was not a sample survey, it has no sampling errors. The practical  difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce nonsampling errors,  such as difficulties interpreting a particular question that can introduce  unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps to minimize  nonsampling errors by pretesting the survey questions in person and by  teleconference with five board directors (including three board chairs)  from five different FHLBanks.
