Questions have been raised about whether this formula is outdated, allocates funds equitably, and adequately accounts for state agencies' performance. GAO was asked to: (1) examine the extent to which the current formula meets generally accepted equity standards, (2) present options for revising the formula, and (3) identify issues to consider with incorporating performance incentives into the formula. To address these objectives, GAO relied upon two equity standards commonly used to design and evaluate funding formulas: beneficiary equity, which stipulates that funds should be distributed so that each state can provide the same level of services to each person in need; and taxpayer equity, which stipulates that states should contribute about the same proportion of their resources to a given program.

The formula does not account for differences among states in the proportion of people with a disability or the costs of providing services. As a result, the amount of services that states can purchase per person with a disability varies, from $83 to $277 (see figure). In addition, the formula uses only per capita income to measure a state's ability to contribute to the program, excluding other taxable resources. GAO presents three options for revising the formula to illustrate a range of possibilities: the first distributes funds based on states' disability populations, the second also accounts for costs of providing services, and the third further accounts for state resources beyond per capita income. Because any formula change would redistribute funds among states, potentially disrupting services to individuals, GAO also presents options for establishing a transition period. Including performance incentives in the funding formula has potential for improving performance but can also pose challenges. These include: effectively balancing the VR program's multiple goals, rewarding agencies for meeting individuals' specific needs, and basing awards on an agency's performance rather than influences outside its control. GAO identified ways to mitigate these risks, such as using multiple performance measures to address different goals, and adjusting the performance level required for an agency to receive an incentive award. However, these approaches would still require careful consideration of several issues, such as how to account for clients' varying disability levels and needs and provide appropriate incentives for achieving desired outcomes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies, under the auspices of the  Department of Education (Education), play a crucial role in helping  individuals with disabilities prepare for and obtain employment. In fiscal  year 2008, Education distributed over $2.8 billion in grants to state VR  agencies, using a funding formula that was last updated in 1978.

States must match their federal grant  allocations by contributing about $1 to their VR programs for each $4 they  receive.  ce. As  There are two standards concerning the concept of equity that have  commonly been used to design and evaluate funding formulas. The first\u2014 known as beneficiary equity\u2014stipulates that funds should be distributed  to states according to the needs of their respective populations so that  each state, with their federal allocation, can provide the same level of  services to each person in need. The second standard\u2014known as taxpayer  equity\u2014applies to programs, such as VR, in which states contribute funds.  This standard also seeks to provide individuals in need with the same level  of services, but in addition, considers a state\u2019s ability to finance a program  from its own resources. It stipulates that states should be able to provide  comparable services to individuals, with each state contributing about the  same proportion of their resources to the program. To achieve this  standard, taxpayer equity formulas may allocate more funds to states with  fewer taxable resources, set the contribution they are required to make at  a lower level, or do both, so that poorer states do not contribute a larger  share of their resources than wealthier states. To meet the taxpayer equity  standard, a formula requires a reliable measure of a state\u2019s ability to  finance a program from its own resources. To meet both equity standards,  a formula should use reliable and appropriate measures of the need  population in each state and the cost of providing services in each state.", "In this context, you asked us to (1) examine the extent to which the  current formula meets generally accepted equity standards, (2) present  options for revising the formula to better meet these standards, and (3)  identify issues to consider with incorporating performance incentives into  the formula.", "To determine the extent to which the VR funding formula meets equity  standards and to develop options for revising the formula, we examined  data from a number of sources, namely Education\u2019s data on state VR  grants, Census Bureau data on state disability populations, Department of  the Treasury (Treasury) data on state taxable resources, Bureau of Labor  Statistics (BLS) data on wages, and Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) data on rents. In addition, we interviewed experts in  the disability field and had key portions of our analyses formally reviewed  by three disability experts. We also surveyed all 80 VR agencies in the  states, territories, and District of Columbia to obtain their perspectives on  the current formula, options for changing it, and views on the use of  performance incentives in the VR program. We received responses from  74 (93 percent) of the agencies. We also conducted in-depth interviews  with state VR officials at 11 agencies in 9 states, as well as with members  of advisory councils to the VR agencies in 5 of these states. To further  consider potential benefits and challenges of using performance incentives  in the VR funding formula, we reviewed academic literature on the subject  and spoke with officials in three federal programs that currently provide  incentive awards. We conducted this performance audit from September  2008 to September 2009, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. See  appendix I for a detailed discussion of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Rehabilitation Act, as amended, sets out a formula for distributing VR  grants to states and territories. Through this formula, a portion of the  funds appropriated for the VR program are distributed to states based  upon the grant allotment they received for fiscal year 1978. States\u2019 1978  allotments served to ensure that no state experienced a funding decrease  when the formula was revised through a 1978 amendment to the  Rehabilitation Act. Of the remainder of the funds, one-half is distributed  based upon states\u2019 general population and a factor that compares their per  capita income to the national per capita income, and the other one-half,  according to their population and the square of the per capita income  factor. The larger a state\u2019s population, the more funds it will receive.  Conversely, the higher a state\u2019s per capita income compared to the  national level, the lower its allotment will be. The squaring of per capita  income increases its influence on a state\u2019s allotment. However, the  formula mitigates the effect of per capita income for states with very high  or very low per capita income levels by setting upper and lower limits.   Ultimately, the final allotment for a state cannot be less than 1/3 of 1  percent of the total amount appropriated, or $3 million dollars, whichever  is greater. In fiscal year 2008, the minimum allotment was $9.5 million,  and 6 states were allotted this amount. See appendix II for further  information on the funding formula.", "The Act requires states to share in funding the costs of the VR program.  Specifically, the Act sets the federal share for the funding of a state\u2019s VR  program at 78.7 percent. As a result, in order to receive their full federal  allotment, each state must contribute at least 21.3 percent of the funds for  their VR programs. In cases where states do not meet this matching  requirement, the unmatched federal funds are redistributed to other states  near the end of the fiscal year. The Act also calls for annual funding  increases to the VR program, overall, to be minimally pegged to the  increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).  However, funding changes for an individual state may differ from the  change to the CPI-U in any given year because state allocations are,  ultimately, determined by the funding formula. In redistributing the funds,  Education currently gives priority to those states that did not receive an  inflation-adjusted increase over their prior year\u2019s allotment.", "Under the VR program, state VR agencies are to provide vocational  rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities\u2014consistent with  the individual\u2019s strengths, resources, priorities, abilities, interests, and  informed choice\u2014so that they may prepare for and engage in gainful  employment. To do so, state agencies provide a variety of services to  individuals such as job placement assistance, medical treatment,  postsecondary education, occupational training, and assistive  technologies. Individuals may be eligible for VR services if they have a  physical or mental impairment that constitutes or results in a substantial  impediment to employment, and if they need VR services to prepare for,  secure, retain, or regain employment. According to the Rehabilitation Act,  if state VR agencies determine that they will not have enough funding to  serve all eligible individuals who apply for services, they may state the  order in which they will select individuals for services. Agencies using  such an \u201corder of selection\u201d process must develop criteria for ensuring  that individuals with the most significant disabilities will be selected first  for services.", "The current VR funding formula does not include factors for rewarding  agency performance; however, pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act,  Education evaluates state VR agencies\u2019 performance using a set of  performance indicators. These indicators are designed to assess how  well the agencies are helping individuals obtain, maintain, or regain high- quality employment and, also, how well they are ensuring that individuals  from minority backgrounds have equal access to VR services. The  Rehabilitation Act gives Education the authority to reduce or suspend  payments to a state agency whose performance falls below a certain level  and fails to enter into a program improvement plan or to substantially  comply with the terms and conditions of such a plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Current Formula Falls Short of Meeting Equity Standards for Beneficiaries and Taxpayers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Formula Does Not Account for Varying Disability Rates and Service Costs", "paragraphs": ["The VR funding formula does not achieve equity for beneficiaries\u2014the  individuals likely to be served by the VR program\u2014for two reasons. First,  it does not recognize differences among states in the size of their  populations potentially needing VR services. Second, it does not account  for state differences in the costs of providing those services.", "By targeting funds based on a state\u2019s general population, the formula  assumes that the proportion of people needing services is largely the same  from state to state. In fact, as shown in figure 1, the proportion of the  general population that is working-aged and has a disability varies across  states, from 5.6 percent (in New Jersey) to 12.8 percent (in West Virginia)  in 2007. See appendix III for information on disability rates in each state.  In effect, the formula treats alike any two states with similar population  sizes, irrespective of the size of their working-aged disability population.  For example, New Mexico has a slightly greater population than West  Virginia (2.0 million and 1.8 million, respectively), and, therefore, would  receive more funding under the current formula (all other things being  equal) than West Virginia. However, working-aged people with disabilities  comprise nearly 13 percent of West Virginia\u2019s population, compared to 8.7  percent in New Mexico. By not factoring in state disability populations, the  formula does not account for West Virginia having over 60,000 more  working-aged people with disabilities than New Mexico.", "Education officials and one expert we spoke with speculated that the  formula\u2019s use of per capita income might serve to target funds to states  with higher rates of disability since people with disabilities have, on  average, lower incomes. We found some correlation between states\u2019  disability rates and their per capita income. As such, per capita income  is, at best, an imprecise measure of states\u2019 disability rates.", "The funding formula also fails to account for differences among states in  the cost of providing VR services. Focusing on average wages and rents in  each state, we estimated that the cost is 13 percent below the national  average in Idaho, for example, while it is 13 percent above average in  Massachusetts. This means that Massachusetts would need to pay $1.13  for the same set of services that Idaho could purchase for $0.87. By not  taking into account cost differences, VR allocations purchase fewer  services in states that have higher costs. See appendix IV for a table of our  estimates of state cost differences. Also, see appendix I for information on  how we estimated state service costs.", "Not accounting for state differences in both disability populations and cost  of services results in a substantial variation in the amount of services that  states are able to purchase per person with a disability, from a low of $83  in Connecticut, to a high of over three times as much\u2014$277 in North  Dakota. Figure 2 shows estimated state VR allotments, per working-aged  person with a disability, based on fiscal year 2008 funding, adjusted for  differences in costs of wages and rents between states.

Per capita income is based on the  personal income in a state, including income received by state residents in  the form of wages, rents, and interest income. However, using only this  measure excludes certain categories of corporate income that are not  received as income by state residents. For example, the formula does not  factor in corporate income that is retained by corporations for investment  purposes, which could theoretically be subject to state taxation through  corporate income taxes. The formula also excludes business income  received by out-of-state residents, such as dividends, that are potentially  taxable by the state. Although states may differ in their decisions about  whether to tax these resources, the measure used in a funding formula to  compare states\u2019 ability to finance a program should capture all possible  revenue resources and should not be affected by an individual state\u2019s fiscal  decisions. Treasury\u2019s Total Taxable Resources provides more  comprehensive data on the amount of resources that are potentially  taxable in each state. Comparing states\u2019 per capita income with their total  taxable resources shows that, for most states, the two measures are  similar. However, the formula\u2019s use of per capita income particularly  understates the taxable resources in certain states and overstates it in  others (see figure 3). For example, the ratio of per capita income to total  taxable resources per capita is 0.80 in Alaska, which suggests that the use  of per capita income in the formula understates Alaska\u2019s taxable resources  by 20 percent. The formula\u2019s use of per capita income especially  understates the taxable resources in energy-exporting states, such as  Alaska and Wyoming, and in states with numerous corporate  headquarters, such as Delaware. The lack of precision in using per capita  income is accentuated by the squaring of the per capita income factor in  the formula.

However, most disability experts we spoke with considered this provision  outdated and no longer an appropriate factor for distributing VR funds.

Further, in interviews  state VR officials indicated that factors other than allotment levels could  also influence a state\u2019s decision to be under an order of selection, such as  the level of state resources provided to the VR program, the effectiveness  of the agency\u2019s management of program costs, and the agency\u2019s decisions  about how to use existing funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Greater Equity in VR Funding Could Be Accomplished in Several Ways", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Options for Introducing Greater Equity for Taxpayers or Beneficiaries", "paragraphs": ["There are a number of ways to redesign the VR funding formula to achieve  greater equity for beneficiaries, taxpayers, or to balance equity for both.

To  measure the need population, this option would use data on the states\u2019  civilian working-aged disability populations from the Census Bureau\u2019s  ACS.", "A full beneficiary equity formula: This option also allocates funds based  on states\u2019 working-aged disability populations using Census data, but also  includes estimates of the cost of providing VR services in each state. These  cost estimates reflect differences among states with respect to two basic  costs (i.e., wages and rents), which underlay the provision of many VR  services. We developed estimates of state costs using data on wages from  BLS and on rents from HUD. This option does not reflect differences in  other types of basic costs for which reliable data may not be readily  available. See appendix I for further information on the development of  our cost estimates.", "A taxpayer equity formula: This option also distributes funds based on  states\u2019 working-aged disability populations and the cost of providing VR  services, but it adds a third factor to the formula\u2014a measure of each  state\u2019s ability to contribute to the VR program. More funds would be  allocated to states with fewer taxable resources. To measure a state\u2019s  ability to finance the VR program, we utilized data from Treasury on a  state\u2019s total taxable resources, which includes per capita income as well as  other sources of potentially taxable state income, such as corporate  income produced within the state but not received by state residents.", "For the taxpayer equity option, an issue to consider is whether the  matching requirement would be the same across all states, as is the case  with the current formula, or would vary based upon a state\u2019s ability to  finance the VR program. To fully achieve taxpayer equity, the matching  requirement would need to vary according to each state\u2019s financing ability.  If the matching requirement were the same for all states, those with fewer  resources would receive more federal funds but would also need to  provide more state funds for the match. This could result in poorer states  having to contribute a greater share of their resources to the VR program  than wealthier states. See appendix VII for an explanation of how a  variable matching requirement could be incorporated into the taxpayer  equity option.", "Table 1 shows the amount of funds redistributed among states, as well as  the number of states gaining and losing funds, for each of the three  formula options. For example, each of our three prototypes would  redistribute approximately 4 to 6 percent of the VR funds, with about 20  states receiving more funds and at least 20 states receiving less in funds  than they do under the current formula. Between 5 and 11 states would  experience a change in funding levels of 20 percent or more. See appendix  VIII for a state-by-state table of allocations under our three formula  options.", "In our survey of state VR agencies, many respondents expressed  reservations about options for revising the current funding formula. Our  survey presented state agencies with three general approaches to revising  the formula, roughly based on our three formula options. Most  respondents expressed reservations about options that were generally  based on partial beneficiary and taxpayer equity, and they were divided on  the option generally based on full beneficiary equity. Specifically, 45  percent of respondents expressed support for an approach that would  distribute funds so that all states would receive funding to be able to  provide the same level of services to each individual potentially eligible for  VR services, taking into account certain differences in the cost of  providing services, while 47 percent expressed disapproval of this  approach, and the remainder expressed no opinion or preference."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options for Phasing In Changes to Minimize Disruption to State Programs", "paragraphs": ["When a new federal formula is implemented, Congress often provides a  transition period so that grant recipients have time to adjust, especially  those recipients whose grants will be reduced. An abrupt reduction in  funding level could disrupt a state agency\u2019s ability to provide VR services.  Transition periods allow for greater predictability and stability in state  funding levels, which in turn, help avoid major disruptions to existing state  services and allow states to develop long-range plans and program  commitments.", "One way to ease the change to a new formula is to phase it in gradually  over a number of years. During the phase-in period, the state allocations  would be a combination of the old and new formulas, with a gradual  increase in the portion of funding distributed through the new formula,  until the phase-in period is complete. By way of example, figure 4 depicts a  5-year transition period, under which the amount of money allocated  under the old formula would be reduced by 20 percent each year, and the  amount allocated under the new formula would be increased by 20 percent  each year, until all of the allocations are made using the new formula. To  further minimize the disruptive effects of a new formula, the phase-in  period could be longer, although this would, of course, postpone full use  of the new formula.", "Another approach to minimize disruption to state VR programs is to  establish a hold harmless provision that limits the amount of funding that  states could lose under a new formula. One example of this approach  would be to hold states entirely harmless in the first year that the new  formula is implemented, but would allow minimal decreases during the  second and successive years, such as by 1 or 2 percent. Because state  agencies could also have difficulties adjusting to large and sudden funding  increases, limits could also be set on the increases that states would  receive from one year to the next. This graduated approach would allow  agencies to better plan for the additional funds and manage growth in their  VR programs. It should be noted that use of a hold harmless provision  would effectively reduce the amount of funds available for distribution  through the new formula in the early years of a change because most of  the funds would be allocated through the hold harmless provision.  However, over time, as the total amount of funds appropriated for the VR  program increases, more of the funds would be allocated through the new  formula."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Incorporating Financial Performance Incentives in the VR Formula Poses Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Some research and experiences suggest that providing financial incentive  awards based on program performance has the potential to improve  government programs, and a slight majority of VR agencies surveyed are  open to using them in the VR program. Some federal programs currently  provide incentive awards and officials we spoke with from three of these  programs noted some benefits, such as motivating state and local agencies  to improve performance. Of the state VR agency officials who responded  to our survey, 59 percent were open to including some form of incentive  awards in the VR program. Some state officials noted that doing so could  reward high performing agencies, improve VR client success, or motivate  agencies to focus on continuous improvement.", "Nevertheless, there are challenges to incorporating incentive awards into  the VR program, whether through its funding formula or outside it due, in  part, to the multiple and potentially competing facets of the VR program\u2019s  mission. According to the Rehabilitation Act, state VR programs should  help clients achieve employment by providing individualized services,  while also prioritizing service to those with the most significant disabilities  when agencies cannot provide services to all eligible applicants. VR  stakeholders we spoke with, including state agency officials, state  advisory council officials, representatives from private sector VR  companies, and disability researchers, identified three main challenges to  incorporating incentive awards into the VR program. To some extent,  these challenges are already present in the VR program\u2019s current  performance measurement system and could be accentuated by linking  program performance to incentive awards. These challenges are:    Challenge of balancing potentially competing program goals: Unless  carefully designed, a financial performance incentive system could run the  risk of encouraging state VR agencies to focus on achieving certain  program goals, at the expense of others. For example, 89 percent of state  VR officials who responded to our survey thought it likely that providing  state agencies with additional funds based on performance would result in  agencies focusing more heavily on clients who were expected to positively  impact agency performance. In interviews, many VR stakeholders  expressed particular concern that if incentive awards were focused on  achieving employment outcomes for clients, they could induce state  agencies to concentrate on serving those most likely to obtain  employment, at the expense of those with greater barriers, such as those  with the most significant disabilities. This would run counter to the VR  program requirement that state agencies serve individuals with the most  significant disabilities first when operating under an order of selection.  Similar concerns have arisen in other employment programs that have  used incentive awards. For example, we previously reported that local  agency officials in the Department of Labor\u2019s Workforce Investment Act  (WIA) Title IB programs may be reluctant to provide services to job  seekers less likely to find and maintain a job.", "Challenge of rewarding agencies for providing appropriate  individualized services to clients: The VR program provides both long- term services, such as supporting youth with disabilities as they transition  out of high school and pursue higher education, and short-term services,  such as identifying job opportunities for people who already have skills  and qualifications. Several VR stakeholders expressed concern that if  incentive awards did not take into account some clients\u2019 specialized needs  for higher-cost or longer-term services, they could cause agencies to focus  on providing short-term services. Officials from one state advisory council  cautioned that incentive awards might encourage VR counselors to focus  on providing short-term services, even if it resulted in low-paying jobs,  instead of placing VR clients in higher education programs that could  ultimately yield long-term, higher paying career positions.", "Challenge of basing incentive awards on an agency\u2019s performance,  without accounting for factors outside its control: A variety of factors  outside an agency\u2019s control may influence performance outcomes, such as  the state\u2019s economy and the characteristics and needs of the individuals  who seek rehabilitation services. If an agency\u2019s performance cannot be  distinguished from these factors, the provision or withholding of incentive  awards would not necessarily reflect agency actions. Of state VR agency  officials who responded to our survey, 77 percent stated that isolating an  agency\u2019s performance from factors outside its control would be a great or  very great challenge to appropriately distributing incentive awards. For  example, officials in one VR agency said that some parts of their state have  20 percent unemployment, which decreases their ability to place clients in  jobs. Another state agency official noted that his agency has had very  high employment outcomes, in part because the state had one of the  lowest unemployment rates in the country. He added that agencies in  other states whose economies are weak have had poorer employment  outcomes through no fault of their own. In addition, some state officials  suggested that agencies operating under an order of selection would be at  a competitive disadvantage compared to those that are not, because the  caseload of the former would include a greater proportion of clients with  the most significant disabilities and barriers to employment.", "Our research into the types of incentive awards used by other federal  programs, as well as the views of VR stakeholders, revealed several ways  to mitigate such challenges, but none are without potential pitfalls.  Specifically, research on designing incentive award systems suggests the  following options:    Using multiple measures of success: Using a range of performance  measures to determine incentive awards could help motivate state  agencies to focus attention on all aspects of the VR program\u2019s mission.   For example, the performance of state VR agencies might be measured in  terms of both the proportion of people with the most significant  disabilities who find employment, and the proportion of all clients who  achieve this outcome. Another option that could encourage agencies to  provide long-term services, when appropriate, is to establish intermediate  measures of client achievement or the services provided that have  increased a client\u2019s prospect for employment. Such an intermediate  measure could be the number of VR clients who successfully complete  training programs or college degrees. Nevertheless, there are challenges to  developing appropriate measures. For example, although Education  already uses a measure for the VR program focused on people with  significant disabilities, it may be difficult to develop a measure specifically  on people with the most significant disabilities because the Rehabilitation  Act allows states to individually define the term, and our past work found  that state agencies\u2019 definitions vary. Although Education uses multiple  measures to evaluate state VR agencies\u2019 performance, an issue to consider  is whether or not the current measures would be appropriate to use for  distributing incentive awards. Our prior work on the VR program found  that the current measures do not consider agencies\u2019 success in assisting  individuals who have not yet exited the program and do not specifically  track outcomes for youth transitioning out of high school. As a result, we  recommended that Education reevaluate its performance measures to  determine whether they reflect the agency\u2019s goals and values.", "Adjusting performance standards to account for differences in local  economies and program clients: The level of performance required of  each state VR agency to receive an incentive award could be adjusted to  account for the challenges they face. For instance, the performance  standard required to receive an incentive award may be set lower for  agencies in states with poor economies than for states with better  economies. These adjustments could be made using a mathematical  model, negotiations between federal and state agencies, or a combination  of the two approaches. For example, the Job Training Partnership Act  program (JTPA) used mathematical models to quantify the relative effect  of participants and economies on agency outcomes. Some researchers of  the JTPA program found that this approach was perceived to \u201clevel the  playing field\u201d for agencies and had lessened the perverse incentives to  focus more heavily on the most promising clients. However, the research  also suggests that it is difficult to identify and measure all the external  factors that can undermine or lessen agency performance. If key factors  are missing from mathematical models, the adjusted performance  standards may lead to inaccurate estimates. Taking a different approach,  WIA Title IB employment and training programs set performance  standards by negotiating with state agencies. Although advocates of this  approach say that it increases agency involvement and may better capture  qualitative factors that affect agency performance, we and others have  criticized the WIA negotiation approach as unsystematic and inconsistent  across states. Specifically, we have suggested using an approach that  combines negotiations with mathematical models. In a prior report, we  recommended that Labor develop an adjustment model or other  systematic method to account for different populations and local  economies when negotiating performance levels. Labor officials  generally agreed with our recommendation and told us recently that are starting to provide states with adjustment models to inform t negotiation process. Finally, some researchers and public officials  identified concerns about adjusting performance standards, regardless of  the method. For example, some researchers have expressed concern that  adjusting performance standards may be unfair to clients because it allows  agencies to settle for less desirable outcomes for harder-to-serve  populations.", "Beyond these risks, there are a number of considerations involved in  deciding to incorporate incentive awards directly into the VR funding  formula itself. First, it would be important to consider whether or not  states should be required to match the additional funds allocated for  performance, and if not, whether those funds could be treated as part of  the state\u2019s matching contribution. Another consideration is that rewarding  high performance through the funding formula would, in effect, penalize  other states insofar as it reduces the total funding available for distribution  to all agencies based on other formula factors. Some state VR agency  officials we spoke with suggested that incentive awards should not result  in any decrease to base funding allocations. HUD\u2019s Public Housing Capital  Fund program, which provides incentive awards through its funding  formula, includes provisions that minimize the impact of the awards on  states\u2019 funding. However, HUD officials we spoke with still expressed  concern that this system penalizes housing authorities that may need  additional funds if they are to improve their performance.", "Alternatively, incentive awards could be distributed independently of the  VR funding formula to avoid these inherent penalties. Options for  distributing funds outside the main VR funding formula include providing  incentive awards as grants, as occurs in the WIA Title IB programs, or  through a separate incentive award formula, as occurs in the Child  Support Enforcement program. Of the state VR officials who responded  to our survey, 51 percent supported providing incentive awards distributed  independently of formula-determined funds, while only 22 percent  supported providing the incentive awards through the formula.", "Finally, regardless of whether incentive awards are provided through the  VR funding formula or independent of it, there are still other  considerations involved in designing and carrying out an incentive award  system. For instance, it is important that incentive awards are based on  reliable data about agency performance. It is also important to consider  the extent to which an incentive award system will allow for future  modifications should there be changes in program priorities or available  data, or if perverse and unanticipated results ensue. Our earlier work  discusses these and other, related considerations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Although the measures currently used to allocate VR funds may have been  the best available when the formula was last revised in 1978, better data  are now available for factoring in both the potential need for and ability to  support a program. Improved information offers policymakers the  opportunity to update the formula to more closely align funding with the  need for services, as well as with each state\u2019s ability to contribute to the  program. In deciding whether a revision to the formula is warranted,  policymakers will likely want to consider how to strike a balance among  all important factors\u2014need, the cost of providing services, and the extent  to which state resources are available. Certainly, revising the funding  formula poses challenges because any formula change will result in  funding decreases for some states, along with increases for others.  However, there are ways to ease the transition to a new formula, so as to  minimize disruption to VR programs and the people they serve. On the  other hand, incorporating performance incentives into the formula might  introduce more complexity and risk.

To meet both equity standards, a  formula should use reliable and appropriate measures of the need  population in each state and the cost of providing services in each state. A  taxpayer equity formula additionally requires a reliable measure of a  state\u2019s ability to finance a program from its own resources. In the  following sections, we describe how we measured the need population,  cost of providing services, and financing capacity in each state, and how  we analyzed the extent to which the current formula meets equity  standards and developed various formula options. To address all three  objectives, we also surveyed the 80 vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies  in the states, territories, and District of Columbia and conducted in-depth  interviews with 11 VR agencies in 9 states.

First, the ACS provides data on states\u2019 disability populations on an annual  basis. Second, the ACS has a large sample size (with about 3 million  housing units surveyed across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and  Puerto Rico), which would allow for more accurate estimates of the need  population in each state. Third, the ACS surveys people in more types of  group quarters than any of the other surveys, such as those living in  college dormitories, group homes, prisons, and nursing care facilities. This  is significant, since about 10 percent of VR clients exiting the program in  2006 and 2007 lived in group quarters such as group homes or  rehabilitation facilities when they applied to receive VR services,  according to Education\u2019s data. Fourth, the ACS asks six questions that are  designed to capture a wide variety of disabilities (see table 2), and these  questions are asked consistently across all states.

We did not use data from the sixth question  regarding the difficulty of working (question 6 in table 2) because the  Census Bureau had removed this question in 2008 at the recommendation  of an inter-agency task force. The 2008 ACS data is expected to be released  in the fall of 2009 and was not available to use for this study. Since this  question will not be included on future surveys, we sought to produce an  analysis that would more closely reflect future available data.

Although one approach for estimating cost differences is to  estimate the costs for the same basket of goods in different states,  attempting to do this for VR services would be extremely costly and labor- intensive because of the wide array of services that VR agencies provide,  including assessment, counseling, higher education, occupational training,  medical diagnosis and treatment, and transportation. Another challenge is  finding a reliable data source on cost. State agencies\u2019 data on  expenditures, in part, reflect cost of services, but using these data in a  formula runs the risk of allowing undesirable incentives to be introduced  into the program. For example, a state agency that efficiently manages its  program will be able to provide the same quality of services at a lower cost  than an agency with less efficient management. In this case, if the formula  provided higher allocations to states with higher reported costs, it could  reward agencies that are more inefficient. In addition, expenditures data  are of limited use in measuring state cost differences because they reflect  many other factors besides costs. For example, the amount of funds that  agencies spend per client reflects the level of funds they receive from state  and federal sources, as well as the types of clients they serve and the types  of services they provide. For example, some agencies may choose to  provide more intensive, higher-cost services to a smaller number of  clients, while other agencies may choose to serve a larger number of  clients with lower-cost services.", "To address these challenges, we developed and used measures for the  costs of resources\u2014or inputs\u2014that go into providing services, which are  beyond the direct control of state agencies. Specifically, we focused on  two basic inputs\u2014labor and office space\u2014that are needed to provide the  different types of VR services. Where wages or rents are higher because  the general cost of living is high, state agencies must pay more for workers  or office space to provide services. In the following subsections, we  describe in detail how we developed a cost index to reflect differences in  costs for these two types of inputs, labor and office space. There are many  other resources used to provide VR services, such as equipment and  supplies, but data are not readily available on them. Obtaining such data  would be time-intensive and costly, requiring detailed surveys of the  specific services that each VR agency provides and the particular  resources that go into each service. As a result, our cost index may not  capture differences in the cost of some key inputs. For example, due to  lack of data, our index would not capture transportation costs, which  could be higher in states that have geographically dispersed populations.", "While our index has some limitations, we believe it is a reasonable proxy  that can reflect general differences across states in the cost of providing  VR services. Because any cost index will only be an approximation of true  cost differences, the index we developed is based on what we believe are  reasonable assumptions that avoid overstating or exaggerating cost  differences among states. We believe our measure allows us to at least  partially recognize real cost differences among the states, while avoiding  inappropriate incentives. A similar cost of services index is used in the  funding formulas for the Community Mental Health Services and the  Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grants.", "In the following subsections, we describe: (1) our work to identify a data  source for estimating wages in each state, (2) the data source we used to  estimate rental costs in each state, (3) our methodology for estimating  how much to weight wages and rents in the cost index, and (4) how we  combined our weights with the data on wages and rents to develop a cost  of services index for each state.

Specifically, we  examined BLS data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages  (QCEW) and Occupational Employment Statistics (OES). The QCEW data,  which come from employer filings for unemployment insurance, cover  nearly all civilian employment. It classifies wages and employment levels  by industry, using the North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS). We examined private sector wages, but also included public  sector wages for state government employees. In addition, we also  reviewed data on specific occupations related to the VR industry from the  OES. The OES classifies occupations according to the Standard  Occupational Classification (SOC) system.

The QCEW data on the vocational rehabilitation  industry showed some peculiar values. For example, the wages in Vermont  were the highest in the nation in the vocational rehabilitation services  industry, but they were not among the highest in other data series we  examined. We contacted BLS officials to better understand these data.  They informed us that Vermont\u2019s data for the vocational rehabilitation  services industry come from a small number of employers, and as a result,  could be affected by two factors: possible differences in the types of work  performed and in the number of hours worked per week. The average  annual wage in the QCEW is calculated by including both employees who  worked full-time and part-time. If the proportion of VR employees working  part-time varies substantially across states, this could cause state annual  wages to vary. At a broader industry level, this is less likely to be a  problem because the data cover more employers and employees. With  regard to the OES data on rehabilitation counselors, the data were  incomplete. There were no published wages for Alaska and Utah.", "The remaining data series could serve as reasonable proxies for state  wages in the VR program, but we selected the QCEW data for the  education, healthcare, and social assistance industry sector for our proxy  because it covers the wide array of services that the VR program provides.

In  addition, this industry had the smallest range for wage differences across  states\u2014the state with the lowest wage in this industry was 17 percent  below the average, and the state with the highest wage was 25 percent  above average.

This  section describes each of the analyses we conducted for our first  objective.", "Proportion of states\u2019 population that is civilian, of working age, and  with a disability: To determine the proportion of each state\u2019s general  population that is civilian, of working age, and has a disability, we  analyzed 2007 ACS data to obtain the number of civilians in each state  from age 16 to 64 who responded \u201cyes\u201d to at least one of five disability  questions. As discussed above, we did not include individuals who  responded \u201cyes\u201d to the question on difficulty working because this  question was eliminated from the ACS, starting in 2008. We then divided  the working-aged disability population numbers by the total population  (all ages) for each state, which we also obtained from the 2007 ACS. These  proportions are presented in appendix III.", "Correlation between states\u2019 disability populations and their per capita  income: To test whether the formula\u2019s use of per capita income is a  reasonable proxy for states\u2019 disability rates, we analyzed the correlation  between their disability rates and their \u201callotment percentage,\u201d which is  the part of the formula that includes per capita income. As discussed  above, we determined a state\u2019s disability rate as the proportion of a state\u2019s  total population that is civilian, of working age, and has a disability. For  the per capita income factor, we calculated each state\u2019s \u201callotment  percentage,\u201d which according to the formula, is one minus one-half of a  state\u2019s per capita income level divided by the national per capita income  level (see appendix II for a further explanation of the allotment  percentage). We then obtained the correlation coefficient between states\u2019  disability rates and their allotment percentages.", "Allotments per working-aged person with a disability (cost-adjusted):  To determine for each state the allotment per working-aged person with a  disability, as adjusted for the costs of providing services, we used  Education data on the VR grant allotments that states received in fiscal  year 2008, ACS data on state disability populations in 2007 (using the five  disability questions, as described earlier), and the cost index, as described  earlier. Specifically, we used the allotments that Education initially  calculated for each state for fiscal year 2008. To calculate the allotments  per working-aged person with a disability while adjusting for costs, we  divided each state\u2019s grant allotment by the product of the cost index and  the state\u2019s 2007 working-aged disability populations. See appendix V for a  state-by-state listing of allotments per working-aged person with a  disability, as adjusted for costs of services.", "We tested the reliability of Education\u2019s data on VR grant allotments by  replicating Education\u2019s formula calculations and interviewing Education  officials knowledgeable about the data. Our replications of the formula  calculations produced results that were virtually identical to Education\u2019s.  As a result, we determined that the data are sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "Order of Selection Status: We examined whether agencies in those states  with below median allotments per working-aged person with a disability  (adjusting for costs) more often reported being under an order of selection  than those states whose allotments were above the median. To obtain  information on states\u2019 order of selection status, we used Education\u2019s RSA- 113 data, which are quarterly data that states submit on their caseloads.  For states with two VR agencies, we considered a state to be under an  order of selection if either of its agencies reported being under an order of  selection. Table 7 shows the number of states that we considered under an  order of selection, by type of VR agency.", "We assessed the reliability of RSA-113 data by interviewing Education  officials knowledgeable about the data and conducting edit checks.  Education officials informed us that when a state agency reports being  under an order of selection, the Department verifies that the state agency  has documented in its state plan its intention to provide services on an  \u201corder of selection\u201d basis. However, Education officials also informed us  that the RSA-113 data on a state\u2019s order of selection status do not  necessarily indicate whether state agencies are currently operating on this  basis by actively limiting services to individuals. For example, they noted,  and we subsequently confirmed through our own review of the data, that  some states reported being under an order of selection, but reported  having no individuals on a waiting list. As a result, we determined that the  RSA-113 data on order of selection was sufficiently reliable to provide  information on the number of states reporting they were on an order of  selection, but we cannot say whether these states were actually operating  under their order. Our analysis also did not allow us to conclude whether  there is any causal link between states\u2019 funding levels and their order of  selection status.", "Comparison of per capita income and total taxable resources: We  analyzed how per capita income compares with TTR in each state. To do  this, we obtained data on per capita income from the Department of  Commerce and TTR data from Treasury from 2004 to 2006, the latest years  for which data from both sources were available. We took 3-year averages  (2004, 2005, and 2006) of the per capita income and total taxable resources  levels for each state in order to limit the effects of any year-to-year  fluctuations. We then calculated the total taxable resources per capita for  each state by dividing the average total taxable resource amount by the  state\u2019s average population from 2004 to 2006. Next, we created indices by  dividing each state\u2019s per capita income and total taxable resources per  capita by the U.S. averages of per capita income and total taxable  resources per capita, respectively. To compare states\u2019 per capita income  with their total taxable resources, we divided each state\u2019s per capita  income index by its index of total taxable resources per person to obtain  ratios.

To minimize such nonsampling errors, a social science survey specialist  designed the initial questionnaire, in collaboration with GAO staff who had  subject matter expertise.
