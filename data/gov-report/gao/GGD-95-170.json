The judicial waiver rate for person offenses in 1992 was 2.4 percent in contrast to the waiver rate for property offenses, which was 1.3 percent. Therefore, judges were more likely to waive cases to criminal court involving juveniles charged with person offenses than juveniles charged with property offenses in 1992.

Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia have judicial waiver laws, and each state establishes different criteria for which cases may be waived. The criteria often include specific age and offense restrictions as well as factors that the judge must consider related to the juvenile\u2019s case. For example, juvenile judges in Florida can waive a case to criminal court involving a juvenile age 14 or older for any offense if there is a finding that the juvenile should be transferred after considering certain factors; whereas judges in Maryland can waive a case involving a juvenile age 15 or older for any offense and a juvenile of any age charged with a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment if there is a finding that the juvenile is unfit for juvenile rehabilitative measures. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court in an appendix to Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541 (1966), outlined certain factors that the juvenile court judge would consider when making waiver decisions under the specific statute. The factors from the 1966 court case included seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and whether the protection of the community requires waiver; whether the offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful manner; whether the offense was committed against persons or against property, with greater weight being given to offenses against persons, especially if personal injury resulted; prosecutive merit of the complaint; whether the juveniles\u2019 associates in the offenses were adults; sophistication and maturity of the juvenile; juveniles\u2019 record and previous history; protection of the public; and likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile by the use of procedures, services, and facilities that are available to the juvenile court.", "Many states have incorporated these factors into their juvenile codes either verbatim or with minor modifications. In interviews with judges in seven states and in our nationwide survey of prosecutors, we asked which factors from a list (based on factors previously listed) they were most likely to consider when making waiver decisions. The factors chosen most often by judges and prosecutors were the seriousness of the offense, the juveniles\u2019 previous record and history, and whether the juvenile was amenable to rehabilitation.", "While we were unable to get an estimate of the total number of waiver petitions filed by prosecutors, information collected in our survey of prosecutors suggested that more than half of the requests for judicial waivers filed in calendar year 1993 were granted.

Data provided by juvenile court officials on the number of delinquency cases filed in these jurisdictions compared with data provided by criminal court officials on the number of cases directly filed by prosecutors showed that direct filing cases represented a larger percentage of juvenile cases in some states than in others.

However, juveniles age 16 in Nebraska and Vermont and age 17 in Wyoming can be direct filed in criminal court for any offense. In jurisdictions with direct filing laws, prosecutors had discretion to decide whether to file the case in juvenile or criminal court. The extent to which prosecutors exercise their discretion was exemplified by data provided by criminal court officials in Arkansas and Wayne County, Michigan. These data showed that many of the cases eligible for direct filing remained in juvenile court. For example, in Arkansas 2,756 cases were eligible to be filed in criminal court in 1992. However, during that period, prosecutors directly filed about 45 percent of the cases in criminal court.

Without state data, we were unable to determine the frequency of statutory exclusion cases sent to criminal court. We were, however, able to analyze the laws to determine the conditions under which juveniles were excluded from juvenile court (see table 7 for our analysis). According to our analysis, statutory exclusion laws focused primarily on juveniles charged with serious violent offenses and/or juveniles with previous juvenile or criminal court records. In addition, 15 states also excluded one or more other serious offense (e.g., a child age 16 or older carrying a handgun without a license in Indiana).", "In 17 of the 37 states with statutory exclusion laws, the laws excluded juveniles charged with serious violent offenses and juveniles with prior court records (repeat offenders) from juvenile court.

In 13 of the 37 states, the focus of the statutory exclusion laws are to exclude juveniles charged with serious violent offenses from juvenile court. For example, in New York, any juvenile age 13 or older charged with murder in the second degree is to be prosecuted in criminal court. In addition, New York excludes juveniles age 14 or older from juvenile court for a list of serious violent crimes that include assault, rape, and manslaughter, each in the first degree. New York does not have any exclusion provisions on the basis of the juvenile\u2019s prior record. In 7 of the 37 states and in the District of Columbia, the focus of the statutory exclusion laws is to exclude juveniles with prior criminal court records from juvenile court jurisdiction. These laws apply to all juveniles with specified prior records (i.e., adult court convictions) regardless of their offenses. For example, in Virginia, any juvenile previously convicted as an adult is excluded from juvenile court jurisdiction regardless of the offense.", "While statutory exclusion laws in most states focus on serious violent offenses and prior records, in 15 states one or more other serious offenses such as burglary, weapons, and drug offenses are excluded.

For example, in 1978, California law allowed juvenile court judges to waive the case of any juvenile age 16 or older. Since then, a law was passed that allows juvenile court judges to also waive cases involving juveniles 14 or older for a list of specific offenses. This change increased the number of juveniles that are subject to being sent to criminal court. Also, in 1978, North Dakota law allowed judges to waive the case of a juvenile age 16 years or older charged with a \u201ccrime or public offense.\u201d Since then, a new law was passed that allows juvenile court judges to also waive cases involving juveniles 14 years or older charged with committing an act that involves the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm. New Mexico, South Dakota, and Wyoming changed their laws, which had the effect of decreasing the population of juveniles potentially subject to being sent to criminal court.

For example, in 1988, Michigan passed a law that gives prosecutors the discretion to directly file cases in criminal court involving juveniles who are age 15 or older and are charged with a list of specific crimes. Prior to this law, these cases would be filed initially in juvenile court, and the prosecutors would have to request a waiver hearing for those cases they believed should be sent to criminal court.

Of the 57 percent of juveniles not placed on probation in 1992, about 27 percent of their cases were dismissed, 12 percent received some other disposition, and 17 percent received placement (e.g., were placed in a residential treatment program), as shown in table 13.

Because data were not available on the frequency of statutory exclusion, we analyzed the statutory exclusion laws of 37 states and the District of Columbia to determine the types of cases being excluded from juvenile court. To determine sentences of juveniles convicted in criminal court, we analyzed conviction rates, conviction offenses, and incarceration rates and sentences for juveniles prosecuted in criminal court. To determine the dispositions of juveniles in juvenile court, we analyzed the offenses and dispositions of juveniles in juvenile court. To analyze conditions of confinement for juveniles in adult correctional facilities, we conducted site visits at seven adult prisons in four states. We classified cases as juveniles on the basis of the defendants\u2019 age at the time of arrest because data were not available for the defendants\u2019 age at the time of the offense.

On the basis of discussions with juvenile justice officials, this type of comparison should recognize the selection process by which juveniles are sent to criminal court or remain in juvenile court. The officials said that juveniles sent to criminal court are a select subset of all juveniles. The fact that they are selected for criminal court indicates they are different from juveniles processed in juvenile court. When sending juveniles to criminal court, decisionmakers (e.g., judges) generally consider that these juveniles have (1) relatively more serious criminal behaviors, (2) more extensive criminal histories, (3) less amenability to treatment, or (4) a greater likelihood of being a threat to the community than juveniles who are processed in juvenile court. Also, juveniles processed in criminal court are subject to a different sentencing process than those in juvenile court. Both factors mean that comparisons between the two groups of juveniles would be of nonequivalent groups. As a result, differences or similarities in their sentences would be difficult to interpret. However, subject to these caveats, we provided data on the sentencing outcomes for juveniles processed in these two courts.

However, the likelihood that older juveniles would have their cases waived than younger juveniles was much larger in some states than in others. For example, in Arizona older juveniles charged with property offenses were 39 times more likely to have their cases waived than were younger juveniles charged with such offenses; while in Florida, older juveniles charged with property offenses were only 5 times more likely to have their cases waived than younger juveniles. While waiver rates were somewhat higher in four of the six states for violent offenses than for property or drug offenses, the rates varied among the states within each age category. For example, older juveniles charged with property offenses were 44 times more likely to have their cases waived in Missouri than in California, while younger juveniles charged with violent offenses were 58 times more likely to have their cases waived in Missouri than in California.", "Gender - Males were more likely than females to have their cases waived within each offense type in the six states we analyzed.

For example, in Arizona males charged with violent offenses were 42 times more likely to have their cases waived than females in Arizona, while such males were 17 times more likely to have their cases waived than females in California. In some states, the likelihood was more apparent for those charged with violent offenses than for those charged with either property or drug offenses. For males, juveniles charged with violent offenses had higher waiver rates than for males charged with drugs or property offenses in three of the six states. In the remaining three states, males charged with drug offenses had higher waiver rates. Waiver rates for each offense type also differed across states for males. For example, males charged with property offenses in Arizona or Missouri were 18 times more likely to have their cases waived than males in California.", "Race - In four states, blacks were more likely than whites to have their cases waived for violent, property, and drug offenses. For violent offenses, the differential rates are fairly consistent across states, with black juveniles having waiver rates from 1.8 times to 3.1 times higher than whites. The differences varied more widely for drug offenses. In California, black juveniles were half as likely as white juveniles to have their cases waived, while in Pennsylvania black juveniles were more than twice as likely to have their cases waived than whites. There were some large differences, however; for example, for juveniles charged with drug offenses, Arizona\u2019s waiver rates for whites were twice those of California; while for blacks, Arizona\u2019s rates were 55 times those of California.", "Locality - In the four NCJJ states with data on metropolitan and nonmetropolitan courts, some small differences did exist but were not consistent across offense types within the same state. For example, in Missouri, waiver rates in metropolitan areas were higher for violent and drug offenses but lower for property offenses than in nonmetropolitan areas. The waiver rate was highest for drug offenses in all four states in nonmetropolitan areas and in three of the four states in metropolitan areas. In nonmetropolitan areas in Pennsylvania, juveniles charged with violent offenses were less likely to have their cases waived than those charged with drugs or property offenses. The likelihood of cases being waived in each type of locality varied somewhat for the offense types among the four states, particularly for property offenses. For example, juveniles charged with property offenses in metropolitan areas in Pennsylvania were almost 4 times more likely to have their cases waived than were juveniles in South Carolina, while those charged with property offenses in nonmetropolitan areas of Pennsylvania were 9 times more likely to have their cases waived than those in South Carolina.", "Prior Referrals - In the five states with data, waiver rates generally increased with the number of prior referrals for all five states and most offense types. We categorized referrals into three groups: (1) none, (2) one or two, and (3) three or more. The larger increases usually occurred between the second and third categories. For example, in Arizona, juveniles charged with violent offenses and who had one or two prior referrals were 3 times more likely to have their cases waived than those with no referrals, while juveniles charged with violent offenses with three or more referrals were 8 times more likely to be referred than those with no referrals. The states differed in the rates at which they waived cases for these offense types in each prior referral group. The differences were strongest for juveniles charged with property offenses. For example, considering only those with three or more prior referrals, the greatest difference for juveniles charged with violent offenses was found between Arizona and Florida, where Arizona\u2019s waiver rate for these juveniles was 5 times greater than Florida\u2019s.
