FAA maintains data on the number of individuals newly certificated each year, but less is known about how many certificated individuals exit the aviation industry each year and the extent of growing demand. A sufficient supply of certificated workers is critical for safety and to meet the growing demand for air travel. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data provide some information on pay and demand for aviation maintenance workers more broadly, but do not differentiate between FAA-certificated and non-certificated workers due to data collection challenges. Demographic data may also be useful for workforce analysis and planning. FAA data provide some demographic information on certificated mechanics and repairmen, such as age and sex, but the agency lacks data on race and ethnicity. According to GAO analysis of FAA data, the median age of the roughly 330,000 mechanics and repairmen FAA had certificated as of December 2018 was 54 years old and three percent were women.", "Government agencies, educational institutions, and businesses coordinate to some extent in support of this workforce, but FAA does not routinely analyze, collect, or coordinate with other stakeholders on certain data related to workforce development. One of FAA's strategic objectives includes promoting the development of a robust, skilled aviation workforce, and the agency established a committee, in part, to explore ways to diversify this workforce; however, FAA is not currently positioned to understand whether its efforts are optimally targeted or effective. Without routinely analyzing its own data or leveraging others' data, FAA may not have certain information it needs to track or ensure progress toward its workforce development goals.", "FAA has acknowledged that curriculum requirements for Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) schools and mechanic testing standards are outdated. Efforts to revise the decades-old curriculum requirements for AMT schools are ongoing and FAA officials told GAO that a final rule will be published some time toward the end of 2020. FAA officials indicated that the revised mechanic testing standards would likely be finalized after."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its February 2020 report, GAO recommended that FAA use its existing data and coordinate with other federal agencies to identify and gather information to measure progress and target resources toward its goal of promoting a robust, qualified, and diverse aviation maintenance workforce.

A  sufficient supply of qualified aviation maintenance workers, including FAA  certificated mechanics and repairmen, is necessary for repairing aircraft  and maintaining a safe and robust aviation system. Changes in aviation  industry technology are ongoing and are expected to continue at a rapid  pace, which has implications for the training of these workers. In addition,  FAA and the aviation industry anticipate that the demand for air travel will  grow in coming years. Federal and aviation industry stakeholders have  expressed concern over the capacity of the aviation maintenance  workforce to meet projected needs due to retirements, attrition, fleet  growth, and the growing demand for air travel. Yet federal data limitations  make it difficult to determine certain employment characteristics for this  workforce and the curriculum requirements for the aviation maintenance  technician (AMT) schools that train certificated mechanics are decades  old.", "My testimony today is based on our report that issued last week, Aviation  Maintenance: Additional Coordination and Data Could Advance FAA  Efforts to Promote a Robust, Diverse Workforce.

Specifically,  FAA certificated about 8,600 mechanics and repairmen on average each  year for 2014 through 2018 (see fig. 1). BLS data project an annual  average of 11,800 job openings in the United States from 2018-2028 for  aircraft mechanics and service technicians due to growth and replacement, which include job openings for certificated and non- certificated workers.", "There are, however, certain limitations to existing federal data. For  example, neither FAA nor BLS collects data on the race or ethnicity of  certificated individuals. In addition, FAA officials said the number of  certificated individuals likely overestimates the number of them working in  the aviation industry. It is unknown how many of the approximately  330,000 certificate holders are retired, deceased, or working in other  industries. Furthermore, BLS data indicate 136,900 individuals were  employed in the aircraft mechanics and service technicians occupation in  2018, but it is not clear how many of those jobs were filled by FAA- certificated workers.", "There are also limitations to determining employment characteristics such  as pay for certificated workers, specifically. BLS publishes some data on  pay for aircraft mechanics and service technicians, such as average  hourly and annual wages. However, the occupational classification  system BLS and other federal statistical agencies use for aircraft  mechanics and service technicians does not distinguish between FAA- certificated and non-certificated workers, making it difficult to determine  employment characteristics such as pay for certificated workers,  specifically. This is in part because workers are classified by the work  they perform and not necessarily by certification or education, according  to occupational classification system principles. BLS officials said they  collected wage and employment data for certificated workers separate  from non-certificated workers in employer surveys conducted between  2000 and 2012, but stopped collecting these data in part because  employers inconsistently reported them.", "Employers we interviewed, including air carriers and repair stations, had  differing perspectives on potential growth in demand for aviation  maintenance workers; some said they were experiencing difficulty finding  enough workers to meet their needs, while others said they were not  experiencing difficulty. Employers we interviewed for our 2014 report also  expressed varying levels of difficulty filling vacancies and recruiting  individuals for certain aviation professions, including aviation  maintenance workers. Small and medium-sized employers in particular  cited some challenges to hiring due to the wage they offered. Some  stakeholders we interviewed for our recent report voiced concerns about  the potential for a labor shortage. In addition to these views, two of the  three selected labor market indicators (unemployment rate and wage  earnings) we reviewed from 2013 through 2018 were consistent with  difficulties in hiring aircraft mechanics and service technicians, while the  other indicator (employment) was not."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government and Industry Programs Support the Workforce, but FAA Lacks Information That Could Advance Its Workforce Development Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Several federal agencies such as DOD, DOL, VA, Education, and the  Department of Transportation administer grants or programs that support  individuals pursuing aviation maintenance careers or facilitate  coordination among different stakeholders to support them.

The report also  includes examples of states, industry employers, and AMT schools  coordinating or partnering to support the workforce including developing  career grants and military pathway programs.", "Despite some of FAA\u2019s recent efforts in support of this workforce, we  found that FAA does not routinely analyze, collect, or coordinate with  other stakeholders on certain data related to workforce development.", "FAA\u2019s strategic plan includes an objective on promoting the development  of a robust aviation workforce, and its Aviation Workforce Steering  Committee charter emphasizes providing diverse populations, including  youth, women, and minorities, with clear pathways into aviation careers to  expand the talent pool from which both government and industry may  recruit. However, neither the strategic plan nor the steering committee  charter provides specific information on how FAA plans to select and  measure any efforts it undertakes related to these objectives. Without  routinely analyzing its own data or leveraging others\u2019 data, FAA may not  have certain information it needs to track or ensure progress toward its  workforce development goals.", "We identified several areas in which improved data analysis, collection, or  coordination could assist FAA in measuring progress and understanding  how to target its resources in support of its workforce related objectives.  For example, FAA could use the demographic or pathway data it already  collects to identify patterns or relationships (such as the trend in female  certificate holders by pathway), which could be useful information as FAA  aims to increase opportunities for women to pursue aviation maintenance  careers. FAA could also use existing AMT school data (such as  enrollment or mechanic test pass-rate data) to analyze nationwide trends  or aggregate information across AMT schools to better understand the  AMT school pathway as a whole.", "In our 2020 report that issued last week, we recommended that the  Aviation Workforce Steering Committee, as part of its ongoing efforts,  take steps to use existing FAA data and coordinate with other federal  agencies to identify and gather the information it needs to measure  progress and target resources toward its goal of promoting a robust,  qualified, and diverse aviation maintenance workforce.

In October 2015, FAA published a notice of  proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with the stated goal of updating the existing  AMT school curriculum. FAA issued a supplemental NPRM in April 2019  that expanded the scope of the NPRM it issued in October 2015.  Comments on the supplemental NPRM were due in June 2019.

FAA officials told us that a final rule will be published some  time toward the end of 2020.", "In a separate effort outside of the rulemaking process, FAA is currently  updating the testing standards for mechanics. FAA has acknowledged  that current mechanic testing standards are also outdated. As a result,  aviation stakeholders have stated the mechanic tests include outdated or  irrelevant questions. For example, the practical test may include projects  on wood airframes and fabric coverings, which are not common to  modern commercial aircraft.", "An FAA official noted that any delay in finalizing the rule would likely  result in a corresponding delay to finalizing the testing standards.  Delaying the release of the updated mechanic testing standards could  result in the prolonged use of outdated or irrelevant questions on the  mechanic tests.
