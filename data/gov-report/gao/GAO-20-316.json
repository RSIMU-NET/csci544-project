To be cleared for  flight, F-35 policy states that an aircraft must be electronically \u201ccomplete\u201d  in ALIS, meaning that all of the electronic records from each installed F- 35 part must be entered into ALIS. However, users at all 5 of the locations  we visited told us that electronic records are frequently incorrect, corrupt,  or missing, resulting in ALIS signaling that the aircraft should be  grounded, often in cases where maintainers know that the parts have  been correctly installed and are safe for flight. Users at 1 location said  that within a 6-month period in 2019, they experienced anywhere  between 0 and 400 issues per week related to inaccurate or missing  electronic records. These same users said that it is common for their  squadron leadership to elect to allow an aircraft to fly with over 20  inaccurate or missing electronic records that ALIS signals to ground.  According to users at all 5 locations we visited, squadron leadership (e.g.,  DOD personnel designated by maintenance squadron commanders) may  decide to fly an aircraft with inaccurate or missing electronic records, but  we found that this practice varies by location and type of part.", "In June 2019, the Department of Defense Inspector General published a  report on missing electronic records on F-35 spare parts.

For  example, in April 2019, we reported that reduced aircraft performance  was due largely to spare parts shortages. This conclusion was drawn  from data that had been collected and tracked by both the contractor and  DOD across the entire fleet to determine non-mission capability rates due  to supply issues. Further, the F-35 program collects data on the degree to  which maintenance issues are affecting F-35 mission capability. And,  there are ongoing efforts to improve F-35 fleet readiness that are  specifically targeted at supply and maintenance issues that are causing  the significant mission-capability degradation. However, users and  program officials stated that recurring issues with ALIS could also be  affecting aircraft performance and noted that data on these issues are not  being collected by the contractor or DOD.

Air Force officials stated that instead, the F- 35 program office relied on the prime contractor to take the lead in  managing the development of the system. For example, the F-35  Operational Requirements Document provides only overarching, high- level requirements for ALIS and does not include specific, user-related  requirements or requirements to adapt and modernize the system over  time. DOD officials acknowledged that historically, DOD has prioritized  other aspects of the F-35 program, such as the development of the  airframe, over its logistics system.", "In addition, DOD\u2019s focus with ALIS development over the last 5 years has  largely centered on adding capabilities required to complete  developmental testing for the F-35. As issues with the fielded system  have arisen, DOD and the prime contractor\u2019s approach has generally  been to resolve these issues on a case-by-case basis as available  resources allowed, as opposed to making more costly and time-intensive  improvements to the system\u2019s underlying design and functionality. DOD  contracting officials and prime contractor representatives stated that the  need to balance a limited number of software development personnel  between efforts to stabilize the current system and add new features has  negatively affected the development of ALIS. In a 2017 report, the Air  Force Digital Service recommended that the F-35 program office cease  adding new capabilities in order to re-evaluate ALIS-related design  choices and improve software development processes and procedures.  According to the report, many of the issues with ALIS have known root  causes that are directly related to software and hardware design choices  that are 15 years old. For example, ALIS is made up of siloed applications  that each have their own, sometimes conflicting, databases. Further,  according to the Air Force Digital Service report, efforts to upgrade ALIS  from an out-of-date operating system have not been prioritized by the F- 35 program office. Finally, ALIS hardware is cumbersome, consisting of  heavy servers as well as laptops that were originally designed in the mid- 1990s.", "The current approach to developing ALIS has generally led to scheduling  delays and challenges addressing a backlog of ALIS deficiencies. For  example, the ALIS version required to complete developmental testing for  the F-35 was not released until 2018\u20148 years after the originally planned  release date. F-35 program office officials emphasized that in general, the  timeframe for releasing major software updates for ALIS\u2014up to 18  months\u2014has been long. Further, based on data from the prime  contractor, as of September 2019, there were about 4,700 open ALIS  deficiencies, which are used by the prime contractor to track and manage  issues with the system. According to an F-35 program office official,  ALIS deficiencies may be identified in the field by F-35 users, in the prime  contractor\u2019s testing laboratory, or during DOD-led developmental and  operational testing of the F-35 and ALIS. Of these 4,700 deficiencies,  about 34 percent were identified in 2017 or earlier and 22 percent were  category 1 or category 2 deficiencies. Category 1 deficiencies are  considered critical and could jeopardize safety, security, or another  requirement; category 2 deficiencies are those that could impede or  constrain successful mission accomplishment. As shown in figure 10,  the total number of open deficiencies has generally increased over the  last 2 years. In addition, the number of open category 1 through category  3 deficiencies, which are considered critical or have an adverse effect on  mission accomplishment, generally increased during this period. While  the rate at which the prime contractor closed deficiencies during this  period increased, the rate of increase was generally lower than the rate at  which new deficiencies were identified.", "Officials from the Joint Strike Fighter Integrated Test Force and Office of  the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation expressed concerns  about the number and nature of the ALIS-related deficiencies they have  identified during developmental and operational testing. For example, F- 35 testers identified a number of deficiencies with the most recent ALIS  software version, ALIS 3.5, including eight category 1 deficiencies. ALIS  3.5 is referred to as the \u201cstabilization\u201d release because it was intended to  address longstanding issues with ALIS. In addition, F-35 testers stated  that since 2016, they have identified a number of cyber-related ALIS  deficiencies, most of which remain open today.

As we reported in April  2019, the F-35 program as a whole is pursuing a faster and more  incremental approach for delivering new aircraft capabilities to the  warfighter in order to more flexibly address evolving threats. One  approach to software development that helps facilitate such incremental  delivery is Agile, which calls for the delivery of software in small, short  increments rather than in the typically long, sequential phases of a  traditional software development approach. More a philosophy than a  methodology, Agile emphasizes early and continuous software delivery,  as well as using collaborative teams, and measuring progress with  working software. According to some F-35 program office officials,  adopting Agile could result in a more secure system because it involves  continually testing software for security vulnerabilities. Further, we have  previously reported that following an incremental development approach,  such as Agile, gives agencies the opportunity to obtain additional  feedback from users, which increases the probability that each  successive increment will meet user needs. The Mad Hatter initiative is  experimenting with an Agile approach and has had some initial successes  using this model. For example, in July 2019, we observed a  demonstration of a Mad Hatter-developed application that allows the user  to quickly and easily search through Joint Technical Data, an application  within ALIS that has been reported by some users as being extremely  difficult to navigate. However, the Mad Hatter initiative has operated  outside of F-35 program office policies and processes and its applications  are currently not integrated with the fielded ALIS system.

Separately, as part  of its own ALIS initiative, prime contractor officials said that their company  recently began taking steps to adopt best practices for delivering new  ALIS software using an Agile model. However, these efforts are new, and  the F-35 program office has not developed standards for software  developed by the prime contractor using this model.", "DOD officials we spoke with expressed differing views on the extent to  which DOD should adopt an Agile software delivery model for ALIS. For  example, in a 2018 memorandum establishing the Mad Hatter pilot, a  senior Air Force acquisition official stated that the F-35 program should  embrace the tenets of this type of model in order to innovate and rapidly  deliver useful capability through ALIS. Similarly, Air Force, Office of the  Secretary of Defense, and some F-35 program office officials stated that  modernizing ALIS will require DOD to adopt industry best practices by  making decisions quickly, delivering usable products early and often, and  revising plans to reflect experience from completed software iterations. In  contrast, Marine Corps and some F-35 program office officials indicated  that DOD should carefully consider different commercially-available  software tools, as well as DOD-specific constraints, before delivering new  ALIS capabilities. For example, F-35 program office officials associated  with the ALIS Next initiative stated that they conducted an assessment of  the commercial software tools that could be used for new ALIS software  development. These officials said that some of the tools that were initially  being used by the Mad Hatter initiative to develop applications make  software development easier in the short-term but more difficult to switch  toolsets and/or contractors in the long-term. Marine Corps and some F-35  program officials also noted that current DOD processes and  procedures\u2014such as the software certification and cost-estimating  processes\u2014may not be able to support quick software releases.

More  specifically, purchasing IT services through a provider enables agencies  to avoid paying for all of the computing resources (e.g., hardware,  software, networks) that would typically be needed to provide such  services. This approach offers federal agencies a means to buy the  services faster and possibly at less cost than building, operating, and  maintaining these computing resources themselves. However, National  Institute of Standards and Technology guidance states that public cloud  computing represents a significant shift from the norms of on-site data  centers and should therefore be approached carefully with consideration  to the sensitivity of data. While the Mad Hatter initiative has embraced  hosting ALIS in the cloud, including at the squadron level, ALIS Next is  conducting an assessment of the extent to which a cloud-based system is  the best option for ALIS.

However, these officials disagreed  about how much of the future system should be cloud-based at the  squadron level. For example, Air Force, Office of the Secretary of  Defense, and some F-35 program office officials stressed that for day-to- day maintenance at U.S. bases, F-35 squadrons should be able to  access ALIS using Wi-Fi, and that the reliance on onsite servers should  therefore be minimal and limited to deployed scenarios. According to  these officials, DOD can achieve significant cost savings by moving ALIS  to the cloud. These officials also indicated that DOD\u2019s hesitation about  moving from onsite servers to the cloud is mostly cultural and the result of  a lack of understanding about what the cloud is. One senior Office of the  Secretary of Defense official with software expertise stated that  warfighters should be able to deploy with a minimal amount of ALIS  hardware (for example, only a high-powered laptop). In contrast, other F- 35 program office officials told us that the F-35 program office is restricted  in the extent to which it can migrate to cloud-based SOUs due to  connectivity and security restrictions.

Further, as discussed  above, there are divergent views in terms of how DOD should approach  key technical and programmatic aspects of the re-design, and integrating  the different efforts that are underway to fix ALIS\u2014led by the F-35  program office, Air Force, and prime contractor\u2014will therefore require significant direction and leadership. Without a strategy, DOD may not be  able to effectively coordinate and leverage the different ALIS initiatives  that are underway, potentially leading to inefficiencies. DOD also risks  repeating history by failing to clearly articulate what it expects from ALIS  and how it will play a more active role in the management of the system  going forward."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The F-35 aircraft, with its advanced warfighting capabilities, provides  critical tactical aviation for the Department of Defense. However, DOD will  need to overcome substantial challenges related to ALIS if it wants to find  successes in both sustainment and operations of the aircraft. Current  ALIS users continue to report significant challenges with the system that  are affecting day-to-day operations of the aircraft, adding additional flight  line-related responsibilities, and, in some instances, causing squadron  leadership to assume the risk of flying aircraft when ALIS tells them to  stay on the ground. Although ALIS is not currently performing well, over 5  years after we recommended it, DOD has yet to establish a performance- measurement process that would define how ALIS should perform. In the  absence of such a process, DOD will be challenged to address current  and future ALIS-performance issues because it cannot measure ALIS  functionality compared to intended system performance. Furthermore,  ALIS users collectively agree that the issues with ALIS are affecting the  readiness of the aircraft; however, the degree to which this is true  remains unknown. Fleet-wide mission capability rates for the F-35 are still  below the warfighter\u2019s minimum targets, but DOD does not have a  process for measuring, collecting, and tracking information on how ALIS  is affecting these rates. Without such a process, DOD may not  understand all of the factors behind the reduced aircraft performance,  thus limiting its ability to target appropriate solutions.", "DOD officials have acknowledged the ongoing challenges with ALIS and  know that the system, as it stands today, cannot be sustained into the  future; therefore, it is positive that the department has embarked on  efforts to re-design and fix ALIS, as well as take on a more active role in  the management of the system. However, DOD faces a significant  challenge as there are several complex technical and programmatic  uncertainties that will need to be resolved before any future ALIS solution  can be realized. Additionally, there are divergent views among ALIS  stakeholders about how to go about addressing these complex issues.  The future of ALIS remains unclear because the department has not  developed a strategy for the re-design of the system that would identify,  among other things, what the system should look like, how will it be  developed and managed, how it will address key risks, and how much it  will ultimately cost. Without such a strategy, DOD will not be able to  effectively plan for the transition from the current ALIS system, which is  already embedded in over 400 aircraft across the global F-35 fleet, to  whatever solution is determined. Furthermore, a strategy would help align  what is currently a chorus of divergent views within the department on  how to address the future of ALIS. With the worldwide fleet expected to  grow to over 1,000 aircraft over the next four years, and with the U.S.  services becoming increasingly reliant on the F-35\u2019s capabilities to  support their operational strategies, it will be imperative for DOD to  address the ongoing issues related to the F-35\u2019s logistics system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider legislation requiring the Department of  Defense to establish a performance-measurement process for ALIS that  includes, but is not limited to, performance metrics and targets that (1) are  based on intended behavior of the system in actual operations and (2) tie  system performance to user requirements.

To interview officials and observe ALIS- related operations, we conducted site visits to five F-35 locations\u2014Luke  Air Force Base, Arizona; Edwards Air Force Base, California; Nellis Air  Force Base, Nevada; Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona; and Naval  Air Station Lemoore, California. We selected these locations to obtain  perspectives from ALIS-users (i.e. maintainers, pilots, supply personnel,  contractors) from all U.S. services participating in the F-35 program,  including from operational, training, and testing locations. Additionally, we  developed a data collection instrument to collect ALIS-related inputs and  data from ALIS-users (i.e. maintainers, pilots, supply personnel,  contractors) at all 10 U.S. F-35 locations\u2014Luke Air Force Base, Arizona;  Edwards Air Force Base, California; Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada;  Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona; Naval Air Station Lemoore,  California; Hill Air Force Base, Utah; Naval Air Station Patuxent,  Maryland; Eglin Air Force Base, Florida; Marine Corps Air Station  Beaufort, South Carolina; and Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.

We also collected the most recent available  information on ALIS software deficiencies. To determine the reliability of  these data, we collected information on how the data were collected,  managed, and used through a questionnaire and interviews. Although we  identified some limitations in the way that certain data are being collected  and reported\u2014such as data related to aircraft performance like mission  capability rates\u2014we determined that they are sufficiently reliable for the  way in which we reported them and our purposes of providing information  on the progress and challenges within the program.

To determine the reliability of these data, we conducted  electronic tests to identify any internal inconsistencies with the data. We  also reviewed documentation from the prime contractor on the  management of ALIS deficiency data and collected information on how  the data were collected, managed, and used through a questionnaire.  Specifically, we asked questions about inconsistencies we identified  through electronic testing of the data, the extent to which the prime  contractor\u2019s system for collecting deficiency information includes edit  checks or controls to help ensure the data are entered accurately, and  limitations related to the accuracy or completeness of the data.
