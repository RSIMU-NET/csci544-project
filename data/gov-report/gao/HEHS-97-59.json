The program was built on the philosophy that effective intervention in the lives of children can best be accomplished through family and community involvement. Fundamental to program philosophy was the notion that communities be given considerable latitude to develop their own Head Start programs, an idea that has made variability a defining characteristic of the program. These philosophies and the general goals of the program remain virtually unchanged today.", "Although Head Start has long enjoyed both congressional and public support, opinions about the program\u2019s impact have been divided and its effectiveness debated. Some maintain that no compelling evidence exists that Head Start makes any lasting difference in the lives of the population it serves. Others strongly support Head Start and maintain that research has conclusively established its value. Amid this debate, funding for Head Start has tripled in the past 10 years.", "Conflicting information on program impact and the focus on results- oriented program performance information required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 have renewed interest in the impact of the current Head Start program.

Head Start\u2019s primary goal is to improve the social competence of children in low-income families, that is, their everyday effectiveness in dealing with both their present environment and later responsibilities in school and life. Social competence takes into account the interrelatedness of cognitive and intellectual development, physical and mental health, nutritional needs, and other factors. To support its social competence goal, Head Start has delivered a wide range of services to over 15 million children nationwide since its inception. These services consist of education and medical, dental, nutrition, mental health, and social services. Another essential part of every program is parental involvement in parent education, program planning, and operating activities.", "Head Start services are provided at the local level by public and private nonprofit agencies that receive their funding directly from HHS. These include public and private school systems, community action agencies, government agencies, and Indian tribes. In fiscal year 1996, grants were awarded to about 1,400 local agencies, called grantees. Head Start grantees are typically required to obtain additional funding from nonfederal sources to cover 20 percent of the cost of their programs. The Head Start program works with various community sources to provide services. For example, some programs coordinate with public health agencies to obtain health services, while other programs contract with local physicians. Although all programs operate under a single set of performance standards, local programs have a great deal of discretion in how they meet their goals, resulting in great variability among programs.", "Although the program is authorized to serve children at any age before the age of compulsory school attendance, most children enter the program at age 4. The law requires Head Start to target children from poor families, and regulations require that 90 percent of the children enrolled in each program be low income. By law, certain amounts are set aside for specific subpopulations of children, including those with disabilities and Native American and migrant children.", "In addition to providing services to children and families, Head Start also sees one of its roles as a national laboratory for child development. Consequently, Head Start uses much of its discretionary research funding for demonstrations and studies of program innovations. Although overall funding has grown over the years, the amount of funds allocated to research, demonstration, and evaluation has represented about 2 percent or less of the Head Start budget. In fiscal year 1996, Head Start\u2019s research, demonstration, and evaluation budget totaled $12 million (see app. II)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Head Start Has Changed Over the Years", "paragraphs": ["Today\u2019s Head Start is a much different program than it was 30 years ago.

Begun as a summer program, Head Start became largely a full-year program by the early 1970s. In addition, in the early to mid-1970s, the program launched improvement initiatives, including promulgation of performance standards and teacher credentialing. Programs also had the option of providing home-based services.", "In the 1990s, the program continues to change. In 1990, the Congress passed the Head Start Expansion and Quality Improvement Act, which reauthorized Head Start and set aside funds for programs to use to enhance and strengthen the quality of services. In 1994, the Congress established a new program\u2014called Early Head Start\u2014to serve low-income families with infants and toddlers. The program provides continuous, intensive, and comprehensive child development and family support services to low-income families with children under age 3.", "In addition to changes to Head Start over the years, other changes affecting the program relate to the children and families Head Start serves and the amount appropriated to support the program. Head Start\u2019s service population has become increasingly multicultural and multilingual and is confronted with difficult social problems such as domestic violence and drug abuse. Moreover, the number of children served by the program has grown dramatically\u2014from 349,000 children in 1976 to about 750,000 in 1995.

CSR concluded that Head Start participants showed significant immediate gains in cognitive test scores, socioemotional test scores, and health status. Cognitive and socioemotional test scores of former Head Start students, however, did not remain superior in the long run to those of disadvantaged children who did not attend Head Start, according to CSR. In addition, on the basis of a small subset of studies, CSR reported that Head Start participants were less likely to be retained in grade and less likely to be placed in special education.", "Because these research studies were conducted during Head Start\u2019s infancy, their findings provide little information on the effectiveness of the current program. For instance, most of the programs included in the Westinghouse study were summer programs. Almost all programs today are full-year programs. Similarly, the great majority of studies in CSR\u2019s synthesis study were late 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s programs and therefore would not have reflected many significant program changes that took place in the early to mid-1970s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interest in Impact Research Has Increased", "paragraphs": ["Interest in Head Start\u2019s impact has grown with increased congressional and public concern for substantiating federal program performance.

At a time when the value of many federal programs is undergoing intense public scrutiny, however, an agency that reports only these measures has not answered the defining question of whether these programs have produced real results. Because today\u2019s environment is results oriented, the Congress, executive branch, and the public are beginning to hold agencies accountable for outcomes, that is, program results as measured by the differences programs make.", "The Congress\u2019 determination to hold agencies accountable for their performance lay at the heart of two landmark reforms of the 1990s: the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and GPRA. With these two laws, the Congress imposed a new and more businesslike framework for management and accountability on federal agencies.

Conversely, the smaller the number of studies, the greater the risk that the aggregate findings from these studies may not apply to Head Start in general. Most of the approximately 600 articles and manuscripts about Head Start that we identified could not be used to answer questions about impact for various reasons. Much of this literature consisted of program descriptions, anecdotal reports, and position papers. Of those articles that were research studies, some (for example, case studies) were not suitable for drawing general conclusions about impact. Some studies examined change in outcome measures before and after Head Start but did not control for other plausible explanations for the change, for example, maturation.

The most reliable way to determine program impact is to compare a group of Head Start participants with an equivalent group of nonparticipants. The preferred method for establishing that the groups are equivalent at outset is to randomly assign participants to either the Head Start group or the comparison group. Only one of the studies we reviewed used random assignment to form the Head Start and non-Head Start comparison groups. Most of these studies formed a comparison group by selecting children who were similar to the Head Start participants on some characteristic thought to be important to the outcome under study. In most cases, researchers matched participants on one or more demographic variables, usually including some variable related to socioeconomic level. In other cases, researchers did not match treatment and comparison groups but tried to compensate statistically for any inequality between the groups. Neither of these methods compensates completely for lack of random assignment to group.", "Some of the studies used no comparison group; instead, they compared performance of Head Start participants with test norms.

Although program changes might be assumed to increase positive impact, this assumption is largely unsubstantiated. In addition, program impact may be affected by changes in the population served; Head Start families today face different problems than those in the past because of an increase in substance abuse, violence, and homelessness.

In fact, the evaluation of the Early Head Start project, now under way, has randomly assigned potential participants to Early Head Start or a control group that has not received Early Head Start services. Alternatively, a research design that delays, rather than withholds, services could be used. This would involve selecting a study group and randomly assigning some children to Head Start the first year, while the remainder would serve as a control group. The control group would receive services the following year. Another strategy that could be used to study specific parts of the program would be to use an alternative treatment design. In this case, some randomly assigned participants would receive the full Head Start program, while others would receive partial services. For example, if the study interest is in school readiness and cognitive issues, the control group might receive only nutritional and health services.", "Most researchers believe that randomized trials yield the most certain information about program impact. Random assignment is an accepted practice in virtually every area of research, including medicine, economics, and social sciences. In some cases, the treatment of study interest is simply withheld from the control group. In other cases, for example, when researchers suspect that withholding treatment would have a profoundly negative impact, treatment may be delayed for awhile or some lesser, alternative treatment offered.

If true, this nonequivalency in groups would bias the outcome in favor of the comparison group, resulting in underestimation of program effects. Because investigating the characteristics of Head Start participants was beyond the scope of this study, we do not know to what extent, if any, Head Start children may be more disadvantaged than similar children not attending Head Start.

Although research has been conducted, it does not provide information on whether today\u2019s Head Start is making a positive difference in the lives of participants who live in a society that differs vastly from that of the sixties and early seventies.", "While we acknowledge the difficulties of conducting impact studies of programs such as Head Start, research could be done that would allow the Congress and HHS officials to know with more certainty whether the $4 billion dollar federal investment in Head Start is making a difference. For this reason, we recommend that the Secretary of HHS include in HHS\u2019 research plan an assessment of the impact of regular Head Start programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of our report, HHS expressed the belief that the research base on the efficacy of Head Start is more substantial than depicted in our report and that the strategy of the Department to extend this base is appropriate to produce findings about both impact and program quality. HHS also indicated plans to evaluate the feasibility of conducting impact studies such as we recommended. The Quality Research Centers are evaluating the feasibility of conducting randomized trials in small-scale evaluations, and, on the basis of these experiences may consider implementing larger scale studies. The full text of HHS\u2019 comments appears in appendix IV.", "HHS supported the claim that the research base is more substantial than we depict by pointing to the findings from the 1985 synthesis conducted by CSR (cited as \u201cMcKey et al., 1985\u201d in HHS\u2019 comments) and two more recent studies (the Currie and Thomas study and the Fosburg study). For reasons discussed in this report, we do not agree that findings drawn from studies more than 20 years old adequately support claims about the impact of the current Head Start program. Similarly, the findings from the two more recent studies mentioned fail to support conclusions about impact that can be generalized to the national program. Even though these studies were larger than others we found, both had significant methodological limitations. The Currie and Thomas study examined information in a database to reach conclusions about Head Start. This study used an after-the-fact, post-test-only design. Although this design is frequently used when researchers must rely on existing data as their only source, the design is vulnerable to serious threats to validity, as discussed earlier in this report. Because of these design limitations, neither positive conclusions about Head Start (that is, that children\u2019s test scores show immediate positive effects) nor negative conclusions (that is, that these effects quickly disappear for African American children) can be firmly drawn from the findings of this study.", "The second study, the Fosburg study, as HHS pointed out, used a much stronger research design, which randomly assigned children in four Head Start programs to either Head Start or a non-Head Start control group. The site selection methodology, however, precluded generalizing these findings to all Head Start programs. The four Head Start programs selected were chosen from areas identified as underserved in medical and dental services, and Head Start sites that were not in compliance with Head Start performance standards were excluded from selection. In addition, attrition was a significant problem in this study.", "HHS also mentioned that on the basis of recommendations of leading researchers, the Department is conducting a well-balanced, innovative set of new studies of Head Start. It contends that our report does not acknowledge the major longitudinal studies that HHS has planned or that are being conducted by other agencies. Our report states that HHS\u2019 planned research focuses on program improvement, and we agree that such studies are needed. We also support the studies of program impact that HHS has under way in special program areas such as Early Head Start. Our work, however, focused specifically on HHS\u2019 research plans that address the question of impact of the regular Head Start program. HHS\u2019 current research plans, however, do not include such research.", "Finally, HHS maintained that it is building a substantial system of innovative research, development, and management tools in response to GPRA. The Department emphasized the role the Quality Centers play in these efforts and said that these centers are currently evaluating possible strategies for performing comparison group studies that use a random assignment research design. HHS maintained that we overlooked the importance of studying the quality of Head Start programs in assessing impacts.", "We fully support HHS\u2019 plans to investigate the feasibility of conducting randomized trials because these studies provide the clearest indication of program impact. We also agree that the issue of quality is important in assessing program impact and findings from studies need to include information on program quality. The ultimate measure of program quality is impact, however. Until sound impact studies are conducted on the current Head Start program, fundamental questions about program quality will remain.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Head Start Bureau, appropriate congressional committees, the Executive Director of the National Head Start Association, and other interested parties.

Second, findings from studies of early programs have limited generalizability to more stable programs. The early years of any program are not likely to represent a program in its maturity. This is especially true for Head Start, which was implemented quickly and on a large scale.", "Finally, earlier studies were thoroughly reviewed by the Head Start synthesis project and were reported in The Impact of Head Start on Children, Families, and Communities in 1985.
