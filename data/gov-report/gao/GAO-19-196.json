Businesses and other entities commonly use these data to determine eligibility for credit, employment, and insurance. In 2017, Equifax, one of the largest CRAs, experienced a breach that compromised the records of at least 145.5 million consumers.", "GAO was asked to examine issues related to federal oversight of CRAs. Among other things, this report discusses (1) measures FTC has taken to enforce CRA compliance with requirements to protect consumer information, (2) measures CFPB has taken to ensure CRA protection of consumer information, and (3) actions consumers can take after a breach. GAO reviewed relevant laws, documentation related to CRA examinations, and policies and practices of selected CRAs; and interviewed representatives of regulatory agencies, CRAs, consumer and industry groups, and Attorneys General from four states with consumer reporting requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2008, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has settled 34 enforcement actions against various entities related to consumer reporting violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), including 17 actions against consumer reporting agencies (CRA). Some of these settlements included civil penalties\u2014fines for wrongdoing that do not require proof of harm\u2014for FCRA violations or violations of consent orders. However, FTC does not have civil penalty authority for violations of requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which, unlike FCRA, includes a provision directing federal regulators and FTC to establish standards for financial institutions to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of customer records. To obtain monetary redress for these violations, FTC must identify affected consumers and any monetary harm they may have experienced. However, harm resulting from privacy and security violations can be difficult to measure and can occur years in the future, making it difficult to trace a particular harm to a specific breach. As a result, FTC lacks a practical enforcement tool for imposing civil money penalties that could help to deter companies, including CRAs, from violating data security provisions of GLBA and its implementing regulations.", "Since 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has had five public settlements with CRAs. Four of these settlements included alleged violations of FCRA; and three included alleged violations of unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices provisions. CFPB is also responsible for supervising larger CRAs (those with more than $7 million in annual receipts from consumer reporting) but lacks the data needed to ensure identification of all CRAs that meet this threshold. Identifying additional sources of information on these CRAs, such as by requiring them to register with the agency through a rulemaking or leveraging state registration information, could help CFPB ensure that it can comprehensively carry out its supervisory responsibilities. According to CFPB staff, the bureau does not have authority to examine for or enforce the GLBA\u2019s safeguards provisions. After the Equifax breach, however, CFPB used its existing supervisory authority to examine the data security of certain CRAs. CFPB\u2019s process for prioritizing which CRAs to examine does not routinely include an assessment of companies\u2019 data security risks, but doing so could help CFPB better detect such risks and prevent the further exposure or compromise of consumer information.", "If a CRA experiences a data breach, affected consumers can take actions to mitigate the risk of identity theft\u2014such as implementing a fraud alert or credit freeze\u2014and can file a complaint with FTC or CFPB. However, consumers are limited in the direct actions they can take against the CRA. Consumers generally cannot exercise choice in the consumer reporting market\u2014such as by choosing which CRAs maintain their information\u2014if they are dissatisfied with a CRA\u2019s privacy or security practices. In addition, according to CFPB, consumers cannot remove themselves from the consumer reporting market entirely because they do not have a legal right to delete their records with CRAs. This limited control by consumers, coupled with the large amount and sensitive nature of the information CRAs possess, underscores the importance of appropriate federal oversight of CRAs\u2019 data security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Congress consider giving FTC civil penalty authority to enforce GLBA\u2019s safeguarding provisions.

It governs the accuracy of this  information and gives consumers rights to view, correct, or opt out of the  sharing or use of certain aspects of their personal information among  affiliates. FCRA also applies to how CRAs can use and share the  information.", "Accuracy of collected information. FCRA requires that when  preparing a consumer report, CRAs follow reasonable procedures to  assure \u201cmaximum possible accuracy\u201d of the information concerning  the individual about whom the report relates. Companies that furnish  information to CRAs also must take steps regarding the accuracy of  information they report, as required by FCRA and its implementing  regulation, Regulation V. A 2012 CFPB report cited steps that  nationwide CRAs take to help ensure that information they collect  from furnishers is legitimate and accurate. The report notes that  initial screening of furnishers generally includes an inspection of the  companies\u2019 physical headquarters, phone numbers, websites,  business licenses, and company records such as annual reports. In  addition, these CRAs may hire third-party investigation services to  screen for illegal or unethical business practices. They may also  conduct additional inspections in response to consumer complaints,  variations in data reporting, or changes in a furnisher\u2019s ownership. To  conduct quality checks on data submitted by furnishers, CFPB  reported that the nationwide CRAs check for blank fields or logical  inconsistencies. Representatives of CRAs we spoke with provided  examples of the quality assurance steps they take. For example, one  representative told us that they look for violations of logical patterns,  such as a loan going from 30 days past due to 90 days past due over  the course of one month. CFPB reported that when inaccuracies are  identified, the CRAs can reject the information. These steps may  improve the quality of the information received from furnishers, but  they cannot ensure the accuracy of such data.", "Use and sharing of information. FCRA permits CRAs to provide  users with consumer reports only if the user has a \u201cpermissible  purpose,\u201d such as to process a credit application, screen a job  applicant, or underwrite an insurance policy, subject to limitations  where the credit or insurance transaction is not initiated by the  consumer. FCRA also prohibits the use of a consumer report for any  purpose other than that specified to the CRA when the user obtained  the report. It also requires that CRAs take steps to validate the  legitimacy of users and their requests for consumer report information  and apply FCRA requirements to the sharing of information within  their companies.", "Validating the legitimacy of users and their requests for  consumer report information. Representatives of CRAs told us  they take several steps to validate the legitimacy of users and their  requests, including verifying credit transactions, periodically  evaluating user agreements, and validating users\u2019 identities. For  example, representatives of one CRA said they sometimes conduct  on-site visits to verify the existence of an entity and the business it  conducts. In addition, they said they randomly select 6,000 to 8,000  consumer files each year and ask users associated with those files to  show proof that the consumers engaged in the credit transactions  contained in those files. However, several CRAs told us that these  steps cannot guarantee that the users and requests are valid. For  example, representatives of one CRA noted that once a user has the  information, a CRA would find it difficult to prevent that user from  retaining and reusing it for purposes other than the original  permissible purpose.", "Applying FCRA requirements to sharing information internally.  As amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of  2003, FCRA limits the ability of affiliated companies to market  products or services to consumers using shared consumer data.  Affiliates may use consumer report information for product or service  marketing only if they clearly and conspicuously disclose to the  consumer that the information may be shared for such solicitations,  the consumer is provided a simple method to opt out of such  solicitations, and the consumer does not opt out. Representatives of  CRAs told us that they apply the same FCRA protections when they  share consumer reporting data among their departments or  subsidiaries, which may use the data for other purposes. For  example, one nationwide CRA said that one of its internal groups  seeks to ensure that the company implements appropriate legal  protections when it shares data for other uses within the company.", "Staff from state Attorneys General offices we spoke with told us that their  states also have laws pertaining to consumer reporting, which have  similar requirements to those in FCRA. In addition, they noted that while  there is no federal data breach notification law, all 50 states have laws  requiring companies to notify consumers in the event of a data breach.  According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, those laws  have varying requirements, such as the timing or method of notification,  and who must be notified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GLBA and Other Laws Govern the Protection of Consumer Information", "paragraphs": ["Congress enacted GLBA in part to protect the privacy and security of  nonpublic personal information that individuals provide to financial  institutions. According to FTC staff, CRAs may be considered financial  institutions under GLBA if they collect, maintain, and report on consumer  information. As with FCRA, GLBA restricts financial institutions from  sharing consumers\u2019 private information, but GLBA restricts sharing with  nonaffiliated third parties specifically, and those parties face similar  restrictions in how they may further share or use the information.", "In addition, unlike FCRA, GLBA includes a provision directing FTC and  certain federal regulators (not including CFPB) to establish standards  specifically with respect to protection against any anticipated threats or  hazards to the security of customer records. Specifically, under GLBA,  these federal regulators are directed to establish appropriate standards  for financial institutions under their jurisdiction to ensure the security and  confidentiality of customer records and information; protect against any  anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records;  and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or  information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any  customer. To implement these standards for CRAs, and other entities  that fall under its jurisdiction, FTC adopted its Safeguards Rule, which  requires, among other things, that financial institutions have a written  information security program, assess the risks to customer information,  and evaluate and adjust the information security program in light of  foreseeable risks. FTC staff told us that because GLBA applies to  information about a consumer with a customer relationship with a  financial institution, the Safeguards Rule may not apply in all cases where  a CRA holds personal information on individuals. For example, they said  that GLBA would more clearly apply if the consumer had purchased credit  monitoring or other products or services directly from the CRA, or if the  CRA obtained customer information from another financial institution,  such as a bank. Representatives of the three nationwide CRAs told us  that for purposes of protecting information, they do not distinguish  between consumers with whom they have a direct customer relationship  and those with whom they do not.", "CRAs we spoke with provided examples of how they protect consumer  information and meet GLBA requirements to maintain administrative,  technical, and physical safeguards. For example, with respect to  administrative safeguards, representatives of one CRA said they enforce  contractual requirements for data access and data security.  Representatives of another CRA said that the technical safeguards they  use include firewalls, anti-virus software, and malware protection.  Examples of physical safeguards from another CRA included monitoring  data centers by video and restricting access to secure data rooms. To  address data protection more generally, representatives of CRAs we  spoke with told us they routinely conduct internal audits of their data  security systems, and that the financial institutions they work with  frequently conduct audits of their risk management practices, including  CRAs\u2019 data security controls.", "Provisions related to unfair or deceptive acts or practices also may apply  to CRAs\u2019 protection of consumer data. Specifically, under FTC\u2019s authority,  section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) prohibits \u201cunfair  or deceptive acts or practices\u201d in or affecting commerce. In the context  of privacy and security, these provisions require companies to truthfully  represent practices to consumers. For example, FTC has found  companies that alleged that they were following certain security  protections, but did not in fact have such security features, to have  engaged in unfair or deceptive practices. Similarly, the Dodd-Frank Act  prohibits providers of consumer financial products or services from  engaging in \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices,\u201d and CFPB  has authority to enforce and supervise for compliance with this  provision. CFPB has alleged that claims to consumers that transactions  are safe and secure while simultaneously lacking basic security practices  can constitute unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. FTC and  CFPB officials said that in the case of data breaches, they would examine  each case individually to determine whether the institution violated these  provisions in connection with the breach.", "Some states also have laws that protect consumer information, including  laws that generally govern data security. For example, staff from the  Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s office told us that their state has a data  security law similar to FTC\u2019s Safeguards Rule but with more specific  requirements, including those for malware detection and firewalls.  According to the National Consumer Law Center, all 50 states have  consumer protection laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive practices. Staff  from state Attorneys General offices told us that they can prosecute  entities for potential violations of these provisions, including data  breaches. They told us that following the Equifax breach, several states\u2019  Attorneys General launched a joint investigation into whether Equifax  violated state laws, including prohibitions of unfair or deceptive practices.  According to staff from one state Attorney General office, as of February  2019, this investigation was ongoing. In addition, Equifax reported that  individual states have also filed legal action or have ongoing  investigations. For example, Massachusetts and West Virginia have filed  civil enforcement actions against Equifax that seek various remedies,  including civil penalties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FTC Has Taken Enforcement Measures against CRAs but Lacks Civil Penalty Authority for GLBA Data Protection Provisions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FTC Enforces CRA Compliance with Consumer Protection Laws", "paragraphs": ["FTC enforces compliance with consumer protection laws under  authorities provided in FCRA, GLBA, and the FTC Act.

FTC staff said that in determining whether to take on  a case related to privacy and data security matters, they consider factors  such as the company\u2019s size and the sensitivity of the data in the  company\u2019s network. For example, FTC may choose not to investigate a  data breach of a small company that affects few people; however, it may  investigate a potential data security violation of a large company, even  without evidence of a breach. Under its statutory authority, FTC can ask  or compel companies to produce documents, testimony, and other  materials to assist in its investigations. In June 2018, FTC notified  Equifax that it was considering legal action against the company as a  result of its 2017 data breach, including seeking civil penalties.", "If FTC finds that a company violated consumer law, the agency may take  several different actions depending on its legal authority and what it  considers to be the most appropriate response. For example, FTC may,  in administrative proceedings, issue cease-and-desist orders for unfair or  deceptive acts or practices. Further, FTC generally may seek a range of  remedies from the U.S. district courts, including injunctions, damages to  compensate consumers for their actual losses, and disgorgement of ill- gotten funds.

This includes cases of  knowing violations of FCRA. For example, in a 2014 settlement, FTC  levied $525,000 in civil penalties against a CRA after alleging that the  company did not comply with FCRA provisions to ensure the accurate  and permissible use of its reports. FTC does not have civil penalty  authority for initial violations of the FTC Act but may obtain civil penalties  from companies for violations of FTC Act orders.", "FTC\u2019s civil penalty authority does not extend to initial violations of GLBA\u2019s  privacy and safeguarding provisions, which require administrative,  physical, and technical safeguards with an emphasis on protection  against anticipated threats and unauthorized access to customer records.  For violations of GLBA provisions, which are enforced pursuant to FTC  Act authority, FTC may seek an injunction to stop a company from  violating these provisions and may seek redress (damages to  compensate consumers for losses) or disgorgement. However,  determining the appropriate amount of consumer compensation requires  FTC to identify the consumers affected and the amount of monetary harm  they suffered. In cases involving security or privacy violations resulting  from data breaches, assessing monetary harm can be difficult.  Consumers may not be aware that their identities have been stolen as a  result of a breach and or identity theft, and related harm may occur years  in the future. In addition, it can be difficult to trace instances of identity  theft to specific data breaches. According to FTC staff, these factors can  make it difficult for the agency to identify which individuals were victimized  as a result of a particular breach and to what extent they were harmed  and then obtain related redress or disgorgement. Having civil penalty  authority for GLBA provisions would allow FTC to fine a company for a  violation such as a data breach without needing to prove the monetary  harm to individual consumers.", "FTC staff told us and testified before Congress that civil penalties are  often the most appropriate remedy for a data breach, and that such  penalties serve as an effective deterrent in cases involving weak data  privacy and security policies and practices. FTC staff noted that in the  case of a data breach, each consumer record exposed could constitute a  violation; as a result, a data breach that involved a large number of  consumer records could result in substantial fines. Unlike FTC, other  regulators have civil penalty authority to punish entities that violate  provisions of GLBA. For example, the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency has said that it can enforce GLBA privacy and safeguard  provisions with civil money penalties against any insured depository  institution or institution-affiliated party subject to its supervision.", "In our 2009 report on modernizing the financial regulatory framework, we  stated that financial regulators should have the authority to carry out and  enforce their statutory missions.

We noted that providing this authority would give FTC a  practical enforcement tool to more effectively enforce provisions related to  security of data and consumer information. Following the 2008 financial  crisis, Congress introduced several bills related to data protection and  identity theft, which included giving FTC civil penalty authority for its  enforcement of GLBA. However, in the final adoption of these laws,  Congress did not provide FTC with this authority.

Four of  these settlements included alleged violations of FCRA and three included  alleged violations of unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices provisions. For  example, in March 2017, CFPB settled with Experian for $3 million in civil  penalties for an alleged violation of FCRA and alleged deceptive acts or  practices. Experian marketed to consumers an \u201ceducational credit  score\u201d that the company claimed lenders used to make credit decisions.  CFPB alleged that lenders did not use these \u201ceducational credit scores\u201d  for this purpose, and that Experian violated FCRA\u2019s implementing  regulation by requiring consumers to view Experian advertisements  before obtaining a free credit report. In December 2015, CFPB levied a  fine of $8 million against another CRA\u2014Clarity Services, Inc.\u2014for  obtaining consumer reports without a permissible purpose in violation of  FCRA and failing to investigate consumer disputes.

From 2015 through 2017,  CFPB examined several CRAs. Some of these examinations resulted in  findings of deficiencies related to data accuracy and dispute processes,  and follow-up examinations were conducted as necessary. As part of its  supervisory role, CFPB also periodically monitors the nationwide CRAs  by requesting information on their activities and identifying any changes in  risk to consumers and the market.

CFPB staff told  us that as of October 2018, they were tracking between 10 and 15 CRAs  that might qualify as larger market participants (as defined by CFPB).  CFPB staff told us that they believe the CRA market is highly  concentrated and there were not likely to be many larger market  participants beyond the 10 to 15 they are tracking. However, CFPB staff  said that the 10 to 15 CRAs may not comprise the entirety of larger  market participants because whether CRAs meet the threshold may vary  from year to year and CFPB has limited data to determine whether CRAs  meet the threshold. Specifically, CFPB staff said that identifying additional  larger market participant CRAs can be challenging. For example, the  Securities and Exchange Commission does not require nonpublicly  traded CRAs to file financial and other information that CFPB could  otherwise use to identify these CRAs, which are generally not widely  known to the public. In addition, CFPB staff said they do not ask CRAs to  provide their annual receipts, with the exception of the specific CRAs  being considered for examination in a given year, because CFPB staff  said calculating these receipts could create an additional cost to the  companies.", "Our January 2009 report on reforming the U.S. financial regulatory  structure noted that regulators should be able to identify institutions and  products that pose risks to the financial system, and monitor similar  institutions consistently. One method for identifying institutions for  oversight, particularly where data are limited, is to require companies to  register with the relevant regulator. For example, among other  requirements, insured depository institutions must obtain a charter to  operate, and money services businesses generally must register with the  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Similarly, CFPB could identify  CRAs that meet the larger market participant threshold by requiring such  businesses to register with them, subject to a rulemaking process and  cost-benefit analysis of the burden it could impose on the industry.   Another method CFPB could use to identify CRAs and inform its oversight  activities would be to leverage information collected by states.  Stakeholders we spoke with cited New York and Maine as examples  where CRAs are required to register with the state. Implementing  strategies such as registration or leveraging existing information could be  a cost-effective way for CFPB to identify all CRAs under its authority.  Identifying additional sources of information on the population of larger  market participant CRAs\u2014including those that are lesser-known, possibly  unknown to CFPB, and possibly in possession of large amounts of  sensitive consumer information\u2014could help ensure that CFPB has more  comprehensive information for carrying out its supervisory  responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFPB\u2019s Prioritization of CRA Examinations Does Not Specifically Account for Data Security Risk", "paragraphs": ["To determine which product lines, institutions, and compliance issues to  examine, CFPB determines the institutions (for example, banks, credit  unions, non-bank mortgage servicers, and CRAs) and the consumer  product lines that pose the greatest risk to consumers, and prioritizes  these for examinations annually (see fig.2). CFPB segments the  consumer product market into institution product lines, or specific  institutions\u2019 offerings of consumer product lines. CFPB then assesses  each institution product line\u2019s risk to consumers at the market level and  institutional level. To assess risk at the market level, CFPB considers  market size and other factors that contribute to market risk. Market size  includes a consideration of a product\u2019s market size relative to other  consumer finance product markets. Other market risk factors include the  potential risk to consumers from new or existing products offered in the  market as well as emerging risks and trends in consumer financial  products. For example, CFPB noted that a market may be considered  higher risk if consumers cannot choose the provider of a financial product  or service in that market, or if the transactions occur between two  businesses rather than between a business and consumers. Because  they do not face the same risk of losing customers as companies in other  markets, companies in higher-risk markets may not have the same  financial incentives to protect the interests of consumers.", "To assess risk at the institution level, CFPB considers an institution\u2019s  market share within a product line, as well as field and market  intelligence. An institution\u2019s market share correlates with the number of  consumers who could be affected by that institution\u2019s practices; therefore,  CFPB generally places a higher priority on larger providers of products.  Field and market intelligence includes quantitative and qualitative  information on an institution\u2019s operations for a given product line,  including the strength of its compliance management systems, the  number of regulatory actions directed at the institution, findings from prior  CFPB examinations, information obtained from CFPB\u2019s quarterly  monitoring of institutions, public reports, and the number and severity of  consumer complaints CFPB has received about the institution. Field and  market intelligence can also include information about an institution\u2019s fair  lending practices and its ability to provide fair, equitable, and  nondiscriminatory access to credit.", "Taking market and institutional considerations together, CFPB places  institution product lines into tiers based on its determination of their  relative risk to consumers. These risk tiers range from 1 to 5, with 1 being  the lowest risk and 5 being the highest risk. Risk tiers then feed into  CFPB\u2019s development of its supervision strategy, which includes other  information, including information from subject matter experts and recent  legal and policy decisions that could affect examinations, and  consultations with internal stakeholders. CFPB uses both the risk tiers  and information from its supervision strategy to identify potential  institutions for examination. Following this process, CFPB has regularly  determined CRAs\u2019 consumer reporting to be a high priority for  examination since it began supervising them in 2012.", "After identifying institution product lines to examine, CFPB determines  specific areas of compliance to assess. These determinations are made  by considering sources such as consumer complaints, public filings and  reports, and past examination findings related to the same or similar  products or institutions. Most recently, CFPB examinations of CRA\u2019s  consumer reporting have focused on issues such as data accuracy,  dispute processes, compliance management, and permissible purposes.", "Although CFPB\u2019s examination prioritization incorporates several important  factors and sources, the process does not routinely include assessments  of data security risk, such as how institutions detect and respond to cyber  threats. According to CFPB staff, the agency\u2019s process for determining  risk tiers incorporates the risk factors specifically cited in the Dodd-Frank  Act, including those related to the size of a product market. The Act also  states that CFPB should consider other factors it determines to be  relevant; as such, CFPB staff noted that certain elements of data  protection have been included in the scope of some of its past CRA  examinations. For example, CFPB staff said that in assessing compliance  with FCRA\u2019s permissible purposes provision, the examination scope  would include ensuring that data are not improperly shared. CFPB staff  noted that the bureau cannot examine for compliance with or enforce the  data security standards in provisions of GLBA and FCRA or FTC\u2019s  implementing rules, even at larger participant CRAs. After the Equifax  breach, however, CFPB used its existing supervisory authority to develop  internal guidelines for examining data security, and conduct some CRA  data security examinations. CFPB staff said that they do not routinely  consider data security risks during their examination prioritization process  and have not reassessed the process to determine how to incorporate  such risks going forward.", "The Dodd-Frank Act requires CFPB, when implementing its risk-based  supervision program, to consider risks posed to consumers in the relevant  product and geographic markets. In addition, federal internal control  standards state that agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to  risks related to achieving defined objectives. This can entail considering  all significant internal and external factors to identify risks and their  significance, including magnitude of impact, likelihood of occurrence,  nature of the risk, and appropriate response. In light of the Equifax  breach, as well as CFPB\u2019s acknowledgment of the CRA market as a  higher-risk market for consumers, it is important for CFPB to routinely  consider factors that could inform the extent of CRA data security risk  such as the number of consumers that could be affected by a data  security incident and the nature of potential harm resulting from the loss  or exposure of information.", "CFPB\u2019s reliance primarily on consumer complaints, information from  public filings, and information and findings from past examination for  prioritizing examinations may not fully detect data security risks that  CRAs pose. Data accuracy and dispute resolution feature prominently in  consumer complaints, according to CFPB staff, because consumers  mostly interact with CRAs in these contexts. But consumers likely did not  know, for example, about Equifax\u2019s data security challenges prior to its  breach, so that vulnerability was not a focus of complaints. While the  three nationwide CRAs acknowledged the risk of data breaches in recent  public filings, other larger participant CRAs may not be publicly traded  and therefore may not have public filings. Further, if CFPB\u2019s past  examinations have not addressed data security, the agency cannot use  those past examination findings to target current risks.", "The Equifax breach demonstrated the vulnerability that CRAs may face  with regard to data security. We have noted that advancements in  technology, combined with the increasing sophistication of hackers and  others with malicious intent, have increased the risk of sensitive personal  information being exposed and compromised. We have also reported  that rapid developments in new technologies will continue to pose new  threats to security, privacy, and safety. In recent years, insured  depository institutions\u2014which, like CRAs, maintain large amounts of  sensitive consumer data\u2014have been subject to regular information  technology examinations, which, according to one regulator, may include  a cybersecurity component. Banking regulators have noted that  unauthorized access to the information and systems that support these  institutions can affect operations, pose risk to consumers through  exposure of private information, and undermine consumer confidence.", "The risks may be similar for CRAs\u2014companies that by definition also  maintain extensive amounts of sensitive consumer information.

First, consumers generally cannot trace the source of the data used to  commit identity theft to a particular breached entity. As a result, it can be  difficult to link a breach by a CRA (or any other entity) to the harm a  consumer suffers from a particular incidence of identity theft, which may  make it challenging to prevail in a legal action. Second, unlike with many  other products and services, consumers generally cannot exercise choice  if they are dissatisfied with a CRA\u2019s privacy or security practices.  Specifically, consumers cannot choose which CRAs maintain information  about them. In addition, consumers do not have a legal right to delete  their records with CRAs, according to CFPB staff, and therefore cannot  choose to remove themselves entirely from the CRA market.", "FTC and CFPB have noted that the level of consumer protection required  can depend on the consumer\u2019s ability to exercise choice in a marketplace.  For example, when determining whether a practice constitutes an unfair  practice, FTC considers whether the practice is one that consumers could  choose to avoid.

These challenges underscore the importance of  appropriate federal oversight of CRAs\u2019 data security.", "While FTC has taken significant enforcement actions against CRAs that  have violated federal privacy or data security laws, it is important that the  agency have all of the appropriate enforcement options to fulfill its  mission of protecting consumers. However, GLBA, one of the key laws  governing the security of consumer information, does not provide FTC  with civil penalty authority. The remedies that FTC does have available  under GLBA\u2014such as disgorgement and consumer redress\u2014may be  less practical enforcement tools for violations involving breaches of mass  consumer data.
