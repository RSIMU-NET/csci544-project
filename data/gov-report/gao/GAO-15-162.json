States that did not conduct FBI record checks said this was because the state lacked a designated agency to review check results, among other challenges. In 2006, the Attorney General proposed that nongovernmental entities also serve in this role but noted that this would require considerations about securing data and protecting personal information.", "States have improved the completeness of criminal history records used for FBI checks\u2014more records now contain both the arrest and final disposition (e.g., a conviction)\u2014but there are still gaps. Twenty states reported that more than 75 percent of their arrest records had dispositions in 2012, up from 16 states in 2006. Incomplete records can delay checks and affect applicants seeking employment. The Department of Justice has helped states improve the completeness of records through grant funding and other resources, but challenges remain. For example, the FBI's Advisory Policy Board\u2014which includes representatives from federal, state, and local criminal justice agencies\u2014created a Disposition Task Force in 2009 to address issues regarding disposition reporting, among other things. The task force has taken actions to better measure the completeness of state records and identify state requirements for reporting disposition information. However, the task force does not have plans with time frames for completing remaining goals, such as examining and recommending improvements in national standards for collecting and reporting disposition information.", "According to stakeholders GAO contacted, the use of private companies to conduct criminal history record checks appears to be increasing because of employer demand and can provide benefits, such as faster response times.

The official  noted that these agencies may also give a higher priority to addressing  inquiries from law enforcement, further delaying responses to record  inquiries for employment and licensing purposes. Repository officials from  another state noted that it generally takes 1 or 2 days to finish an FBI  criminal record check when no records are returned or the records are  complete, but otherwise it can take up to several months, for example, to  conduct the research needed to complete a record.", "Further, officials from the four record repositories said that state privacy  laws\u2014which can restrict the information that agencies are allowed to  disseminate for non-criminal-justice purposes\u2014can affect a state\u2019s ability  to obtain information. For example, officials in Washington State said that  according to state law, they can disseminate a criminal record for non- criminal-justice purposes only if the record contains conviction information  or arrest information that is less than 1 year old. Also, the officials said  that it can be difficult to interpret whether records returned from another  state would prohibit employment or licensing in the state where an  individual is seeking employment, since state laws can define felonies  and misdemeanors differently.

DOJ\u2019s grant funding and other assistance programs have  helped states address these challenges.", "Prosecutors not reporting final case decisions: According to officials  from DOJ and our case study states, one of the major contributors to  arrest records not having final dispositions occurs when prosecutors  decline to prosecute an individual but do not report this information to the  state\u2019s central records repository. Prosecutors may decline to prosecute  an individual for a variety of reasons, such as insufficient evidence or the  low severity of the offense. Prosecutors also have the authority to offer  plea bargains, which reduce the seriousness of a charge in return for a  guilty plea or other forms of cooperation with the prosecution. Prosecutors  cited excessive workload and the lack of technology and human  resources as reasons why they did not report declinations to prosecute,  according to a 2005 BJS survey.decisions that can lead to an arrest record without a disposition include  decisions to consolidate a case into another case and to close a case that  has become dormant because of insufficient evidence or witnesses,  among other things.", "When not reported, other prosecutorial  Fingerprints not collected under cite-and-release practices:  Incomplete criminal history records can also result from law enforcement  officials citing and releasing individuals without formally arresting and  fingerprinting them. This can result in state and local courts submitting  dispositions to a state\u2019s central records repository without a  corresponding arrest record because the individual was never  fingerprinted. Typically, states allow citation and release for misdemeanor  offenses, but according to the National Conference of State Legislatures,  at least 2 states permit citation and release for some felonies. Cite-and- release policies can result in a significant number of incomplete criminal  history records. For example, a senior official from 1 of our case study  states said that cite-and-release arrests were one of the practices that  contributed to approximately 1.6 million dispositions that are not linked to  an arrest, which the state keeps in an independent data system and is  working to match up with the corresponding arrest records.", "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, cite-and- release arrests are a common practice for law enforcement agencies and  are useful to these agencies.

Courts can use such devices to  immediately fingerprint individuals upon arrival in court for the citation  hearing.

Law enforcement typically generates the case  control number when an individual is arrested and fingerprinted, and  some states use the number to associate all subsequent criminal history  information from criminal justice entities with the original arrest event.  According to the state officials, the process to transfer the case control  number among local criminal justice entities may be manual and therefore  prone to errors or occur inconsistently. For example, officials from 1 state  said that certain local agencies that make arrests write case control  numbers on a white board, and the numbers do not always get  transferred to prosecutors and courts.

DOJ components have taken a range of actions to  help state and local agencies improve the accuracy and completeness of  their criminal history records and address related challenges. However,  the FBI Advisory Policy Board\u2019s Disposition Task Force has been in  existence since 2009, but it has not issued best practices or national  standards for collecting and reporting disposition information or  developed a national strategy for improving the quality of disposition  reporting, as intended. Establishing a plan with time frames and  milestones could help the task force achieve its remaining goals and help  improve disposition reporting.", "In addition, for more than 3 years, the FBI has received but not used  disposition information from OPM to potentially help states enhance the  completeness of their criminal history records. It is important that the FBI  and OPM clarify what disposition information that OPM collects will be  provided to the FBI and formally agree on how OPM will provide it. This  would enable the FBI to forward the information to states and allow each  state to determine if the information can be used to update their criminal  history records. Finally, although the FBI and the Compact Council have  taken steps to educate states on the regulatory requirement that they  notify applicants of their right to challenge and correct the information in  their criminal history records, FBI audits of state and local agencies\u2019 use  of criminal history records consistently show that states do not notify all  applicants as required.

OPM noted that preliminary discussions between the FBI and OPM  indicate that the disposition data in OPM\u2019s reports of investigations may  be useful to the FBI in identifying records in its system that are lacking  dispositions but that contain a disposition at the local level. OPM added  that it has been researching internal technical strategies that will provide  specific data fields to the FBI that can be formatted and sorted in a  manner best suited to the FBI\u2019s needs. OPM noted, however, that the  format in which OPM collects and maintains data is necessarily oriented  toward fulfilling the agency\u2019s assigned mission.

We selected these laws  to represent a range of factors, including variation in whether the law  requires or authorizes (permits) an FBI record check, different  employment sectors covered (i.e., nonprofit, private, or public  employment), and variation in paid versus volunteer positions.", "In addition, we conducted a web-based survey of officials at agencies  within all 50 states and the District of Columbia that maintain criminal  history records (state repositories) to determine the extent to which states  are conducting FBI checks for the employment sectors covered under the  three federal laws.

We took steps in developing the questionnaire, collecting the data,  and analyzing them to minimize such nonsampling error. To ensure our  survey questions were accurate, understandable, and unbiased, we  pretested our survey instrument with officials in 3 states\u2014California,  Idaho, and Washington. An independent reviewer within GAO also  reviewed a draft of the questionnaire prior to its administration.

We selected this time frame because 2006  was the year the Attorney General issued the criminal record background  check report and 2012 was the year with the most current available  survey data.
