Venezuela also supplies about 11 percent of current U.S. imports of crude oil and petroleum products and wholly owns five refineries in the U.S. Consequently, Venezuela is a key player in the future energy security of the United States and the world. The current global oil market is tight and may be more susceptible to short-term supply disruptions and higher and more volatile prices. Recently, tension between Venezuela and the United States has caused concern about the stability of Venezuelan oil supplies. On several occasions, Venezuela's President has threatened to stop exporting oil to the U.S. or to close Venezuela's U.S.-based refineries. In this context, GAO analyzed: (1) how Venezuela's crude oil production and exports of crude oil to the U.S. has changed in recent years, (2) the potential impacts of a reduction in Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S., and (3) the status of U.S. government programs and activities to ensure a reliable supply of oil from Venezuela. Commenting on a draft of the report, the State and Commerce Departments generally agreed with the report, but DOE contended that the report presents an \"alarmist view\" of U.S. energy security. We disagree and believe the report presents a contextually balanced treatment of the issue."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Venezuelan oil production has fallen since 2001, but exports of crude oil and petroleum products to the United States have been relatively stable--except during a 2-month strike in the winter of 2002-2003, during which the oil sector was virtually shut down and exports to the United States fell by about 1.2 million barrels. Energy Information Administration data show that total Venezuelan oil production in 2001 averaged about 3.1 million barrels per day, but by 2005 had fallen to about 2.6 million barrels per day. Following the strike, Venezuela's President ordered the firing of up to 40 percent of Venezuela's national oil company employees. U.S. and international oil industry experts told us that the resulting loss of expertise contributed to the decline in oil production. In 2005, the Venezuelan government announced plans to expand its oil production significantly by 2012, but oil industry experts doubt the plan can be implemented because Venezuela has not negotiated needed deals with foreign oil companies as called for in the plan. A model developed for the Department of Energy estimates that a 6-month disruption of crude oil with a temporary loss of up to 2.2 million barrels per day--about the size of the loss during the Venezuelan strike--would, all else remaining equal, result in a significant increase in crude oil prices and lead to a reduction of up to $23 billion in U.S. gross domestic product. A Venezuelan oil embargo against the United States would increase consumer prices for petroleum products in the short-term because U.S. oil refiners would experience higher costs getting replacement supplies. A shutdown of Venezuela's wholly-owned U.S. refineries would increase petroleum product prices until closed refineries were reopened or new sources were brought on line. These disruptions would also seriously hurt the heavily oil-dependent Venezuelan economy. U.S. government programs and activities to ensure a reliable supply of oil from Venezuela have been discontinued, but the U.S. government has options to mitigate short-term oil disruptions. For example, activities under a U.S.-Venezuela oil technology and information exchange agreement were stopped in 2003, in part, as a result of diplomatic decisions. In recent years, U.S. oil companies have not sought assistance from the U.S. government with issues in Venezuela because the companies do not believe that federal agency intervention would be helpful at this time. To mitigate short-term oil supply disruptions, the U.S. government could attempt to get oil-producing nations to increase their production to the extent possible, or could release oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. While these options can mitigate short-term oil supply disruptions, long-term reductions in Venezuela's oil production and exports are a concern for U.S. energy security, especially in light of current tight supply and demand conditions in the world oil market. If Venezuela fails to maintain or expand its current level of production, the world oil market may become even tighter than it is now, putting further pressure on both the level and volatility of energy prices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States imports about 13 million barrels of crude oil and refined  The United States imports about 13 million barrels of crude oil and refined  petroleum products each day, or about 65 percent of its total daily  petroleum products each day, or about 65 percent of its total daily  consumption.

Meanwhile, demand for crude oil is growing rapidly in China and other  countries. Market tightness, along with the fact that much of the world\u2019s  supply of oil is in relatively unstable regions, may make the global oil  market increasingly susceptible to short-term disruptions and lead to  higher and more volatile oil prices.

Crude oil is a global commodity and, as such, any  world event that increases instability in crude oil prices reduces energy  security for all oil-buying countries in similar ways. Numerous empirical  studies have shown a correlation between oil price shocks and economic  downturns. When crude oil prices rise, this pushes up prices of petroleum  products. Consumers spend more of their income on energy and less on  other goods, which can cause an economic slowdown. In addition, since  much of the oil is imported, there is a greater flow of funds overseas rather  than increased domestic spending. World oil prices have more than  doubled since 2003 and are currently higher, when adjusted for inflation,  than in any time since the early 1980s. World demand for oil is projected to  increase by about 43 percent over the next 25 years\u2014from about 82  million barrels per day in 2004 to about 118 million barrels per day in  2030\u2014with much of the increased demand coming from China and other  countries.

Most of Venezuela\u2019s crude oil that is not consumed domestically in  Venezuela is exported to the United States because of its close proximity;  additionally, Venezuela owns significant refining assets in the United  States and the U.S. Virgin Islands that can refine its heavy sour oil. In the  1980s and 1990s, PDVSA bought CITGO, Inc. and acquired interests in  several other U.S. refineries that had the ability or could be reconfigured  to refine such crude oil. Today, the refining capacity of PDVSA\u2019s share of  the nine U.S. refineries in which it has an interest is about 1.3 million  barrels per day.

However, beginning in 1992, the  Venezuelan government reopened its petroleum industry to foreign and  private Venezuelan oil companies in what was known as the \u201cApertura.\u201d  Between 1992 and 1997, Venezuela signed 32 operating service agreements  to allow 22 private Venezuelan, U.S., and other foreign companies to  produce oil in fields that were considered, at the time, economically  marginal or high risk. The purpose of these 32 operating service  agreements was to allow foreign companies to assist PDVSA in producing  oil, and the contracts were structured so foreign-company operators did  not have any rights over the volumes, reserves, or prices of crude oil but  were reimbursed for their costs plus a service fee for production. The  Venezuelan government granted the foreign company operators an  indefinite \u201croyalty holiday\u201d whereby the companies paid no more than 1  percent royalty on the extracted crude, instead of the maximum of 16-2/3  percent at the time.", "Also during this period, PDVSA entered into four joint ventures with  foreign companies, including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and  ChevronTexaco from the United States, to produce crude oil in the Faja.  These joint ventures, whose majority shares were owned by the foreign oil  companies, were considered high risk at the time, in part due to the  challenges of producing \u201cextra-heavy\u201d sour oil from the Faja, which is  among the lowest quality oil commercially produced anywhere in the  world.

The new law increased maximum royalties from  16-2/3 percent to 30 percent, and increased the percentage of ownership  by PDVSA in all operating arrangements with foreign and domestic  companies to at least 51 percent. In 2005, the Venezuelan government took  steps to make foreign and domestic companies migrate from the terms of  the existing 32 operating service agreements to the terms of the new law.  Essentially, beginning in 2006, the companies that had been paying no  more than 1 percent in royalty fees under the operating service  agreements had to pay as much as 30 percent.

For example, international financial data show that foreign  investment in Venezuela declined between 2001 and 2004. Specifically, net  foreign direct investment in Venezuela was about $3.5 billion in 2001,  declined to almost zero in 2002, and recovered to about $1.9 billion in  2004, the last year for which investment data are available. Because we  were unable to obtain reliable, independent data on specific investment in  Venezuela\u2019s oil and gas sector, we analyzed total foreign investment in  Venezuela as a proxy for the condition of the oil sector. Our analysis  indicates a high correlation between Venezuelan oil production and net  foreign investments in Venezuela. In addition, experts told us that there is  a high correlation between the number of active oil drilling rigs and oil  production. However, the number of active rigs fell sharply during and  after the strike and, as of 2005, had not returned to their 2001 levels.  Specifically, there was an average of 66 active drilling rigs in Venezuela in  2001; the number of rigs fell to as low as 12 during the height of the strike  in January 2003; and the average increased to 60 in 2005. This provides  further evidence that Venezuela\u2019s oil production has decreased.", "The Venezuelan government\u2019s firing of thousands of PDVSA employees  following the strike contributed to the decline in production. The  government dismissed about 40 percent of PDVSA\u2019s approximately 40,000  employees, including many management and technical staff. Experts told  us that the loss of managerial and technical expertise caused a rapid  decline in the company\u2019s oil production from existing fields. In fact, some  said that the loss of expertise was so critical that after the strike, PDVSA  was unable to issue invoices for contractor services.", "Venezuelan officials told us that strikers did deliberate damage to the  company and that this sabotage accounts for some of their difficulties  since the strike. PDVSA employees with whom we spoke, some of whom  were fired and others who resigned, disputed the claims of sabotage and  said that strikers had originally planned only a two- or three-day strike, but  that the government shut them out before they could return to work.  Venezuelan officials acknowledged that the loss of expertise initially  hampered operations and said that they have been replacing and training  lost workers as quickly as possible. However, many industry experts told  us that a black list of former PDVSA managerial and technical staff that  the Venezuelan government will not rehire is limiting Venezuela\u2019s ability to  acquire the necessary staff to meet its production goals. In addition,  officials from foreign oil companies with operations in Venezuela told us  that since the strike, PDVSA has become highly politicized and that PDVSA  officials are often slow to make key decisions, which have complicated  foreign companies\u2019 decisions to invest in the Venezuelan oil sector. Many  oil industry officials told us that PDVSA\u2019s lack of managerial and technical  expertise still remains one of the biggest challenges in continuing  operations in Venezuela with PDVSA as a partner. In addition, experts told  us that Venezuela had underinvested in oil field maintenance since the  early 1990s, and that this had contributed to PDVSA\u2019s declining  production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Declines in Production by PDVSA Have Been Partly Offset by Increases in Foreign Oil Companies\u2019 Production, but Not by Enough to Reach the PreStrike Production Level", "paragraphs": ["Data from EIA, the International Energy Agency, OPEC, and the  Venezuelan government indicate that, from 2001 through 2005, Venezuelan  crude oil production controlled by PDVSA decreased, while production  controlled by foreign companies increased.

Beginning in 2005, the Venezuelan administration took steps to  make private Venezuelan and foreign companies producing crude oil  under the 32 operating service agreements renegotiate those agreements.  Essentially, the new agreements increase the maximum royalty from 16-2/3  percent to 30 percent, increase income taxes from 34 percent to 50  percent, and give PDVSA at least a 51 percent share of the operations  covered by the agreement. Oil industry officials and experts have generally  reacted negatively to the changes in the agreements. Most company  officials we contacted told us that Venezuela\u2019s move to unilaterally impose  new agreements increased their risk and eroded the investment climate in  Venezuela, likely leading to future production declines. Many oil industry  officials and experts told us that the changes in the foreign company  participation structure, such as mandating a majority share of the  operation for PDVSA, pose investment risks and uncertainty for foreign  companies because the Venezuelan government has ultimate control in  decisionmaking. When France\u2019s Total and Italy\u2019s Eni oil companies failed  to sign new agreements, the Venezuelan government seized control of  their operations in April 2006; five other fields were turned over to PDVSA  after negotiations, according to the Venezuelan spokesperson. Also,  ExxonMobil and Norway\u2019s Statoil chose to sell their minority stakes in  smaller fields rather than accept Venezuela\u2019s required changes.

This spending was in  addition to money companies paid to the Venezuelan government as  royalties and income taxes, and therefore reduces the amount of funds  available for investing in oil production.", "Future production could be impaired by the Venezuelan government\u2019s  preference to use national oil companies from developing countries (such  as China) and other geopolitically strategic countries (such as Brazil) as  partners to explore and develop new fields in Venezuela, instead of relying  on experienced international oil companies.

A Venezuelan oil embargo against the United States would have  smaller impacts that would primarily affect the United States.

Because Venezuela\u2019s economy is so dependent on its  oil sector, Venezuela would likely try to restore oil production as quickly  as possible following a strike or similar disruption to avoid large losses of  export revenues.", "A model developed for DOE by a contractor, using a hypothetical oil  disruption scenario that we developed to resemble the disruption caused  by the Venezuelan strike during the winter of 2002\u20132003, predicted that, by  the second month of a disruption, worldwide crude oil prices would  temporarily increase by about $11 per barrel\u2014from an assumed pre- disruption price of $55 per barrel to almost $66 per barrel. The increase  in world crude oil prices would, in turn, drive up prices of refined  petroleum products. Later, as the lost oil was replaced with oil from other  sources or production resumed, the price of crude oil would return to the  previous level. The model further predicted that the temporary increase in  world oil prices caused by a disruption would lower the U.S. GDP by about  $23 billion relative to what it would have been otherwise\u2014about $13  trillion. A loss of this magnitude for a given year is likely to cause a small  decline in the growth rate of the U.S. economy, but is unlikely to result in a  recession. In this analysis, the rate of GDP growth would be about 0.18  percent less than what it would have otherwise been for the year.", "Our hypothetical disruption scenario lasts only a few months because  Venezuela, like any other country that is heavily dependent on oil revenue,  is likely to exert a great effort to end any severe disruption of crude oil  production. The country\u2019s economy in general, and government revenues  in particular, depend heavily on the revenues that the country obtains  from petroleum production and exports. For example, oil revenues  accounted for between 45 and 50 percent of Venezuelan government  revenues in recent years. A severe drop in oil revenues for more than a few  months would cripple the economy, resulting in lower economic growth  and lost jobs; Venezuelan authorities would consider a prolonged oil  industry shut down as a very grave threat to the government and to the  country as a whole. Indeed, PDVSA officials told us that they restored  most of their lost production during the first few months after the strike.", "It should be noted that the model somewhat understates the impacts on  the United States of a sudden and severe loss of oil from Venezuela  because it treats any disruption of oil supplies as equal, regardless of the  location or the characteristics of the lost oil. In other words, the model  does not differentiate between heavy sour crude oil (such as that  produced in Venezuela) and any other type of crude oil\u2014for example,  \u201cArab Medium\u201d (which is Saudi Arabia\u2019s medium-quality crude oil). Thus,  the model does not consider the economic cost of replacing, for example,  100,000 barrels of heavy sour oil with the same amount of lighter, sweeter  oil. In fact, Arab Medium may cost more than some Venezuelan crude oils  because of its higher quality, and because the transportation cost of a  barrel of oil from Saudi Arabia is higher than that of a barrel of oil from                                                                                                                                     Venezuela. In addition, there may be an economic penalty associated with  some U.S. refineries\u2019 switching from their normal significant reliance on  Venezuelan oil to replacement oil from alternative sources. For example,  one U.S. oil company that refines Venezuelan crude oil ran its refinery  optimization model for us to illustrate the impact of switching crude oil  types on its refining costs. Its model showed that replacing a large quantity  of the Venezuelan oil that it uses on a regular basis with oil from Mexico  and the Middle East would cause a 7 percent drop in the capacity  utilization of one of its refineries. This would reduce supplies of petroleum  products, putting upward pressure on consumer prices.", "The DOE contractor who developed the model acknowledged that the  model does not account for the effects of higher transportation costs or  changes in refinery capacity utilization caused by switching from one type  of crude oil to another. He said that higher transportation costs and  switching crude oil types could result in larger impacts than the model  predicts, but that the price impact of switching crude oil types is not  understood well enough to be accurately modeled and is likely to be small.", "We also did an analysis of the impact of the same hypothetical Venezuelan  disruption scenario on world oil price and on U.S. GDP using parameters  developed by EIA to evaluate oil price disruptions. EIA has also done  similar analyses, including (1) a slightly larger oil supply disruption and (2)  an analysis of the impacts of the actual Venezuelan strike. The impacts on  the price of oil are quite close in all the analyses. However, the impacts on  U.S. GDP vary significantly as a result of differing assumptions about how  sensitive the economy is to increases in oil prices.

The  impact of an embargo would be smaller because the Venezuelan oil would  go to other destinations instead of being taken off of the world market.  However, since most replacement supplies are farther away than  Venezuela, U.S. oil refiners would experience higher costs and delays in  getting oil supplies; such an embargo would therefore increase U.S.  consumer prices for gasoline and other petroleum products in the short  term. Also, as discussed previously, some U.S. refineries that are designed  to handle large amounts of Venezuelan heavy sour crude oil would operate  less efficiently if they had to switch to different types of crude oil.", "EIA\u2019s March 2005 analysis estimated that a Venezuelan oil embargo against  the United States would cause the price of West Texas Intermediate crude  oil (a commonly used benchmark oil) to increase in the short term by $4 to  $6 per barrel from the then-current price of $53 per barrel\u2014an increase of  between 8 to 11 percent, as opposed to the 19 to 34 percent increase  associated with a sudden and severe loss of oil. The price would rise  because the embargo would cause (1) higher transportation costs resulting  from longer distances to transport oil from locations farther away than  Venezuela; (2) refinery inefficiencies resulting from switching crude oil  types; and (3) a market psychology premium reflecting fears of further  escalation.", "The EIA analysis did not quantify the impact of an oil embargo on U.S.  prices of gasoline and other refined petroleum products. However, an  increase in U.S. crude oil prices by 8 to 11 percent per barrel would raise  costs of refined petroleum products to the extent that the increase would  be passed on to the consumer. All else being equal, such an increase would  add 11 to 15 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline, assuming the  conditions in March 2005.", "DOE officials told us that their analysis assumes the $4 to $6 per barrel  increase would last as long as the disruption. However, adjustments would  reduce this price impact over time. Refineries, for example, could  reconfigure some of their processes and make other adjustments over time  to improve their ability to efficiently handle replacement crude oil types.  Transportation costs could also adjust over time. For example, Venezuela  likely could switch from the relatively small tankers used for the short  haul to the United States to very large tankers to move its oil to more  distant locations, thereby helping offset Venezuela\u2019s increased  transportation costs for shipping the oil longer distances.", "A Venezuelan oil embargo against the United States would also affect the  Venezuelan economy, but the impact would not be as great as the impact  of a sudden loss of oil. According to a U.S. company that produces oil in  Venezuela, such an embargo would reduce PDVSA\u2019s oil revenues from  between $3\u20134 billion dollars per year due to the following factors:    Refinery operations that Venezuela wholly and partly owns in the United  States, which take about 70 percent of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports to the  United States, would be adversely affected by the embargo because they  would have to obtain crude oil from locations farther away than Venezuela  and the replacement crude oil would likely be of a different quality.", "Venezuela\u2019s crude oil revenues would be adversely affected by the higher  cost of transporting oil to locations farther away than the United States  market.", "In addition, oil company officials and industry experts told us that few  countries have significant refining capacity that is designed to efficiently  process the heavy sour oil from Venezuela.

The  impacts would be obviously most severe in the United States, although  increased demand by U.S. oil companies to buy petroleum products from  other countries could cause prices to rise in those countries as well.

The goal of this activity was to stimulate dialogue and  cooperation on energy issues among countries in the Western Hemisphere  and identify and promote actions to foster regional interconnections  through the development of energy sector projects in the hemisphere. As  the coordinators, DOE and Venezuela\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum  organized a series of hemispheric-wide summit meetings to discuss energy  cooperation beginning in 1995. For example, at the third hemispheric  meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, in January 1998, officials from the 26  countries in attendance agreed to promote policies that facilitated trade in  the energy sector and facilitate the development of the energy  infrastructure, develop regulatory frameworks that are transparent and  predictable, and promote foreign private investment in the sector  throughout the hemisphere. DOE officials told us that this initiative ended  with the meeting in Mexico in 2002, but that, in 2004, Trinidad offered to  host a meeting of hemispheric energy ministers in a less formal setting to  discuss energy security. The meeting, which was held in Trinidad and  Tobago in April 2004, was organized by DOE and Trinidad, without  Venezuela playing a significant role organizationally. The meeting focused  on hemispheric energy security and included high-ranking energy officials  from 35 countries, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, and  Venezuela, as well as other key energy-producing countries from Central  and South America. DOE officials told us that, during the meeting,  Venezuela\u2019s Minister of Energy and Petroleum met with DOE\u2019s Secretary  and agreed that it was very important not to politicize the oil trade  between the United States and Venezuela and that both countries  recognized the importance of that trade.

But the relationship between the two countries with respect to  energy issues has changed in recent years\u2014some energy related activities  previously used to foster energy security have been discontinued. For  example, DOE officials told us that 3 years have elapsed since the last  formal discussion between DOE and the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy  and Petroleum regarding energy security. Also, officials in the Commerce  Department and in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative reported  there is no current engagement between them and their counterparts in  Venezuela regarding energy security. Officials in Department of State  headquarters said that they have worked hard for years to build a  productive energy relationship with Venezuela by participating in frequent  consultations with Venezuelan energy officials, meeting most recently in  March 2006. DOE officials also said they have maintained open dialogue  with Venezuelan energy officials.", "Most U.S. oil companies have not relied on assistance from the U.S.  government to help with issues in Venezuela in recent years although,  according to DOE officials, DOE stays in contact with companies  regarding the situation in Venezuela, and senior DOE officials frequently  report on the status of U.S. energy investment and overall energy  production in Venezuela at senior-level meetings of the U.S. government.  The U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela told us he does not have good access  to Venezuelan government officials and, correspondingly, it is difficult to  help U.S. companies doing business in Venezuela obtain access to  Venezuelan officials. Officials in the Departments of Commerce and State,  and in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, told us companies that  might otherwise seek their assistance in negotiating with foreign  governments do not do so in Venezuela because the companies do not  believe that federal agency intervention would be helpful. For example, an  official from the Department of Commerce said that U.S. government  involvement would be extremely harmful to the relationship between U.S.  companies and their business interests in Venezuela.

Officials in the Department of State and DOE, as the lead  agencies in crafting U.S. energy security policy, consult with each other,  with other U.S. government agencies (as appropriate), and with U.S.  companies doing business in foreign countries to identify potential oil  disruptions and craft responses to the disruptions, if necessary.", "U.S. government agencies used diplomacy to mitigate the impact of the oil  disruption resulting from the Venezuelan strike. Anticipating a potential oil  supply problem in Venezuela, representatives from key DOE offices began  coordinating with the Department of State months before the strike to  produce a plan to bring together data and information about possible  supply problems and to produce an appropriate response to the potential  disruption. The overall effort was headed by the National Security Council  and top U.S. government administration officials, with Department of State  and DOE officials acting as subject experts. After the strike began, the  Department of State and DOE used diplomacy to encourage increases in  OPEC member and other countries\u2019 crude oil production by 1.3 million  barrels per day. Also, according to DOE officials, DOE officials  responsible for coordinating oil supply disruptions responses with the  International Energy Agency upgraded their day-to-day contact with  emergency response officials at the agency, focusing on the strike\u2019s  potential impacts and assessing possible mitigation measures. According  to an EIA study, most of the replacement oil came from Mexico and the  Middle East, especially Iraq.", "Not withstanding this success, most oil industry officials and experts, as  well as U.S. government officials, said that using diplomacy to obtain  additional oil likely would be less effective today because there is less  surplus oil production capacity now than there was during the Venezuelan  strike. During the Venezuelan strike, as much as 5.6 million barrels per day  of spare oil production capacity was available from several regions,  including Mexico, West Africa, and the Middle East. Now, experts say that  the total world spare production capacity is only about 1 million barrels  per day, and most of it is in Saudi Arabia. If the oil balance continues to  tighten and surplus production capacity shrinks, increasing production in  response to disruptions will be more difficult, if not impossible.", "Aside from using diplomacy, another tool for mitigating supply disruptions  is the use of oil reserves. The U.S. government can use the U.S. Strategic  Petroleum Reserve to increase the supply of crude oil available to U.S.  refineries in three ways: selling oil from the reserve, exchanging oil from  the reserve whereby Reserve oil is replaced at a specified date in the  future, and allowing oil companies to delay delivering oil to the reserve.   Federal law requires that the drawdown and sale of oil from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve be authorized by the President. However, DOE can  authorize an exchange of oil from or a delay in delivery of oil to the  Reserve.  While no set criteria exist for triggering the release of oil from  the reserve in the case of a supply disruption, U.S. agency officials told us  that, during any disruption, the Department of State and DOE provide  analytical and technical advice through the National Security Council to  help the President evaluate his options. U.S. policy makers believe that  providing oil during a supply disruption is the most efficient mechanism to  counteract the impacts of the disruption.", "The United States currently maintains about 700 million barrels of crude  oil in the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. If 1.5 million barrels a day  were released\u2014the amount of crude oil exported by Venezuela to the  United States\u2014the reserve is enough to replace over 450 days of lost  Venezuelan oil. During the Venezuelan oil strike, oil was not withdrawn  from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, mostly because other oil- producing countries increased production by 1.3 million barrels a day.  However, the U.S. government allowed U.S. oil companies to delay  delivering oil that they were committed to deliver to the U.S. Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, which added about 18 million barrels to the U.S. oil  supply available to refineries\u2014an amount equivalent to almost 1 day of  U.S. oil consumption, or almost 2 weeks of Venezuelan oil exports to the  United States.", "In addition to using the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to mitigate the  impact of a supply disruption, the United States could also benefit if the  strategic reserves of International Energy Agency member countries were  released. Each International Energy Agency member country is required to  hold stocks equal to 90 days or more of its net imports. Presently,  International Energy Agency countries hold about 4.1 billion barrels of oil  stocks. According to a DOE official, the three countries with the largest  government controlled reserves\u2014the United States, Germany, and  Japan\u2014are able to release about 8 million barrels a day at the onset of a  disruption. This quantity is equal to about 10 percent of total world oil  demand. The International Energy Agency also requires member countries  to release stocks, restrain demand, and share available oil, if necessary, in  the event of a major oil supply disruption. While there are no criteria for  triggering the release of oil from the member countries\u2019 reserves, the  International Energy Agency has specified arrangements for the  coordinated use of a drawdown, the restraint of demand, and other  measures that member countries could implement in case of a disruption.  Also, International Energy Agency officials say that a disruption of 7  percent or more of world supply is a de facto trigger.", "During the Venezuelan strike, the Department of State and DOE  maintained steady diplomatic contact with members of the International  Energy Agency to discuss the evolving situation and to share concerns in  case a drawdown of member reserves was deemed necessary. A later  International Energy Agency analysis of the Venezuelan disruption  concluded that, although International Energy Agency member-country  stocks were not used during the Venezuelan disruption, the presence of  the International Energy Agency stocks played an important role in  reassuring the market. Furthermore, the availability of government stocks  muted speculation on the markets, according to an International Energy  Agency analysis of the disruption.", "Although the U.S. government has options to mitigate impacts of short- term oil disruptions on crude oil and petroleum products prices, these  mitigating actions are not designed to address a long-term loss of  Venezuelan oil from the world market. If Venezuela fails to maintain or  expand its current level of production, the world oil market may become  even tighter than it is now, putting further pressure on both the level and  volatility of energy prices. In this context, the United States faces  challenges in the coming years that may require hard choices regarding  energy sources, foreign relations and energy-related diplomacy, and the  amount of energy Americans use.", "Officials in the four U.S. government agencies we contacted said they do  not have contingency plans to deal with oil losses specifically from  Venezuela or any other single country. Officials at the lead agencies for  energy security, the Department of State and DOE, said they do not have  specific plans because the available mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of  an oil disruption\u2014diplomacy to persuade oil-producing countries to  increase production and using oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum  Reserve\u2014are adequate to deal with disruptions from any source.  According to DOE officials, it conducts scenario analyses of the  vulnerabilities of disruptions from certain countries and relies on these  options to deal with disruptions. They said that these options have been  proven to be adequate.", "Officials in most oil companies we contacted also said they do not have  plans to deal specifically with a disruption of Venezuelan oil because, as  with any oil disruption, if a Venezuelan oil disruption were to occur they  would replace the lost oil with oil from other sources. The officials said  that oil is a fungible commodity and typically available on the spot market.  During the Venezuelan strike, for example, U.S. refiners replaced  Venezuelan crude oil with crude oil from other sources, including Mexico,  Brazil, Russia, Ecuador, and the Middle East."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Departments of State and Commerce, DOE, and the  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative with a draft of this report for their  review and comment.  The Department of State and the Office of the U.S.  Trade Representative told us that they generally agreed with the findings  of the report but did not provide written comments.  DOE and the  Department of Commerce provided written comments.  The Department  of Commerce agreed with the report\u2019s overall findings; Commerce\u2019s letter  is reproduced in appendix II.  DOE neither agreed nor disagreed with the  report\u2019s overall findings, noting that the United States has had a long and  mutually beneficial relationship with Venezuela and that our report makes  valuable points regarding the challenges facing Venezuelan crude oil  production.  However, DOE raised two issues that it contends provide an  \u201calarmist view\u201d of U.S. energy security.  DOE\u2019s concerns and our response  to them are summarized below; DOE\u2019s letter is reproduced in appendix III.   All four agencies also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "DOE\u2019s first concern is that a $23 billion loss to U.S. GDP, which we  reported and attributed to a model developed for DOE by a contractor, is  misleading and will be taken out of context because the prediction does  not take into account mitigating factors that could influence the impact of  an oil disruption on U.S. GDP.  Specifically, DOE said that the prediction  does not take into account worldwide response to an oil supply disruption,  the availability of Arab Heavy oil to replace lost Venezuelan heavy oil, and  the ability to use the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and worldwide  stocks to mitigate the impact of a disruption.  We disagree that our  reporting of the model results is misleading or out of context and believe  all the mitigating factors raised by DOE have been addressed in our report.   Contrary to DOE\u2019s assertion, the model that predicted the $23 billion loss  incorporates the worldwide response and availability of replacement oil  from surplus production capacity, such as Arab Heavy oil.  However, as  our report notes, because there is much less surplus capacity available  today than there was in winter 2002-2003 when a similar disruption  occurred as a result of the Venezuelan strike, relying on surplus capacity  would not be as effective as it was at that time.  Also, our report discusses  in detail the options the U.S. government has to mitigate the impacts of an  oil disruption, including using strategic petroleum reserves, either  unilaterally or in concert with other countries.  DOE also states that the  report does not contain an analysis of the impact of a Venezuelan oil  supply disruption on that country\u2019s economy.  We disagree with this  assertion.  Our report discusses the severe impact a Venezuelan oil  disruption would have on that country\u2019s economy\u2014the Venezuelan  national oil company is the country\u2019s largest employer, and accounts for a  third of Venezuela\u2019s GDP, four fifths of its export revenue, and half of  government revenue\u2014and notes that Venezuela would likely take steps to  correct any such disruption as soon a possible to avoid that impact.", "DOE\u2019s second concern is that by focusing on the discontinuation of  bilateral programs with Venezuela our report leads the reader to believe  that such programs could guarantee U.S. energy security.  We disagree;  nowhere in the report do we imply that such programs with Venezuela  could guarantee the United States\u2019 energy security.  On the contrary, we  point out that instability in Venezuela\u2019s oil sector exists in a broader  context of tightening global oil supply and demand balance and that  instability of any significant individual oil-producing country can have a  significant impact on U.S. and world energy security.  Further we report  that a number of factors create energy security concerns, including a  reduction in global surplus oil production capacity in recent years, the fact  that much of the world\u2019s supply of oil is in relatively unstable regions, and  rapid growth in world oil demand that has led to a tight balance between  demand and supply.  DOE also states that our report does not address the  comprehensive actions the U.S. is taking domestically and internationally  to ensure energy security.  While a comprehensive assessment of U.S.  energy security was beyond the scope of this report, our report  nonetheless notes that the United States has long had a number of  programs and activities designed to ensure energy security.  For example,  for those initiatives identified as within the scope of our report, we listed  the 21 other countries with which the U.S. government has negotiated  bilateral technology and information exchange agreements.", "Overall, we disagree that our report, as written, presents an \u201calarmist  view\u201d of U.S. energy security.  We point out that oil supply disruptions can  have adverse economic impacts but that the U.S. government has options  to mitigate such impacts.  However, we also point out that these mitigating  options are only designed for short-term disruptions and there remain  potential long-term concerns with regard to Venezuelan oil supply in the  event that Venezuelan oil production continues to fall.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of State, the United  States Trade Representative, and the Secretary of Commerce.

(2) What are the potential impacts of a reduction in Venezuelan oil  exports, a Venezuelan embargo on oil exports to the United States, or  sudden closure of Venezuela\u2019s refineries in the United States? (3) What is  the status of U.S. government programs and activities to ensure a reliable  supply of oil from Venezuela and to mitigate the impacts of a supply  disruption? We used a number of methodological techniques to address  these issues.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed studies and analyses of the  Venezuelan oil sector and its history. We met with officials from 10 U.S.  and multinational oil companies, eight refiners, and two service  companies; industry experts from the International Energy Agency, the  Center for Strategic and International Studies, the National Petrochemical  and Refiners Association, an international energy consulting firm, and  other institutions; and officials from the Department of Energy (DOE),  Department of State, Department of Commerce, the Office of the United  States Trade Representative, the U.S. Geological Survey, and various other  U.S. government agencies.

(PDVSA) officials,  including the president, the vice president of production, and a number of  PDVSA board members and senior managers; the Venezuelan Auditor  General; members of the financial community; and other individuals with  expertise in the oil sector of Venezuela. We met with operations officials at  various oil exploration, production, and refining centers in the Maracaibo  and Faja regions of Venezuela. Both in the United States and in Venezuela,  we spoke with numerous former PDVSA employees, executives, and  directors, and oil company officials. We also collected, evaluated the  reliability of, and analyzed data on Venezuelan production, consumption,  and exports of oil and petroleum products. The sources of our data  include U.S. government agencies, especially the Energy Information  Administration (EIA); the International Energy Agency; the Venezuelan  government and PDVSA; and other governmental and private sources. We  deemed these data to be reliable for the purposes of addressing our  objectives. Regarding Venezuela\u2019s plans for future production, we  analyzed plans and data provided by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum  and PDVSA officials. We also discussed the feasibility of Venezuela  implementing its plans with Department of State and DOE officials, as well  as with numerous oil company officials and industry experts.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed several studies of the  impacts of oil disruptions, including the impact of the Venezuelan strike in  the winter of 2002\u20132003. We also analyzed current conditions in the world  oil market to evaluate what might occur if a similar disruption occurred  today. We also evaluated the potential impacts of\u2014(1) a sudden and  severe drop in Venezuelan oil exports from the world market, (2) a sudden  diversion of oil from the United States to other markets through an  embargo, and (3) the closure by Venezuela of its wholly-owned U.S.-based  refineries. Specifically, we asked a DOE contractor at the Oak Ridge  National Laboratory to use an economic oil-disruption model to analyze  the impacts of a hypothetical Venezuelan oil disruption on world oil prices  and on the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). For this analysis we  constructed a hypothetical disruption scenario similar to the one that  actually occurred during the Venezuelan oil strike in the winter of 2002\u2013 2003, but using assumptions regarding market and economic conditions  closer to those that prevailed at the time of the analysis (late 2005). We  also conducted our own analysis of the same scenario using EIA\u2019s oil  disruption rules of thumb that predict how oil prices and the U.S. GDP  respond to disruptions in world oil supplies. For the analyses of the  potential impacts of a Venezuelan embargo against the United States, we  relied largely on EIA analyses. For the impacts of Venezuela\u2019s sale or  closure of its CITGO refineries in the United States, we analyzed the  response of gasoline prices to the major loss of refinery capacity that  accompanied hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. In addition, we  discussed the impact of potential Venezuelan oil disruptions with  numerous industry experts in Venezuela and in the United States; officials  in the Departments of State and Commerce, and DOE; and International  Energy Agency officials.", "To address the third objective, we met with officials at various U.S.  government agencies, including the Departments of State and Commerce,  DOE, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, to identify the status  of programs and activities to ensure a continued supply of oil and to  mitigate a disruption of imports of crude oil and refined petroleum  products from Venezuela, as well as to determine whether the agencies  have Venezuelan-specific contingency plans.
