The fate of these  papers was up to the former president or his descendents, and some were  lost forever. In 1940, Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first president to  arrange to have a library built using privately raised funds and to then  transfer both the facility and his papers to the federal government.  Through its Office of Presidential Libraries, NARA operates presidential  libraries housing the papers of all subsequent presidents through George  W. Bush, as well as President Roosevelt\u2019s predecessor in the White  House, Herbert Hoover. At the end of a president\u2019s term, NARA staff begin  working with the president\u2019s official records and other materials. This  work goes on during library construction and during the period between  the dedication of the library facility and its transfer to the federal  government. Table 1 provides facts about the 13 presidential libraries and  museums operated by NARA.", "For most of the libraries, as the president\u2019s term was coming to a close or  after it ended, friends and supporters of the president created a private  charitable foundation to collect donations to construct a library. Under  current law, NARA collaborates with each presidential library foundation  on the construction of the library facility, and when the facility  construction is complete, the foundation deeds or gives the right to use the  library facility or a portion of the facility to NARA. The Presidential  Libraries Act of 1986 also requires that the National Archives Trust Fund  receive an operating endowment for each library before NARA can accept  the transfer of the library. These endowments fund some of the federal  government\u2019s costs for the operation and maintenance of the presidential  libraries. Figure 1 captures key steps of the current process of  establishing a presidential library. Some variations from this process may  exist.", "Each library is operated by a director who is a NARA employee, and other  library staff who are also NARA employees. The staffs typically include an  administrative officer, facility manager, education and exhibits specialists,  archivists, archives technicians, and clerks, among other staff. The  director of a presidential library is appointed by the Archivist of the United  States, the head of NARA, who consults with the former president in  selecting a candidate.", "The Office of Presidential Libraries is headed by the Assistant Archivist for  Presidential Libraries. The Office of Presidential Libraries is responsible  for overseeing the management of records at the libraries, the  development of policies and procedures for the management and  operation of presidential libraries, and the development and coordination  of plans, programs, and resource allocations at presidential libraries. The  Office of Presidential Libraries is also involved in the creation of new  presidential libraries.", "Funds appropriated by Congress support NARA\u2019s staffing, administration,  security, maintenance, and renovation projects at the library. In fiscal year  2009, NARA spent more than $68 million in appropriations to operate the  presidential libraries. In addition, for fiscal year 2009 NARA received $41.5  million in special appropriations for repairs and restoration to the John F.  Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum ($22 million), the Franklin D.  Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum ($17.5 million), and the  Lyndon Baines Johnson Library & Museum ($2 million).", "Each private foundation is operated by a director, president, or CEO and  other staff that may include a chief financial officer and director of  communications, among other positions. Foundation support enables the  libraries to expand their research and archival functions, as well as  undertake additional projects such as public outreach efforts. The  foundations\u2019 level of involvement in the activities at their associated  library, such as collaboration on public and educational programs, varies  from library to library. Foundations may also sponsor their own programs  and activities, such as hosting a lecture series or academic discussion or  producing a newsletter. NARA officials told us that, in most cases, these  kinds of programs and activities are offered in conjunction with and  supported by library staff. For example, a foundation may pay for a lecture  series that is held in NARA-controlled space.", "The foundations may also generally support their associated libraries with  additional funding for new facilities and equipment and for updating  permanent exhibits, adding program space, and giving the library the use  of foundation staff time for library activities. Foundations provide these  resources directly to their associated library. This process generally is  handled at the library level based on the relationship between the library  and the foundation. Each presidential library also has a trust fund that  receives revenue from the sale of publications, museum shop sales,  document reproductions, audio-visual reproductions, library admissions,  public space rentals, educational conferences, and interest income. Trust- fund money helps the library cover the cost of museum shop inventory,  personnel, operational and financial systems, equipment, and supplies.  These funds may also support exhibit-related and public-programming  expenses. In fiscal year 2009, the trust funds for presidential libraries had a  total end-of-year balance of approximately $15 million. In addition to trust  funds, presidential libraries also maintain funds from gifts donated to a  library for general library support or for specific projects or programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Laws and Regulations, NARA Policies, and Individual Library Agreements Provide Guidance on the Library\u2013Foundation Relationship", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Laws Govern Library Creation", "paragraphs": ["The federal laws specific to presidential libraries focus primarily on the  design and construction of library facilities and, once constructed, the  deeding of the library facilities, or the rights to use the facilities, to the  federal government.

According to NARA\u2019s General Counsel, there are no special laws  or regulations that apply only to how library employees interact with the  foundation or, if applicable, university associated with their library, but  the laws and regulations that apply throughout the federal government  also apply to library employees.", "The Hatch Act provides the rules for the activities of library employees at  events such as candidate debates or speeches by candidates that  sometimes take place at the libraries. The Hatch Act, which is enforced by  the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), prohibits certain political  activities for federal employees.

For example,  library directors have contacted NARA General Counsel to inquire about  using libraries as polling places. NARA approved the use of libraries as  polling places as long as certain requirements were met such as that no  political solicitation occurs on library-controlled property. In another  example, a local political party requested but was not allowed to hold a  political forum at the library.", "NARA officials told us that NARA does not have internal directives  specifically regarding the supervision of library and foundation staff.

These agreements differ  in format; content; and the extent to which they address use of facilities,  library and foundation staff relationships, and political activities. These  agreements must be consistent with the applicable statutes and NARA  regulations. At some libraries, the library\u2013foundation relationship is  addressed by more than one agreement due to the updating or  supplementing of original documents, or to the changing format of the  agreements over time. Some of the oldest agreements are primarily a  series of Letters of Offer and Acceptance between the foundation and the  General Services Administration (GSA), with later agreements taking the  form of a mutually signed agreement between the foundation and NARA.  For example, the Ford museum and the Hoover, Truman, Eisenhower, and  Kennedy library agreements (from 1957 to 1980) include one or more  Letters of Offer and Acceptance between the foundation and the GSA.  Later agreements from more-recently established libraries, as well as  earlier libraries that updated their agreements, include mutually signed  agreements between the foundation and NARA. Of these later agreements,  some focus on a specific project or aspect of the library\u2013foundation  relationship, while some focus broadly on the library\u2013foundation  relationship.", "We reviewed the library\u2013foundation agreements and found that, over time,  the agreements have become increasingly more detailed, especially  regarding staff, each entity\u2019s use and control of the different parts of the  facilities, and political activities. Earlier agreements are largely focused on  the transfer of property from the foundation to the United States, while  later agreements address additional aspects of the library\u2013foundation  relationship. For example, later agreements address which entity controls  specific parts of the facilities, including details related to one entity\u2019s use  of the other\u2019s space (such as the permitted purposes for using the other\u2019s  space, and reimbursing the other entity for costs associated with using its  space). Later agreements are also more likely to clarify the different roles  and responsibilities of library and foundation staff, and address activities  or tasks that library staff are not allowed to perform. Some of the later  agreements also address potential conflicts of interest between the library  and the foundation. For example, two of the later agreements state that  foundation staff are to act in the best interests of the foundation, and  NARA staff are to act in the best interests of NARA and the United States.  Regarding political activities, two of the later agreements state that library  space is not allowed to be used for partisan political activities. Also, NARA  regulations give library directors the authority to establish supplemental  policies. According to NARA officials, these supplemental policies may  provide further detail on the library\u2013foundation relationship regarding  facilities, staff, and political activities. Our review was limited to NARA- wide policies and library\u2013foundation agreements and we did not review  any local library supplemental policies.", "NARA officials explained that the written agreements between individual  libraries and the foundations are important, but that they also do not fully  prescribe the relationships between the entities. They said that the  relationships are shaped over time and by factors such as the particular  foundation\u2019s interest in collaborating with the library or doing charitable  work elsewhere. For example, the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum  and its associated foundation, the Truman Library Institute, are colocated  and often collaborate on educational programs. The foundation describes  itself as working with the library to \u201cfulfill the Truman Library\u2019s  commitment to research and education.\u201d In contrast, the mission of the  foundation associated with the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum, The  Carter Center, does not directly focus on the library, but rather \u201cto  advance peace and health worldwide.\u201d NARA officials said that interaction  between individual libraries and their foundations vary, but they also  stressed that no one foundation\u2019s emphasis is more correct than another.
