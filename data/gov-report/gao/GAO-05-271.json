Lockheed Martin won the competition, and the  program entered system development and demonstration in October 2001.", "The program\u2019s objective is to develop and deploy a technically superior  and affordable fleet of aircraft that support the warfighter in performing a  wide range of missions in a variety of theaters. The single-seat, single- engine aircraft is being designed to be self-sufficient or part of a  multisystem and multiservice operation, and to rapidly transition between  air-to-surface and air-to-air missions while still airborne. To achieve its  mission, the JSF will incorporate low observable technologies, defensive  avionics, advanced onboard and offboard sensor fusion, and internal and  external weapons. The JSF aircraft design has three variants: conventional  takeoff and landing variant for the Air Force, aircraft carrier-suitable  variant for the Navy, and short takeoff and vertical landing variant for the  Marine Corps, the United Kingdom, and the Air Force. These aircraft are  intended to replace aging fighter and attack aircraft currently in the  inventory (see table 1).", "In 2004, DOD extended the JSF program schedule to address problems  discovered during systems integration and the preliminary design review.  Design efforts revealed significant airframe weight problems that affected  the aircraft\u2019s ability to meet key performance requirements. Software  development and integration also posed a significant development  challenge. Program officials delayed the critical design reviews, first  flights of development aircraft, and the low-rate initial production decision  to allow more time to mitigate design risk and gather more knowledge  before continuing to make major investments. As a result, the initial  operational capability date was delayed. DOD is in the process of  reestablishing resource levels needed to deliver capabilities, given current  and expected future conditions. The new business case will be presented  to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) decision makers this  spring.", "A key to successful product development is the formulation of a business  case that matches requirements with resources\u2014proven technologies,  sufficient engineering capabilities, time, and funding\u2014-when undertaking  a new product development. First, the user\u2019s needs must be accurately  defined, alternative approaches to satisfying these needs properly  analyzed, and quantities needed for the chosen system must be well  understood. The developed product must be producible at a cost that  matches the users\u2019 expectations and budgetary resources. Finally, the  developer must have the resources to design and deliver the product with  the features that the customer wants and to deliver it when it is needed. If  the financial, material, and intellectual resources to develop the product  are not available, development does not go forward. If the business case  measures up, the organization commits to the development of the product,  including the financial investment. This calls for a realistic assessment of  risks and costs; doing otherwise undermines the intent of the business  case and invites failure.

In addition, the number of aircraft it plans to deliver  has been reduced. As a result, unit costs for the JSF aircraft have  increased substantially, thereby reducing the program\u2019s buying power. The  most significant quantity reduction occurred after system development  began in 2001, when the program reduced the number of aircraft it plans  to procure from 2,852 to 2,443, or by 14 percent. The Navy\u2014concerned  that it could not afford the number of tactical aircraft it planned to  purchase\u2014reduced the number of JSF aircraft for joint Navy and Marine  Corps operations from 1,089 to 680 by reducing the number of backup  aircraft needed. However, the Navy has not indicated to the developer the  exact mix of the carrier and short takeoff and vertical landing variants it  intends to purchase.", "The cost estimate to fully develop the JSF has increased by over 80  percent. DOD expected that by using a joint development program for the  three variants instead of three separate programs, JSF development costs  could be cut by about 40 percent. However, cost increases have nearly  eroded all of the estimated savings. Development costs were originally  estimated at $24.8 billion. By the 2001 system development decision, these  costs had increased by $9.6 billion largely because of a 36-month schedule  extension to allow more time to mature the mission systems and a more  mature cost estimate.", "By 2004, costs increased an additional $10.4 billion to $44.8 billion. The  program office cited several reasons, including efforts to achieve greater  international commonality, optimize engine interchangeability, refine the  estimating methodology, and extend the schedule for unexpected design  work. Almost half of this increase, $4.9 billion, was a result of an  approximately 18-month delay for unexpected design work caused by  increased aircraft weight that degraded the aircraft\u2019s key performance  capabilities.

In  1996, the program established unit flyaway cost goals for each variant,  expecting the variants to have a high degree of commonality and to be  built on a common production line. However, commonality among the  variants has decreased, and the cost to produce the aircraft has increased  (see table 3). The unit flyaway cost for the conventional takeoff and  landing variant has increased by 42 percent; the cost for the short takeoff  and vertical landing variant has increased by a range of 37 to 55 percent;  and the cost for the carrier variant has increased by a range of 29 to 43  percent. According to program data, a large part of the cost increase since  the start of development can be attributed to labor costs for building the  airframe and to the costs for producing the complex mission systems.", "With reduced quantities and increased program costs, the JSF program is  now buying fewer aircraft at a higher cost, thereby reducing the program\u2019s  buying power.

Cost reimbursement contracts provide for payment of  allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. They are  used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit  costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed- price contract. Cost reimbursement contracts require only the contractor\u2019s  \u201cbest efforts,\u201d thus placing a greater cost risk on the buyer\u2014in this case,  DOD. In contrast, a fixed-price contract provides for a pre-established  price and places more risk and responsibility for costs and resulting profit  or loss on the contractor and provides more incentive for efficient and  economical performance.

DOD has not been able to deliver on  its initial promises, and the sizable investment DOD plans to make over  the next few years greatly raises the stakes to meet future promises.

JSF\u2019s failure to adequately match requirements and resources has already  resulted in increases in cost, schedule, and performance estimates, and a  reduction in DOD\u2019s buying power. The new business case must also be  accompanied by an acquisition strategy that adopts an evolutionary  approach to product development\u2014one that enables knowledge-based  investment decisions to maximize remaining program dollars. While the  warfighter may not receive the ultimate capability initially, an evolutionary  approach provides a useful product sooner and in sufficient quantities to  start replacing the rapidly aging legacy fighter and attack force. The  decisions DOD makes now and over the next 2 years will greatly influence  the efficiency of its remaining funding\u2014over 90 percent of the $245 billion  estimated total program costs.

DOD officials  should define an affordable first increment, with its own business  case that clearly defines the warfighter\u2019s most immediate needs  and accurately identifies the resources required to deliver on this  needed capability. The business case should be established with a  high degree of confidence based on known constraints about  technology, engineering knowledge, time, and money. For those  warfighter needs that cannot be accommodated within this first  increment, the program should outline a strategy to meet these  needs through subsequent increments, each dependent on having  sufficient product knowledge to start system development and  demonstration. Each increment should be managed as a distinct  acquisition with its own business case for supporting the  investment.  (2) Develop and implement a knowledge-based acquisition approach,  as called for by best practices and DOD\u2019s acquisition policy, an  approach that ensures attainment and use of demonstrated product  knowledge before making future investments for each product  increment. Before increasing the investment in production  resources (tooling, materials, and personnel) greater than  investments already in place to support the manufacturing of  development test aircraft, the Secretary should ensure knowledge  consistent with best practices is captured. This should help  minimize the number of low-rate initial production aircraft DOD  procures on a cost reimbursement basis, reducing the potential  financial risk to the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics), provided us with written comments on a draft of this  report. The comments appear in appendix I.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary  establish an executable program that includes an affordable first  increment with its own business case that clearly defines the warfighter\u2019s  most immediate needs and accurately identifies the resources required to  deliver on this capability.  DOD stated that the JSF program acquisition  strategy is based on an appropriate balance of technical, cost, and  schedule risk considerations to achieve program objectives.  Warfighter  representatives are involved in determining the content for each block  capability, and technology maturity is factored into the decision plan that  has been endorsed by DOD leadership.  DOD stated its JSF management  practices achieve the objectives of the GAO recommendation.", "We believe DOD\u2019s acquisition strategy will not provide the full benefits of  an evolutionary approach as suggested by DOD\u2019s policy and best practices.   DOD has not structured the JSF development program into increments  managed as separate acquisitions with their own cost, schedule, and  decision milestones, making the likelihood of successful program  outcomes low.  The JSF strategy resembles other past major acquisition  programs that have attempted to achieve the ultimate capability in a single  development increment. DOD has allowed technology development to spill  over into product development, weakening any foundation for program  cost or schedule estimates.  This has led to poor outcomes for other  programs, such as the F/A-22 and Comanche, where lengthy and costly  development efforts resulted in either program cancellation or a  significant reduction in the number of systems to be acquired, a real loss in  DOD buying power.  Without a true evolutionary approach supported by a  business case for each increment, it will be difficult for the JSF program to  meet product requirements within current estimates of time and money.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation to develop and  implement a knowledge-based acquisition approach, which ensures  attainment and use of demonstrated product knowledge before making  future investments for each product increment.  The department agrees  that a knowledge-based approach is critical to making prudent acquisition  decisions and stated that its current JSF acquisition strategy incorporates  this type of approach.  The department admits it has accepted some  concurrency between development and production to reduce schedule  and cost, but it will consider the production readiness of the JSF design at  the low-rate and full-rate production decision milestones.  It states that the  new program plan includes clear entry and exit criteria for critical  milestones to ensure technologies are mature and required incremental  objectives are achieved before obligating funds.  DOD stated that it  conducts regular program reviews, and the Defense Acquisition Board will  review program readiness prior to making any milestone decision.  The  frequent rotation of program leadership ensures ongoing cooperative  oversight of emerging challenges and program decisions, and ensures  accountability for the implementation of those decisions.  Finally, DOD  states that the acquisition strategy is consistent with acquisition directives  and ensures the department commits resources only after determining that  specific developmental or knowledge-based criteria are achieved.", "We believe the JSF\u2019s acquisition strategy will not capture the right  knowledge at the right time for informed decisions on future  investments\u2014over $200 billion dollars.  The program does not have the  practices in place to capture knowledge at key junctures.  DOD will not  have captured knowledge before production starts that ensures the design  is mature, reliable, and works or that manufacturing processes are in  control---keys to successful outcomes in the production phase.  Further,  the large investments planned in production capability for the JSF over the  next few years are vulnerable to costly changes as the aircraft is still being  designed and tested.  DOD has historically developed new weapon  systems in a highly concurrent environment that usually forces acquisition  programs to manage technology, design, and manufacturing risk at the  same time.  While DOD believes it can manage the risk of concurrent  development and production by holding regular program reviews and with  entrance and exit criteria for decisions, DOD\u2019s own experience has shown  this approach to be risky and often not totally effective.  This has been  DOD\u2019s traditional approach to weapons acquisition, the same approach  that has led to programs costing significantly more than planned and  taking much longer to develop.  This environment has made it difficult to  make informed decisions because appropriate knowledge has not been  available at key decision points.  If decisions are tied to the availability of  critical knowledge, program managers can be held accountable for the  timely capture of that knowledge instead of less precise or ill-defined  criteria included in risk reduction plans.  DOD\u2019s practice of frequently  changing program managers also decreases accountability because  commitments made today will likely not be carried through by the same  managers who made the commitments.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretaries of the Air Force, Army, and Navy; and the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget.
