This report examines: (1) what is known about property in selected agencies' warehouses and how much agencies spend to store it, and (2) the extent to which selected agencies assess the ongoing need for property stored in warehouses. GAO reviewed federal statutes, regulations, and GSA's guidance; analyzed policies from three agencies\u2014FAA, Office of Science, and BOP\u2014which were selected based on total warehouse square footage, among other factors; conducted site visits to agencies' warehouses; and interviewed stakeholders such as agency officials and industry groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that three selected agencies stored a wide variety of property in their warehouses.

For example, although two of the agencies had policies about when such an assessment should occur, none of the agencies specified how it should occur for most types of property. Instead, agencies primarily relied on agency officials' professional judgment to assess ongoing need. GAO identified instances where agencies retained unneeded property absent relevant guidance. For example, one agency site had stored obsolete computers dating back to the 1990s. While the General Services Administration (GSA) drafted guidance in response to recent legislation, this guidance does not describe approaches or practices stakeholders identified as potentially useful for assessing ongoing need for property, such as periodic retention justifications, use of data analytics, and utilization reviews. Further, while GSA officials intend to put the final guidance on GSA's website and provide it to agencies that participate in a GSA-chaired committee on property management by December 2019, GSA has not provided a documented plan or a timeline for broader dissemination. Guidance that incorporates such approaches could help agencies avoid retaining property that is no longer needed and, as a result, allow them to better manage their property and use of their warehouse space."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA incorporate approaches agencies could use to assess the ongoing need for property in GSA's guidance\u2014such as periodic justifications, use of data, and utilization reviews\u2014and develop a plan for communicating the guidance government-wide.

Some of this property is in the  nearly 18,000 warehouses that take up over 90-million square feet that  these agencies reported holding and leasing in fiscal year 2018. Over the  last 4 years, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for  agencies to reduce their physical footprint, including warehouse space.  This effort presents an opportunity for agencies to review their property  inventory stored within warehouses and dispose of unneeded items.  However, we have found that federal agencies do not routinely identify  and dispose of unneeded items, which could affect their ability to reduce  warehouse space and storage costs. Recently enacted legislation, the  Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018 (FPPMA), requires  agencies to regularly assess certain types of property under their control  in accordance with guidance from the General Services Administration  (GSA). Such assessments are to include evaluating utilization and the  extent to which agencies\u2019 missions are dependent on the property being  assessed.", "You asked us to review property stored in warehouses. This report  addresses: (1) what is known about property stored in selected federal agencies\u2019 warehouses and how much they spend to store it; and (2) the  extent to which selected agencies assess the ongoing need for property  stored in warehouses.", "There are no government-wide data on the types of government property  stored in warehouses. As a result, for both of our objectives we focused  on selected departments and agencies. At the department level, to obtain  variation among the top 10 agencies by warehouse square footage, we  used the following criteria: (1) total warehouse square footage, (2) recent  changes in warehouse square footage, and (3) proportion of leased to  owned warehouse space as reported in Federal Real Property Profile  (FRPP) and Reduce the Footprint data. Within each selected  department, we then selected components with the most warehouse  square footage, with one exception. These agencies were: (1) the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) within the Department of  Transportation; (2) the Office of Science within the Department of Energy  (DOE); and (3) the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) within the Department of  Justice.", "To determine what is known about property in selected agencies\u2019  warehouses, we conducted site visits to at least one site for each agency  that was among the largest in terms of warehouse square footage and at  least one other site that was near one of the large sites, as described  below.", "FAA: Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma; the Staging Area and Mobile Asset Deployment Center in  Independence, Missouri; and Charles B.

Information obtained from these sites and regional officials is not  generalizable to the selected agencies, and information from the selected  agencies is not generalizable to other agencies.", "To determine how much selected agencies spend to store property in  warehouses, including the numbers and square footage of these  warehouses, we reviewed fiscal year 2018 FRPP data for information on  FAA and BOP because that was the most recent data available when we  conducted our analysis. For the Office of Science, we reviewed DOE data  because DOE reports most information to FRPP at the department level  rather than for specific offices, such as the Office of Science, and we  used fiscal year 2018 data to cover the same period covered by the  FRPP data. Both FRPP and DOE data included information about direct  costs for warehouses such as rent, operations, and maintenance costs.  We reviewed documentation related to these data sources, interviewed  knowledgeable officials, and determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for providing information about warehouse numbers, square  footage, and costs.", "To determine the extent to which selected agencies assess the ongoing  need for property stored in warehouses, we analyzed their policies and  procedures related to property management, including policies for  identifying and disposing of unneeded property. We interviewed officials  at the sites we visited about their processes for identifying and disposing  of unneeded property and challenges in identifying unneeded property.  To obtain a government-wide perspective on these issues, we reviewed  GSA guidance and relevant industry standards related to property storage  and warehousing practices. We also interviewed a standards-setting  organization and two industry stakeholders selected based on their  knowledge about property management practices to discuss property  storage and warehousing processes, practices, and standards that  agencies could use to assess the ongoing need for property. In addition,  we invited participants from the Interagency Committee on Property  Management (ICPM)\u2014a committee chaired by GSA that consists of  executive agency representatives interested in federal property\u2014to speak  with us regarding their practices for identifying unneeded property and  interviewed the four agencies that volunteered to participate. Finally, we  reviewed FPPMA\u2019s requirements and interviewed GSA\u2019s Office of  Government-wide Policy officials about GSA\u2019s role in assisting agencies  in identifying unneeded federal property, how FPPMA could affect GSA\u2019s  roles and responsibilities going forward, and GSA\u2019s progress in  implementing FPPMA.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal law requires executive agencies to: maintain adequate inventory controls and accountability systems for  property under their control;  continuously survey property under their control to identify excess;  and promptly report excess property to GSA and generally dispose of it in  accordance with GSA regulations so that it can be made available to  other federal agencies and stakeholders for reuse.", "In addition, the FPPMA requires agencies to assess accountable property  within their control in accordance with guidance from GSA. Property can  be accountable or non-accountable. Accountable property is property  with a useful life of at least 2 years that an agency determines should be  tracked in its property records. Each agency determines what  constitutes accountable property for that agency, and for our selected  agencies, consideration is given to an item\u2019s acquisition cost and other  factors, such as ease of theft and sensitivity. For our three selected  agencies, these acquisition cost thresholds ranged from $5,000 to  $10,000 in fiscal year 2018. Non-accountable property is property that  does not meet the agency\u2019s definition of accountable property and may  include items such as office furniture and printers. Agencies typically do  not track non-accountable property unless they need to for specific  purposes, such as managing inventory levels.", "Some agency property is located in warehouses. For the purpose of this  report, we used the definition of \u201cwarehouse\u201d in FRPP guidance:  \u201cbuildings used for storage, such as ammunition storage, covered sheds,  and buildings primarily used for storage of vehicles or materials.\u201d This  term encompasses a broad array of property that agencies may classify  differently for internal purposes but classify as warehouses for FRPP  reporting in the absence of more precise categories. For example, some  buildings that DOE reports as warehouses in FRPP are specialized  facilities for storing nuclear and nuclear-contaminated material. In the  absence of an FRPP category for nuclear storage, these buildings are  classified in FRPP as warehouses. In a similar manner, FAA classified as  warehouses in FRPP buildings used to house air traffic support systems,  such as approach lighting systems, because no other category in FRPP  was a better fit.", "GSA\u2019s role in agencies\u2019 management of property they have acquired,  whether in warehouses or elsewhere, is limited until an agency declares  that property as excess. Once property is declared excess, it can be  transferred to another agency or certain non-federal recipients, donated,  sold, abandoned, or destroyed. GSA has issued regulations that govern  agencies\u2019 actions in the property disposal process, and it administers a  web-based system that facilitates property disposal. However, prior to an  agencies\u2019 identifying property as excess, GSA\u2019s authority to issue  regulations or formal guidance regarding agencies\u2019 management of  property is limited to topics that have been specifically assigned to the  GSA Administrator, according to GSA officials.", "GSA distinguishes between formal guidance and informal guidance, and  GSA officials explained this distinction as follows. Formal guidance, such  as a Federal Management Regulation bulletin, must be reviewed by GSA  management and general counsel officials. For example, in 2017 GSA  issued a Federal Management Regulation bulletin on warehousing that  summarized industry perspectives from two voluntary consensus  standards, which were published by ASTM International\u2019s asset  management committee and which GSA had participated in developing.  One standard addressed storage of property and the other addressed  strategic warehousing. GSA officials stated they were authorized to  include content on property management in the bulletin under the  authority of GSA\u2019s real-property policy program because the content  supported the real property goal of reducing the federal government\u2019s real  property footprint. In contrast, informal guidance does not require review  by GSA management or general counsel officials but may be published  on GSA\u2019s website or disseminated at GSA trainings. Whether formal or  informal, agencies are not required to adhere to such guidance.", "Typically, within agencies, responsibility for managing property is  generally shared between property officials and property custodians.  Property officials\u2019 primary responsibilities relate to property management.  For example, they may be responsible for updating property data  systems, providing property lists and instructions for property inventories,  resolving issues that arise with property management, and managing the  disposal process after a property custodian has determined that an item  is no longer needed. Property custodians are generally program  managers who are assigned responsibility for specific property items  associated with the program they manage as an ancillary duty. For  example, property custodians may be required to conduct physical  inventories of property assigned to their program and work with a property  official to resolve any issues arising during the inventory. Depending on  how an agency uses its warehouses and property, property custodians  may be responsible for property in a single warehouse, in multiple  warehouses, or in a variety of locations. Moreover, multiple property  custodians may be responsible for property in a single warehouse, as  depicted in figure 1."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Stored Various Types of Property in Warehouses but Had Limited Information about Storage Costs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Agencies Stored a Variety of Property in Warehouses", "paragraphs": ["The three selected agencies had a total of 1,221 warehouses, with over  6.4-million square feet, that contained a broad array of property.  Although comprehensive data on property in these agencies\u2019 warehouses  were unavailable, interviews, site visits, and agencies\u2019 data on  warehouses themselves provided some information on the types of  property in them. We found that the agencies had some commonalities in  the contents of their warehouses. For example, all three had warehouses  that contained material-handling equipment, such as fork lifts, as well as  excess property being processed for disposal. However, much of the  property in agencies\u2019 warehouses was specific to their missions,  according to agency officials and our observations. Table 1 includes  information about the agencies\u2019 warehouses and examples of the types of  agency-specific property in them.", "We also visited warehouses at each of the selected agencies to obtain  additional information about and view the types of property stored within  them, as described below.", "FAA. FAA had warehouses at four main sites that contained property  specific to the sites\u2019 missions, and most of the remaining warehouses  were buildings that contained equipment, tools, or materials to maintain  aviation support systems or housed support systems, such as approach  lighting systems, according to our analysis of FAA warehouse data, FAA  officials, and sites we visited. For example, we visited FAA\u2019s warehouses  at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, including the Logistics  Support Facility, FAA\u2019s largest warehouse and central location for  maintaining and repairing aviation support systems deployed throughout  the national airspace system. Most items in the warehouse were spare  parts, materials, and systems or system components that had been sent  to the facility for repair. We also visited FAA\u2019s Staging Area, which  supports FAA\u2019s manufacture and assembly of new systems to be  deployed throughout the country. Accordingly, much of the property at the  two warehouses that comprise this facility was equipment, parts, and  material, along with the machines and tools to manufacture and assemble  the material. For example, we viewed components of a wind shear alert  system that were being prepared to be shipped. FAA\u2019s Mobile Asset  Deployment Center stored and maintained FAA\u2019s mobile assets, such as  air traffic control towers and housing units that FAA deploys to maintain  service during disruptions such as natural disasters. Finally, we visited a  96-square-foot shack\u2014identified in FRPP as a warehouse and pictured  below\u2014that housed an approach lighting system.

Warehouses at the two national  laboratories we visited\u2014Argonne National Laboratory and Fermi National  Accelerator Laboratory\u2014contained a broad variety of equipment,  including equipment being staged for near-term use and equipment in  longer-term storage specifically designated for future projects. For  example, one warehouse at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory  contained a cryogenic system acquired by CERN, the European  Organization for Nuclear Research, as its contribution to a planned  experiment. This cryogenic system will be used for cooling purposes. A  warehouse at the same site also contained some decades-old items kept  as replacements for items still in use. According to officials, many of these  older items would be difficult to obtain in a reasonable time frame for a  reasonable price if a replacement were needed. In addition, at Fermi  National Accelerator Laboratory, we saw a large, out-of-use calorimeter\u2014 a device commonly used in physics experiments\u2014that was being stored  for eventual use in an educational display. Warehouses also contained  parts, materials, and supplies for laboratory use. (See fig. 3 for examples  of Office of Science warehouses and property.)", "BOP. Most of the BOP warehouses were located at correctional  institutions throughout the country, served similar functions, and  contained similar types of property for inmate use, according to BOP  headquarters officials and our review of BOP real property data. The two  correctional institutions we visited each had a warehouse that served as a  distribution center, where items arriving at the institution were received,  processed, and sent to the appropriate personnel within the institution,  and a food service warehouse, where food items used to feed the inmate  population were stored. At one institution, non-perishable items for inmate  use, such as uniforms, mattresses, soap, and toilet paper were stored at  the distribution center, while the other institution we visited stored less  property at the distribution center and expedited delivery to the relevant  division. Additionally, one institution used a warehouse to store dairy  equipment in support of an inmate-run dairy.

Two features of  how these agencies track property and warehouse costs would make it  difficult to do so. First, as mentioned above, selected agencies did not  have comprehensive information on items in warehouses, information that  would be needed to determine per-item storage costs. Second, selected  agencies generally incurred direct costs\u2014rent, operations costs, and  maintenance costs\u2014at a warehouse level. However, because a  warehouse may have had some of its square footage dedicated to other  uses, such as office or laboratory space, it would be difficult to ascertain  what percentage of costs would be allocated to storage versus these  other uses. Moreover, in some cases, operations costs, such as utilities,  were incurred at a multi-building level, making it difficult to determine what  portion of the bill is attributable to a single warehouse. Finally, selected  agencies generally did not track indirect costs, such as personnel costs  for conducting regular inventories and other administrative costs  associated with storing property in their warehouses, according to agency  officials.", "While none of the selected agencies systematically tracked property  storage costs, we did identify one Office of Science site, one Department  of Transportation site, and one Department of Justice site that analyzed  the use of specific portions of warehouses for cost allocation purposes.  Officials at these agencies said that this approach may create incentives  for property custodians to identify excess property in a timelier manner.", "Argonne National Laboratory, within the DOE\u2019s Office of Science,  annually analyzes direct costs for each building, including  warehouses, and charges each division within the laboratory for the  space it occupies.

The departments charge users for the portions of the  warehouses they occupy.", "While these approaches may create incentives to identify unneeded  property in a timely manner, they may not be applicable for all  circumstances. For example, staff at Fermi National Accelerator  Laboratory stated that they explored the cost and benefits of analyzing  space use to allocate costs by user but had not found it to be cost- effective or feasible. In addition, allocating costs based on warehouse  usage would be challenging if users\u2019 space usage changes regularly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Without Guidance, Selected Agencies Did Not Systematically Assess the Ongoing Need for Property in Their Warehouses Two of the Three Agencies Specified When to Identify Some Types of Unneeded Property, but None Speciied How to Assess Most Items for Ongoing Need", "paragraphs": ["Two of the three agencies we reviewed had policies in place explaining  the frequency in which property custodians should assess property for  ongoing need. Specifically, the Office of Science and BOP had policies  that called for identifying unneeded property beyond the statutory  requirement to continually survey property to identify excess. For  example, DOE regulations, which cover the Office of Science, require  managers to perform walkthroughs at least every 2 years to identify  unneeded property. According to officials, these walkthroughs are  conducted by contractors that manage national laboratories. Similarly,  BOP policy requires that property custodians conduct an annual site  inspection to identify unneeded property prior to the annual inventory,  and, according to officials, this process is overseen by the institution\u2019s  associate warden. In contrast, FAA policy does not set any timeframe  for property custodians to identify unneeded property. However,  according to one FAA headquarters official, assessing property for  ongoing need is inherent to the inventory process, which, according to  FAA policy, should occur at least every 3 years for accountable  property.", "In addition, only DOE had specific requirements to determine if property is  needed. Specifically, DOE regulation requires written justification for  retention of property classified as equipment held for future projects. If  equipment is retained for longer than a year, the justification is to be  reviewed by a higher level of authority, and retention of such equipment  for longer than 3 years requires approval by the head of the DOE field  organization. The Office of Science Organizational Property  Management Officer\u2014who is responsible for reviewing contractors that  manage Office of Science sites\u2014reviewed  sites\u2019 adherence to this  requirement using metrics, such as acquisition date and time in storage,  according to officials.", "Beyond this particular requirement for DOE, none of the agencies had a  systematic way to identify property that may be unneeded. Instead, they  primarily relied on professional judgment to determine the ongoing need  for property in warehouses in the absence of guidance on how to  determine whether property is still needed. For example, FAA officials  confirmed that they do not have guidance or metrics on how to identify  unneeded property and typically rely on property custodians\u2019 professional  judgment. According to officials at one FAA site we visited, property  custodians do not use specific criteria for identifying unneeded property  because it is obvious when items are no longer needed. Similarly, at the  BOP institutions we visited, officials confirmed that they rely on property  custodians\u2019 professional judgment, along with the judgment of associate  wardens, to identify unneeded property during the annual site inspections,  but acknowledged that this has led to different outcomes. For example, at  one site we visited, site officials stated that some associate wardens are  more inclined than others to require property custodians to identify  property as unneeded.", "While officials at all of the selected agencies said they believed property  custodians were able to identify unneeded property in a timely manner  using their professional judgement, we identified instances, through our  interviews and agency assessments, where agencies had retained  unneeded property in storage.

The report  recommended that the contractor review all IT equipment for  continued need and that certain items be removed from the active  inventory in their asset management system.", "BOP headquarters officials told us that, when assisting regional office  personnel in training a new property official at an institution, they  noticed the institution was storing inmate clothing that exceeded the  institution\u2019s needs.

One agency  implemented a policy in 2013 requiring written justification to retain  certain accountable property for certain time periods, with the time  period varying for different types of property. After the initial storage  time period, written justification for continued storage must be  reviewed and approved by an official who is above the property  custodian. According to property officials, this policy has contributed  to an estimated 35 to 40 percent reduction of property held in storage.", "Data analytics. Officials from another agency stated that they use a  logistics management application to track and analyze information,  such as property age, amount, rate of usage, and warehouse space  availability. As a result, the agency has identified and disposed of  excess property at various warehouses that otherwise would likely  have been retained. For example, according to officials, analysis  conducted using this application on idle property in one warehouse  informed the decision to identify as unneeded a significant amount of  furniture. A previous manager had acquired the furniture for use in  staff housing, but the items were not well-suited to available housing  in the area.", "Utilization reviews. Industry groups we interviewed advocated for  increased use of data to assess utilization to inform decisions on  whether to retain stored property, such as utilization reviews that  systematically assess property utilization and continued need. For  example, when conducting a utilization review, one stakeholder  recommended a process that begins with pinpointing where the  inactive population of property items reside. Upon locating anything  that has been inactive for a certain period of time, within a certain  storage area, those items are identified as candidates for disposal.

More broadly, agencies across the  government are operating without the benefit of government-wide  guidance that could help assess their property for ongoing need in a  systematic manner. With the recent enactment of FPPMA, an opportunity  exists for GSA to develop and communicate guidance to help agencies  assess property utilization and identify unneeded property in warehouses  more efficiently that includes practices GSA identifies as being useful.  Such guidance could help agencies avoid retaining property that is no  longer needed and, as a result, allow them to better manage the use of  their warehouse space."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["The Administrator of GSA should direct the Office of Government-wide  Policy (1) to incorporate into its guidance approaches or practices that  agencies could use to assess utilization of and the ongoing need for  property\u2014approaches such as recommendations for periodic  justifications, data analytics, and utilization reviews\u2014and (2) to develop a  plan and timelines for communicating the guidance to agencies  government-wide.

We limited our scope to civilian agencies because we have  already done extensive work on property management within Department  of Defense. At the department level, we used Reduce the Footprint data  from fiscal year 2017 because they were the most current data available  when we conducted the analysis to identify the top 10 departments in  terms of warehouse square footage. To obtain variation among these  agencies, we categorized these departments as large, medium, or small  in terms of warehouse square footage and selected one from each  category based on changes in square footage between fiscal years 2015  and 2017 using fiscal year 2017 Reduce the Footprint data and on the  proportion of leased warehouse space to owned warehouse space using  fiscal year 2017 Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) data. Because  none of the selected agencies manages property at the department level,  we then selected a component within each department. For the  Department of Transportation and the Department of Justice, we selected  the components with the most warehouse square footage according to  fiscal year 2017 FRPP data\u2014FAA and BOP, respectively. For DOE, we  used the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2017 real property data to identify the  components with the most warehouse square footage because DOE  reports most information to FRPP at the department level rather than for  specific offices, such as the Office of Science. We then selected the  Office of Science, which had third highest amount of warehouse square  footage, because of security concerns with one of the components with  more warehouse square footage and because the other component with  more warehouse square footage used a greater proportion of warehouse  space to store nuclear and nuclear-related material.", "To determine what is known about property in selected agencies\u2019  warehouses, we interviewed headquarters-level officials regarding the  agencies\u2019 property data, conducted site visits to view and photograph  property stored in warehouses, and gathered information in interviews  with agency officials. In selecting sites, we selected at least one site per  agency that was among the largest in terms of warehouse square feet for  that agency and at least one other site that was near one of the large  sites, as described below:", "FAA: Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma; Staging Area and Mobile Asset Deployment Center in  Independence, Missouri; and Charles B. Wheeler Downtown airport in  Kansas City, Missouri.", "Office of Science: Argonne National Laboratory and Fermi National  Accelerator Laboratory in the Chicago area.", "BOP: U.S. Penitentiary Leavenworth in Leavenworth, Kansas, and  Federal Correctional Institute El Reno in El Reno, Oklahoma.", "For each agency, we also interviewed officials at the headquarters and  regional levels. Information obtained from these sites and regional  officials is not generalizable to the selected agencies, and information  from these agencies is not generalizable to other agencies.", "To determine how much selected agencies spend to store property in  warehouses, as well as the numbers and square footage of these  warehouses, we analyzed FRPP data from fiscal year 2018 for FAA and  BOP, and DOE fiscal year 2018 real property data for the Office of  Science because DOE reported most data to FRPP at the department  level; both sources included information about direct costs such as rent,  operations, and maintenance costs. We used FRPP data from fiscal year  2018 because that was the most recent data available when we  conducted our analysis and DOE data covering the same period to be  consistent. We reviewed documentation related to these data sources,  interviewed knowledgeable officials, and determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for providing information about warehouse numbers,  square footage, and the costs listed above.", "To determine the extent to which selected agencies assess the ongoing  need for property stored in warehouses, we reviewed statutes,  regulations, GSA guidance, our prior work, reports by federal agencies\u2019  Offices of Inspector General, and relevant industry standards related to  property storage and warehousing practices. In addition, for selected  agencies we analyzed property policies and procedures for identifying  and disposing of unneeded property and interviewed headquarters,  regional, and site officials. We also interviewed three industry  stakeholders\u2014two property-management and one standards-setting  organization\u2014to discuss property storage and warehousing processes,  practices, and standards that agencies could use to assess the ongoing  need for property. We selected these organizations based on their  knowledge about property management practices. Furthermore, we  interviewed officials from four agencies\u2014Census Bureau, Department of  State, Internal Revenue Service, and National Aeronautics and Space  Administration\u2014that participate in the Interagency Committee on Property  Management (ICPM), a committee chaired by GSA that consists of  executive agency representatives interested in federal property. We  invited all ICPM participants to speak with us regarding their practices for  identifying unneeded property and interviewed all participants who  volunteered to participate to understand how other agencies assess  property for ongoing need. Finally, we reviewed FPPMA\u2019s requirements  and interviewed GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy officials about  GSA\u2019s role in assisting agencies in identifying unneeded federal property,  how FPPMA could affect GSA\u2019s roles and responsibilities going forward,  and GSA\u2019s progress in implementing FPPMA.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2018 to December  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
