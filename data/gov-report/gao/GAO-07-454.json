DHS began operations in March 2003 with the mission to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce vulnerabilities, minimize damages from attacks, and aid in recovery efforts. GAO has reported that the creation of DHS was an enormous management challenge and that the size, complexity, and importance of the effort made the challenge especially daunting and critical to the nation's security. Our prior work on mergers and acquisitions found that successful transformations of large organizations, even those faced with less strenuous reorganizations than DHS, can take at least 5 to 7 years to achieve. GAO was asked to report on DHS's progress in implementing its mission and management areas and challenges DHS faces. This report also discusses key themes that have affected DHS's implementation efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["At the time of its creation in 2003 as one of the largest federal reorganizations in the last several decades, we designated the implementation and transformation of DHS as a high-risk area due to the magnitude of the challenges it confronted in areas vital to the physical and economic well being of the nation. After 4 years into its overall integration effort, DHS has attained some level of progress in all of its mission and management areas. The rate of progress, however, among these areas varies. Key underlying themes have affected DHS's implementation efforts, and will be essential for the department to address as it moves forward. These include management, risk management, information sharing, and partnerships and coordination. For example, while DHS has made progress in transforming its component agencies into a fully functioning department, it has not yet addressed key elements of the transformation process, such as developing a comprehensive strategy for agency transformation and ensuring that management systems and functions are integrated. This lack of a comprehensive strategy and integrated management systems and functions limits DHS's ability to carry out its homeland security responsibilities in an effective, risk-based way. DHS also has not yet fully adopted and applied a risk management approach in implementing its mission and management functions. Some DHS component agencies, such as the Transportation Security Administration and the Coast Guard, have taken steps to do so, but DHS has not yet taken sufficient actions to ensure that this approach is used departmentwide. In addition, DHS has taken steps to share information and coordinate with homeland security partners, but has faced difficulties in these partnership efforts, such as in ensuring that the private sector receives better information on potential threats. Given DHS's dominant role in securing the homeland, it is critical that the department's mission and management programs are operating as efficiently and effectively as possible. DHS has had to undertake these responsibilities while also working to transform itself into a fully functioning cabinet department--a difficult task for any organization. As DHS moves forward, it will be important for the department to continue to develop more measurable goals to guide implementation efforts and to enable better accountability of its progress toward achieving desired outcomes. It will also be important for DHS to continually reassess its mission and management goals, measures, and milestones to evaluate progress made, identify past and emerging obstacles, and examine alternatives to address those obstacles and effectively implement its missions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently passed its 4 year  anniversary, and this anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the  progress it has made since its establishment, determine challenges the  department has faced in implementing its mission and management areas,  and identify issues that will be important for the department to address as  it moves forward. Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, DHS  began operations in March 2003 with missions that include preventing  terrorist attacks from occurring within the United States, reducing U.S.  vulnerability to terrorism, minimizing the damages from attacks that  occur, and helping the nation recover from any attacks. Over the past   4 years, the department has initiated and continued the implementation of  various policies and programs to address these missions as well as its  nonhomeland security functions. In particular, DHS has implemented  programs to secure the border and administer the immigration system;  strengthen the security of the transportation sector; and defend against,  prepare for, and respond to threats and disasters. DHS has also taken  actions to integrate its management functions and to transform its  component agencies into an effective cabinet department.", "We have evaluated many of DHS\u2019s programs and management functions  since the department\u2019s establishment. We have issued over 400 products  on major departmental programs in the areas of border security and  immigration; transportation security; defense against, preparedness for,  and response to threats and disasters; and the department\u2019s management  functions\u2014including acquisition, financial, human capital, information  technology, and real property management. In November 2006, we  provided congressional leadership with a list of government programs,  functions, and activities that warrant further congressional oversight.  Among the issues included were border security and immigration  enforcement, security of transportation modes, preparedness and  response for catastrophic threats, and DHS implementation and  transformation. We have also reported on broad themes that have  underpinned DHS\u2019s implementation efforts, including agency  transformation, strategic planning and results management, risk  management, information sharing, and partnerships and coordination. We  have made about 700 recommendations to DHS on ways to improve its  operations and address these key themes, such as to develop performance  measures and set milestones for key programs, allocate resources based  on assessments of risk, and develop and implement internal controls to  help ensure program effectiveness. DHS has implemented some of these  recommendations, taken actions to address others, and taken other steps  to strengthen its mission activities and facilitate management integration.  However, we have reported that the department still has much to do to  ensure that it conducts its missions efficiently and effectively while  simultaneously preparing to address future challenges that face the  department and the nation.", "In 2003, we designated the implementation and transformation of DHS as  high-risk because it represented an enormous undertaking that would  require time to achieve in an effective and efficient manner. Additionally,  the components merged into DHS already faced a wide array of existing  challenges, and any DHS failure to effectively carry out its mission could  expose the nation to potentially serious consequences. The area has  remained on our high-risk list since 2003. Most recently, in our January  2007 high-risk update, we reported that although the department had made  some progress transforming its 22 agencies into an effective, integrated  organization, DHS had not yet developed a comprehensive management  integration strategy and its management systems and functions\u2014 especially related to acquisition, financial, human capital, and information  management\u2014were not yet fully integrated and wholly operational. We  also noted that DHS faces a number of challenges to effectively carry out  its program activities and enhance partnerships with private and public  sector entities to leverage resources. We concluded that this array of  management and programmatic challenges continues to limit DHS\u2019s ability  to fulfill its homeland security roles in an effective, risk-based way.  Furthermore, in 2005 we designated information sharing for homeland  security as high-risk, and in 2006 we identified the National Flood  Insurance Program as high-risk. In 2003 we expanded the scope of the  high-risk area involving federal information security, which was initially  designated as high-risk in 1997, to include the protection of the nation\u2019s  computer-reliant critical infrastructure. We identified information sharing  for homeland security as high-risk because of the lack of strategic plans;  established processes, procedures, and mechanisms; and incentives for  sharing information. We identified the National Flood Insurance Program  as high-risk because it was highly unlikely that the program would  generate sufficient revenues to repay funds borrowed from the Treasury to  cover claims during catastrophic loss years and because of concerns  related to the program\u2019s financial resources, compliance with mandatory  purchase requirements, and the costly impact of repetitive loss properties.  We expanded the scope of the federal information security high-risk area  to include the protection of the nation\u2019s computer-reliant critical  infrastructure because, as the focal point of federal efforts, DHS had not  yet completely fulfilled any of its key responsibilities for enhancing cyber  security.", "In designating the implementation and transformation of DHS as high-risk,  we noted that the creation of DHS was an enormous management  challenge. The size, complexity, and importance of the effort made the  challenge especially daunting and incomparably critical to the nation\u2019s  security. We noted that building an effective department would require  consistent and sustained leadership from top management to ensure the  needed transformation of disparate agencies, programs, and missions into  an integrated organization. Our prior work on mergers and acquisitions,  undertaken before the creation of DHS, found that successful  transformations of large organizations, even those faced with less  strenuous reorganizations than DHS, can take 5 to 7 years to achieve. We  reported that in successful transformations, organizations undergo a  change of their cultures to become more results-oriented, client- and  customer-oriented, and collaborative in nature. To successfully transform,  an organization must fundamentally reexamine its processes,  organizational structures, and management approaches. Organizational  changes such as these are complex and cannot be accomplished overnight.  In the case of DHS, it will likely take at least several more years for the  department to complete its transformation efforts. We also have  recommended that Congress continue to monitor whether it needs to  provide additional leadership authorities to the DHS Under Secretary for  Management or create a Chief Operating Officer/Chief Management  Officer position that could help elevate, integrate, and institutionalize  DHS\u2019s management initiatives. The Implementing Recommendations of the  9/11 Commission Act of 2007, enacted in August 2007, designates the  Under Secretary for Management as the Chief Management Officer and  principal advisor on management-related matters to the Secretary. Under  the Act, the Under Secretary is responsible for developing a transition and  succession plan for the incoming Secretary and Under Secretary to guide  the transition of management functions to a new administration. The Act  further authorizes the incumbent Under Secretary as of November 8, 2008  (after the next presidential election), to remain in the position until a  successor is confirmed to ensure continuity in the management functions  of DHS.", "You asked us to review our past work on DHS and provide an assessment  of DHS\u2019s progress and challenges during its first 4 years. This report  addresses the following questions: (1) What progress has DHS made in  implementing key mission and core management functions since its  inception, and what challenges has the department faced in its  implementation efforts? (2) What key themes have affected DHS\u2019s  implementation of its mission and management functions?", "DHS\u2019s major mission and management areas include border security;  immigration enforcement; immigration services; aviation security; surface  transportation security; maritime security; emergency preparedness and  response; critical infrastructure and key resources protection; science and  technology; and acquisition, financial, human capital, information  technology, and real property management. This report also identifies the  key cross-cutting themes that have affected the department\u2019s efforts to  implement its mission and management areas. These key themes include  agency transformation, strategic planning and results management, risk  management, information sharing, and partnerships and coordination."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We primarily focused the performance expectations on DHS\u2019s homeland  security-related functions. We generally did not identify performance  expectations related to DHS\u2019s nonhomeland security functions, although  we did identify some performance expectations that relate to these  functions. We also did not apply a weight to the performance expectations  we developed for DHS, although qualitative differences between the  expectations exist. We recognize that these expectations are not time  bound, and DHS will take actions to satisfy these expectations over a  sustained period of time. Therefore, our assessment of DHS\u2019s progress  relative to each performance expectation refers to the progress made by  the department during its first 4 years. Our assessment of DHS\u2019s progress  relative to each performance expectation is not meant to imply that DHS  should have fully achieved the performance expectation by the end of its  fourth year.", "To identify the performance expectations, we examined responsibilities  set for the department by Congress, the Administration, and department  leadership. In doing so, we reviewed homeland security-related legislation,  such as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004,  the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Maritime Transportation Security  Act of 2002, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of  2002, and the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. We also  reviewed DHS appropriations acts and accompanying conference reports  for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. We did not consider legislation enacted  since September 2006 in developing the performance expectations. To  identify goals and measures set by the Administration, we reviewed  relevant homeland security presidential directives and executive orders.  For the goals and measures set by the department, we analyzed the DHS  Strategic Plan, Performance Budget Overviews, Performance and  Accountability Reports, and component agencies\u2019 strategic plans. For  management areas, we also examined effective practices identified in our  prior reports. We analyzed these documents to identify common or  similar responsibilities for DHS mission and management areas and  synthesized the responsibilities identified in the various documents to  develop performance expectations for DHS. We obtained and incorporated  feedback from our subject matter experts on these performance  expectations. We also provided the performance expectations to DHS for  review and incorporated DHS\u2019s feedback.", "Based primarily on our prior work and DHS IG work, as well as updated  information provided by DHS between March and June 2007, we examined  the extent to which DHS has taken actions to achieve the identified  performance expectations in each area and make a determination as to  whether DHS has achieved the key elements of each performance  expectation based on the criteria listed below:    Generally achieved: Our work has shown that DHS has taken  actions to satisfy most of the key elements of the performance  expectation but may not have satisfied all of the elements.", "Generally not achieved: Our work has shown that DHS has not  yet taken actions to satisfy most of the key elements of the  performance expectation but may have taken steps to satisfy some of  the elements.", "No assessment made: Neither we nor the DHS IG have completed  work and/or the information DHS provided did not enable us to clearly  assess DHS\u2019s progress in achieving the performance expectation.  Therefore, we have no basis for making an assessment of the extent to  which DHS has taken actions to satisfy the performance expectation.", "An assessment of \u201cgenerally achieved\u201d indicates that DHS has taken  sufficient actions to satisfy most elements of the expectation; however, an  assessment of \u201cgenerally achieved\u201d does not signify that no further action  is required of DHS or that functions covered by the expectation cannot be  further improved or enhanced. Conversely, \u201cgenerally not achieved\u201d  indicates that DHS has not yet taken actions to satisfy most elements of  the performance expectation. An assessment of \u201cgenerally not achieved\u201d  may be warranted even where DHS has put forth substantial effort to  satisfy some but not most elements of an expectation. In cases when we or  the DHS IG have not completed work upon which to base an assessment  of DHS actions to satisfy a performance expectation and/or the  information DHS provided did not enable us to clearly determine the  extent to which DHS has achieved the performance expectation, we  indicated \u201cno assessment made.\u201d We analyzed the extent of our work, the  DHS IG\u2019s work, and DHS\u2019s updated information and conferred with our  subject matter experts to determine whether the work and information  were sufficient for a making a determination of generally achieved or  generally not achieved.", "Between March and June 2007, we obtained updated information from  DHS and met with program officials to discuss DHS\u2019s efforts to implement  actions to achieve the performance expectations in each mission and  management area. We incorporated DHS\u2019s additional information and  documentation into the report and, to the extent that DHS provided  documentation verifying its efforts, considered them in making our  assessments of DHS\u2019s progress.", "For each performance expectation, an analyst on our staff reviewed our  relevant work, DHS IG reports, and updated information and  documentation provided by DHS, including information received during  meetings with DHS officials. On the basis of this review, the analyst made  a determination that either DHS generally achieved the performance  expectation or generally did not achieve the performance expectation, or  the analyst identified that no determination could be made because  neither we nor the DHS IG had completed work and DHS did not provide  us with updated information and documentation. A second analyst then  reviewed each determination to reach concurrence on the assessment for  each performance expectation by reviewing the first analyst\u2019s summary of  our reports, relevant DHS IG reports, and DHS\u2019s updated information and  documentation. In cases when the first and second analyst disagreed, the  two analysts reviewed and discussed the assessments and relevant  documents to reach concurrence. Then, our subject matter experts  reviewed the summary of our reports, relevant DHS IG reports, and DHS\u2019s  updated information and documentation to reach concurrence on the  assessment for each performance expectation.", "To develop criteria for assessing DHS\u2019s progress in each mission and  management area, we analyzed criteria used for ratings or assessments in  our prior work, in DHS IG reports, and in other reports and studies, such  as those conducted by the 9-11 Commission and the Century Foundation.  We also reviewed our past work in each mission and management area  and obtained feedback from our subject matter experts and DHS officials  on these criteria. Based on this analysis, we developed the following  criteria for assessing DHS\u2019s progress in each mission and management  area:    Substantial progress: DHS has taken actions to generally achieve  more than 75 percent of the identified performance expectations.    Moderate progress: DHS has taken actions to generally achieve  more than 50 percent but 75 percent or less of the identified  performance expectations.    Modest progress: DHS has taken actions to generally achieve  more than 25 percent but 50 percent or less of the identified  performance expectations.    Limited progress: DHS has taken actions to generally achieve 25  percent or less of the identified performance expectations.", "After making a determination as to whether DHS has generally achieved or  generally not achieved the identified performance expectations, we added  up the number of performance expectations that we determined DHS has  generally achieved. We divided this number by the total number of  performance expectations for each mission and management area,  excluding those performance expectations for which we could not make  an assessment. Based on the resulting percentage, we identified DHS\u2019s  overall progress in each mission and management area, as (1) substantial  progress, (2) moderate progress, (3) modest progress, or (4) limited  progress. Our subject matter experts reviewed the overall assessments of  progress we identified for DHS in each mission and management area.", "Our assessments of the progress made by DHS in each mission and  management area are based on the performance expectations we  identified. The assessments of progress do not reflect, nor are they  intended to reflect, the extent to which DHS\u2019s actions have made the  nation more secure in each area. For example, in determining that DHS  has made modest progress in border security, we are not stating or  implying that the border is modestly more secure than it was prior to the  creation of DHS. In addition, we are not assessing DHS\u2019s progress against  a baseline in each mission and management area. We also did not consider  DHS component agencies\u2019 funding levels or the extent to which funding  levels have affected the department\u2019s ability to carry out its missions.   We also did not consider the extent to which competing priorities and  resource demands have affected DHS\u2019s progress in each mission and  management area relative to other areas, although competing priorities  and resource demands have clearly affected DHS\u2019s progress in specific  areas.", "In addition, because we and the DHS IG have completed varying degrees  of work (in terms of the amount and scope of reviews completed) for each  mission and management area, and because different DHS components  and offices provided us with different amounts and types of information,  our assessments of DHS\u2019s progress in each mission and management area  reflect the information available for our review and analysis and are not  necessarily equally comprehensive across all 14 mission and management  areas. For example, as a result of the post-September 11, 2001, focus on  aviation, we have conducted more reviews of aviation security, and our  methodology identified a much larger number of related performance  expectations than for the department\u2019s progress in surface transportation  security. Further, for some performance expectations, we were unable to  make an assessment of DHS\u2019s progress because (1) we had not conducted  work in that area, (2) the DHS IG\u2019s work in the area was also limited, and  (3) the supplemental information provided by DHS was insufficient to  form a basis for our analysis. Most notably, we were unable to make an  assessment for four performance expectations in the area of immigration  enforcement. This affected our overall assessment of DHS\u2019s progress in  that area as there were fewer performance expectations to tally in  determining the overall level of progress.", "We conducted our work for this report from September 2006 through July  2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In July 2002, President Bush issued the National Strategy for Homeland  Security. The strategy set forth overall objectives to prevent terrorist  attacks within the United States, reduce America\u2019s vulnerability to  terrorism, and minimize the damage and assist in the recovery from  attacks that may occur. The strategy set out a plan to improve homeland  security through the cooperation and partnering of federal, state, local,  and private sector organizations on an array of functions. The National  Strategy for Homeland Security specified a number of federal  departments, as well as nonfederal organizations, that have important  roles in securing the homeland. In terms of federal departments, DHS was  assigned a prominent role in implementing established homeland security  mission areas.", "In November 2002, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was enacted into  law, creating DHS. This act defined the department\u2019s missions to include  preventing terrorist attacks within the United States; reducing U.S.  vulnerability to terrorism; and minimizing the damages, and assisting in  the recovery from, attacks that occur within the United States. The act  also specified major responsibilities for the department, including to  analyze information and protect infrastructure; develop countermeasures  against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, and other emerging  terrorist threats; secure U.S. borders and transportation systems; and  organize emergency preparedness and response efforts.", "DHS began operations in March 2003. Its establishment represented a  fusion of 22 federal agencies to coordinate and centralize the leadership of  many homeland security activities under a single department. According  to data provided to us by DHS, the department\u2019s total budget authority was  about $39 billion in fiscal year 2004, about $108 billion in fiscal year 2005,  about $49 billion in fiscal year 2006, and about $45 billion in fiscal year  2007. The President\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget submission requests  approximately $46 billion for DHS. Table 15 provides information on  DHS\u2019s budget authority, as reported by DHS, for each fiscal year from 2004  though 2007.", "Since creating and issuing its first strategic plan, the department has  undergone several reorganizations. Most notably, in July 2005, DHS  announced the outcome of its Second-Stage Review, an internal study of  the department\u2019s programs, policies, operations, and structures. As a  result of this review, the department realigned several component  agencies and functions. In particular, the Secretary of Homeland Security  established a Directorate of Policy to coordinate departmentwide policies,  regulations, and other initiatives and consolidated preparedness activities  in one directorate, the Directorate for Preparedness. In addition, the  Secretary established a new Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the  Office of Infrastructure Protection composed of analysts from the former  Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection directorate. The Office  of Infrastructure Protection was placed in the Directorate for  Preparedness. The fiscal year 2007 DHS appropriations act provided for  the further reorganization of functions within the department by, in  particular, realigning DHS\u2019s emergency preparedness and response  responsibilities.", "In addition to these reorganizations, a variety of factors have affected  DHS\u2019s efforts to implement its mission and management functions.

We have  identified strategic planning as one of the critical success factors for new  organizations. This is particularly true for DHS, given the breadth of its  responsibility and need to clearly identify how stakeholders\u2019  responsibilities and activities align to address homeland security efforts.  The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 requires  that federal agencies consult with the Congress and key stakeholders to  assess their missions, long-term goals, strategies, and resources needed to  achieve their goals. It also requires that the agency include six key  components in its strategic plan: (1) a mission statement; (2) long-term  goals and objectives; (3) approaches (or strategies) to achieve the goals  and objectives; (4) a description of the relationship between annual and  long-term performance goals; (5) key factors that could significantly affect  achievement of the strategic goals; and (6) a description of how program  evaluations were used to establish or revise strategic goals. Other best  practices in strategic planning and results management that we have  identified include involving stakeholders in the strategic planning process,  continuously monitoring internal and external environments to anticipate  future challenges and avoid potential crises, holding managers  accountable for the results of their programs, and aligning program  performance measures and individual performance expectations at each  organizational level with agencywide goals and objectives.", "DHS issued a departmentwide strategic plan in 2004 that addressed five of  six GPRA-required elements. The plan included a mission statement, long- term goals, strategies to achieve the goals, key external factors, and  program evaluations, but did not describe the relationship between annual  and long-term goals. The linkage between annual and long-term goals is  important for determining whether an agency has a clear sense of how it  will assess progress toward achieving the intended results of its long-term  goals. While DHS\u2019s Performance Budget Overview and other documents  include a description of the relationship between annual and long-term  goals, not including this in the strategic plan made it more difficult for  DHS officials and stakeholders to identify how their roles and  responsibilities contributed to DHS\u2019s mission. In addition, although DHS\u2019s  planning documents described programs requiring stakeholder  coordination to effectively implement them, stakeholder involvement in  the planning process itself was limited. Given the many other  organizations at all levels of government and in the private sector whose  involvement is key to meeting homeland security goals, earlier and more  comprehensive stakeholder involvement in the planning process is  essential to the success of DHS\u2019s planning efforts. Such involvement is  important to ensure that stakeholders help identify and agree on how their  daily operations and activities contribute to fulfilling DHS\u2019s mission. To  make DHS a more results-oriented agency, we recommended that DHS\u2019s  strategic planning process include direct consultation with external  stakeholders, that its next strategic plan include a description of the  relationship between annual performance goals and long-term goals, and  that the next strategic plan adopt additional good strategic planning  practices, such as ensuring that the strategic plan includes a timeline for  achieving long-terms goals and a description of the specific budgetary,  human capital, and other resources needed to achieve those goals.  According to DHS officials, the department is planning to issue an updated  strategic plan, but they did not provide a target time frame for when the  plan would be issued.", "We have also reported on the importance of the development of outcome- based performance goals and measures as part of strategic planning and  results management efforts. Performance goals and measures are intended  to provide Congress and agency management with information to  systematically assess a program\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and  performance. A performance goal is the target level of performance  expressed as a tangible, measurable objective against which actual  achievement will be compared. A performance measure can be defined as  an indicator, statistic, or metric used to gauge program performance.  Outcome-oriented measures show results or outcomes related to an  initiative or program in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency, or impact.", "A number of DHS\u2019s programs lack outcome goals and measures, which  may hinder the department\u2019s ability to effectively assess the results of  program efforts or fully assess whether the department is using resources  effectively and efficiently, especially given various agency priorities for  resources. In particular, we have reported that some of DHS\u2019s components  have not developed adequate outcome-based performance measures or  comprehensive plans to monitor, assess, and independently evaluate the  effectiveness of their plans and performance. For example, in August 2005  we reported that ICE lacked outcome goals and measures for its worksite  enforcement program and recommended that the agency set specific time  frames for developing these goals and measures. In March 2006, we  reported that USCIS had not yet established performance goals and  measures to assess its benefit fraud activities, and we recommended that  they do so. Further, we have also reported that many of DHS\u2019s border- related performance goals and measures are not fully defined or  adequately aligned with one another, and some performance targets are  not realistic.

A risk management approach can help DHS  make decisions systematically and is consistent with the National  Strategy for Homeland Security and DHS\u2019s strategic plan, which have  called for the use of risk-based decisions to prioritize DHS\u2019s resource  investments regarding homeland security related programs.", "Several DHS component agencies have taken steps toward integrating  risk-based decision making into their decision making processes. For  example, the Coast Guard has taken actions to mitigate vulnerabilities and  enhance maritime security. Security plans for seaports, facilities, and  vessels have been developed based on assessments that identify their  vulnerabilities. In addition, the Coast Guard used a Maritime Security Risk  Assessment Model to prioritize risk according to a combination of possible  threat, consequence, and vulnerability scenarios. Under this approach,  seaport infrastructure that was determined to be both a critical asset and a  likely and vulnerable target would be a high priority for funding security  enhancements. By comparison, infrastructure that was vulnerable to  attack but not as critical or infrastructure that was very critical but already  well protected would be lower in priority. In the transportation area, TSA  has incorporated risk-based decision-making into number of its programs  and processes. For example, TSA has started to incorporate risk  management principles into securing air cargo, but has not conducted  assessments of air cargo vulnerabilities or critical assets (cargo facilities  and aircraft)\u2014two crucial elements of a risk-based management approach  without which TSA may not be able to appropriately focus its resources on  the most critical security needs. TSA also completed an Air Cargo  Strategic Plan in November 2003 that outlined a threat-based risk  management approach to securing the nation\u2019s air cargo transportation  system. However, TSA\u2019s existing tools for assessing vulnerability have not  been adapted for use in conducting air cargo assessments, nor has TSA  established a schedule for when these tools would be ready for use.", "Although some DHS components have taken steps to apply risk-based  decision making in implementing their mission functions, we also found  that other components have not always utilized such an approach. DHS  has not performed comprehensive risk assessments in transportation,  critical infrastructure, and the immigration and customs systems to guide  resource allocation decisions. For example, DHS has not fully utilized a  risk-based strategy to allocate resources among transportation sectors.  Although TSA has developed tools and processes to assess risk within and  across transportation modes, it has not fully implemented these efforts to  drive resource allocation decisions. We also recently identified concerns  about DHS\u2019s use of risk management in distributing grants to states and  localities. For fiscal years 2006 and 2007, DHS has used risk assessments  to identify urban areas that faced the greatest potential risk, and were  therefore eligible to apply for the Urban Areas Security Initiative grant,  and based the amount of awards to all eligible areas primarily on the  outcomes of the risk assessment and a new effectiveness assessment.  Starting in fiscal year 2006, DHS made several changes to the grant  allocation process, including modifying its risk assessment methodology,  and introducing an assessment of the anticipated effectiveness of  investments. DHS combined the outcomes of these two assessments to  make funding decisions. However, we found that DHS had limited  knowledge of how changes to its risk assessment methods, such as adding  asset types and using additional or different data sources, affect its risk  estimates. As a result, DHS had a limited understanding of the effects of  the judgments made in estimating risk that influenced eligibility and  allocation outcomes for fiscal year 2006. DHS leadership could make more  informed policy decisions if it were provided with alternative risk  estimates and funding allocations resulting from analyses of varying data,  judgments, and assumptions. We also reported that DHS has not applied a  risk management approach in deciding whether and how to invest in  specific capabilities for a catastrophic threat, and we recommended that it  do so.", "In April 2007, DHS established the new Office of Risk Management and  Analysis to serve as the DHS Executive Agent for national-level risk  management analysis standards and metrics; develop a standardized  approach to risk; develop an approach to risk management to help DHS  leverage and integrate risk expertise across components and external  stakeholders; assess DHS risk performance to ensure programs are  measurably reducing risk; and communicating DHS risk management in a  manner that reinforces the risk-based approach. According to DHS, the  office\u2019s activities are intended to develop a risk architecture, with  standardized methodologies for risk analysis and management, to assist in  the prioritization of risk reduction programs and to ensure that DHS  component risk programs are synchronized, integrated, and use a common  approach. Although this new office should help to coordinate risk  management planning and activities across the department, it is too early  to tell what effect this office will have on strengthening departmentwide  risk management activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Sharing Remains a Challenge for DHS", "paragraphs": ["The federal government, including DHS, has made progress in developing  a framework to support a more unified effort to secure the homeland,  including information sharing. However, opportunities exist to enhance  the effectiveness of information sharing among federal agencies and with  state and local governments and private sector entities. As we reported in  August 2003, efforts to improve intelligence and information sharing  needed to be strengthened. In 2005, we designated information sharing for  homeland security as high-risk. We recently reported that the nation still  lacked an implemented set of governmentwide policies and processes for  sharing terrorism information, but has issued a strategy on how it will put  in place the overall framework, policies, and architecture for sharing with  all critical partners\u2014actions that we and others have recommended. The  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required that  the President create an \u201cinformation sharing environment\u201d to facilitate the  sharing of terrorism information, yet this environment remains in the  planning stage. An implementation plan for the environment, which was  released on November 16, 2006, defines key tasks and milestones for  developing the information sharing environment, including identifying  barriers and ways to resolve them, as we recommended. We noted that  completing the information sharing environment is a complex task that  will take multiple years and long-term administration and congressional  support and oversight, and will pose cultural, operational, and technical  challenges that will require a collaborated response.", "DHS has taken some steps to implement its information sharing  responsibilities. For example, DHS implemented a system to share  homeland security information. States and localities are also creating their  own information \u201cfusion\u201d centers, some with DHS support. DHS has  further implemented a program to protect sensitive information the  private sector provides it on security at critical infrastructure assets, such  as nuclear and chemical facilities. However, the DHS IG found that users  of the information system were confused with it and as a result did not  regularly use it; and DHS had not secured of the private sector\u2019s trust that  the agency could adequately protect and effectively use the information  that sector provided.  These challenges will require longer-term actions to  resolve.  Our past work in the information sharing and warning areas has  highlighted a number of other challenges that need to be addressed. These  challenges include developing productive information sharing  relationships among the federal government, state and local governments,  and the private sector; and ensuring that the private sector receives better  information on potential threats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Faced Difficulties in Coordinating with Homeland Security Partners", "paragraphs": ["In addition to providing federal leadership with respect to homeland  security, DHS also plays a large role in coordinating the activities of other  federal, state, local, private sector, and international stakeholders, but has  faced challenges in this regard. To secure the nation, DHS must form  effective and sustained partnerships between legacy component agencies  and also with a range of other entities, including other federal agencies,  state and local governments, the private and nonprofit sectors, and  international partners. We have reported that successful partnering and  coordination involves collaborating and consulting with stakeholders to  develop and agree on goals, strategies, and roles to achieve a common  purpose; identify resource needs; establish a means to operate across  agency boundaries, such as compatible procedures, measures, data, and  systems; and agree upon and document mechanisms to monitor, evaluate,  and report to the public on the results of joint efforts. We have found that  the appropriate homeland security roles and responsibilities within and  between the levels of government and with the private sector are evolving  and need to be clarified.", "The implementation of the National Strategy for Homeland Security  further underscores the importance for DHS of partnering and  coordination. For example, 33 of the strategy\u2019s 43 initiatives are required  to be implemented by 3 or more federal agencies and the National  Strategy identifies the private sector as a key homeland security partner. If  these entities do not effectively coordinate their implementation activities,  they may waste resources by creating ineffective and incompatible pieces  of a larger security program. For example, because the private sector  owns or operates 85 percent of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, DHS  must partner with individual companies and sector organizations in order  to protect vital national infrastructure, such as the nation\u2019s water supply,  transportation systems and chemical facilities. In October 2006 we  reported that all 17 critical infrastructure sectors established their  respective government councils, and nearly all sectors initiated their  voluntary private sector councils in response to the National  Infrastructure Protection Plan. The councils, among other things, are to  identify their most critical assets, assess the risks they face, and identify  protective measures, in sector-specific plans that comply with DHS\u2019s  National Infrastructure Protection Plan.", "DHS has taken other important actions in developing partnerships and  mechanisms for coordinating with homeland security partners. For  example, DHS formed the National Cyber Response Coordination Group  to coordinate the federal response to cyber incidents of national  significance. It is a forum of national security, law enforcement, defense,  intelligence, and other government agencies that coordinates  intragovernmental and public/private preparedness and response to and  recovery from national level cyber incidents and physical attacks that have  significant cyber consequences. In the area of maritime security, DHS has  also taken actions to partner with a variety of stakeholders. For example,  the Coast Guard reported to us that as of June 2006, 35 sector command  centers had been created and that these centers were the primary conduit  for daily collaboration and coordination between the Coast Guard and its  port partner agencies. We also found that through its Customs-Trade  Partnership Against Terrorism Program, CBP has worked in partnership  with private companies to review their supply chain security plans to  improve members\u2019 overall security.", "However, DHS has faced some challenges in developing other effective  partnerships and in clarifying the roles and responsibilities of various  homeland security stakeholders. For example, in February 2007 we  testified that because DHS has only limited authority to address security at  chemical facilities it must continue to work with the chemical industry to  ensure that it is assessing vulnerabilities and implementing security  measures. Also, while TSA has taken steps to collaborate with federal and  private sector stakeholders in the implementation of its Secure Flight  program, in 2006 we reported these stakeholders stated that TSA has not  provided them with the information they would need to support TSA\u2019s  efforts as they move forward with the program. In addition, we reported in  September 2005 that TSA did not effectively involve private sector  stakeholders in its decision making process for developing security  standards for passenger rail assets We recommended, and DHS developed,  security standards that reflected industry best practices and could be  measured, monitored, and enforced by TSA rail inspectors and, if  appropriate, by rail asset owners. We have also made other  recommendations to DHS to help strengthen its partnership efforts in the  areas of transportation security and research and development.", "Further, lack of clarity regarding roles and responsibilities caused DHS  difficulties in coordinating with its emergency preparedness and response  partners in responding to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. For example, the  Red Cross and FEMA had differing views about their roles and  responsibilities under the National Response Plan, which hampered efforts  to coordinate federal mass care assistance. Department of Labor and  FEMA officials also disagreed about which agency was responsible for  ensuring the safety and health of response and recovery workers. This  lack of clarity about each other\u2019s roles and procedures resulted in delayed  implementation of the National Response Plan\u2019s Worker Safety and Health  Support Annex. We recommended that DHS take steps to improve  partnering and coordination efforts as they relate to emergency  preparedness and response, including to seek input from the state and  local governments and private sector entities, such as the Red Cross, on  the development and implementation of key capabilities, including those  for interoperable communications."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Given the dominant role that DHS plays in securing the homeland, it is  critical that the department\u2019s mission programs and management systems  and functions operate as efficiently and effectively as possible. In the more  than 4 years since its establishment, the department has taken important  actions to secure the border and the transportation sector and to defend  against, prepare for, and respond to threats and disasters. DHS has had to  undertake these critical missions while also working to transform itself  into a fully functioning cabinet department\u2014a difficult undertaking for  any organization and one that can take, at a minimum, 5 to 7 years to  complete even under less daunting circumstances. At the same time, a  variety of factors, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, threats to and  attacks on transportation systems in other countries, and new  responsibilities and authorities provided by Congress have forced the  department to reassess its priorities and reallocate resources to address  key domestic and international events and to respond to emerging issues  and threats.", "As it moves forward, DHS will continue to face the challenges that have  affected its operations thus far, including transforming into a high- performing, results-oriented agency; developing results-oriented goals and  measures to effectively assess performance; developing and implementing  a risk-based approach to guide resource decisions; and establishing  effective frameworks and mechanisms for sharing information and  coordinating with homeland security partners. DHS has undertaken efforts  to address these challenges but will need to give continued attention to  these efforts in order to efficiently and effectively identify and prioritize  mission and management needs, implement efforts to address those needs,  and allocate resources accordingly. Efforts to address these challenges  will be especially important over the next several years given the threat  environment and long-term fiscal imbalance facing the nation.", "To address these challenges, DHS will need to continue its efforts to  develop a results-oriented mission and management framework to guide  implementation efforts and progress toward achieving desired outcomes.  In moving forward, it will also be important for DHS to routinely reassess  its mission and management goals, measures, and milestones to evaluate  progress made, identify past and emerging obstacles, and examine  alternatives to address those obstacles and effectively implement its  missions. We have made nearly 700 recommendations to DHS on  initiatives and reforms that would enhance its ability to implement its core  mission and management functions, including developing performance  goals and measures and setting milestones for key programs, making  resource allocation decisions based on risk assessments, and developing  and implementing internal controls to help ensure program effectiveness.  DHS has generally agreed with our prior recommendations.", "Moreover, taking those actions that we have suggested for agencies on our  high-risk list provides a good road map for DHS as it works to further  develop management structures that, once in place, could help the  department more efficiently and effectively implement its mission and  management functions. To be removed from our high-risk list, agencies  first have to produce a corrective action plan that defines the root causes  of identified problems, identifies effective solutions to those problems,  and provides for substantially completing corrective measures in the near  term. Such a plan should include performance metrics and milestones, as  well as mechanisms to monitor progress. In the spring of 2006, DHS  provided us with a draft corrective action plan that did not contain key  elements we have identified as necessary for an effective corrective action  plan, including specific actions to address identified objectives, and this  plan has not yet been approved by the Office of Management and Budget.  Second, agencies must demonstrate significant progress in addressing the  problems identified in their corrective action plans. It will be important for  DHS to become more transparent and minimize recurring delays in  providing access to information on its programs and operations so that  Congress, GAO, and others can independently assess its efforts. Finally,  agencies, in particular top leadership, must demonstrate a commitment to  sustain initial improvements in their performance over the long term.  Although DHS leaders have expressed their intent to integrate legacy  agencies into the new department, they have not dedicated the resources  needed to oversee this effort.", "A well-managed, high-performing Department of Homeland Security is  essential to meeting the significant homeland security challenges facing  the nation. As DHS continues to evolve, implement its programs, and  integrate its functions, we will continue to review its progress and  performance and provide information to Congress and the public on its  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on this report from the Secretary of Homeland  Security. In comments dated July 20, 2007, and signed by the  Undersecretary for Management (reprinted in their entirety in appendix  II), DHS took issues with our methodology and disagreed with the  conclusions we reached for 42 of the 171 performance expectations  (specifically 41 of the 84 performance expectations where we assessed  DHS as not having achieved the expectation and 1 of the 9 performance  expectations for which we did not make an assessment). DHS also  provided technical comments, which we considered and incorporated  where appropriate.", "DHS raised five general issues with our methodology. First, DHS believes  that we altered the criteria by which we would judge the department\u2019s  progress in changing our terminology from \u201cgenerally addressed\u201d to  \u201cgenerally achieved.\u201d As we communicated to DHS, we did not change the  underlying assessment approach or evaluation criteria. Rather, we  changed the way that we characterized DHS\u2019s progress for each  performance expectation. For example, our definition for \u201cgenerally  addressed\u201d and \u201cgenerally achieved\u201d did not change: \u201cOur work has shown  that DHS has taken steps to effectively satisfy the key elements of the  performance expectation but may not have satisfied all of the elements.\u201d  The change from \u201caddressed\u201d to \u201cachieved\u201d was not a change in  methodology, criteria, or standards but only a change in language to better  convey, in the context of results-oriented government, the legislative and  executive intent behind these performance expectations that DHS achieve  these expectations rather than merely begin to take steps that apply or are  relevant to them.", "Second, DHS took issue with the binary standard we used to assess each  performance expectation. While we acknowledge the binary standard we  applied is not perfect, we believe it is appropriate for this review because  the administration generally has not established quantitative goals and  measures for the performance expectations in connection with the various  mission and management areas. Thus, we could not assess where along a  spectrum of progress DHS stood for individual performance expectations.  We chose the 2-step process for assessing DHS\u2019s progress\u2014using a binary  standard for individual performance expectations and a spectrum for  broad mission and management areas\u2014and fully disclosed it to and  discussed it with DHS officials at the outset and throughout the review.", "Third, DHS was concerned about how we defined our criteria for  assessing DHS\u2019s progress in achieving each performance expectation and  an apparent shift of criteria we applied after the department supplied us  additional information and documents. With regard to how we defined our  criteria and the performance expectations, the key elements for the  expectations were inherent to each one, and we discussed these elements  in each assessment. Further, we did not shift our criteria. Rather we  employed a process by which we disclosed our preliminary analysis and  assessments to DHS, received and analyzed additional documents and  statements from DHS officials, and updated (and in many cases changed)  our preliminary assessments based on the additional inputs. This process  resulted in an improvement, a diminution, or no change in our assessment  of the applicable area. In some cases, we added language to clarify the  basis of our assessment after our review of the additional information DHS  provided.", "Fourth, DHS raised concerns that we did not \u201cnormalize\u201d the application  of our criteria by the many GAO analysts who had input to this review. Our  methodology involved significant input by these analysts because they  have had experience with the mission and management areas we were  evaluating and were knowledgeable about the programs, specific  performance expectations, activities, data, and results from each area. A  core team of GAO analysts and managers reviewed all the inputs from  these other GAO staff to ensure the consistent application of our  methodology, criteria, and analytical process. In addition, our quality  control process included detailed reviews of the facts included in this  report, as well as assurance that we followed GAO\u2019s policies and generally  accepted government auditing standards.", "Finally, DHS points out that we treated all performance expectations as if  they were of equal significance. In our scope and methodology section we  recognize that qualitative differences between the performance  expectations exist, but we did not apply a weight to the performance  expectations because congressional, departmental, and other  stakeholders\u2019 views on the relative priority of each performance  expectation may be different and we did not believe it was appropriate to  substitute our judgment for theirs.", "DHS disagreed with our assessment of 42 of the 171 performance  expectations\u2014including 41 of the 84 performance expectations we  assessed as generally not achieved\u2014contending that we did not fully take  account of all the actions it has taken relative to each expectation.  Specifically, DHS believes that we expected DHS to achieve an entire  expectation in cases where both DHS and we agree that ultimate  achievement will not be possible for several more years, such as in the  areas of border security and science and technology. This report provides  Congress and the public with an assessment of DHS\u2019s progress as of July  2007 and does not reflect the extent to which DHS should have or could  have made more progress. We believe that it is appropriate, after pointing  out the expectation for a multiyear program and documenting the  activities DHS has actually accomplished to date, to reach a conclusion  about whether DHS had not implemented the program after 4 years.", "DHS\u2019s concern that we have not adequately used or interpreted additional  information it provided us, such as for performance expectations in the  areas of aviation security and emergency preparedness and response, has  little basis. We fully considered all information and documents DHS  provided and described how we applied this information in the assessment  portion of each performance expectation. In some cases DHS only  provided us with testimonial information regarding its actions to achieve  each performance expectation, but did not provide us with documentation  verifying these actions. In the absence of such documentation to support  DHS\u2019s claims, we concluded that DHS had generally not achieved the  expectations. In other cases, the information and documents DHS  provided did not convince us that DHS had generally achieved the  performance expectation as stated or as we had interpreted it. In these  cases, we explain the basis for our conclusions in the \u201cGAO Assessment  sections\u201d.Further, in some cases the information and documents DHS  provided were not relevant to the specific performance expectation; in  these situations we did not discuss them in our assessment. In addition, in  some of its comments on individual performance expectations, DHS  referenced new information that it did not provide to us during our review.  In these cases we either explain our views on the information, or in one  case we have changed our conclusion to \u201cno assessment made\u201d.", "Overall, we appreciate DHS\u2019s concerns and recognize that in a broad- based endeavor such as this, some level of disagreement is inevitable,  especially at any given point in time.
