In the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, Congress directed GAO to assess the program integrity implications of enrolling these companies and allowing them to bill Medicare. GAO reviewed about 2.8 million emergency department claims for 2000 from five states and assessed whether contractor physicians retained by staffing companies billed Medicare comparably to other emergency department physicians.

In addition, the patients treated by contractor physicians received diagnostic tests, were admitted to the hospital, and used ambulance transport at rates similar to patients treated by other emergency department physicians. Staffing companies that retain contractor physicians remain largely invisible to the oversight efforts of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) because these companies are not enrolled in Medicare. Although CMS has information on the individual physicians, it has no information on the companies themselves. This may hinder oversight because contractor physicians provided a significant share of emergency care to Medicare beneficiaries. For example, in four of the five states studied, 27 to 58 percent of the physicians with substantial emergency department practices were contractor physicians retained by staffing companies. CMS does not permit the enrollment of staffing companies that retain contractor physicians because, under current law, these companies may not be reassigned Medicare benefits. This limits CMS's ability to monitor claims. CMS cannot identify claims submitted by these companies on behalf of their contractor physicians nor can it subject the claims to the same systematic scrutiny given to enrolled groups. Consequently, it cannot evaluate the billing patterns of specific companies nor assess the aggregate impact of these companies on Medicare program integrity."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2000, Medicare\u2014the federal health insurance program that serves the  nation\u2019s elderly and disabled\u2014paid for about 16 million visits to hospital  emergency departments. Although hospitals may employ individual  physicians to provide care, they can rely on other staffing arrangements to  ensure adequate physician coverage in their emergency departments.  Some hospitals rely on medical groups, such as physician partnerships, to  ensure this coverage, while others utilize staffing companies to provide  physician services. Staffing companies are businesses that recruit  physicians, verify medical credentials, and provide physicians to staff  hospital departments, including emergency departments. Some staffing  companies are small and serve local or regional markets, while others are  large and provide physicians to hospitals nationwide. Some staffing  companies employ the physicians that they provide to hospitals and others  retain physicians on a contractual basis.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency  responsible for administering the Medicare program, determines,  consistent with Medicare law, when and under what arrangements  physicians can enroll in, and therefore directly bill, the program for  services. Medicare law generally allows individual physicians and  physician partnerships to file claims for payment. Medicare law also  permits physicians to \u201creassign\u201d their right to payment to certain other  entities, such as the hospitals or other facilities where services were  performed, or to their employers. CMS\u2019s interpretation of this provision  has had the effect, however, of prohibiting companies that retain  physicians on a contractual basis from receiving reassigned benefits. As a  consequence, such staffing companies have not been permitted to enroll  in\uf8e7and therefore submit claims directly to\u2014Medicare. Claims for services  supplied by contractor physicians must be submitted to Medicare either by  the physicians themselves or the facilities where the services were  furnished. This determination applies to companies that retain contractor  physicians to staff hospital emergency departments, as well as those  providing physician services for other medical specialties, such as  radiology and anesthesiology.", "Although staffing companies that retain contractor physicians cannot  directly bill Medicare, they nonetheless indirectly receive Medicare funds.  These staffing companies submit claims to Medicare on behalf of their  contractor physicians, who are entitled to direct payment for their services  to Medicare beneficiaries. The Medicare payments are deposited in the  contractor physicians\u2019 individual bank accounts. However, the staffing  companies have typically made arrangements with these physicians to  transfer their payments for these Medicare claims to the staffing  companies. Depending upon the contract provisions, the companies and  contractor physicians then share these funds.", "The fiscal integrity of the Medicare program is partially dependent on  CMS\u2019s ability to effectively identify and investigate aberrant billing  patterns among providers to hold these providers accountable. Contractor  physicians are individually responsible for the billings submitted on their  behalf. Because staffing companies that use contractor physicians are not  enrolled in Medicare, CMS typically has little information on these  companies and cannot readily associate the billings of individual  contractor physicians with specific staffing companies. If CMS is unable to  recoup overpayments from contractor physicians, it does not have the  recourse to recoup these funds from staffing companies. As a result, these  staffing companies may have less incentive than enrolled providers to  ensure that the program is billed properly.", "Recent legislation required that we study the Medicare provider  enrollment process as it relates to contractor physicians with a particular  emphasis on hospital-based physicians, such as those retained by  emergency department staffing companies. Among other things, it  specifically directed us to assess the program integrity implications of  enrolling staffing companies that retain contractor physicians. As agreed  with the committees of jurisdiction, we examined emergency department  billings and focused this report on (1) whether staffing companies\u2019  contractor physicians bill Medicare similarly to emergency department  physicians with other affiliations, such as those practicing in partnerships,  medical groups, or employee-based staffing companies, and (2) how CMS\u2019s  ability to monitor Medicare billings has been affected by the lack of  information linking contractor physicians to their staffing companies.", "To conduct our study, we examined Medicare emergency department  evaluation and management (E&M) services because they are an essential  component of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries by emergency  department physicians. E&M services involve a physician taking a patient\u2019s  medical history, performing a physical examination, and making decisions  regarding diagnosis and treatment. Medicare payments for E&M services  vary based on several factors, including the patient\u2019s status and presenting  diagnosis and the level of the physician\u2019s medical decision making and  counseling exercised during the patient\u2019s examination. We analyzed about  2.8 million claims for emergency department E&M services paid in 2000  for beneficiaries in Alabama, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West  Virginia\u2014or about 20 percent of Medicare emergency department E&M  services paid in 2000 nationally.", "To determine which physicians were contractors associated with\u2014that is,  retained by\u2014staffing companies, we identified physicians with common  payment addresses who were not enrolled in Medicare as part of a medical  group. For purposes of comparison, we placed all other physicians,  including those who were members of partnerships, medical groups, or  employees of hospitals or staffing companies, in a separate category. To  determine if contractor physicians associated with emergency department  staffing companies billed Medicare for more complex services at higher  rates than physicians with other affiliations, we compared the proportions  of each group\u2019s E&M billings that were billed at the two highest levels. We  also compared information from Medicare claims about other services that  patients served by each group received at the time of their emergency  department visits to assess whether the groups were caring for  comparable patients. It was not feasible to obtain patients\u2019 medical  records that would allow a more complete comparison of the two groups\u2019  patients. Our findings cannot be generalized or projected to staffing  companies that retain contractor physicians in other specialties, such as  radiology or anesthesiology, nor can our findings be projected to other  states.", "In addition to our claims analysis, we interviewed CMS officials to discuss  Medicare enrollment policies and procedures as well as the program  integrity implications of enrolling staffing companies that retain contractor  physicians in Medicare. We also discussed these matters with  representatives from several of the claims administration contractors that  CMS relies on to help administer the program. We obtained the views of  officials from staffing companies that employ physicians, as well as those  that retain physicians on a contractual basis and several organizations  representing emergency department physicians. Included among those  officials interviewed at CMS and staffing companies were several  physicians who have experience working in hospital emergency  departments. Finally, we reviewed applicable laws, regulations, and other  guidance concerning Medicare enrollment and claims processing. We  performed our work from March 2001 through February 2003, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

However, they can \u201cassign\u201d their rights to payment to physicians, other  providers, and suppliers who directly deliver the care or service and then  submit claims to Medicare. These physicians as well as other providers  and suppliers must meet criteria for enrollment in the Medicare program.  To bill Medicare, CMS requires that physicians, other providers, and  suppliers use a standardized, five-digit coding system on the claim forms  to identify the medical services and procedures that were provided. These  billing codes describe the type of medical, surgical, and diagnostic service  rendered. For E&M services, these codes also designate the level\u2014or  intensity\u2014of care provided. Emergency department E&M codes range  from 99281 to 99285. Typically, the higher the E&M code, the more  complex the consultation, or level of care involved, and the higher the  Medicare payment.", "CMS has delegated the authority for enrolling physicians and other entities  into the Medicare program to its claims administration contractors\u2014the  fiscal intermediaries and carriers\u2014that help it manage the Medicare  program. As carriers are responsible for the administration of Part B  services, they are therefore tasked with managing the enrollment of  physicians in Medicare. Before enrolling individual physicians and other  entities, the carriers determine whether applicants meet Medicare  eligibility criteria and assess, based on information provided, whether they  appear to pose a potential threat to program integrity. For example,  applicants are required to disclose their legal business names and  ownership, adverse legal actions, and outstanding Medicare debt from  previous enrollment along with copies of their medical licenses. The  carriers also have the authority to request additional documentation to  validate information included in the enrollment application, such as  articles of incorporation and partnership agreements. In addition to  verifying the required information, the carriers may access several national  databases to identify adverse reports on applicants that may affect their  ability to become enrolled in Medicare. Once physicians are enrolled, the  carriers assign each physician an individual provider identification number  (PIN), which serves as a unique identifier. Similarly, entities that are  eligible to enroll in Medicare and therefore directly bill the program\u2014such  as physician partnerships or staffing companies that employ physicians\u2014 obtain group PINs.", "As specified by law, physicians can only \u201creassign\u201d their payment rights to  certain other entities, such as the hospitals or other facilities where  services were performed or to their employers. Emergency department  staffing companies generally do not own the facilities where services are  performed and those that retain contractor physicians are not considered  the physicians\u2019 employers. As a result, Medicare payments cannot be  reassigned to emergency department staffing companies that retain  contractor physicians, and these companies are not permitted to enroll in  and directly bill Medicare or be assigned group PINs. However, these  staffing companies may submit claims on behalf of their contractor  physicians, using the physicians\u2019 individual PINs. Although the physicians  are ultimately responsible for the claims submitted on their behalf, they  may not be aware of how the staffing companies code the services billed  to Medicare.", "Carriers may use an individual or a group PIN to facilitate their program  integrity activities. PINs allow carriers to link the individual physicians  who actually rendered the services and the entities with which they are  affiliated. Carriers are then able to monitor billing patterns and compare  billings of both individual physicians and groups. By analyzing the billing  patterns associated with both the PINs of individual physicians and these  entities, carriers can identify meaningful differences and detect potential  instances of improper payments or fraud. Because staffing companies that  retain contractor physicians may not be reassigned benefits and cannot  enroll in Medicare, they do not receive group PINs.

Moreover, the rates at which other services\u2014such as ambulance  transportation, hospital admission, and diagnostic testing\u2014were rendered  in conjunction with the higher-level E&M services were similar for  contractor physicians and those with other affiliations, providing an  indication that the patients of both types of physicians were comparable."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Higher-Level E&M Services Billed at Similar Rates", "paragraphs": ["Comparing the emergency department E&M billings of contractor  physicians with other affiliated physicians showed that physicians  involved with the two types of staffing arrangements billed Medicare for  the higher-level services at similar rates in four of the five states we  reviewed.

The carriers cannot perform this  analysis for staffing companies that retain contractor physicians because  these companies do not have group PINs that would enable carriers to link  physicians\u2019 billings to the companies.

If the review finds improper bills, the  carrier can take corrective action, including an assessment of amounts  paid in error that must be repaid to Medicare. For repeated billing abuses,  the carrier can take steps to further protect the Medicare program. For  example, it can delay payment of some or all claims, pending more intense  screening. When the group is enrolled in Medicare, the carrier may hold  accountable, not just the physicians responsible for the improper billings,  but the group, partnership, or entity employing those physicians as well.  For example, if the physician stops billing Medicare before the amount of  the overpayment can be withheld from subsequent payments or if the  physician is unable to return the amount of the overpayment, plus  applicable penalties and interest, the carrier may be able to recover the  funds from a partnership or staffing company that employed the physician.
