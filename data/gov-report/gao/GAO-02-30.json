Of the $4.5 billion appropriated to the U.S. Census Bureau in fiscal year 2000, lower-than-expected expenditures and obligations resulted in available balances of at least $415 million. A lower-than-expected support staff workload reduced salary and benefit costs by about $348 million. Enumerator workload is largely determined by the initial mail response rate for returned census questionnaires. The initial mail response of 64 percent meant that Census enumerators did not have to visit more than three million American households. However, the available balances from the higher mail response rate and the lower support staff workload were partially offset by about $100 million of higher salary and benefit costs for enumerators, including a higher workload for unanticipated recounts. According to Bureau data, enumerator productivity did not significantly affect budget variances for the 2000 decennial census. The Bureau reported the national average time to visit a household and complete a census questionnaire was about the one hour estimated. Because of significant internal control weaknesses, the Bureau was unable to develop and report complete, accurate, and timely information for managing decision-making. Specific control weaknesses for fiscal year 2000 were related to the lack of controls over financial reporting and financial management systems. Financial reporting issues included (1) the inability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and other financial management reports needed for oversight and day-to-day management; (2) the lack of timely and complete reconciliations needed to validate the balances of key accounts; and (3) unsupported and inaccurate reported balances for accounts payable and undelivered orders--two key accounts needed to manage and report on unliquidated obligations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The decennial census is the nation\u2019s most comprehensive and expensive data-gathering program.

During fiscal year 2000, the bureau conducted the actual decennial count of U.S. population and housing as of April 1, 2000, which is its largest and most complex activity. The results of the 2000 decennial census are used to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, draw congressional and state legislative districts, and form the basis for the distribution of an estimated $200 billion annually of federal program funds over the next decade to state and local governments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Census Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["The bureau receives two appropriations from the Congress: (1) salaries and expenses and (2) periodic censuses and programs.

As part of the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 2000, the appropriation for Periodic Censuses and Programs earmarked $4.476 billion by framework for the bureau and the Census Monitoring Board to remain available until expended. While these amounts were earmarked for the frameworks, section 205 of the act authorized the Department of Commerce to transfer amounts not to exceed 5 percent of any appropriation to another appropriation, but no appropriation could be increased by more than 10 percent. Section 205 also required the Department of Commerce to comply with the procedures set forth for reprogramming under section 605 of the act. For management, program, financial, staffing, and performance purposes, the 8 frameworks were further divided by the bureau into 23 activities and within these activities, further divided into 119 projects.

However, only a few days earlier on January 25, 1999, the Supreme Court, in Department of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives (525 U.S. 316), held that the Census Act prohibited the bureau from using statistical sampling for purposes of congressional apportionment. Because the original budget request was submitted with the plans for statistical sampling, the bureau had to amend its plans in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. According to the bureau, the effect of this decision was that an estimated 12 million additional nonresponding households would require visits by enumerators. In addition, various programs designed to address undercounting and other coverage errors would have to be expanded. The bureau also planned to visit about 4 million additional addresses for which the Postal Service had returned the questionnaires because it believed the housing units to be vacant or nonexistent.", "In light of the need for additional enumeration and other programs to ensure accuracy, OMB requested and the Congress approved additional funding of $1.7 billion to the bureau\u2019s original budget request of $2.8 billion.

Because of these difficulties, the bureau\u2019s financial statements were manually compiled instead of being generated directly from its financial management systems.", "Compounding the potential for error, adjustments to the financial statements must be posted manually and each adjustment must be crosswalked to the financial statements instead of being posted directly by the financial management systems. For example, the bureau did not post a fourth quarter 2000 entry to deferred revenue and accounts receivable balances, which resulted in a material overstatement of these accounts in its draft financial statements.", "Further, the bureau was unable to use its financial management system to produce required Treasury reports such as the Statement of Transactions (SF-224) and Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (SF- 133). The bureau prepared these reports manually, which required additional time and effort to meet due dates and increased opportunities for error.", "Ineffective Reconciliations. The lack of adequate account reconciliation seriously affected the ability of the bureau to prepare timely and accurate financial statements at year-end. The bureau stated in its 1999 and 2000 FMFIA reports that it did not promptly reconcile its financial information system with its subsidiary records. The bureau also reported that when reconciliations were performed, it did not sufficiently document and account for all reconciling items. According to the bureau, critical reports required to prepare the financial statements from the financial management systems were not fully developed as part of the standard reporting package. In addition, the bureau\u2019s auditor reported and we concur with the following findings.", "Many key financial statement balances in the general ledger were not reconciled by the bureau to supporting subsidiary records in a timely manner through the first 6 months of fiscal year 2000. The auditor reported this condition as a material weakness in its internal control reports on the bureau for fiscal years 1999 and 2000.", "Bureau accountants who performed reconciliations were unfamiliar with the nature and details of the accounts they were reconciling and the reconciliations were not adequately supported. The auditor noted that for the last half of fiscal year 2000, the bureau resorted to hiring contractors to perform many of the monthly reconciliations. This resulted in most balances being adequately supported and reviewed by year-end.", "Deferred revenue and accounts receivable, however, were not properly reconciled throughout the year. The bureau\u2019s Division of Finance did not reconcile financial transactions with information from program offices, and folders by reimbursable project did not contain adequate information on amounts collected from customers or accumulation of costs for projects. Without proper and timely accounting, collections are subject to increased risk of loss or theft. The bureau did not update cash balance reports throughout the fiscal year and did not bill a large amount of work to customers in a timely manner, impeding timely collection efforts. Additionally, accounts receivable from the public for economic and demographic data were not aged properly and the bureau did not establish an allowance for uncollectable accounts until after year-end in order to fairly present statements in accordance with GAAP.", "The bureau also did not reconcile its intragovernmental balances with its trading partner agencies other than the Department of Commerce, at least annually, to comply with the provisions of OMB Bulletin 97-01. The bureau experienced difficulties in producing intragovernmental account information and, as a result, reports had to be prepared manually, were incomplete, contained errors, and were submitted late. In addition, the bureau\u2019s core financial management system was not designed to identify separately amounts that should be eliminated for intragovernmental purposes in accordance with GAAP.", "Accounts Payable and Undelivered Order Weaknesses and Errors. As part of analysis of bureau budget variances discussed earlier in this report, we focused on the timely and accurate reporting of these two accounts. Controls over unliquidated obligations, which include accounts payable and undelivered orders, are an important part of the structured process needed to reconcile and deobligate funds in a timely manner. The bureau disclosed in its 1999 and 2000 FMFIA reports that it lacked adequate support for its accounts payable and undelivered orders balances. Further, both the bureau and its auditor have reported significant weaknesses in account reconciliation, as previously discussed, including accounts payable and undelivered orders. For example, we noted that the bureau had not promptly reconciled its subsidiary records with its general ledger control account for undelivered orders as of September 30, 2000. Adjustments for this reconciliation were not recorded until almost 7 months later on April 28, 2001. Further, subsidiary records of accounts payable and undelivered orders by vendor were not included as part of the standard system reports, hampering efforts to appropriately manage these accounts.", "Our review and testing of key internal controls for these accounts found conditions to be much worse than reported by the bureau or its auditor. The weaknesses we identified included (1) erroneous information that had not been promptly corrected and (2) ineffective controls to accrue liabilities when goods or services have been delivered but not paid. These weaknesses contributed to additional errors in accounts payable and undelivered order balances as of September 30, 2000. Specifically, the effect of the errors we identified as of September 30, 2000, was a 10- percent overstatement of the audited $457 million undelivered order balance and a 20-percent understatement of the audited $134 million accounts payable balance. While these errors were evidence of weak internal controls and were significant to the undelivered orders and accounts payable line items, these errors alone were not material to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s $1.2 billion fiscal year 2000 balance sheet and other financial statements.", "The primary cause of these problems was erroneous information in subsidiary records for undelivered orders that was not corrected in a timely manner as noted in the following examples.", "Year-end adjustments of $65 million had to be manually posted, which did not occur until 7 months later on April 28, 2001.", "Undelivered orders subsidiary records as of September 30, 2000, contained $46 million for a contract that had been liquidated in February 1999. This error was finally corrected as part of the above $65 million of year-end adjustments to reconcile a subsidiary report to the general ledger.", "Subsidiary records for three undelivered orders balances totaling $5 million were duplicated. This duplication occurred because the bureau changed the document type code of these undelivered orders but did not remove the old document type code from the subsidiary records.", "Undelivered orders for services for three contracts totaling $20 million (previously discussed as part of our $55 million of proposed deobligations) had been completed as of September 30, 2000, and could have been deobligated.", "Undelivered orders also included $27 million of goods and services that had been delivered prior to September 30, 2000. The effect of these deliveries is a decrease in undelivered order balances and a corresponding increase in accounts payable balances as of September 30, 2000. We identified about $26 million by reviewing 95 subsequent disbursements over $500,000 from October 1, 2000, through January 31, 2001. The remaining $1 million was identified from a further examination of contracts, interagency agreements, purchase orders, invoices, and payments for account balances over $1 million through June 4, 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Management Systems Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s financial management systems encompass the software, hardware, personnel, manual and automated processes, procedures, internal controls, and data necessary to carry out financial management functions, manage financial operations, and report financial status. Weaknesses in the bureau\u2019s financial management systems affect the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of data needed for oversight and informed management decisions. The bureau has experienced persistent financial management systems problems for many years and has candidly acknowledged the material nonconformance of its financial systems in annual FMFIA reports. The bureau\u2019s fiscal years 1999 and 2000 FMFIA reports stated that further work was required to improve routine bureau reporting and systems controls.", "Extensive systems weaknesses and errors were found by the bureau and its auditors, and by us during our work on certain fiscal year 2000 bureau account balances. In addition, Commerce officials acknowledged significant fiscal year 2001 efforts to correct existing weaknesses in the bureau\u2019s core financial management system. We do not agree with the bureau\u2019s assertion in its annual financial report for fiscal year 2000 that its financial management systems substantially comply with FFMIA requirements. FFMIA was intended to advance federal financial management by ensuring that federal financial management systems can and do routinely provide reliable, timely, and consistent disclosure of financial data. FFMIA requires that agencies implement and maintain systems that substantially comply with federal financial management systems requirements, as contained in OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, the Joint Federal Management Improvement Program\u2019s (JFMIP) Framework for Federal Financial Management Systems, and JFMIP\u2019s Core Financial System Requirements;   applicable federal accounting standards; and the U.S. Standard General Ledger (SGL) at the transaction level.", "In its fiscal year 1999 and 2000 reports of compliance with laws and regulations, the bureau\u2019s auditing firm stated that the results of its tests disclosed no instances in which the bureau\u2019s financial management systems did not substantially comply with FFMIA. However, in its fiscal year 1998 report on compliance with laws and regulations, the bureau\u2019s previous auditing firm stated that the bureau did not substantially comply with FFMIA, and many of the same weaknesses this firm reported have continued. In our view, the bureau\u2019s financial management systems did not substantially comply with the three requirements of FFMIA as of September 30, 2000, as discussed below.", "First, we believe that the bureau\u2019s systems did not substantially comply with the federal financial management systems requirements. This is because the systems could not provide reliable and timely financial information to manage current government operations and prepare financial reports. The systems weaknesses were the result of a number of factors, including data quality and systems design issues. For example, the bureau\u2019s auditors reported the following weaknesses in the bureau\u2019s core financial management system, the Commerce Administrative Management System (CAMS).", "For fiscal year 1999, the auditors reported a material weakness in the ability of CAMS to produce necessary reports routinely and on time to meet internal and audit requirements. For example, CAMS was unable to prepare usable undelivered order and accounts payable subsidiary reports. In addition, the auditors reported a material weakness in certain information system controls, including the lack of a security plan for CAMS and needed improvements in the operating system that supported CAMS.", "For fiscal year 2000, the auditors determined that the bureau had made some systems improvements in CAMS and concluded that the reporting and controls were a reportable condition rather than a material internal control weakness. For example, the auditors reported in fiscal year 2000 that CAMS could not distinguish adjustments that occur between preliminary and final balances. In addition, reports required by Treasury, such as the SF-224, Statement of Transactions, and the SF-133, Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, were not supported by CAMS and had to be manually prepared. Further, the auditors continued to have concerns about weaknesses in bureau security planning, management, and access controls. A penetration test conducted by the auditors indicated that bureau systems and data were vulnerable to unauthorized access, although no actual instances of unauthorized access were detected. GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government highlight the need for adequate control over automated information systems to ensure protection from inappropriate access and unauthorized use by hackers and other trespassers or inappropriate use by agency personnel.", "We concurred with these auditor reports and, in conducting our test work of accounts payable and undelivered orders, identified several other serious systems deficiencies as follows.", "For fiscal year 2000, CAMS could not produce subsidiary records of accounts payable and undelivered orders by vendor to support its general ledger balances. Bureau officials stated that CAMS is a transaction-based system that has accumulated about 18 million records since it was initially installed on October 1, 1997. These records represent transactions for invoices, payments, and adjustments that would have to be sorted by vendor codes in order to obtain detail balances by vendor. Even if this were done, bureau officials expect their efforts to be hampered by thousands of balances of less than $1 because of small differences created by estimating and rounding of invoices and payments.", "CAMS had no archive capability to store millions of completed transactions to reduce volume and processing time and highlight errors, duplicates, and larger balances. According to Commerce officials responsible for CAMS, the archiving capability has not been a priority since new and faster computer hardware in fiscal year 2001 has reduced processing time for accounts payable and undelivered order subsidiary transaction reports from 22 hours to 2 hours. However, these subsidiary reports still remain unusable as a day-to-day reporting and control tool because they continue to include a large volume of completed transactions and are not sorted by vendor.", "Because CAMS subsidiary records for payables, receivables, property, and undelivered orders were not integrated with the general ledger, extensive manual reconciliation and workarounds were required, which are time- consuming and error prone. As a result of these deficiencies, the bureau took 3 months to provide us with an electronic file of undelivered order transactions that reconciled to the CAMS general ledger before intra- agency elimination entries. Even after this lengthy delay in obtaining the file, we still had to sort the transactions by vendor to obtain the September 30, 2000, undelivered order balance by vendor in order to conduct our testing. Further, the bureau was unable to provide a usable accounts payable listing by vendor as of September 30, 2000.", "Second, we believe that the bureau\u2019s financial management systems for fiscal year 2000 did not produce information that substantially complied with applicable federal accounting standards. This occurred because systems weaknesses affected the ability of the bureau to prepare its fiscal year 2000 financial statements and reports in accordance with GAAP. According to the January 4, 2001, OMB guidance for determining compliance with FFMIA, indicators of noncompliance with accounting standards would include the material weakness reported by the auditors on the bureau\u2019s difficulties and delays in producing complete and accurate financial statements and related disclosures. The material adjustments necessary to fairly present statements at year-end and the significant errors we found in accounts payable and undelivered order balances are evidence of serious weaknesses that impede compliance with GAAP.", "Finally, we believe that the bureau\u2019s financial management systems did not substantially comply with the last requirement of FFMIA regarding the SGL at the transaction level. This is because the bureau\u2019s subsidiary feeder systems do not interface with the CAMS core financial system general ledger for timely posting to the SGL at the transaction level. We noted that for fiscal year 2000, CAMS did not support reconciliation of SGL control accounts to their respective subsidiary records, such as the Undelivered Orders Report (FM 109) to the CAMS control accounts. Further, CAMS could not provide a usable accounts payable listing by vendor as of September 30, 2000, that would indicate the SGL accounts at the transaction level.", "According to Commerce officials, a number of improvements to the CAMS core financial system were made during fiscal year 2001, including improved capability to routinely generate usable detail subsidiary reports for advances, accounts receivable, accounts payable, undelivered orders, and unfilled customer orders;   a new process to test closing entries and run trial balances, enter audit adjustments, and generate postclosing balances;   certification tests of software that examined 176 functional areas and identified 9 exceptions for a compliance rate of 95 percent; and   cleanup of large volumes of unmatched transactions due to missing or erroneous vendor, customer, or document numbers from faulty feeder systems to improve reports needed for the annual audit process.", "We did not assess these reported improvements. The fiscal year 2001 financial closing and independent audit of the bureau will help determine the effectiveness of these actions. Further, Commerce officials stated that standard interfaces for accounts receivable and payable, which will allow source feeder system data to be posted at the transaction level to the CAMS general ledger more timely and accurately, are being built and are expected to be available by July 2002."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Review of Other Selected Areas", "paragraphs": ["As agreed, we also obtained financial system information and reviewed financial policies on other selected financial areas at the U.S. Census Bureau. These areas, presented in appendix III, were personnel and benefit expenditures, fund balance with Treasury, property and equipment, and government credit cards. The following are two areas of concern.", "For personnel expenditures, some salary amounts were charged to the wrong projects due to errors in time charge coding. This distorted variances when compared to planned amounts and created inaccurate measures of performance for selected projects. Projects affected were remote Alaska enumeration and advance visits for service-based enumeration. These errors occurred because bureau supervisors and timekeepers did not closely review project codes used by employees on timesheets.", "For property and equipment, over $158 million, about 57 percent, of total undepreciated accountable property in the bureau\u2019s records was not reported on the bureau\u2019s balance sheet as of September 30, 2000. Federal accounting standards state that property with a useful life of 2 years or more be capitalized but allow each agency to establish its own dollar threshold for capitalization.  Any amounts under that limit would be expensed. However, a limit that is too high understates the reported amount of property and equipment possessed by the bureau.

This section of the report addresses the bureau\u2019s disagreement with the two recommendations and our conclusion regarding compliance with FFMIA. The bureau\u2019s remaining specific comments are addressed in appendix IV.", "In general, the bureau stated that it is important to underscore its overarching success in managing the $4.5 billion budget appropriated for the 2000 census and that any analysis of the bureau\u2019s financial management system should acknowledge this significant achievement. However, the objectives of our budget review did not include assessing the efficiency of expenditures and obligations against planned budget appropriations. Rather, the objective of our review was to analyze budget variances reported by the U.S. Census Bureau and to identify other potential variances for the 2000 decennial census, including the reasons for these variances. Further, the bureau is still assessing the efficiency of the 2000 census in its postenumeration review, which will not be completed until fiscal year 2003. As stated in the introduction to this report, this product is one of several we will be issuing in the coming months on lessons learned from the 2000 census. As was done after the 1990 census, we are currently reviewing key operations of the 2000 census.", "With regard to the two recommendations with which the bureau did not agree, the first related to our call for the bureau to deobligate at least $55 million for contracts for which the work had been completed and no further amounts were needed. The bureau stated that the $55 million should not have been deobligated as of September 30, 2000, because final closeout, which may include late cost determinations, often occurs well after the period of performance has expired. However, the bureau indicated its agreement with the estimated amounts to be deobligated, stating that it had included an estimated $28 million in its fiscal year 2001 budget for prior-year recoveries and that the remaining $27 million would be used to partially offset its fiscal year 2002 appropriation. The bureau\u2019s primary concern was the timing of when these funds would be available.", "As indicated in the body of this report, three contracts had amounts totaling $20 million that should have been deobligated as of September 30, 2000, while three other contracts were completed and had amounts totaling $35 million that were available for potential deobligation by the time we completed our review in June 2001. As stated in our report, we recognize that an agency should identify and deobligate funds no longer needed after the agency is certain no related costs remain to be paid. Thus, the report takes into account the bureau\u2019s point that contract closeout may take some time beyond the end of the fiscal year.", "The second recommendation with which the bureau disagreed related to the bureau\u2019s property and equipment capitalization threshold. The bureau stated that the Department of Commerce had issued a capitalization threshold of $25,000 for individual purchases, which Census then adopted. We did not evaluate the appropriateness of the $25,000 threshold for the Department of Commerce as a whole and agree that the amount of the bureau\u2019s net property and equipment appears to be insignificant at that level. However, we continue to recommend that the threshold be considered and evaluated separately for the U.S. Census Bureau in light of the fact that the higher threshold resulted in eliminating 57 percent of the bureau\u2019s accountable property and equipment from its balance sheet\u2014 which is significant to the bureau.", "Finally, the primary finding with which the bureau disagreed in its specific comments was our assessment that the bureau\u2019s financial management systems did not substantially comply with the requirements of FFMIA as of September 30, 2000. The bureau stated that its financial management system complied with all FFMIA requirements and identified three issues as key support for its position. We disagree with each of these points and continue to believe that the bureau\u2019s financial management systems were not FFMIA compliant.", "First, the bureau indicated that its financial systems were able to support a $4.5 billion budget, and bureau managers used financial management reports to meet all statutory deadlines and complete the 2000 operations on time and under budget. As stated previously, the objectives of this report did not include a qualitative analysis of the bureau\u2019s performance in conducting the 2000 census. However, our report does describe several instances of noncompliance with FFMIA requirements. For example, as stated in the body of this report, the bureau\u2019s auditors reported as a material internal control weakness that reports required by Treasury such as the SF-224, Statement of Transactions, and the SF-133, Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, were not supported by the bureau\u2019s financial management systems and had to be manually prepared. While the bureau\u2019s response cited OMB\u2019s January 4, 2001, guidance on FFMIA implementation in support of its position, the bureau did not include a key sentence from the guidance, which states, \u201cAuditors then need to use judgement in assessing whether the adverse impacts caused by identified deficiencies are instances of substantial noncompliance with FFMIA.\u201d In our view, the above material weakness was clearly evidence of substantial noncompliance as of September 30, 2000.", "Second, the bureau stated that CAMS met 95 percent of JFMIP core requirements and used standard general ledger accounts as required. Also, although the bureau agreed that manual processes are required, it cited OMB guidance that states systems need not be entirely automated to be FFMIA compliant. Our report acknowledges that, according to bureau officials, a number of improvements were made to the CAMS core financial system subsequent to September 30, 2000. Although we did not assess these reported subsequent improvements, their description, number, and significance supports our belief that CAMS did not comply with FFMIA as of September 30, 2000. Further, Commerce officials cited additional work to be done such as building standard interfaces for accounts receivable and payable, which are not expected to be available until July 2002. In addition, we agree that the use of manual processes does not necessarily indicate FFMIA noncompliance. However, the deficiency we pointed out was the CAMS lack of integrated subsidiary records with the general ledger, requiring extensive manual reconciliation and workarounds, which are time consuming and error prone. At the transaction level, we reported problems with timely posting to the SGL and the reconciliation of SGL control accounts to their respective subsidiary records, as well as the inability to provide a usable accounts payable listing by vendor.", "Third, according to the bureau, its financial management systems substantially comply with federal accounting standards because the errors and year-end adjustments we identified in accounts payable and undelivered orders were not \u201cmaterial enough\u201d to warrant a finding of noncompliance. Our report contains several indicators of noncompliance with accounting standards, which are consistent with OMB guidance on this issue. Specifically, evidence of serious weaknesses that impede compliance with accounting standards includes (1) the material weakness reported by its auditor on the bureau\u2019s difficulties and delays in producing complete and accurate financial statements and related disclosures, (2) the material adjustments necessary to fairly present statements at year- end, and (3) the significant errors we found in accounts payable and undelivered order balances.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Government Reform.

According to the bureau, half of the positive variance of $6 million for project 6301 for definition of geographic area was caused by overestimating the number of geographic staff required to carry out the participant statistical area program. The remaining half of the positive variance is attributed by the bureau to fewer geographic clerks in the National Processing Center (NPC) for the Boundary and Annexation Survey mailing and response processing. This resulted in lower salary and benefit costs for about 224 FTEs. 2.  The negative variance of $20 million for project 6331 for nonresponse follow-up assignment control was caused by an underestimate of funds for salary, travel, and other costs. According to the bureau, the underestimate was caused by an unanticipated activity of rescheduling and assigning enumerators to recount about 122,000 questionnaires that were lost between the local census offices and the data capture centers. 3.  The negative variance of $26 million for project 6333 for nonresponse follow-up assignment preparation was because of an underestimate of funds for salary, travel, and other costs. According to the bureau, this underestimate was caused by unplanned activity of preparing information packages for enumerator to recount over 600,000 cases in which questionnaires did not indicate the number of persons living in the household. 4.  The positive variance of $8 million for project 6335 for the Be Counted and Questionnaire Assistance Center programs was caused by the lower workload that resulted in salary, travel, and other cost savings. According to the bureau, the 886,000 actual addresses processed were 10 percent less than the 980,000 addresses planned for the program. The bureau believed this occurred because it had a better address list than originally anticipated so people did not need to rely on the Be Counted forms available at walk-in centers, such as community centers, churches, libraries, post offices, and other public facilities. Also, many of the Be Counted forms received were not used as households were already counted as a part of the regular mail out and mail back process.5.  A negative variance of $53 million occurred for project 6336 for coverage improvement follow-up that resulted in higher salary, travel, and other costs. According to the bureau, the variance was because of the unanticipated need to verify 1.5 million new addresses as vacant and to identify about 68,000 households to be recounted by enumerators for one area because the accuracy of the enumeration was in question. 6.  A positive variance of $31 million occurred for project 6337 for group quarters enumeration in places like prisons, nursing homes, and school dormitories. According to the bureau, the variance was because of a two-thirds lower workload of 172,000 actual units rather than the 519,000 units planned, which resulted in salary, travel, and other cost savings. The bureau believes this occurred because some of the addresses it planned for group quarters enumeration were actually businesses, commercial establishments, duplicates, or nonexistent. 7.  A positive variance of $8 million occurred for project 6338 for list enumeration in areas where residences do not receive mail delivery, such as rural areas where mail is sent to post office boxes. According to the bureau, the variance occurred because of a 25-percent lower workload of 372,000 actual units rather than the 500,000 units planned, which resulted in salary, travel, and other cost savings. The bureau believes this occurred because of inaccurate address lists that determined planned amounts. 8.  The negative variance of $87 million for project 6339 for nonresponse follow-up enumeration was caused by higher costs than planned for enumerator salary and benefit costs and a higher workload for unanticipated recounts. According to bureau data, enumerators were paid almost $1 an hour more than the average $11.77 an hour planned in order to recruit a sufficient number of quality temporary workers in a tight labor market. In addition, almost 3,300 more FTE enumerators were hired than planned. This occurred because of the bureau\u2019s front- loaded staffing strategy that anticipated a 150-percent turnover of enumerators coupled with a higher workload for unexpected household visits to recount almost 800,000 incomplete, lost, or inaccurate questionnaires for   over 600,000 cases in which returned questionnaires did not indicate the number of persons living in the household (preparation costs are item #3),   122,000 questionnaires that were lost between completion by local census offices and processing by the data capture centers (assignment costs are item #2), and   68,000 questionnaires that were recounted because the accuracy of the enumeration was in question. (Identification costs are item #5.) 9.  The positive variance of $7 million for project 6341 for remote Alaska enumeration was because, according to the bureau, salary and other costs were erroneously charged to project 6516 for enumerating special populations. (See #19.) 10. A positive variance of $32 million occurred in project 6342 for service based enumeration in places like soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and areas frequented by persons with no fixed addresses. According to the bureau, the variance was caused by an 80-percent lower workload of 14,000 actual sites verses the 69,000 sites planned, which resulted in salary, travel, and other cost savings. The bureau believes that the majority of the planned sites did not exist and were added to address lists because of inaccurate national and local data. Also, bureau officials stated that some costs of advance visits were erroneously charged to project 6516 for enumerating special populations. (See #19.) 11. The positive variance of $95 million for project 6447 for data collection A (intercity support staff in 102 local census offices) was caused by lower support workloads than planned, and the higher than expected mail response rate was a contributing factor. According to the bureau, this resulted in cost efficiencies in logistical support salaries of 3,578 FTEs compared to the 6,416 FTEs planned, for savings of 44 percent. 12. The positive variance of $55 million for project 6448 for data collection B (suburb support staff in 51 local census offices) was caused by lower support workloads than planned, and the higher than expected mail response rate was a contributing factor. According to the bureau, this resulted in cost efficiencies in logistical support salaries of 1,692 FTEs compared to the 3,221 FTEs planned, for savings of 47 percent. 13. The positive variance of $134 million for project 6449 for data collection C (small town support staff in 316 local census offices) was caused by lower support workloads than planned, and the higher than expected mail response rate was a contributing factor. According to the bureau, this resulted in cost efficiencies in logistical support salaries of 10,723 FTEs compared to 16,480 FTEs planned, for savings of 35 percent. 14. The positive variance of $14 million for project 6450 for data collection D (rural support staff in 42 local census offices) was caused by lower support workloads than planned, and the higher than expected mail response rate was a contributing factor. According to the bureau, this resulted in cost efficiencies in logistical support salaries of 1,633 FTEs compared to the 2,532 FTEs planned for savings of 35 percent. 15. According to the bureau, the negative variance of $7 million for project 6455 for kit preparation was caused by higher than planned staff overtime and priority shipping costs to ensure delivery of materials and supplies to the 520 temporary local census offices to begin enumeration. 16. The positive variance of $11 million for project 6470 for regional direction and control was caused by lower support staff workloads than planned in 12 regional census offices, and the higher than expected mail response rate was a contributing factor. According to the bureau, this resulted in cost efficiencies in logistical support salaries of 1,161 FTEs compared to the 1,518 FTEs planned, for savings of 24 percent. 17. The positive variance of $39 million for project 6480 for ACE collection activity was caused by a lower than planned workload of cases requiring personal visits. According to the bureau, this resulted in lower data collection costs for staff salaries and benefits of $33 million, lower equipment costs of $4 million, and lower office rental costs of $2 million. The purpose of ACE was to estimate the population for purposes such as redistricting by sampling households from an address list developed independently of the address list used to enumerate the census. The results of ACE (formerly Integrated Coverage Management) were to have been statistically combined with the results of enumeration to form a single, integrated set of population counts. 18. According to the bureau, the positive variance of $36 million for project 6510 for regional and local census office support was caused by lower support workloads, which resulted in lower office space and equipment costs than planned. The mail response rate was a contributing factor to the lower support workloads. 19. According to the bureau, the negative variance of $18 million for project 6516 for enumerating special populations was caused by charging salary and other costs erroneously charged from Remote Alaska (see #9) and some costs of advance visits for service-based enumeration (see #10). 20. According to the bureau, the positive variance of $31 million for project 6540 for telecommunications was the result of renegotiating a 90-percent reduction in FTS 2000 long distance phone costs from a planned 10 cents a minute to an actual 1 cent a minute. 21. According to the bureau, the positive variance of $6 million for project 6910 for automated acquisitions was primarily the result of lower computer equipment costs and lower headquarters telephone support costs than planned. 22. According to the bureau, the positive variance of $14 million for project 6912 for telephone questionnaire assistance was caused by lower contractor costs in running the program since the number of inbound calls of 6 million was 45 percent lower than the 11 million calls planned. 23. The negative variance of $5 million for project 6406 for address list capture was caused by the higher than planned workload for support staff updating enumerator maps and the address database. According to the bureau, planned workload was 2.4 million map sheets while the actual workload was over 150 percent higher at 6.1 million map sheets because the number of new and corrected locations was higher than anticipated. 24. The positive variance of $7 million for project 6408 non-ID processing was caused by the lower than planned workload for support staff to match and code questionnaires for the Be Counted and Telephone Assistance programs. According to the bureau, planned workload was 2.5 million addresses and actual workload was 52 percent lower at 1.2 million addresses because more information was already contained in mailed questionnaires than anticipated. 25. According to the bureau, the negative variance of $9 million for project 6918 for the DCS 2000 contract was caused by higher contractor costs than planned to scan census questionnaires in two passes. The first pass scanned six basic questions on both the short and long forms, and the second scanned the balance of long form responses. The bureau refers to this as the two-pass approach to data capture. 26. The positive variance of $22 million for project 6922 for NPC data capture operations was caused by a lower workload than planned for forms to process and higher productivity for data entry. According to the bureau, 5 million fewer mail back, enumerator, and group quarters forms were processed, and data entry productivity of 6,500 keystrokes per hour was higher than the 5,200 keystrokes per hour planned. 27.

See the \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section of this report. 2.  Our report clearly lays out the source and status of the budget variances we identified. We note that the bureau\u2019s restatement of our findings still concludes with the same dollar amounts we reported. 3.  We have modified footnote 10 to add that the appropriation for Periodic Censuses and Programs established a 3-day notification period for reprogramming funds provided by the appropriation. 4.  The bureau\u2019s increased reliance on private contractors was stated factually, and the scope of our work did not include determining whether the use of contractors was appropriate for the involved activities. The human capital issue described in the body of this report reflects a concern that the bureau did not have a sufficient number of experienced accountants familiar with the financial statement process and able to effectively monitor year-end reconciliations or provide needed accounting support on a day-to-day basis. While not specifically disclosed as part of an independent auditor\u2019s report on internal control, the assessment of the bureau\u2019s internal control environment as high risk by its independent auditor was supported by the auditor\u2019s working papers, which were within the scope of our work as stated in appendix I, \u201cObjectives, Scope, and Methodology.\u201d 5.  We have modified the report to indicate that the FMFIA weakness reported by the bureau seriously affected the bureau\u2019s ability to conform with generally accepted accounting principles. 6.  The bureau\u2019s response presented new information on system testing that was not mentioned throughout our discussions with key bureau officials, up to and including our exit conference on June 15, 2001. However, in our experience, system testing is usually done on downloaded offline systems data so that online data needed for management are not altered, disrupted, or lost. To delay posting $65 million of year-end adjustments for 7 months due to systems testing would, in our view, seriously hamper financial management activities. This is because, during this period, system personnel would be using automated screen inquiries for individual contracts that contain incorrect and misleading data and would have to refer to a manual tracking list of adjustments, a cumbersome and error-prone process. 7.  Bureau officials told us, in the context of accounts payable and undelivered order transactions, that about 18 million records accumulated since the installation of CAMS on October 1, 1997. The bureau\u2019s response that 100 million transaction records have accumulated since CAMS\u2019 inception provides further evidence that the bureau should develop archive capability to store millions of completed transactions in order to reduce volume and processing time and to highlight errors, duplicates, and larger balances."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Staff members who made key contributions to this report were Cindy Barnes, Linda Brigham, Amy Chang, and Peggy Smith."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
