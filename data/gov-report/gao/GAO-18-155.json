This report describes: (1) the types of actions that key federal agencies have taken to develop biological threat awareness, and how that information is used to support investment decisions; (2) the extent to which these agencies have developed shared threat awareness; and (3) how DHS's NBACC determines what additional threat characterization knowledge to pursue.", "GAO analyzed federal policies, directives, and strategies related to biodefense, as well as agency documents such as threat assessments and modeling studies. We identified five key biodefense agencies based on review of the roles designated in these documents. GAO interviewed officials from these agencies about threat awareness activities, and reviewed prior GAO work and related biodefense studies.

Scientific research is also performed on emerging pathogens to understand their means of transmission, host susceptibility, and effects of infection.", "Analysis activities: Agencies use modeling studies and other analytical work to help determine the scope and impact of possible biological threats.", "These three activities help agencies identify and prioritize the most dangerous biological threats, which can then be used to guide biodefense investments. For example, USDA told GAO it uses threat information to determine which foreign animal diseases represent its highest priorities based on the potential of those agents to cause catastrophic harm, and those priorities are used to inform investments. Similarly, HHS said it conducts threat awareness activities to help inform the development and acquisition of human medical countermeasures.", "Federal agencies with key roles in biodefense share biological threat information through many different mechanisms designed to facilitate collaboration among government partners, including working groups and interagency agreements. For example, agency officials reported using collaborative mechanisms to coordinate activities and avoid duplication and overlap. However, as GAO and others have noted, opportunities exist to better leverage shared resources and inform budgetary tradeoffs. Recent legislation requires key biodefense agencies to create a national biodefense strategy that has the potential to help address these issues, by, among other things, supporting shared threat awareness. Until the strategy is developed, the extent to which it will meet this need is unknown.", "The threat characterization research agenda at DHS's National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) is based primarily on the results and knowledge gaps identified through the Bioterrorism Risk Assessment (BTRA). According to DHS officials, the knowledge gaps deemed most critical include data about biological agents that have a high impact on BTRA consequence estimates and also a high degree of uncertainty. Each year NBACC produces an annual plan that outlines new research projects intended to address these knowledge gaps, and incorporates additional planning criteria, such as interagency stakeholder input, resource availability, and maintenance of required technical capabilities.

Agent\u2014Microorganism (or derived toxin) or  pest that causes disease in humans, animals,  or plants.  Characterization (of agents, pests and  biological events)\u2014Agents and pests can be  characterized by applying modern scientific  techniques that describe their properties,  behaviors, life cycle, or genetic makeup.  Biological events can be characterized by  evaluating specific disease outbreaks to  understand what the outbreak is and how  serious it is likely to be by monitoring such  things as the cause, speed, duration, and  means of transmission.  Surveillance\u2014In the biological context, the  ongoing collection, analysis, and  interpretation of data to help look for  pathogens in plants, animals, and humans; in  food supplies; and in the environment.  Detection\u2014In the biological context, involves  recognition of signs and signals to discern  whether disease occurrence is abnormal  based on its general characteristics, as well  as where, when, and how severely the  disease has historically occurred. supply, or used to contaminate the water supply.

One of the pillars of  biodefense identified in HSPD-10 is threat awareness, which consists of  activities such as collecting and analyzing intelligence, developing risk  assessments, and anticipating future threats. For example, such  information may include assessment about where biological threat agents  might come from, how outbreaks may unfold, and the effectiveness of  available defenses against them. Threat awareness is vital to help identify  necessary biodefense capabilities to help identify, protect against, and  respond to National or Global Catastrophic Biological Risks and help  ensure investments are prioritized to make effective use of federal funds.", "Protecting humans, animals, plants, food, and the environment (air, soil,  and water) from potentially catastrophic effects of intentional or natural  biological events entails numerous activities carried out within and among  multiple federal agencies and their nonfederal partners. The Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a lead role in interagency coordination  and planning for emergency response to biological incidents in the United  States and is responsible for assessing the risks to the civilian population  posed by various biological agents. DHS conducts multiple efforts to  enhance biological threat awareness, including development of the  Bioterrorism Risk Assessment (BTRA) with input from other key federal  agencies, such as the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Health and  Human Services (HHS).

We analyzed these  documents to understand agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities regarding  biodefense, specifically those pertaining to threat awareness activities.  We identified the key biodefense agencies by reviewing the biodefense  policies mentioned above, as well as through interviews with DHS officials  who identified the key agencies with which they collaborate on threat  awareness activities. The agencies we identified through these policy  reviews and interviews were DHS, DOD, HHS, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).", "To describe how these five key agencies conduct their threat awareness  activities and use this information to support investment decisions, we  reviewed agency-specific strategies and plans related to their biodefense  activities, including those from NBACC, DOD\u2019s Chemical and Biological  Defense Program, the multiagency Public Health Emergency Medical  Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE), and USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant  Health Inspection Service (APHIS). We also analyzed information  provided by agencies and conducted interviews with agency officials  related to agencies\u2019 threat awareness activities to determine how threat  awareness is conducted and how it informs other biodefense  investments. For example, we reviewed documents such as threat  assessments, including the 2010 and 2016 BTRAs; scientific reports on  biological agent characteristics; modeling studies of the potential impact  of various biological threats; and response guidelines informed by  biological threat awareness activities. For additional context and support,  we also reviewed prior GAO work related to biodefense and reports from  other organizations, such as the Congressional Research Service, the  Bipartisan Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism Research Center, the  Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, and the National Research  Council of the National Academies.", "To determine the extent that federal agencies have developed shared  threat awareness and how NBACC determines what additional threat  characterization knowledge to pursue, we conducted a site visit to  NBACC at Fort Detrick, Maryland, to meet with DHS officials and NBACC  staff to discuss the collaborative efforts among the key biodefense  agencies in conducting and reviewing the BTRA. We interviewed agency  officials from DHS, DOD, HHS, USDA, and EPA to understand the types  of collaborative activities they engage in, examine the opportunities  available to share threat awareness information, and identify any  challenges in sharing information across agencies. We compared the  activities to leading practices we have identified in prior work to enhance  and sustain interagency collaboration. We also examined existing policy,  strategies, and structures that could enable shared threat awareness  activities, including the recent National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  mandate to create a national biodefense strategy.

Despite ratification of the Biological Weapons Convention in 1975 and the  end of the Cold War decades later, the threat of biological warfare  persists today. For example, as the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on  Biodefense reported, the State Department assessed in 2015 that China,  Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Syria continue to engage in dual-use or  biological weapons-specific activities and are failing to comply with the  convention, to which each of these countries has agreed. Additionally, the  revolution in biotechnology presents opportunities to advance the life  sciences, yet that same technology in the wrong hands could be used to  create biological weapons. For example, nonstate actors such as  terrorist organizations, domestic militia groups, and \u201clone wolves\u201d have  both the interest and capacity to develop biological weapons. The  intelligence community plays a key role in assessing these types of  threats.", "Threat awareness is also challenged by the unpredictable nature of  naturally occurring disease, which could affect human and animal health  and agricultural security, potentially causing global catastrophic biological  risks which could lead to loss of life, and sustained damage to the  economy, societal stability, or global security. To assess and develop  means to combat these threats, many federal agencies conduct biological  threat awareness activities, which may include a combination of risk  assessment and key activities to better understand certain characteristics  of biological threats. For example, the genetic compositions of some  viruses naturally change, as exemplified in 2009, when an H1N1  influenza virus emerged with a new combination of genes, causing a  global pandemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC)\u2014an entity within HHS\u2014when these significant genetic  changes occur in a virus, most people have little or no immunity to the  new virus. Climate change also has the potential to negatively impact  human health and the agriculture industry. As we reported in October  2015, climate change may contribute to the spread of vector-borne  diseases that are transmitted to humans by animals, including  invertebrate animals such as mosquitoes and ticks. Examples of vector- borne diseases that currently pose health risks in some regions of North  America include chikungunya disease, dengue fever, Lyme disease, and  West Nile virus fever. Additionally, habitat loss and human  encroachment on rural and wildlife environments are bringing populations  of humans and animals into closer and more frequent contact, increasing  the risk of disease transmission among people, pets, livestock, and  wildlife.", "Finally, the scientific community must safeguard the biological agents it  uses to assess threats. Protecting laboratory workers and the population  at large from intentional or accidental release of dangerous pathogens  during the pursuit of more knowledge about them is also challenging.  Recent high-profile events, such as a DOD laboratory inadvertently  shipping incompletely inactivated samples of Bacillus anthracis, the  bacterium that causes anthrax, to almost 200 laboratories worldwide over  the course of 12 years and the unexpected discovery of misplaced vials  of smallpox (variola) virus at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  campus, also highlight the threat due to improper handling and unknown  storage of dangerous biological agents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Several federal departments and agencies have responsibilities as part of  their mission to assess the threat of biological agents and carry out key  biodefense roles as delineated in HSPD-10 and the National Strategy for  Countering Biological Threats, among other documents.", "National Biodefense Analysis and  Countermeasures Center (NBACC)  NBACC consists of two centers:  National Biological Threat Characterization  Center  Its mission supports national goals to deter  and reduce the impact of current and newly  identified biological threats by providing timely  scientific data, knowledge products, and  expertise required for accurate and informed  threat analyses and biodefense planning,  preparedness, response, and recovery.

Since that time, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC)  Global Disease Detection Operations Center  has been monitoring the spread of the  epidemic from Brazil to other countries in the  Americas. By early 2016, the Zika virus had  spread to dozens of countries, including local  transmission in U.S. territories. At this time,  CDC activated its Emergency Operations  Center to respond to outbreaks of Zika  occurring in the Americas, and enhance  disease surveillance and response  coordination.  In February 2016, the director of CDC said  that recent chikungunya and dengue  outbreaks in the United States suggest that  Zika outbreaks in the U.S. mainland may be  relatively small and localized, which can be  attributed to better infrastructure and mosquito  control than that found in Latin America. In  contrast, he said outbreaks of dengue and  chikungunya suggest that Zika virus may  spread widely in the U.S. territories.  CDC estimates of Zika virus cases for 2016  support the CDC director\u2019s prediction, with  224 locally acquired mosquito-borne cases in  the United States (in Florida and Texas)  compared to nearly 36,000 locally acquired  cases in U.S. territories (largely in Puerto  Rico).

However, as we and others have observed in  recent reports, opportunities remain to enhance threat awareness across  the entire biodefense enterprise, leverage shared resources, and inform  budgetary tradeoffs among various threats and agency programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Partners Share Biological Threat Information through a Combination of Working Groups, Interagency Agreements, and Other Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["Officials from key federal agencies, including DHS, DOD, EPA, HHS, and  USDA, identified multiple mechanisms that facilitated biodefense  collaboration and shared awareness of biological threats. These  mechanisms often serve multiple purposes; for example, a working group  can develop policy and also aid in information sharing, among other  benefits. Officials from these key biodefense agencies reported using  collaborative mechanisms to share biological threat information, as well  as to coordinate activities, avoid duplication and overlap, implement  specific programs for addressing biological threats, and assist in policy  development at the agency and White House level. The existence of  working groups and similar bodies to help promote information sharing,  align policies and procedures, and coordinate to leverage resources is  consistent with key practices and mechanisms that we have previously  reported as useful for enhancing and sustaining interagency  collaboration. Figure 7 provides examples of collaborative mechanisms  identified for biodefense.", "Officials at key federal agencies reported participating in several types of  collaborative mechanisms, including interagency bodies, working groups  at the agency and executive level, formalized agreements, colocation,  joint projects and funding efforts, and shared expertise. Examples within  each mechanism include the following:  Interagency bodies. Key federal agencies reported participating in  formal interagency bodies that have their own authority and resources  and are established to coordinate activities related to biodefense. One  such group is PHEMCE, the federal interagency decision-making body for  medical countermeasure development and acquisition. PHEMCE is led  by HHS, and includes both internal HHS partners, such as CDC, FDA,  and NIH, and external interagency partners, such as DOD, DHS, USDA,  and the Department of Veterans Affairs. In addition, other key agency  officials reported participating in interagency bodies coordinated by HHS  and USDA to determine additions and removals to the select agent list.", "Working groups. Officials in each of the key agencies said they  participate in established and ad hoc working groups to provide subject- matter knowledge and expertise, share information, prioritize research,  and avoid duplicating efforts. For example, officials from over a dozen  agencies and components participate in an Interagency Bioterrorism  Working Group through DHS that provides a conduit for interagency  review of technical inputs and assumptions for biological agents and other  parameters in the BTRA. DHS officials stated that this working group also  works to obtain wider interagency understanding and ownership of the  DHS BTRA. Officials from DOD\u2019s JPEO-CBD also stated that they sit on  multiple interagency working groups with DHS officials that focus on  combating terrorism, biosurveillance, and research and development,  among other topics. Similarly, CDC officials stated they participated on  approximately 10 to 20 separate working groups with specialized  purposes, such as integrated process teams for specific research  programs.", "Collaborative mechanisms within the Executive Office of the  President. Some working groups and other collaboration mechanisms  have been led by the National Security Council and other offices within  the Executive Office of the President in order to ensure a comprehensive  and coordinated approach to biodefense across agencies. For example,  the Subcommittee on Biological Defense Research and Development  was led by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and  included representatives from 16 agencies and three White House  offices. This subcommittee evaluated U.S. biological defense capabilities  to identify future priorities and actions. The National Security Council has  also led integrated policy committees focused on a particular threat or  range of threats, such as genome editing and synthesis and select agents  and toxins.", "Written interagency agreements. Agencies have executed written  agreements in order to define their relationships for a particular aspect of  biodefense. For example, in March 2015, DOD, DHS, and EPA renewed  a formalized relationship through a memorandum of understanding for  chemical and biological defense research, development, and  acquisition\u2014all of which require shared threat awareness. The  agreement identifies roles and responsibilities for chemical and biological  defense, establishes senior and technical working groups, and  establishes cross-agency responsibilities. In particular, DOD, DHS, and  EPA agreed to exchange and identify program needs and overlapping  interests; establish interagency agreements between parties for joint  projects and funding; conduct research and provide data to the partner  agencies; and facilitate the establishment of interagency projects and  working groups. DOD officials stated that the activities carried out under  the memorandum have varied over time, but ongoing collaborative  activities included efforts in biosurveillance, wearable sensors,  decontamination, and a repository for threat agent data.", "Joint facility locations. As we reported in 2014, to maximize resource  sharing and facilitate scientific exchange on the study of biological threat  agents and other pathogens, DOD, HHS, and DHS share a joint biological  campus, known as the National Interagency Biodefense Campus, located  at Fort Detrick, Maryland. DHS officials said that, in addition to gaining  efficiencies by sharing biosecurity and infrastructure requirements among  all three facilities (U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious  Diseases, DHS\u2019s NBACC, and NIH\u2019s Integrated Research Facility),  personnel at the three laboratories can communicate more regularly than  would otherwise be possible with different locations. The agencies  represented on the National Interagency Biodefense Campus also  conduct a research consortium to coordinate projects.", "Joint funding and program efforts. Key federal biodefense agencies  have provided funding to partner organizations and agencies in order to  obtain technical assistance or expertise for individual projects. DOD and  EPA officials stated that DHS\u2019s S&T Directorate often funds subject- matter experts to perform research and testing to assist in the  development of answers to technical questions. For example, DHS  funded staff at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious  Diseases to research the characteristics of a particular agent in an  aerosolized environment.", "Leveraging expertise. Agency officials also stated how more informal  mechanisms, such as relationships between key personnel and soliciting  input for research projects, provide the opportunity to leverage expertise  to share threat awareness information and can increase collaboration and  positive results between agencies. For example, DHS holds interagency  stakeholder panels and outreach events (separate from existing working  groups) to gather expertise during development of several biodefense  products, including the BTRA. DHS officials said that DOD personnel  from DTRA and DHS\u2019s Biological Threat Characterization Program also  conduct joint program reviews, and DHS personnel contribute expertise to  DTRA\u2019s contract evaluation teams."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biodefense Strategy Provides an Opportunity to Use Enterprise-Wide Threat Awareness to Help Leverage Resources and Inform Resource Tradeoffs", "paragraphs": ["The collaborative mechanisms in which the key agencies in our review  participate may facilitate information sharing in support of specific federal  activities and in individual programs, or in response to specific biological  events after they begin to unfold, but there is no mechanism in place to  develop enterprise-wide threat awareness and assess the relative risks.  For example, the BTRA is a dedicated effort to identify and assess the  risk of biological events that stem from nonstate actors intentionally  seeking to harm U.S. interests using biological agents. By design, it is  focused on the consequences and likelihood of terrorist events  threatening human health, and does not assess the risk from other types  of biological threats. However, there is no similar comprehensive  mechanism in place that integrates threat awareness information for all  sources of intentional biological threats, as well as naturally occurring  events that could harm or destabilize U.S. interests by catastrophically  affecting humans, animals, and plants. Similarly, HHS officials stated that  PHEMCE is a primary mechanism used to communicate threat  awareness and other information on biodefense. However, the primary  purpose of PHEMCE is to make decisions about human health  countermeasures to be acquired for the Strategic National Stockpile. As a  result, biological threat information pertaining to other domains, such as  plant or animal health, may not be discussed and shared within this  venue without a connection to human health.", "In addition, there is no existing mechanism that can leverage threat  awareness information to direct resources and set budgetary priorities  across all agencies for biodefense. Agencies use threat awareness  mechanisms for resource planning according to the individual agency\u2019s  mission. For example, DOD guidance states that budgeting and planning  for biodefense relies, in part, on DIA\u2019s CBRN Warfare Capstone Threat  Assessment. Similarly, DHS officials stated they use the BTRA to help  plan DHS investments in future research or to help inform domestic  biodefense preparations. According to DOD officials, because the DOD  mission is different, they only use the BTRA indirectly and do not  specifically rely on it for prioritizing activities or planning efforts.", "HSPD-10 requires the development of periodic assessments of the  evolving biological weapons threats. DHS officials stated that the BTRA  was created, in part, to fulfill the need for an assessment of the risk of  intentional use of biological weapons by nonstate terrorists. However, the  nation faces other biological threats, including naturally occurring  diseases that affect human, animal, and plant health, and biological  weapons used by state actors. Without a mechanism that is able to  assess the relative risk from biological threats across all sources and  domains, the nation may be unable to prioritize resources, defenses, and  countermeasures against the most pressing threats.", "We previously reported in 2011 that the overarching biodefense  enterprise would benefit from strategic oversight mechanisms, including a  national strategy, to ensure efficient, effective, and accountable results.  We noted that the complexity and fragmentation of roles and  responsibilities across numerous federal and nonfederal entities presents  challenges to ensuring efficiency and effectiveness across the entire  biodefense enterprise. In light of that complexity and fragmentation, we  observed that a national biodefense strategy could help address the key  fragmentation issues across the biodefense enterprise, such as ensuring  strong linkage and identifying gaps in investments across the four pillars.  In response to our observations, National Security Council staff in  December 2014 identified three presidential policy documents\u2014the  National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, the National  Biosurveillance Strategy, and Presidential Policy Directive 8\u2014they  reported work in concert to provide comprehensive strategic guidance.  However, none of these documents comprehensively addresses all four  pillars of biodefense, and, even when taken together, they do not fully  address the fragmentation issues we have previously identified.", "Other independent observers have also commented on challenges  presented by fragmentation and complexity across the biodefense  enterprise. For example, in October 2015, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel  on Biodefense reported that the United States lacked strategic leadership  to promote collaboration within the federal government and other  biodefense partners and achieve innovation throughout the enterprise.  The study panel also recommended that the federal government develop,  implement, and update a comprehensive national biodefense strategy  that would define all organizational structures, future plans, and resource  requirements along with unified budgetary authority.", "We testified in 2016 that several high-level biodefense strategies had  been created in the past. However, there is no broad, integrated  strategy that can be used to identify risk, assess resources, and prioritize  investments. For example, the National Security Council\u2019s National  Strategy for Countering Biological Threats is focused solely on outlining  the federal government\u2019s approach to reducing the risks of biological  weapons proliferation and terrorism, while the National Health Security  Strategy authored by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and  Response (ASPR) seeks to strengthen communities\u2019 abilities to protect  against and respond to any incidents with negative health consequences.  While these and other strategies, such as the National Strategy for  Biosurveillance, address aspects of biodefense, no single strategy  provides a comprehensive approach for the nation to prepare and plan for  biological threats. In addition, as we reported in 2016, the individual  strategies related to pieces of the biodefense enterprise do not currently  address the need for prioritization and tradeoffs among approaches when  faced with limited resources and expansive threat.", "In addition, there is no individual or entity with responsibility, authority,  and accountability for overseeing the entire biodefense enterprise. White  House officials have previously told us that the National Security Council  and the Homeland Security Council act together as focal points for federal  biodefense efforts. As noted above, many federal departments and  agencies participate in National Security Council groups and  mechanisms, and biodefense efforts at the White House level are  recognized collaboration mechanisms. However, as described in the Blue  Ribbon Study Panel report and reported to us by HHS and DHS officials,  these mechanisms may not persist from one presidential administration to  the next. As a result, any mechanism located within bodies such as the  National Security Council and Homeland Security Council may not  provide the continuity and leadership needed to address persistent  biological threats. The absence of mechanisms to develop shared threat  awareness across the full set of biological threats and use that  information to identify opportunities for leveraging resources to mitigate  risk across the enterprise is another example of the fragmentation we  have previously identified.", "However, opportunities exist to enhance shared threat awareness across  the biodefense enterprise. Enacted on December 23, 2016, the National  Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 required DOD,  HHS, DHS, and USDA to jointly develop a national biodefense strategy and associated implementation plan. The law requires the strategy and  implementation plan to:  inventory and assess all existing strategies, plans, policies, laws, and  interagency agreements related to biodefense; describe biological threats from warfare, terrorism, naturally occurring  infectious disease, and accidental exposure; describe current federal efforts preventing the proliferation and use of  biological weapons, preventing accidental or naturally occurring  outbreaks, and mitigating the effects of an epidemic; describe roles and responsibilities of the agencies for biodefense; describe interagency capabilities required to support the national  recommend actions for strengthening current biodefense capabilities  and structures, and for improving interagency coordination.", "According to DHS officials, as of September 2017, the White House  National Security Council is currently overseeing an interagency  workgroup to develop that strategy. DOD officials confirmed that the  process to create such a strategy is under way, and the effort may include  revising or consolidating existing guidance in addition to developing a  new national biodefense strategy.", "As the departments fulfill their obligations under the NDAA for 2017, key  federal organizations have the opportunity to institutionalize mechanisms  to help the nation make the best use of limited biodefense resources, to  include broader shared threat awareness to inform opportunities to  leverage resources. However, until the strategy is developed, we will not  know the extent it will address shared threat awareness, if at all. The  NDAA for 2017 requires the strategy to be submitted to Congress not  later than 275 days after enactment (September 2017) and requires us to  review it 180 days after the date of submittal.

The officials said they aim to enhance the value of BTRA conclusions by  increasing the accuracy and completeness of the data used as modeling  inputs through the work of NBACC.

BTCP program  officials reported that although research priorities generally target Tier 1  Select Agents, they also seek to advance research projects that broadly  encompass (1) a variety of biological threat agents (e.g., bacteria,  viruses, and toxins); (2) agents representing different characteristics that  affect threat (e.g., means of acquisition or production, dissemination and  exposure attributes, and expected medical consequences), and (3) a  selection of traditional, emerging, enhanced, and advanced biological  threat agents.", "In addition to the identification of BTRA-related knowledge gaps, BTCP  officials stated that emerging events and specific stakeholder needs could  also influence research priorities. For example, during the 2014 Ebola  outbreak, BTCP officials directed NBACC to perform research to better  understand the risk factors associated with disease transmission, such as  the persistence of the virus on various surfaces, and the efficacy of  common disinfectants to inform decontamination and public health  response efforts.

Although the plan documents the DHS knowledge gaps that serve  as a key driver for developing specific project proposals, in some cases  these gaps are identified only as general areas of research, such as the  virulence of specified threat agents, which could require a broad scope of  research to address. As the plan notes, these priority knowledge gaps  exceed the resources available for threat characterization each year. For  this reason, NBACC uses a combination of additional criteria to further  refine research priorities and select projects for inclusion in the new  scope of work, such as consideration of the time and resources required  and which knowledge gaps are most likely to provide clear and  compelling answers through experimentation. Other factors that may  influence final project selection include addressing the knowledge gaps  that could be completed reasonably comprehensively in 3 to 4 years or  may have potential to provide a framework to better understand other  priority agents or emerging threats, such as the Ebola virus or other  infectious diseases (see fig. 9).

HHS\u2019s medical and  public health consequence modeling reports use the exposure information  from DHS\u2019s material threat assessments (MTA) to calculate the number of  individuals who may become ill, be hospitalized, or die based on the MTA  scenario with and without medical countermeasures. HHS reported using the  modeling reports as part of an assessment process to establish requirements  for medical countermeasures that need to be developed and acquired to  respond to a biological incident. aimed at reducing large public health consequences of attacks on the food  supply. FDA assesses public health and economic impact of an attack, the  accessibility of a target and ease of an attack, the ability to recover, the loss  of production due to an attack, and target selection. FDA also said it  considers the health, economic, and psychological impacts of an attack on  the food industry.", "Scientific Research. Studies include thermal stability of microbial agents  and ability to inactivate biological agents in the food supply, and studies of  pathogenic properties of viruses to help understand the epidemiology,  transmission, evolution and origin of an outbreak. which is a system of environmental monitoring intended to provide  early warning and detection of a biological attack. DHS also houses  and supports the National Biosurveillance Integration Center\u2014a  collaboration of 14 federal partners intended to integrate information  about threats to human, animal, plant, and environmental health from  thousands of sources to develop a more comprehensive picture of the  threat landscape.", "Research and Analysis. DHS operates the National Biodefense  Analysis and Countermeasures Center, which conducts scientific  research and develops reports and products intended to address  identified knowledge gaps associated with current and future  biological threats, including the effectiveness of potential  countermeasures and the characterization of key attributes of  biological attacks by an adversary such as agent acquisition; agent  production; dissemination methods; and virulence.
