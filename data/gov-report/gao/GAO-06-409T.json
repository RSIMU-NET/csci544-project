Using these incentives properly--in concert with good acquisition practices--is a key to minimizing waste, maximizing value, and getting our military personnel what they need, when and where they need it. Congress asked GAO to testify on DOD's use of award and incentive fees and the role they play in the acquisition system. This statement highlights the risks of conducting business as usual and identifies the actions DOD needs to take to use these fees more effectively.

Contract management has been a long-standing business management challenge for DOD because it often cannot assure that it is using sound business practices to acquire the goods and services the warfighter needs. For weapon system acquisitions, the persistent and long-standing nature of acquisition problems has perhaps made a range of key decision makers complacent about cost growth, schedule delays, quantity reductions, and performance shortfalls. DOD's strategies for incentivizing its contractors, especially for weapon system development programs, reflect the challenges in these areas. DOD programs routinely engage in award-fee practices that do not hold contractors accountable for achieving desired outcomes and undermine efforts to motivate contractor performance, such as evaluating contractors on award-fee criteria that are not directly related to key acquisition outcomes (e.g., meeting cost and schedule goals and delivering desired capabilities to the warfighter); paying contractors a significant portion of the available fee for what award-fee plans describe as \"acceptable, average, expected, good, or satisfactory\" performance; and giving contractors at least a second opportunity to earn initially unearned or deferred fees. As a result, DOD has paid out an estimated $8 billion in award fees on contracts in GAO's study population, regardless of whether acquisition outcomes fell short of, met, or exceeded DOD's expectations. Despite paying billions of dollars, DOD has not compiled data or developed performance measures to evaluate the validity of its belief that award and incentive fees improve contractor performance and acquisition outcomes. These issues, along with those GAO has identified in DOD's acquisition and business management processes, present a compelling case for change. By implementing the recommendations GAO has made on award and incentive fees, DOD can improve incentives, increase transparency, and enhance accountability for the fees it pays. At the same time, by working more broadly to improve its acquisition practices, DOD can set the right conditions for getting better acquisition outcomes and making more efficient use of its resources in what is sure to be a more fiscally constrained environment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) use of monetary incentives known as award and incentive fees.  With DOD spending over $200 billion annually to acquire products and  services that include everything from spare parts to the development of  major weapon systems, our numerous, large, and mounting fiscal  challenges demand that DOD maximize its return on investment and  provide the warfighter with needed capabilities at the best value for the  taxpayer. In an effort to encourage defense contractors to perform in an  innovative, efficient, and effective way, DOD gives its contractors the  opportunity to collectively earn billions of dollars through monetary  incentives known as award and incentive fees. Using these incentives  properly, in concert with sound acquisition practices, is a key to  minimizing waste, maximizing value, and getting our military personnel  what they need, when and where they need it. Unfortunately, DOD has not  used these incentives effectively. How they have been used and how we  believe they should be used is the focus of my statement today.", "To put the issues related to DOD\u2019s use of award and incentive fees in  context, I want to step back and look at some of the broader management  challenges that confront DOD. The department is facing a significant  number of recurring problems in managing its major weapon acquisitions.  Although U.S. weapons are the best in the world, DOD\u2019s acquisition  process for weapons programs consistently yields undesirable  consequences\u2014dramatic cost increases, late deliveries to the warfighter,  and performance shortfalls. These problems occur, in part, because DOD  tends to consistently overpromise and underdeliver in connection with  major acquisition efforts. In addition, DOD\u2019s weapons programs do not  capture, early on, the requisite knowledge that is needed to efficiently and  effectively manage program risks. For example, programs lack clearly  defined and stable requirements, move forward with unrealistic program  cost and schedule estimates, use immature technologies in launching  product development, and fail to solidify design and manufacturing  processes at appropriate junctures in development. As a result, wants are  not always distinguished from needs; expectation gaps are the norm;  problems often surface late in the development process; and fixes tend to  be much more costly than if they were caught earlier.", "Cost increases incurred while developing new weapon systems typically  mean that DOD cannot produce as many of those weapons as intended nor  can it be relied on to deliver them to the warfighter when promised and  with the initially advertised capabilities. In addition, military operations in  Afghanistan and Iraq are consuming a large share of DOD resources and  causing the department to invest more money sooner than expected to  replace or fix existing weapons. Meanwhile, DOD is intent on transforming  military operations and currently has its eye on multiple megasystems that  are expected to be the most expensive and complex ever. These new  desires and long-standing acquisition and contract management challenges  are running head-on into the nation\u2019s current imprudent and unsustainable  fiscal path. At the same time, DOD\u2019s numerous business management  weaknesses continue to result in reduced efficiencies and effectiveness  that waste billions of dollars every year. These business management  weaknesses touch on all of DOD\u2019s major business operations, ranging  from the department\u2019s inadequate management of its overall business  transformation effort to decades-old financial management and  information technology problems to various contracting and selected  supply chain challenges. In fact, all these areas and more are on GAO\u2019s  2005 \u201chigh-risk\u201d list of programs and activities that need urgent attention  and fundamental transformation to ensure that our national government  functions in the most economical, efficient, and effective manner possible.", "DOD\u2019s use of award and incentive fees is an issue at the nexus of two of  these high-risk areas\u2014DOD contract management and DOD weapon  system acquisition. Contract management has been a long-standing  business management challenge for the department. DOD is the  government\u2019s largest purchaser, yet it is often unable to assure that it is  using sound business practices to acquire the goods and services needed  to meet the warfighter\u2019s needs. For example, we have found that DOD has  not used various contracting tools and techniques effectively\u2014such as  performance-based service contracting, multiple-award task order  contracts, purchase cards, and, most recently, award and incentive fees.  For DOD weapon system acquisitions, we have found the persistent and  long-standing nature of acquisition problems has perhaps made a range of  key players both in the Pentagon and the Congress complacent about cost  growth, schedule delays, quantity reductions, and performance shortfalls  in weapon system programs. DOD\u2019s strategies for incentivizing its  contractors, especially on weapon system development programs, reflect  this complacency and are symptomatic of the lack of discipline, oversight,  transparency, and accountability in DOD\u2019s acquisition process. As a result,  DOD programs routinely engage in practices that undermine efforts to  motivate positive contractor performance and that do not hold contractors  accountable for achieving desired acquisition outcomes, such as meeting  cost and schedule goals and delivering desired capabilities to the  warfighter.", "DOD generally does not evaluate contractors based on award-fee  criteria that are directly related to key acquisition outcomes. In  addition, the link between the elements of contractor performance that  are included in the criteria and these outcomes is not always clear. As a  result, DOD paid out an estimated $8 billion in award fees over the life  of the contracts in our study population (from their inception through  our data collection phase), regardless of whether acquisition outcomes  fell short of, met, or exceeded DOD\u2019s expectations.", "DOD programs engage in practices that undermine efforts to motivate  excellent contractor performance by regularly paying contractors a  significant portion of the available fee for what award-fee plans  describe as \u201cacceptable, average, expected, good, or satisfactory\u201d  performance. Although the definition of this level of performance  varies by contract, these definitions are generally not related to  outcomes. About half of the contracts in our sample, allowed  70 percent or more of the available fee to be paid for this level of  performance.", "DOD award fee practices do not promote accountability. DOD  programs gave contractors on about half of the award-fee contracts in  our study population at least a second opportunity to earn an estimated  $669 million in initially unearned or deferred fees.", "Taken together, DOD\u2019s acquisition, business, and contract management  practices are contrary to the purpose of performance-based contracting  concepts and have resulted and, if not corrected in both form and practice,  will continue to result in wasting billions of dollars in taxpayer funds. My  statement today will focus on what steps DOD must take to strengthen the  link between monetary incentives and acquisition outcomes and by  extension increase the transparency and accountability of DOD programs  for fees paid and of contractors for results achieved. This testimony draws  upon our recently issued report on DOD\u2019s use of award and incentive fees  as well as the GAO High-Risk series and our body of work on weapon  system acquisitions.", "GAO\u2019s many acquisition-related reports over the years raise serious  questions about the reasonableness, appropriateness, and affordability of  DOD\u2019s current investment plans; the soundness of the acquisition process  which implements those plans; and the effectiveness of the practices DOD  uses to manage its contractors, including the use of award and incentive  fees. These reports collectively present a compelling case for change.", "Appendix I contains information about the scope and methodology for  GAO-06-66, Defense Acquisitions: DOD Has Paid Billions in Award and  Incentive Fees Regardless of Acquisition Outcomes.

One of the characteristics that vary  across contract types is the amount and nature of the fee that agencies  offer to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified objectives or  goals. Of all the contract types available, only award- and incentive-fee  contracts allow an agency to adjust the amount of fee paid to contractors  based on the contractor\u2019s performance.", "Federal acquisition regulations state that award- and incentive-fee  contracts should be used to achieve specific acquisition objectives, such  as delivering products and services on time or within cost goals and with  the promised capabilities. For award-fee contracts, the assumption  underlying the regulation is that the likelihood of meeting these  acquisition objectives will be enhanced by using a contract that effectively  motivates the contractor toward exceptional performance. Typically,  award-fee contracts emphasize multiple aspects of contractor  performance in a wide variety of areas, such as quality, timeliness,  technical ingenuity, and cost-effective management. These areas are  susceptible to judgmental and qualitative measurement and evaluation,  and as a result, award-fee criteria and evaluations tend to be subjective.  Table 1 provides a description of the general process for evaluating the  contractor and determining the amount of award fee earned."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prevalence and Use of Award and Incentive Fees", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2003, award- and incentive-fee  contract actions accounted for 4.6 percent of all DOD contract actions  over $25,000.

Our sample of 93 contracts includes $51.6 billion, or  almost one-third, of those obligated award- and incentive-fee contract  dollars. These obligations include award- and incentive-fee payments as  well as other contract costs.", "DOD utilized the contracts in our sample for a number of purposes. For  example, research and development contracts accounted for 51 percent  (or $26.4 billion) of the dollars obligated against contracts in our sample  from fiscal years 1999 through 2003; while non-research-and-development  services accounted for the highest number of contracts in our sample.  Further, we estimate that most of the contracts and most of the dollars in  our study population are related to the acquisition of weapon systems.", "DOD has the flexibility to mix and match characteristics from different  contract types. The risks for both DOD and the contractor vary depending  on the exact combination chosen, which, according to the Federal  Acquisition Regulation, should reflect the uncertainties involved in  contract performance. Based on the results from our sample, about half of  the contracts in our study population were cost-plus-award-fee contracts.  The theory behind these contracts is that although the government  assumes most of the cost risk, it retains control over most or all of the  contractor\u2019s potential fee as leverage. On cost-plus-award-fee contracts,  the award fee is often the only source of potential fee for the contractor.  According to defense acquisition regulations, these contracts can include a  base fee\u2014a fixed fee for performance paid to the contractor\u2014of anywhere  from 0 to 3 percent of the value of the contract; however, based on our  sample results, we estimate that about 60 percent of the cost-plus-award- fee contracts in our study population included zero base fee. There is no  limit on the maximum percentage of the value of the contract that can be  made available in award fee, although the 20 percent included in the  Space-Based Infrared Radar System High development contract we  examined was outside the norm.

DOD\u2019s historical practice of  routinely paying its contractors nearly all of the available award fee  creates an environment in which programs pay and contractors expect to  receive most of the available fee, regardless of acquisition outcomes. This  is occurring at a time when DOD is giving contractors increased program  management responsibilities to develop requirements, design products,  and select major system and subsystem contractors. Based on our sample,  we estimate that for DOD award-fee contracts, the median percentage of  available award fee paid to date (adjusted for rollover) was 90 percent,  representing an estimated $8 billion in award fees for contracts active  between fiscal years 1999 and 2003. Estimates of total award fees earned  are based on all evaluation periods held from the inception of our sample  contracts through our data collection phase, not just those from fiscal  years 1999 through 2003. Figure 2 shows the percentage of available fee  earned for the 63 award-fee contracts in our sample.", "The pattern of consistently high award-fee payouts is also present in  DOD\u2019s fee decisions from evaluation period to evaluation period. This  pattern is evidence of reluctance among DOD programs to deny  contractors significant amounts of fee, even in the short term. We estimate  that the median percentage of award fee earned for each evaluation period  was 93 percent and that the contractor received 70 percent or less of the  available fee in only 9 percent of the evaluation periods and none of the  available fee in only 1 percent of the evaluation periods."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Case for Change: Moving Toward Outcome-Based Award-Fee Criteria", "paragraphs": ["March 29, 2006, emphasizing the need  to link award fees to desired program  outcomes.", "Award fees have generally not been effective at helping DOD achieve its  desired acquisition outcomes, in large part, because award-fee criteria are  not linked to desired acquisition outcomes, such as meeting cost and  schedule goals and delivering desired capabilities. Instead, DOD programs  structure award fees to focus on the broad aspects of contractor  performance, such as technical and management performance and cost  control, that they view as keys to a successful program. In addition,  elements of the award-fee process, such as the frequency of evaluations  and the composition of award-fee boards, may also limit DOD\u2019s ability to  effectively and impartially evaluate the contractor\u2019s progress toward  acquisition outcomes. Most award-fee evaluations are time-based,  generally every six months, rather than event-based; and award-fee boards  are made up primarily of individuals directly connected to the program. As  a result of all these factors, DOD programs frequently paid most of the  available award fee for what they described as improved contractor  performance, regardless of whether acquisition outcomes fell short of,  met, or exceeded DOD\u2019s expectations.", "High award-fee payouts on programs that have fallen or are falling well  short of meeting their stated goals are also indicative of DOD\u2019s failure to  implement award fees in a way that promotes positive performance and  adequate accountability. Several major development programs\u2014 accounting for 52 percent of the available award-fee dollars in our sample  and 46 percent of the award-fee dollars paid to date\u2014are not achieving or  have not achieved their desired acquisition outcomes, yet contractors  received most of the available award fee. These programs\u2014the Comanche  helicopter, F/A-22 and Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, and the Space-Based  Infrared System High satellite system\u2014have experienced significant cost  increases, technical problems, and development delays, but the prime  systems contractors have received 85, 91, 100, and 74 percent of the award  fee, respectively to date (adjusted for rollover), totaling $1.7 billion (see  table 2).", "DOD can ensure that fee payments are more representative of program  results by developing fee criteria that focus on its desired acquisition  outcomes.

On this program, DOD revised the award-fee plan in June 2002 as  part of a program and contract restructuring. The award-fee plan was  changed to focus on achieving a successful system demonstration by  December 2004. Prior to the restructuring, the contractor had received 95  percent of the available award fee, even though the program had  experienced a series of cost increases and schedule delays.

Two practices, in  particular, paying significant amounts of fee for \u201cacceptable, average,  expected, good, or satisfactory\u201d performance and providing contractors  multiple opportunities to earn fees that were not earned when first made  available, undermine the effectiveness of fees as a motivational tool and  marginalize their use in holding contractors accountable for acquisition  outcomes.", "Although DOD guidance and federal acquisition regulations state that  award fees should be used to motivate excellent contractor performance,  most DOD award-fee contracts pay a significant portion of the available  fee for what award-fee plans describe as \u201cacceptable, average, expected,  good, or satisfactory\u201d performance. Although the definition of this level of  performance varies by contract, these definitions are generally not related  to outcomes. Some plans for contracts in our sample did not even require  the contractor to meet all of the minimum standards or requirements of  the contract to receive one of these ratings. Some plans also allowed for  fee to be paid for marginal performance. Even fixed-price-award-fee  contracts, which already include a normal level of profit in the price, paid  out award fees for satisfactory performance.

Rollover is the process of moving unearned available award fee from one  evaluation period to a subsequent evaluation period, thereby providing the  contractor an additional opportunity to earn that previously unearned  award-fee. We estimate that 52 percent of DOD award-fee contracts rolled  over unearned fees into subsequent evaluation periods, and in  52 percent of these periods, at least 99 percent of the unearned fee was  rolled over.

The DOD requirements, acquisition, budgeting, and  investment processes are broken and need to be fixed. DOD\u2019s  requirements process generates much more demand for new programs  than fiscal resources can reasonably support. The acquisition environment  encourages launching product developments that promise the best  capability, but embody too many technical unknowns and too little  knowledge about the performance and production risks they entail.  However, a new program will not be approved unless its costs fall within  forecasts of available funds and, therefore, looks affordable. Further,  because programs are funded annually and departmentwide,  cross-portfolio priorities have not been established, competition for  funding continues over time, forcing programs to view success as the  ability to secure the next funding increment rather than delivering  capabilities when expected and as promised.", "The business cases to support weapon system programs that result from  these processes are in many cases not executable because the incentives  inherent in the current defense acquisition system are not conducive to  establishing realistic cost, schedule, and technical goals. As a result, DOD  has to date not been willing to hold its programs or its contractors  accountable for achieving its specified acquisition outcomes. Instead,  faced with a lack of knowledge and the lack of a sound business case,  DOD programs use award-fee contracts, which by their very nature allow  DOD to evaluate its contractors on a subjective basis. This results in  billions of dollars in wasteful payments because these evaluations are  based on contractors\u2019 ability to guide programs through a broken  acquisition system, not on achieving desired acquisition outcomes.", "Implementing our recommendations on award and incentive fees will not  fix the broader problems DOD faces with its management of major  weapons or service acquisitions. However, by implementing our  recommendations, DOD can improve incentives, increase transparency,  and enhance accountability for the fees it pays. In particular, moving  toward more outcome-based award-fee criteria would give contractors an  increased stake in helping DOD to develop more realistic targets upfront  or risk receiving less fee when unrealistic cost, schedule, and performance  targets are not met. To make this new approach to incentives function as  intended, DOD would also need to address the more fundamental issues  related to its management approach, such as the lack of a sound business  case, lack of well-defined requirements, lack of product knowledge at key  junctions in development, and program instability caused by changing  requirements and across-the-board budget cuts. Working in concert, these  steps can help DOD set the right conditions for more successful  acquisition outcomes and make more efficient use of its resources in what  is sure to be a more fiscally constrained environment as the nation  approaches the retirement of the \u201cbaby boom\u201d generation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent DOD Actions", "paragraphs": ["Last week, DOD issued a policy memorandum on award-fee contracts that  takes steps towards addressing several of the recommendations made in  our report, and the department has indicated that further actions are  planned to address the remaining recommendations.
