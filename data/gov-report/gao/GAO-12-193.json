IRS charges user fees for various activities that include assisting taxpayers in complying with their tax liabilities, clarifying the application of the tax code to particular circumstances, and ensuring the quality of paid preparers of tax returns, among others. In fiscal year 2010, two fees accounted for more than 80 percent of total retained user fee collections: (1) Installment agreements (IA): Provides taxpayers who cannot pay their full tax liability the option to pay their full tax liability with smaller monthly payments over a period of time for up to 60 months. This service is offered to most taxpayers for $105 with lower rates for low-income taxpayers and those who opt for a direct debit agreement. This service generated $198 million, or 68 percent of IRS's total retained user fee collections. (2) Income verification express services (IVES): Provides 2-business-day processing and electronic delivery of tax return transcripts for users, such as mortgage lenders and other financial market entities, to confirm the income of a borrower (taxpayer) during the processing of a loan application. IRS charged a fee of $2.25 for each IVES transcript request. This service generated $40 million, or 14 percent of total retained fee collections. IRS conducts a review of its user fees biennially (or every 2 years) and has taken steps to improve its estimates of the cost of providing its user fee services, with particular attention to its largest fee. For example, IRS hired a contractor to evaluate, update, and simplify the IA user fee cost estimate. However, for a few of IRS's smaller fee programs, GAO found that IRS omitted fees from its biennial review, did not clearly document assumptions to be used in some cost estimates, and lacked documentation of factors considered in setting some fees. For example, one user fee has not been reviewed or updated since fiscal year 1996, while program managers for another user fee were uncertain about salary assumptions. GAO also found that while officials stated that they consider factors other than cost (such as potential effects on taxpayer compliance and administrative burden) in setting fee rates, they did not thoroughly document these factors or corroborate anecdotal support with analysis. Finally, GAO found that IRS did not fully document final decisions made on fee rates as a result of its biennial review. IRS has implemented several new user fees in recent years, but it may not be taking full advantage of its process for identifying new user fees. As directed by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25, IRS's CFO requests that each division review its programs and provide proposals for new user fees on a biennial basis. However, officials in some divisions or offices said that they had no formal solicitation process for employees to suggest new user fee proposals.

We primarily focused on user  fees that were included in IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2009 biennial review. We  also obtained information about IRS\u2019s internal controls for the revenue  and volume data we used and determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. Specifically, we relied on our audit  of the aggregated year-end user fee balances and transaction testing for  the installment agreement user fee revenue amount, which accounts for  the majority of user fee collections and found that the revenue data were  sufficiently reliable for our descriptive purposes. Further, we performed a  separate analysis to assess the reliability of the user fee volume data by  (1) conducting a correlation analysis between the revenue and volume  data and (2) using the revenue amount and fee rate to calculate the  volume. Based on our analyses, we determined that the volume data  were sufficiently reliable for our descriptive purposes.", "In addition, we interviewed officials from IRS\u2019s Office of the Chief  Financial Officer, Office of the Chief Counsel, Large Business and  International Division, Office of Professional Responsibility, Return  Preparer Office, Small Business and Self-Employed Division, Tax Exempt  and Government Entities Division, and Wage and Investment Division,  who were responsible for overseeing the user fee programs, and the  Taxpayer Advocate Service.

Finally, we reviewed prior GAO work on user fees and cost estimation  and other relevant literature.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2011 through  November 2011 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
