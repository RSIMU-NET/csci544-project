CMS generally uses regular program integrity activities\u2014such as claims reviews\u2014to oversee Medicare NEMT. Under Medicaid, CMS also uses regular oversight activities, and these include overseeing states' program integrity activities and periodically issuing guidance. However, some of CMS's guidance is outdated or may be of limited use because of legislative and other changes that affect Medicaid and states' NEMT programs. For example, a 1998 guidebook on NEMT contains outdated information on implementing NEMT transportation broker programs. Other more recent guidance is targeted for patients and providers rather than state Medicaid programs. However, these programs also benefit from updated guidance on strategies to ensure compliance with federal requirements while incorporating current practices to meet beneficiaries' needs. Guidance for state Medicaid programs is particularly important because NEMT is at high risk for fraud and abuse; some selected states and stakeholders GAO interviewed reported that updated guidance could be helpful.

Challenges reported related to containing costs, maintaining program integrity, contracting with and overseeing vendors, and accessing NEMT. For example, states reported challenges containing NEMT costs due to increased NEMT utilization and reported implementing practices to help address these challenges. Such practices include setting fixed provider reimbursement fees that remained relatively constant in recent years.

We also  reviewed key reports, such as Medicare Payment Advisory Commission,  Department of Health and Human Services-Office of Inspector General  (HHS-OIG), and Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) reports,  and prior GAO reports. Additionally, we conducted searches in  bibliographic databases\u2014including Medline, National Technical  Information Service, WorldCat PAIS International, and Social Services  Abstracts\u2014to identify additional literature on NEMT under Medicare and  Medicaid. We screened search results and identified studies for relevance  to our research objectives and selected those that focused on delivery of  NEMT services under Medicaid and Medicare. We interviewed CMS and  HHS-OIG officials, as well as two patient advocates and a transportation  industry group involved in coordinating transportation. In addition, for  Medicaid, we interviewed officials from 15 selected state Medicaid  agencies. We selected a non-probability sample of states based on a mix  of considerations, including Medicaid enrollment and spending, the  approaches states use to deliver NEMT, geographic distribution, and  whether or not states have expanded Medicaid under the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The selected states were:  Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Georgia,  Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio,  Tennessee, Washington, and Wyoming. We also reviewed documents  from states, such as contracts with health plans and organizations  providing NEMT, and utilization and spending data.", "To determine the challenges that exist in providing NEMT and steps that  state Medicaid agencies are taking, we screened and identified studies  from the sources identified above, and selected and reviewed studies that  focused on challenges in providing NEMT under Medicaid, as well as  HHS-OIG and state auditor reports. We also interviewed CMS and HHS- OIG officials, two patient advocates, and a transportation industry group  that are involved in coordinating transportation, two healthcare industry  associations that are knowledgeable about providing NEMT under  Medicaid, including Medicaid managed care, and officials from the 15  selected state Medicaid agencies. In order to obtain more in-depth  information about challenges, we visited two states\u2014Louisiana and  Colorado\u2014to interview officials involved in providing NEMT. We selected  these two states because they use more than one model to provide  NEMT, including using at least one broker, and have both rural and urban  populations. In Louisiana, we interviewed officials from two health plans  that had contracts with the state for more than 1 year and serve more  than 50 percent of the Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care,  as well as the two transportation brokers that provide NEMT. In  Colorado, we interviewed the transportation broker Colorado uses for the  Denver metropolitan area, a health care plan that serves Medicaid  beneficiaries in Colorado and officials in two counties outside of the  Denver metropolitan area that are responsible for providing NEMT to their  residents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, other key contributors to this  report were Heather MacLeod, Assistant Director; Kristin Ekelund, Lynn  Filla-Clark, Julie Flowers, Jacquelyn Hamilton, Bonnie Pignatiello Leer,  Amy Rosewarne, and Betsey Ward-Jenks."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
