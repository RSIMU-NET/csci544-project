GAO was asked to provide information on the (1) challenges students with disabilities may face accessing federally funded transition services; and (2) extent to which federal agencies coordinate their transition activities. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency documents from Education, HHS, Labor, and SSA, which administer the key programs that provide transition services.

Eligible students with disabilities are entitled to transition planning services during high school, but after leaving high school, to receive services that facilitate their transition they must apply as adults and establish eligibility for programs administered by multiple federal agencies. Students with disabilities may face delays in service and end up on waitlists if these programs are full. In addition, while all five states GAO contacted have taken steps to coordinate their transition services and assist families with the transition process, officials said that it is still difficult for students and their parents to navigate and for providers to coordinate services across different programs. Officials and parents GAO spoke with also noted a lack of sufficient information or awareness of the full range of service options available after high school on the part of students with disabilities, parents, and service providers. In addition, state and local officials said students with disabilities may not be adequately prepared to successfully transition to life after high school. This may be due, in part, to limited opportunities to engage in vocational and life skills training or obtain work experience while in school.", "The Departments of Education (Education), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Labor (Labor), and the Social Security Administration (SSA) coordinate transition activities to some degree, but their coordination has limitations and they do not assess the effectiveness of their efforts. One coordinating body involves all four agencies and focuses on transition services. However, that group's primary coordination activity is information sharing among staff-level representatives rather than developing common outcome goals and establishing compatible policies for operating across agencies. Agency officials told GAO that a lack of compatible outcome goals for transitioning students and differences in statutory eligibility criteria are among the barriers that hinder interagency coordination for this population. While agencies collaborate to some extent, their efforts represent a patchwork approach and there is no single, formal, government-wide strategy for coordinating transition services for students with disabilities. Moreover, it is unclear what impact coordination has on service provision because agencies do not assess the effectiveness of their coordination activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve the provision of transition services for students with disabilities, GAO recommends that Education, HHS, Labor, and SSA develop an interagency transition strategy that addresses (1) operating toward common outcome goals for transitioning youth; (2) increasing awareness of available transition services; and (3) assessing the effectiveness of their coordination efforts.

This can be a daunting process, and research has  documented that students with disabilities are less likely than their peers  to successfully make the transition. For example, as of February 2012,  the employment rate for young adults ages 20 to 24 with disabilities was  less than half the rate of their peers without disabilities. When young  adults with disabilities do not successfully transition out of high school,  they may face a lifetime of continued reliance on public assistance,  potentially leading to substantial costs to the government and society.  Although the total amount of federal money spent to support students with  disabilities in transitioning out of high school is not known, the federal  investment in educating students with disabilities is substantial. In 2011,  the Department of Education (Education) awarded about $11.5 billion in  federal grants to states to help ensure that 6.6 million students with  disabilities\u2014approximately 2.2 million of whom were of transition-age\u2014 received a free appropriate public education, as required by the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a key piece of  legislation pertaining to transition.

Once students exit high  school, they are no longer entitled to federal transition services under  IDEA.  Instead, they may apply and be found eligible for a number of  other separately administered federal programs that are authorized to  provide services that can assist youth with disabilities in their transition to  postsecondary education, employment, and independent living. GAO has  reported on the need for better coordination among federal disability  programs, including those serving students with disabilities. This is one  reason that, as of 2011, federal disability programs remained on GAO\u2019s  high risk list.of transition services for students with disabilities, you requested we  provide information on: (1) challenges students with disabilities may face   In light of questions about the accessibility and coordination  accessing transition services under existing federal programs; and (2) the  extent to which federal agencies coordinate their transition activities.", "To identify potential challenges, we reviewed the definitions of disability  and the eligibility criteria in selected federal statutes governing federal  programs that provide transition services.  To assess the extent to which  federal agencies coordinate their transition activities, we asked officials  from the four agencies that administer key programs serving students in  their transition out of high school\u2014Education, the Departments of Health  and Human Services (HHS) and Labor (Labor), and the Social Security  Administration (SSA)\u2014to provide information on their coordination efforts  and activities relating to transition services. We compared their responses  and agency documents to our criteria on activities that can enhance and  sustain collaboration among federal agencies. In addition, we consulted  a number of experts in the field of transition and from advocacy  organizations that represent young adults with a wide range of disability  types. Finally, to obtain the perspectives of state and local agencies that  deliver transition services, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of five  states and contacted officials to obtain their views. We selected these  states based on the number of federal grants they received in fiscal year  (FY) 2011 to fund transition services, recommendations of agency  officials and experts, and geographic diversity. Through a combination of  site visits and telephone interviews, we spoke with service providers and  officials from state education, vocational rehabilitation, developmental  disability, and workforce agencies. In each state we visited, we also met  with groups of students with disabilities and parents to discuss the  challenges they face.

Such services and supports are formulated in an IEP, which is   In the  developed, discussed, and documented by a student\u2019s IEP team.2004 reauthorization of IDEA, Congress required that, beginning no later  than age 16, a student\u2019s IEP must include measurable postsecondary  goals related to training, education, employment, and where appropriate,  independent living skills. The IEP also must specify the transition   services needed to assist the student in reaching those goals. School  officials are required to invite the student to a meeting where the  transition services detailed in the IEP are discussed.

They may also demonstrate varying levels of  academic aptitude and achievement in different areas. Thus, the number  of programs for which each student may be eligible can vary widely based  on their abilities, postsecondary goals, and the types of supportive  services they may need to be successful. We identified a range of  programs that provide services to support students with disabilities in their  transition out of high school. These programs vary in the target population  served, services provided, grant funding amounts, and other  characteristics. In addition, they are authorized by multiple federal laws  (administered through various federal agencies), each with its own  eligibility requirements and application processes. (See fig. 1). Moreover,  federally funded programs that provide transition services, as defined in  this report, are often delivered through state and local entities that have  flexibility on how to administer services.", "The following four agencies have primary responsibility for administering  federal programs that can provide services to transition-age youth with  disabilities:", "Education\u2019s Rehabilitation Services Administration awards funds to  state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies in the form of matching  grants to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and engage in  gainful employment.

Furthermore, if the student is receiving special  education services, this plan must be coordinated with the student\u2019s  IEP in terms of goals, objectives, and services.", "Labor oversees the one-stop center system, a comprehensive  workforce investment system created under the Workforce Investment  Act of 1998 (WIA) that brings together multiple federally funded  employment and training programs that can help all eligible individuals  seeking employment and training\u2014including students with  disabilities. Labor also administers the Disability Employment  Initiative, which is designed to improve educational, training, and  employment opportunities and outcomes for youth and adults with  disabilities who are unemployed, underemployed, and/or receiving  Social Security disability benefits.", "SSA provides cash benefits to qualifying individuals with disabilities\u2014 including transition-age young adults\u2014through its Disability Insurance  and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs. SSA also  administers the Ticket to Work program, which is designed to enable  individuals with disabilities (who are receiving disability insurance or  SSI benefits and are between the ages of 18 and 64) to obtain  services needed to find, enter, and retain employment.

Because Medicaid usually does  not cover home and community-based services, states must obtain a  waiver to provide these services. Services provided in accordance  with these waivers vary by state, are individualized, and may include,  for example, case management, personal care attendants, or day or  residential habilitation.", "In addition, these and other federal agencies fund a number of other  programs through grants to states, localities, and nongovernmental  organizations that may assist students and young adults during their  transition from high school. Some of these grants explicitly target  improving postsecondary outcomes for students with disabilities and  others provide a range of support services such as assistive technology,  information and referral, advocacy, transportation, leadership  development, benefits counseling, and independent living services.

These include  difficulty navigating multiple programs that are not always coordinated;  possible delays in service as they wait to be served by adult programs;  limited access to transition services; a lack of adequate information or  awareness on the part of parents, students, and service providers of  available programs that may provide transition services after high school;  and a lack of preparedness for postsecondary education or employment.  Prior GAO work identified many of these same challenges, which is  indicative of the longstanding and persistent nature of the challenges facing students with disabilities as they transition out of high school.", "In each of the five states we contacted, state officials said it can be  difficult for students with disabilities and their families to navigate the  multiple federal programs that provide transition services. Some officials  said that the shift from being automatically entitled to services under IDEA  if identified as disabled while in high school to having to apply as adults  and be found eligible for multiple programs after exiting high school is  difficult for students and their parents to understand. (See fig. 2).", "Many of the stakeholders told us that a lack of coordination between  programs was another key challenge for students with disabilities and/or  their families. For example, staff from a parent training and information  Center in Minnesota said that it is very challenging for parents to navigate  the system and coordinate resources for their children across programs.  In their experience, none of the program officials coordinate with those  from other programs to share information on clients. State officials  suggested that a lack of coordination between programs often arises as  early as during IEP transition planning meetings. IDEA requires high  schools to invite, with parental or student consent, representatives from  adult programs likely to be responsible for providing or paying for  transition services to the student after high school, such as VR, to these  meetings to the extent appropriate.not required to attend, and we heard that they are often not at the table  for transition planning meetings. VR officials from one state  acknowledged this, saying that while they try to attend transition planning  meetings, it is not always possible because of resource and time  constraints. Some of the stakeholders suggested that without the  commitment of local leaders and service providers to coordinate services  between high school and adult programs, there is little to no  communication between programs, which can create difficulty for families  trying to navigate across different programs.", "These representatives, however, are  In each of the five states we contacted, some officials said that differing  requirements for adult programs can confuse students and parents. For  example, officials from Florida\u2019s department of VR said that the  requirement for VR clients to have an individualized plan for employment  that identifies an employment goal and the services and supports  necessary to achieve that goal can be confusing for youth who already  included transition plans and identified a career goal in their IEP. In  addition, the amount of documentation each program requires can be  overwhelming for students with disabilities and their parents. According to  a student in Maryland, there is a continuous administrative burden on  applicants to provide the same or similar information to multiple  programs. Officials we interviewed from three of the four federal agencies  acknowledged these challenges.", "In each of the states we contacted, officials suggested that it would be  helpful to appoint a case manager to coordinate services and guide  students and their families through the transition process. Some of the  parents and also officials from two of the four federal agencies agreed  that a case manager could help students with disabilities and their  families navigate across the multiple programs. However, officials from  one federal agency cautioned that it could be costly and, given that  programs that provide transition services are administered by different  federal agencies and implemented at the state and local level,  challenging to administer.", "Students with disabilities may also face delays in service upon leaving  high school as they wait to obtain services from adult programs or for  their eligibility determinations to be finalized. Many stakeholders said that  delays in service can be caused by limited financial or program  resources, which may leave youth with disabilities on waitlists for  services. In particular, states may have waitlists\u2014sometimes with several  thousand individuals\u2014for home and community-based waiver services.  The departments of VR in four of the five states we contacted were  operating under a federally required order of selection, requiring them to  serve individuals with the most significant disabilities before serving  others. Several parents from Minnesota said that their children had  been on waitlists for waiver services or VR services for years. One parent  from Florida said that her adult son was living at home with no services or  employment options as he waited for waiver services from the state\u2019s  department of disability. Officials from Nevada\u2019s department of VR said  that delays in service may also occur when students with disabilities,  upon leaving high school, must return assistive technology devices on  loan from the school, such as software for blind individuals that reads text  on a screen in a computer-generated voice. According to officials, some  students go without these critical adaptive devices until VR is able to  equip them with the same or similar technologies.", "Service delays can be exacerbated if students with disabilities have to  wait until program officials resolve who should provide and pay for  services. In addition, some adult programs will not provide services to  students who are still eligible to receive services under IDEA. Officials  from two states said that, as a result, there has been a shift toward  keeping students with disabilities in high school longer so that schools  continue paying for services until students graduate or turn 22 years of  age. For example, officials from Maryland\u2019s department of VR said that  students with developmental disabilities who decide to leave high school  before they age out of IDEA services often face a delay in services  because the state department of developmental disability will not provide  services to students younger than age 21.", "Some of the stakeholders said that differing eligibility criteria, definitions  of disability, and assessment requirements for the various adult programs  can also result in service delays while youth with disabilities wait for  assessments or eligibility determinations. For example, officials in the four  states in which we spoke with higher education officials said some  colleges require students with disabilities to be reassessed before they  can receive accommodations, and that this can cause a delay in service  because there are long waitlists for these reassessments or because they  are cost prohibitive for some families.", "Limited access to reliable public transportation to and from employment  programs and service providers\u2014especially in rural areas\u2014was also  frequently highlighted as a major challenge. For example, officials from  Florida said limited funding for transportation services contributes to the  lack of transportation for students with disabilities.", "Officials in each of the states we contacted also said that certain groups  of students with disabilities are more likely to face limited service options  or gaps in service because their disabilities may be less visible or  because they are less likely to qualify for adult programs. These groups  include students with developmental or cognitive disabilities, learning  disabilities, mental health disabilities, autism, and mild disabilities.  Further, we heard that there may be limited programs for students with  hearing or visual impairments, and that if these students also have other  disabilities, it can be difficult to determine which program (e.g., VR or a  developmental disability agency) should provide services, which can lead  to gaps in service. Similarly, officials said that students with disabilities  who are in the juvenile justice system, are themselves parents, or are  homeless may also be more likely to face gaps in service than other  students with disabilities because they tend not to be aware of or  connected to adult service providers. In addition, some students who  qualified for services under IDEA and/or under Section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act may not meet the eligibility requirements for adult  programs and may, therefore, have limited or no post-high school service  options. For example, one parent told us that her daughter, who has a  serious physical disability, did not receive any transition planning  assistance and struggled to gain access to services such as personal  care attendants who would help her successfully transition to a college  out of state.", "A lack of adequate information and awareness of available program  options on the part of parents, students, and service providers was  another challenge highlighted during our site visits. Many stakeholders  said that students with disabilities and their parents do not always receive  enough information about the full range of service options after high  school. For example, a parent from California said that she was very  disappointed with the limited information she received from her school  district and that she had no idea what resources were available for her  son after he left high school. A student from Maryland expressed concern  that students with disabilities who do not seek information about transition  services outside of high school may not have access to information, and  consequently, to needed services. In contrast, a few stakeholders said  parents may receive too much information and feel overwhelmed. For  example, a parent from California said that families may receive so much  information that they do not remember everything and do not know where  to seek help when the time comes. A staff member from the California  Department of Education\u2019s Workability program said that, even when  information about transition services is available, it is generally not  compiled and made available in one central place for families to access.She recommended that states or programs develop an accessible, easy  to read transition manual that clearly lays out post-high school service  options.", "Sometimes there was an issue with the accuracy of information parents  received. For example, officials in three of the five states we contacted  said that parents may be misinformed about programs, especially about  the ability of their children to retain SSI benefits. Officials from Florida\u2019s  developmental disability agency noted that parents are often misinformed  by teachers or adult program service providers that their children will lose  these benefits entirely if they obtain any paid employment.", "Lack of awareness of service options also extended to teachers and other  high school personnel. Many of the stakeholders said that teachers and  other high school personnel may not always be aware of post-high school  service options for students with disabilities. For example, one parent said  that while there are a lot of programs in her community that can aid  students in transition, school personnel are not aware of them and  therefore cannot appropriately guide students with disabilities and their  families. Moreover, some experts and state education officials said that  teacher training and professional development programs do not always  adequately prepare teachers to provide transition services or inform them  about the various agencies and resources available to students with  disabilities. A few of the officials, however, said that teachers in some  school districts are well trained in and aware of adult programs that can  provide transition services, which allows them to disseminate information  to students and their parents.", "In addition, some stakeholders said that service providers from adult  programs may not be used to working with this student population or have  limited awareness of other adult programs that can provide  complementary transition services. For example, stakeholders in  Maryland and Nevada said that VR counselors need additional training to  work with transition-age youth with disabilities and officials from  Maryland\u2019s local workforce agencies said that one-stop center staff need  more training to help these students enter the workforce. A representative  from a parent training and information center in Maryland added that the  knowledge service providers have about other programs is piecemeal and  inconsistent. She suggested the federal government support additional  training for all professionals who work with students in transition.", "Many stakeholders said that high schools do not always adequately  prepare students with disabilities for college or the workforce, and cited  several contributing factors. According to some officials, the federal  requirement to begin transition planning by age 16 is too late. In fact,  officials in four of the five states we contacted said that schools are  required to start transition planning at an earlier age. In addition, in all  five states we heard that schools\u2019 emphasis on academic achievement  has left little time for vocational and life skills training, even though these  skills may be key to gaining and retaining employment\u2014especially for  students with disabilities. Officials from Minnesota\u2019s department of VR  said that schools need to pay greater attention to vocational training  because students with disabilities are at a distinct disadvantage if they  leave high school with no work experience. Further, officials from  Maryland\u2019s department of developmental disabilities said that because  most jobs require a high school diploma, students with disabilities who  receive certificates instead of diplomas could find their employment  options significantly curtailed because many employers do not recognize  alternative completion documents. As a transition specialist from  Maryland noted, many students with non-traditional diplomas end up in  sheltered workshops because they are not considered to be qualified for  competitive employment opportunities.", "In addition, according to some stakeholders, adult programs are not  always designed to meet the needs of transition-age youth with  disabilities in ways that will help them succeed in college or in a job. For  example, a few state officials said that the VR system does not provide  incentives for serving transition-age youth with disabilities because VR\u2019s  performance indicators reward counselors for serving clients who find and  maintain employment for at least 90 days, and youth with disabilities may  take longer to do so. representatives from California\u2019s workforce agency, that the time frame of  the employment outcome measures under the WIA youth program may  be too short\u2014for example, the employment retention rate at 6 months\u2014 and not appropriate for transition-age youth with disabilities who often  require follow-up support longer than 6 months in order to be successful  at a job.", "We previously reported that Education does not comprehensively measure the  performance of VR for certain key populations, including transition-age youth. See GAO,  Vocational Rehabilitation: Better Measures and Monitoring Could Improve the  Performance of the VR Program, GAO-05-865 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 23, 2005). social security benefits instead of receiving job training, and that students  with more serious disabilities who could benefit from competitive  employment (i.e., applying for and getting a job) may be steered instead  toward adult day training programs and sheltered workshops."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agency Coordination of Transition Activities Has Limitations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Agencies Coordinate on Specific Transition Activities but Face Some Barriers", "paragraphs": ["Education, HHS, Labor, and SSA coordinate transition activities to some  degree, but their coordination has limitations and they do not assess the  effectiveness of their efforts. They coordinate on some specific transition  activities, but their efforts are primarily focused on information sharing  and lack elements that our prior work identified as enhancing and  sustaining effective coordination. We have reported on the importance  of developing common outcome goals and of engaging in strategic  planning and coordination to address issues that cut across agency  boundaries. This can take many forms, ranging from occasional meetings  between agency staff to more structured joint policy teams operating over  a long period of time.", "One federal coordination effort\u2014the Federal Partners in Transition  Workgroup\u2014targets transition services to students with disabilities and  involves all four agencies that administer the key programs that provide  transition services to youth with disabilities. However, this workgroup is informal and primarily involves information sharing among staff-level  representatives, according to agency officials. For example, SSA officials  told us that in past meetings, their staff presented information about SSI  requirements for the transitioning youth population, including the process  for redetermining eligibility for SSI when youth turn age 18, and  information on the Student Earned Income Exclusion. To a lesser  extent, some workgroup members also reported that they have jointly  developed guidance for students with disabilities and grantees, including  a fact sheet about how students can take advantage of Schedule A hiring  authority for federal jobs. In addition, the workgroup has convened  forums to help students with disabilities develop their leadership and self- advocacy skills and to discuss action steps to ensure students are  prepared to move successfully to adulthood. This workgroup also  convened a meeting of representatives of technical assistance centers to  discuss coordination among the centers. Agencies involved in the  workgroup reported varying levels of involvement in more extensive  coordination activities, such as policymaking, program planning, and joint  strategic planning. Labor officials leading the effort told us they are in the  process of drafting a strategic plan to identify objectives, activities, and  outcomes for the group.", "Education and Labor also participate in the National Community of  Practice in Support of Transition, which was developed by the IDEA  Partnership and focuses on joint efforts among state and local agencies  to coordinate and improve outcomes for youth with disabilities in  transition. Both agencies also have established intra-agency groups to   (See fig. 3.)  facilitate collaboration between internal program offices.", "Education officials also said they recently sponsored a national transition  conference for more than 800 professionals, families, and students to  facilitate collaboration and communication across federal, state, and local  entities. Aside from these efforts, officials said most of their interagency  coordination regarding transition services occurs on an ad hoc basis,  such as sharing white papers and holding informal discussions about  policies, performance measures, and technical assistance to states. In  addition, several federal coordination efforts broadly target disadvantaged  youth or all individuals with disabilities and may address some aspects of  transition. (See app. III).", "Some federal agencies are involved in new demonstration projects that  plan to address coordination across systems at the state and local level.  For example, an official from HHS stated that the agency has coordinated  with Education and Labor to develop grants under the new Projects of  National Significance Partnerships in Employment Systems Change. This  initiative will provide resources for state agencies and service providers to  collaborate with other services systems to develop statewide model  demonstration projects that expand competitive employment for youth  with developmental disabilities. In another example, officials at all four  agencies said they have been involved in early discussions regarding  implementation of the new Promoting Readiness of Minors in  Supplemental Security Income (PROMISE) initiative, which will fund pilot  projects in states to promote positive changes in the outcomes of youth  SSI recipients and their families. Education officials said they are in the  process of holding meetings to gather input on potential projects from  federal partners and stakeholders, including state agency officials, service  providers, researchers, policy experts, and families. As part of the  initiative, Education and SSA officials said they will work collaboratively to  identify legislative barriers to competitive employment and ways to  improve coordination at the state level. In addition to collaborative efforts  across agencies, Education officials said that six grants focusing on  transition and funded by their Rehabilitation Services Administration are  in their fifth and final year of operation. According to Education officials,  these grants demonstrate the use of promising practices of collaborative  transition planning and service delivery to improve the postsecondary  education and employment outcomes of youth with disabilities.", "Despite these efforts, federal agency officials identified several barriers  that limit their ability to coordinate. We have reported that federal  agencies face a range of coordination barriers, one of which stems from  goals that are not mutually reinforcing or are potentially conflicting,  making it difficult to reach a consensus on strategies and priorities. found interagency coordination is enhanced by having a clear and  compelling rationale for staff to work across agency lines and articulate  the common federal outcomes they are seeking. Indeed, officials  identified a lack of compatible outcome goals for transitioning students  with disabilities as one of the key barriers that hinder their coordination  efforts.", "Mutually reinforcing goals or strategies are designed to help align agency activities,  core processes, and resources to achieve common outcomes. countered by requirements for students to prove that their disabilities limit  their ability to work in order to receive SSI benefits. Similarly, officials  told us that, in early interagency discussions regarding the PROMISE  initiative, special education officials focused on students\u2019 access to  postsecondary education, while VR and SSA officials were more  concerned about students\u2019 earnings. Officials from all four agencies said  that aligning outcome goals for transition-age students with disabilities  would enhance interagency coordination and help agencies approach  transition in a more integrated way. Some officials suggested establishing  a common agreement on desired outcomes for transitioning students,  such as economic self-sufficiency or engagement in meaningful  employment, volunteer work, or postsecondary education by a certain  age.", "The age range for children served through special education under IDEA is 3 through  21. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(B). SSI serves children from birth to age 18, (42 U.S.C. \u00a7  1382c(c)), at which point there must be a redetermination as to whether or not they are  still eligible for SSI benefits as adults (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(H)(iii)). programs.services to recipients who might benefit from them. Moreover, integrating  information about students served by multiple programs over time would  allow agencies to assess the impact of transition services across  programs, according to Education and SSA officials. In addition, officials  said sharing information about common service recipients would help  agencies serve students with disabilities in a more streamlined way. For  instance, SSA could identify students receiving employment and training  services through other federal programs and provide counseling to help  them understand how paid employment affects their SSI benefits and  health insurance, with an eye toward helping students attain greater  economic self-sufficiency. Officials cautioned, however, that privacy  concerns may limit some information sharing and make it difficult to  integrate information from multiple systems. While officials noted that the  Federal Partners in Transition Workgroup has discussed these  information sharing challenges at some of its meetings, one official noted  that there is no substantive effort to address them at the federal level.", "As a result, agencies are limited in their ability to target  Officials also identified a lack of clarity on agencies\u2019 roles and  responsibilities for providing and paying for transition services as another  coordination barrier. For example, each program has its own statutory  authority, permitting it to pay only for certain services or types of services.  This can create confusion, particularly at the state and local levels, about  who is responsible for paying for a particular service. It can also result in  frequent debates about which agency is responsible for funding services,  according to some officials, creating a disincentive for agencies to work  together.

Agency officials acknowledged that coordination  specifically on transition services could be improved. For example, one  official said agencies could work collaboratively to identify opportunities to  address legislative and regulatory barriers to coordinating transition  services. Officials added that improved data collection and sharing could  help agencies adopt a more coordinated and crosscutting approach to  delivering transition services to students with disabilities. Labor officials  leading the Federal Partners in Transition Workgroup said that, while an  overall plan for transition remains beyond the group\u2019s scope of work, a  framework that identifies what is needed for a successful transition could  be used at the federal level to review collaboration across systems and to  identify definition, service, and funding gaps.also be used at the local level to identify gaps in communities and  individual plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Do Not Assess the Effectiveness of Their Coordination Efforts", "paragraphs": ["It is unclear whether existing federal coordination efforts have had a  positive effect on access to transition services because agencies do not  assess their coordination efforts.

Agency officials also told  us that some coordination efforts have led to increased engagement in  transition policy by students with disabilities and their families and  improved results in achieving career readiness and self-sufficiency.  However, these results are difficult to corroborate because agencies do  not evaluate the impact of their efforts, and in many cases do not track  coordination outcomes at the federal level, according to agency officials.Furthermore, the effectiveness of existing federal coordination efforts is  questionable, as evidenced by persistent challenges students with  disabilities face navigating multiple programs.", "Some federal agencies monitor compliance with requirements for  grantees to coordinate with other state and local entities under individual  programs. For example, Part B of IDEA requires state educational  agencies to report annually on their performance using 20 indicators  established by the Secretary. One of the indicators measures the state\u2019s  compliance with the requirement under IDEA to include postsecondary  goals and transition services in the IEPs of students age 16 and above;  and to invite the student and, if appropriate, representatives from other  participating state agencies to the student\u2019s IEP team meetings if  transition services are to be discussed. Similarly, state VR agencies  must report annually to the Rehabilitation Services Administration on  whether they have identified the responsibilities of other agencies through  statute, regulation, or written agreements, and to undergo monitoring of  their coordination activities. These monitoring reviews, however, mainly  address compliance with programmatic and fiscal requirements, help  ascertain whether state agencies have in place signed formal interagency  agreements, and check whether these agreements include key  components such as providing technical assistance to school districts on  transition planning.

Without  receiving accurate and timely information about available services,  students may miss opportunities to access needed services that could  mean the difference between achieving an optimal level of self-sufficiency  and relying on public assistance to meet their basic needs. While officials  report that federal agency coordination efforts, such as the Federal  Partners in Transition Workgroup, have improved relationships and built  shared knowledge across participating agencies, they have yet to adopt a  broader interagency strategic approach to addressing longstanding  challenges in providing transition services to students with disabilities.  The transition workgroup, in particular, represents a unique vehicle that  could provide leadership in developing such a strategy specifically  focused on students with disabilities who are transitioning out of high  school. Given the multiple agencies involved in supporting this population,  in conjunction with multiple eligibility criteria and definitions established in  statute, the lack of such a strategy is a missed opportunity to break down  coordination barriers and work across agency boundaries. Only then can  agencies systemically address persistent transition challenges and  improve outcomes for students with disabilities.

HHS also questioned the relevance of several programs included in our  list of federal programs that provide transition services, on the basis that  the programs do not provide direct services. We agree that one of these  programs, Partnership in Employment Systems Change Grants, is  intended to enhance collaboration rather than provide transition services;  therefore, we removed it from the list. However, we disagreed that the  Youth Information, Training and Resources Centers program be omitted  from the list. It provides self-advocacy services that we consider to be a  type of transition service for youth.
