These branches are subject to host countries\u2019 anti-money-laundering laws rather than U.S. anti-money-laundering laws. As a result, U.S. regulators\u2019 examinations of these branches are more narrowly scoped than comparable examinations of branches in the United States. In addition, host country bank privacy and data protection laws may serve to prevent U.S. regulators from performing on-site examinations of U.S. branches in certain countries. However, regulators can rely on other means to counteract or prevent money-laundering activities at these overseas branches.", "Several U.S. law enforcement agencies are responsible for investigating crimes involving money laundering. Law enforcement officials from two European countries expressed concern to GAO about the difficulties of dealing with multiple U.S. agencies. U.S. law enforcement agency officials, however, prefer not to designate a single agency as a focal point on overseas money-laundering inquiries because of jurisdictional problems.", "Instead, a number of U.S. agencies have adopted a July 1994 Memorandum of Understanding that aims to improve overseas coordination.", "Also, the United States is working with other countries through treaties and arrangements to establish global anti-money-laundering policies, mainly through the Financial Action Task Force.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to be here today to discuss money laundering, a global problem that needs to be fought collectively by the international community.

Gonzalez over the past year and a half on U.S. efforts to combat overseas money laundering. Most of our work will be more comprehensively summarized in a report we plan to release shortly.

FinCEN provides governmentwide intelligence and analysis that federal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies can use to aid in the detection, investigation, and prosecution of domestic and international money laundering and other financial crimes.

U.S. banking regulators have also relied on approaches in which financial institutions report financial transactions involving known or suspected money laundering.According to a senior Treasury official, U.S. regulators\u2019 anti-money-laundering efforts in coming years are expected to rely more on the reporting of financial transactions involving known or suspected money laundering. U.S. regulators will also be expected to continue relying on CTRs, but to a lesser extent.", "Most U.S. banks have adopted so-called \u201cknow your customer\u201d policies over the past few years to help them improve their identification of financial transactions involving known or suspected money laundering, according to the American Bankers Association. Under these know your customer policies, which are currently voluntary but which the Treasury plans to make mandatory in 1996, financial institutions are to verify the business of a new account holder and report any activity that is inconsistent with that type of business. According to the American Bankers Association, these policies are among the most effective means of combating money laundering, and the majority of banks have already adopted such policies.", "The seven European countries we visited have tended to model their anti-money-laundering measures after a 1991 European Union (EU)Directive that established requirements for financial institutions similar to those that financial institutions conducting business in the United States must follow. However, instead of relying on the routine reports of currency transactions that the United States has traditionally emphasized, European countries have tended to rely more on suspicious transaction reports and on know your customer policies. These know your customer policies are somewhat more comprehensive than comparable U.S. ones, according to European bank and regulatory officials.", "While Hungary and Poland have adopted anti-money-laundering measures following the EU Directive, banking and government officials in these two countries told us that the implementation and enforcement of their anti-money-laundering measures have been hindered. They attributed problems to such factors as resource shortages, inexperience in detection and prevention, and in Poland, conflicts between bank secrecy laws and recently adopted anti-money-laundering statutes.", "FinCEN and INTERPOL have recently initiated Project Eastwash, to attempt to assess money laundering in 20 to 30 countries throughout East and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. According to FinCEN officials, as of late 1995 on-site visits had been made to five countries to assess the law enforcement, regulatory, legislative, and financial industry environment in each nation.

One reason is that host country anti-money laundering measures may not be as stringent as U.S. anti-money-laundering requirements and, thus, may not provide the necessary information for U.S. examiners. OCC and FRB officials also said that the expense of sending examiners overseas limits the amount of time examiners can spend reviewing the anti-money-laundering controls of the bank. However, according to these officials less time is needed to conduct an anti-money-laundering examination at some overseas branches because of the small volume of currency transactions. FRB officials told us that they have recently developed money-laundering examination procedures to be used by its examiners to address the uniqueness of overseas branches\u2019 operations and to fit within the short time frames of these examinations.

Nevertheless, U.S. law enforcement agencies have taken recent steps to address overseas money-laundering coordination. In particular, a number of U.S. agencies adopted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in July 1994 on how to assign responsibility for international drug money-laundering investigations. Law enforcement officials were optimistic that the MOU, which was signed by representatives of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Postmaster General, would improve overseas anti-money-laundering coordination.
