As part of strategic workforce planning, FAA determines the critical skills needed in its workforce and assesses individual worker skill levels. It also follows leading practices in performance management, but FAA officials and union representatives questioned the system's fairness, echoing concerns that they have raised in the past. FAA follows fewer leading practices in diversity management, but has an opportunity to strengthen its efforts as it updates diversity outreach plans. Despite these efforts, FAA ranked 214th out of 216 agencies in 2009 as the best place to work in the federal government, similar to its ranking in 2007. These low rankings could pose obstacles to FAA's efforts to retain its existing workforce and recruit staff with the requisite skills needed to implement the Next Generation Air Transportation System. By fiscal year 2013, FAA projects that 38 percent of its employees who perform work that is critical to FAA's mission will be eligible to retire. While FAA employee responses to governmentwide surveys indicate that they like their work, their responses are considerably less positive than the rest of the federal government regarding other factors that have an impact on employee recruitment, motivation, and retention. The percentage of FAA employees' positive responses regarding communications, involvement in decisions that affect their work, and respect for their leaders were up to 19 points below those of the rest of the federal government. FAA has developed an action plan to improve leadership and create a performance-based culture that could improve employees' workplace satisfaction.

To  address these questions, we compared the FAA\u2019s human capital practices  with leading practices\u2014those that we have identified through previous  work as being present in public and private organizations that are viewed  as leaders in strategic human capital management and managing for  results. We reviewed FAA documents and regulations, and relevant studies  by other organizations, and interviewed key FAA operating officials who  have responsibility for implementing human capital procedures within  FAA\u2019s major organizational entities. We also interviewed FAA\u2019s human  resource management officials and obtained the perspectives of organized  labor through semistructured interviews with union representatives.

In response  to a congressional mandate resulting from this review, the Secretary of  Transportation prepared a report in 1995 that concluded that the most  effective reform would be to exempt FAA from most federal personnel  rules and procedures contained in title 5 of the United States Code. On  November 15, 1995, Congress exempted FAA from a number of title 5 rules  and procedures (see table 1) and directed the FAA Administrator to  develop and implement a new personnel management system. The law  also required that FAA\u2019s new personnel management system address the  unique demands of the agency\u2019s workforce and, at a minimum, provide  greater flexibility in the compensation, hiring, training, and location of  personnel. Subsequent legislation added the requirement for FAA to  negotiate with its labor unions any changes made to its personnel  management system. On April 1, 1996, FAA introduced its new personnel  management system and, over the next several years, initiated a number of  efforts to address the following reform objectives:    FAA acquires, develops, and deploys required expertise (people) where  and when needed.", "Human resource systems support employees\u2019 achievement of goals.", "FAA has effective leadership and management.", "FAA is perceived as a desirable place to work.", "Human resource management systems are efficient and adaptable.", "In 2003, we reported that FAA had implemented many of its reform  initiatives, but changes to its compensation system, workforce planning  initiatives, and implementation of a new performance management system  remained incomplete. FAA had (1) developed a new broadbanded,  performance-based pay structure aimed at providing a wider range of pay  and greater managerial flexibility to recruit, retain, and motivate  employees and (2) implemented the pay structure in varying forms for  about 75 percent of its workforce. FAA had planned to cover the  remainder of the workforce under the new compensation plan as it  negotiated new labor agreements with unions representing those  workforces. As of July 2009, 88 percent of FAA\u2019s workforce was under one  or more components of performance-based compensation. However, FAA  and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA)\u2014-the union  representing FAA\u2019s air traffic controllers\u2014agreed to a new contract in  September 2009 that removed nearly 16,000 employees from performance- based compensation, thereby reducing the percentage of the workforce  under performance-based compensation to about 55 percent.", "As part of its reform efforts, FAA also developed a new performance  management system consisting of a narrative evaluation of employees\u2019  performance against performance standards combined with feedback and  coaching. FAA began developing its new performance management system  in 1999 and first implemented it within segments of the agency in 2001. At  the time of our 2003 report, about 20 percent of FAA\u2019s workforce was  under the new performance management system. As of July 2009, FAA had  expanded the performance management system\u2019s coverage to more than  95 percent of its workforce. Under FAA\u2019s new contract with NATCA, air  traffic controllers continue to be covered by the new performance  management system. While the contract requires that controllers\u2019  performance be evaluated against written standards, and that the  supervisor and controller discuss the evaluation, the contract does not  provide for interim or midpoint performance feedback during the  performance appraisal cycle.", "FAA also sought, received, and implemented flexibilities in hiring,  relocating, and training employees. However, at the time of our 2003  report, FAA had not completed efforts to incorporate these flexibilities  into strategic workforce plans. Workforce planning should include  developing strategies for integrating hiring, recruiting, training, and other  human capital activities in a manner that meets the agency\u2019s long-term  objectives to ensure that appropriately skilled employees are available  when and where they are needed to meet an agency\u2019s mission. We  reported that FAA had established agencywide corporate policies and  guidance for developing workforce plans for executives, managers, and  supervisors and for specific occupations, but these initiatives were at  varying degrees of implementation. As we discuss later in this report, FAA  has developed workforce plans for its major organizational segments and  for specific workforces.", "In 2003, we also noted that FAA lacked baseline data against which to  measure the impact of its initiatives, and that FAA had not adequately  linked initiative goals to the agency\u2019s mission goals. While FAA\u2019s human  resource officials maintained that the new compensation system  addressed recruitment and retention objectives, FAA could not support  this assertion with data because the agency did not establish any baseline  data from which to measure improvements. Consequently, we were unable  to evaluate the effectiveness of FAA\u2019s reform efforts. We recommended  that FAA develop empirical data and establish performance measures,  develop linkages between human capital reform initiatives and program  goals, establish time frames for data collection and analysis, and hold  managers accountable for the results of human capital management  efforts. FAA has implemented these recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Workforce Demographics and Expertise Requirements", "paragraphs": ["In the coming years, FAA risks losing significant amounts of institutional  knowledge as its employees retire. The dramatic shifts that are occurring  in the nation\u2019s population are reflected in FAA\u2019s workforce, where more  than three-fourths of its employees are age 40 or older. By fiscal year 2013,  FAA projects that 38 percent of its employees who perform work that is  critical to FAA\u2019s mission will be eligible to retire (see table 2). For  example, in the next 5 years, 42 percent of air traffic controllers, who  ensure the safe and smooth movement of air traffic in the air and on the  ground at airports; 31 percent of airway transportation system specialists,  who install and maintain air traffic control systems; and 48 percent of  aviation safety inspectors, who perform critical safety oversight of the  aviation industry and air operators, are projected to be eligible to retire.  However, the current economic downturn could affect FAA\u2019s retention  and recruitment. FAA\u2019s losses from retirement and other causes, for all  occupations, declined by 27 percent during the first 4 months of fiscal year  2009, compared with the corresponding months of the prior fiscal year.  Additionally, a July 2009 vacancy announcement for controllers attracted  nearly 9,000 applications and a recruitment fair for people with disabilities  was successful.", "In addition to replacing institutional knowledge, FAA will need to obtain  expertise to support the transition of the national airspace system to  NextGen. NextGen envisions a fundamental change in air traffic  management by moving to a structure that is adaptable to growth in  operations as well as shifts in demand, and that is network-centric,  meaning everyone using the system has easy access to the same  information at the same time. NextGen will entail a number of  transitions\u2014from ground-based to satellite-based navigation and  surveillance; from voice communications to digital data exchange; from a  fragmented weather forecast delivery system to a system that uses a  single, authoritative source; and from limited operations in poor visibility  conditions to more operations that can proceed in adverse weather. While  FAA plays a central role in these transitions, the Departments of Defense,  Commerce, and Homeland Security; the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration; and the White House Office of Science and Technology  Policy also participate. In previous work, we questioned whether FAA had  the required systems integration expertise, given the complexity of this  effort. FAA responded by engaging the National Academy of Public  Administration (NAPA) to identify (1) the skills needed to accomplish the  transition to NextGen and (2) strategies for acquiring the necessary  workforce competencies. NAPA assembled a panel of experts (NAPA  Panel) to perform the study and reported on the panel\u2019s findings in  September 2008.", "The NAPA Panel found that acquisitions will be an important element in  NextGen. FAA defines its acquisition workforce broadly, following the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidance, to include program and  project managers, researchers and engineers, business and financial  analysts, contracting officers and specialists, contracting officer\u2019s  technical representatives, integrated logistics specialists, test and  evaluation personnel, and other specialized support. Consequently, the  acquisition workforce includes individuals who determine requirements;  plan acquisition strategies; establish business relationships to obtain  needed goods and services; and ensure that the government\u2019s needs are  met by testing, evaluating, and monitoring contractor performance. FAA\u2019s  acquisition workforce also includes experts in subject matter areas, such  as finance, who support the business process. FAA recently estimated that  it will need to hire several hundred additional staff to implement NextGen,  and most of these staff will be part of the acquisition workforce. However,  as FAA attempts to hire these staff, it will be competing with a projected  governmentwide hiring surge. For example, the Partnership for Public  Service\u2019s survey, \u201cWhere the Jobs Are 2009,\u201d indicates that from fiscal  years 2010 through 2012, the federal government could hire more than  16,000 employees to fill needs in general administration/program  management; engineering (electrical, aerospace, and computer); finance;  and contracts.

Additionally,  the technical training program contains an evaluation component.  However, we made several recommendations aimed at, among other  things, improving the timeliness of training, improving FAA\u2019s identification  of gaps in inspectors\u2019 technical knowledge, and developing measures of  the impact of training on achieving organizational goals. FAA has  implemented most of these recommendations. For example, FAA has  taken steps to deliver training in a more timely manner, such as developing  new Web-based courses that inspectors can complete when the training is  needed. Additionally, in 2007, FAA conducted a feasibility analysis that  explored different methods to measure training\u2019s impact on achieving  organizational goals. In August 2009, FAA was working to address the  remaining recommendations by providing more guidance on when  accepting training for in-kind services is appropriate and revising  inspector guidance to clarify that free training does not preclude FAA from  fulfilling its oversight and enforcement role.

The President of the Professional Aviation Safety  Specialists (PASS)\u2014the union representing, among others, FAA  employees who maintain air traffic control equipment\u2014said that the  technical training for airway systems specialists is often unnecessarily  time-consuming and costly, because FAA customizes the training to make  it unique to FAA and then requires that employees travel to the FAA  Academy to receive technical training. The union President said that FAA  could streamline the process by allowing staff to take training courses  from private vendors who offer the same training at locations closer to  their home office. FAA noted that the academy is the only location that  replicates every piece of equipment that aviation systems safety specialists  use, and that equipment in air traffic control facilities cannot be taken off- line for training. However, FAA\u2019s Director of Technical Training and  Development told us that FAA is exploring how to validate locally  provided courses for equivalency to the training provided at the FAA  Academy. Additionally, FAA is increasing the availability of Web-based  training, simulations, and other alternative training methodologies that  will allow greater opportunities for on-site training, according to another  FAA training official. We are currently reviewing airway transportation  system specialist training under another engagement.", "NATCA representatives criticized how FAA implements controller  training.

FAA\u2019s Director of Technical  Training and Development believes this criticism to be an overstatement,  and noted that FAA offers many specialized courses at the FAA Academy  and fills the spaces allocated.", "NATCA representatives also believe that controllers have fewer  opportunities to attend training because there are not enough experienced  controllers to handle air traffic while others attend training. A 2008 report  from the Department of Transportation Inspector General questioned  whether FAA had sufficient numbers of experienced controllers to train  the large numbers of new controllers that it was hiring. The report noted  that the hiring process was outpacing the capabilities of many air traffic  facilities to efficiently process and train new hires. The Inspector General  made a number of recommendations, and FAA agreed or partially agreed  with most of them. FAA notes that the agency continues to monitor its  hiring and training programs to achieve a balance between a facility\u2019s  trainees and the facility\u2019s training capacity, and to help ensure that  trainees progress through each stage of training while ensuring safety.

The  FAA officials believe that the SCI is not large enough to motivate  performance, and because more than one-half of the employees receive  the increase, it creates morale problems among those employees whom  officials believe are solid performers, but received no SCI. Union  representatives said that, from the employee\u2019s perspective, it is not clear  how supervisory recommendations are translated into decisions about  which employees receive these increases. Union representatives also  expressed fairness concerns in saying that, in some cases, the same  employees receive the increases every year and that, in other cases,  increases appear to be given on a rotating basis, without respect to level of  performance.", "All employees who meet expectations also receive an Organizational  Success Increase (OSI), which FAA provides when the agency has met at  he  least 90 percent of its performance targets. The total funding pool for t OSI consists of the amount of the governmentwide General Schedule  increase for a given year, plus an additional 1 percent. As with t OSI aligns with the reform objective of supporting employees\u2019  achievement of organizational goals. However, FAA and union officials  criticized the OSI component of performance pay because, in their  opinion, it rewards or penalizes employees for organizational performanc that they cannot influence. For example, FAA may withhold a portion of  the OSI because the agency did not achieve its target for reducing  operational errors, even though there are many employees, such as  contract specialists, whom FAA officials and union representatives believe  have no influence over such activities.", "FAA has taken actions to improve the implementation of its performance  management system.

The Partnership and ISPPI  develop their ranking on the basis of analysis of OPM\u2019s biannual Federal  Human Capital Survey results. The survey contains over 80 items that  gauge employee satisfaction with pay, leadership, and collaboration,  among other things. The Partnership and ISPPI ranked FAA 204th out of  222 agencies in 2007 and 214th out of 216 agencies in 2009.", "These published rankings are important to FAA because an agency\u2019s  reputation is a key factor in recruiting and hiring applicants. A recent  Partnership report noted that a good reputation is the most frequently  mentioned factor in choosing potential employers, and agencies with high  satisfaction and engagement scores were seen as desirable by college  graduates seeking employment. The Partnership report also noted that  college students are rating some government agencies as ideal employers.", "Similarly, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) reported that  employees\u2019 willingness to recommend the federal government or their  agency as a place to work can directly affect an agency\u2019s recruitment  efforts, the quality of the resulting applicant pool, and the acceptance of  employment offers. In 2005, compared with 1989, MSPB found that  considerably more federal employees would recommend the government  as a place to work, and that more federal employees reported satisfaction  with their pay. Moreover, the job security that federal employment offers  is a major selling point in the current economic downturn. While FAA  generally follows leading recruitment and hiring practices, FAA may be  able to take only limited advantage of these favorable trends, since only  about one-half of FAA employees\u2019 responses to the OPM survey item, \u201cI  would recommend my organization as a good place to work,\u201d were  positive in 2008. About 65 percent of the employees in the rest of the  federal government responded positively, putting FAA about 15  percentage points behind other agencies. Moreover, MSPB noted that  prospective employees would rather work for an agency billed as one of  the best places to work as opposed to an agency at the bottom of the list.  Clearly, when Congress passed legislation allowing FAA to implement a  new personnel management system, FAA recognized the importance of  this point by establishing the reform objective that FAA be perceived as a  desirable place to work. However, FAA\u2019s low rankings in 2007 and 2009  would not indicate to prospective applicants that FAA is perceived as a  desirable place to work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FAA Is Considerably behind the Rest of the Federal Government in Key Measures of Workplace Satisfaction, and Is Taking Steps Aimed at Improvement", "paragraphs": ["FAA employee responses to OPM\u2019s 2008 Federal Human Capital Survey  placed the agency well behind the rest of the federal government in overall  job and organizational satisfaction, as well as satisfaction with their  leaders and their leaders\u2019 competencies in communications and building  teamwork and cooperation.

Moreover, FAA employees were less positive  concerning many of the items that OPM has identified as indicators of an  agency\u2019s ability to recruit, motivate, and retain employees. On the basis of  its analysis of its past two Federal Human Capital Surveys, OPM  determined that responses to 16 items\u2014called \u201cimpact items\u201d\u2014really  make a difference in whether people want to come, stay, and contribute  their fullest to an agency. FAA\u2019s percentage of positive responses to these  impact items and the difference between FAA\u2019s percentage of positive  responses and that of the rest of the federal government appear in figure 1.", "FAA responses to the top two items in figure 1 indicate that FAA  employees said they like the work they do and derive considerable  satisfaction from it; and FAA employees\u2019 satisfaction on these topics was  close to that of employees in the rest of the federal government. However,  for the remainder of the items, FAA employees expressed less satisfaction  than employees in the rest of the federal government. These lower levels  of workplace satisfaction represent potential hurdles when competing for  talent with other federal agencies. FAA\u2019s strained labor-management  relations could be contributing to the low percentages of positive  responses. Several bargaining units have had contract negotiations stretch  over many years with no settlement. For example, nearly 4,000 employees,  represented by PASS, remain under the provisions of contracts that date  back to 1988 and 1993, while new contracts are under negotiations.  Additionally, in 2006, FAA encountered difficulties in negotiating a new  labor contract with NATCA, which represents about one-third of FAA  employees. In May 2009, FAA and NATCA began mediated bargaining to  reach agreement on a new contract. In September 2009, FAA and NATCA  signed a new 3-year contract. FAA and NATCA reached agreement on  most contract items, but required binding decisions from the mediators for  some items, including compensation. FAA views the new contract as a  framework for helping to meet the challenges of implementing NextGen.", "While improvement in any of the impact items that OPM identified could  help FAA improve its attractiveness as an employer of choice, the items  for which FAA is farthest behind the rest of the federal government  provide a focus for FAA to target its improvement efforts. Those items  revolve around employee perceptions of their leaders and the leadership  competencies of communication and building teamwork and cooperation.", "Research has shown that employees who are led by strong leaders are  more satisfied, engaged, and loyal than employees with weak leaders.", "FAA employees provided 28 percent positive responses regarding  satisfaction with the policies and practices of senior leaders, and 33  percent positive responses regarding having a high level of respect for  senior leaders. These two items were the farthest behind the positive  responses to impact items from the rest of the federal government.  Additionally, positive responses to \u201cHow good a job do you feel is being  done by your immediate supervisor or team leader?\u201d were 10 percentage  points behind the positive responses from the rest of the federal  government.", "Consistent with FAA\u2019s reform objective, FAA has identified 16 leadership  competencies grouped under 4 dimensions (see fig. 2).", "FAA\u2019s assessed the competency levels of its leaders in 2005, 2007, 2008,  and 2009. The results showed that the communications competency  approached or slightly exceeded the agency target level each year.  However, as figure 1 shows, employee perceptions of communications  from managers remained 12 percentage points behind the rest of the  federal government, suggesting that further work remains. The senior  executives who assisted the NAPA Panel also perceived a need for FAA\u2019s  leaders to improve communications about NextGen. They pointed out that  FAA\u2019s leaders will need to better communicate a clear vision for NextGen,  better define what it is, and get support and buy-in from staff at all levels  of the organization. FAA officials believe that the NextGen Implementation  Plan, issued in January 2009, addresses these concerns. In developing the  plan, FAA\u2019s objective was to allow a broad audience to gain a common  understanding of NextGen. The plan provides technical information in its  appendixes, which officials said address the needs of specific  stakeholders.", "The way leaders communicate with their employees can impact  employees\u2019 perceptions of leaders\u2019 honesty and integrity, which, in turn,  can affect the level of employees\u2019 respect for their senior leaders\u2014another  impact item among those for which FAA\u2019s responses were farthest behind  the rest of the federal government. The president of a local union of the  American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees  (AFSCME) provided an example that he believes demonstrates the  relationship between these competencies. The union representative said  that FAA provided little information to employees between 2003 and 2004  as FAA planned for and implemented a sweeping reorganization that  created the 36,000 employee ATO. After the reorganization, FAA  management characterized ATO as a model organization, but after the first  Chief Operating Officer departed, FAA reorganized the responsibilities of  ATO\u2019s Vice Presidents. The representative believes that FAA\u2019s lack of  communications regarding these reorganizations likely contributed to a  decline in trust of FAA management.", "FAA employees also provided fewer positive responses for impact items  related to the supervisory competency, building teamwork and  cooperation. The survey items related to teamwork and cooperation are  \u201cHow satisfied are you with your involvement in decisions that affect your  work?\u201d and \u201cEmployees have a feeling of personal empowerment with  respect to work processes.\u201d We and others have reported on this as an  area of governmentwide concern under topics such as empowerment,  collaboration, teamwork, and employee engagement. For example, we  have reported that empowering employees plays a crucial role in  establishing a results-oriented culture. Additionally, as we previously  noted in this report, a leading diversity management practice is to  understand that a more diverse and inclusive workforce can yield greater  productivity, and that diversity training could provide an awareness of  how diverse perspectives can improve organizational performance.  Moreover, MSPB has concluded that further engaging the federal  workforce is critical as agencies attempt to improve their operations  within budget constraints, and as they face increasing numbers of  retirement-eligible employees in a labor market where there is intense  competition for top talent. MSPB found that engaged employees have  less intention to leave their current agency, use less sick leave, and workf  in agencies that produce better programmatic results. For the purposes o this report, we use collaboration to include teamwork, cooperation,  employee engagement, and employee empowerment.", "Improving collaboration has implications for FAA\u2019s successful  implementation of NextGen, because 98 percent of FAA\u2019s employees who  are eligible to be members of a bargaining unit are represented by a union.  The NAPA Panel noted that although FAA\u2019s labor-management relations  had been strained for years, FAA had no clear strategy to engage the  unions. In the past, FAA\u2019s failure to collaborate with the ultimate users  early in a system\u2019s design contributed to cost growth and schedule  delays. The panel concluded that FAA\u2019s success in leading the transition  to NextGen will depend, in part, on its willingness to review its past efforts  and learn from challenges and mistakes.", "Although controllers will be end users of NextGen\u2019s technology, NATCA  representatives told us they perceive that FAA management has little  interest in collaboration. NATCA testified to Congress (1) that NextGen  will only be successful if it is done with complete participation and  agreement from government, labor, and industry groups and (2) that  collaboration will help FAA to identify and address potential issues early  on in the process, thereby saving time, money, and resources and avoiding  safety risks.", "In FAA\u2019s view, the agency has always desired to include end users in  developing NextGen technology and procedures. According to FAA, a  dispute arose over whether FAA or NATCA would make the final  determination concerning the specific union members who would serve as  subject matter experts. At the present time, FAA is using controllers as  subject matter experts in testing and developing new technology and  procedures, but NATCA has not endorsed their participation, according to  a senior FAA official.", "Other union representatives discussed collaboration in more general  terms. A PASS representative described a culture in which employees  speak only when asked, and said that speaking up and suggesting  solutions to problems is not encouraged. The representative also said that  many supervisors feel frustrated because they would like to change this  culture, but FAA does not provide any encouragement to do so. A  representative of the American Federation of Government Employees said  the union had been optimistic years ago about a 1996 contract that had an  emphasis on partnership, but nothing materialized in subsequent years.", "The following section of this report describes several actions that FAA is  taking to improve elements of workplace satisfaction, including  collaboration. Additionally, the Senate FAA reauthorization bill contains  provisions aimed at increasing collaboration with employee groups.

In 2007, FAA established its Senior Leadership  Development Program to provide a pipeline of senior managers qualified  to fill executive-level vacancies. To identify emerging leaders among its  nonsupervisory employees, FAA initiated the Program for Emerging  Leaders in 2009. FAA evaluates applicants for these programs on the basis  of their demonstration of the leadership competencies shown in figure 2.  Over time, as more of FAA\u2019s leaders graduate from these programs,  perspectives of employees about their leaders could change for the better.", "Evaluating the outcome of FAA\u2019s leadership development programs will  help FAA assess its progress in meeting its reform objective to improve  leadership and management. To evaluate the outcome of its leadership  development programs, FAA collects evaluations of participants\u2019  satisfaction with the training and the classroom experience and obtains  progress reviews that focus on the demonstrated achievement of  developmental objectives. FAA is also measuring overall programmatic  outcomes tied to succession planning goals, such as the ratio of candidates  in development to projected vacancies, number of graduates appearing on  best-qualified lists, and graduates placed in leadership positions. However,  because FAA has so far graduated 1 cohort of 16 participants from its  leadership development programs, substantial data are not yet available.  To measure the impact of these programs on leadership within the agency,  FAA is beginning to track movement in the results of its periodic  leadership competency assessments.", "FAA also has recently taken some steps to create a more collaborative  climate. For example, in February 2009, FAA invited NATCA to collaborate  on the implementation phase of the En Route Automation Modernization  system\u2014a key component of the NextGen transition. According to  NATCA, FAA and the union have held several constructive negotiation  sessions on the system\u2019s implementation. In another example, FAA agreed,  in collaboration with NATCA, to provide immunity from discipline for  employees who report safety issues under certain conditions, through  program implementation by a joint union-management committee. FAA  credits this agreement for allowing significant strides toward a safety  management culture, with the support of organized labor. FAA also used a  collaborative approach to reach agreement in 2008 on a contract covering  headquarters employees represented by AFSCME. This was the first  successful contract negotiation since the units were first certified in 1999.  A representative of PASS also noted some positive initiatives. He said the  union recently attended a few meetings regarding development of ATO\u2019s   5-year strategic plan, suggesting that FAA management is starting to  embrace the idea that collaboration with union groups results in a better  product.", "Additionally, FAA\u2019s new Administrator is emphasizing employee  engagement. FAA has established an Employee Engagement Steering  Committee comprised of FAA executives. According to FAA, these  executives will engage, listen to, and act upon the issues, ideas,  suggestions, and recommendations made by employees to improve the  FAA work environment, management practices, and organizational  culture, with the goal of becoming one of the best places in government to  work. Moreover, the Administrator has expressed his commitment to  employee engagement in a speech to one of the agency\u2019s largest unions  and sent an e-mail to all FAA employees describing a number of initiatives  aimed at hearing what employees are thinking. According to FAA Human  Resource Management officials, the Administrator also plans to provide  monetary awards to individuals and teams that make significant  contributions to improving workplace satisfaction.", "FAA\u2019s actions, as we have previously described, align with  governmentwide initiatives to improve workplace satisfaction. OPM, in  collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget, has requested  agencies to develop action plans to increase employee satisfaction in areas  where the Federal Human Capital Survey indicated low satisfaction, and to  include their plans as part of their fiscal year 2011 budget submissions.  FAA has developed a Federal Human Capital Survey 2009-2010 Action  Plan, which it intends to include with its 2011 budget submission.", "FAA\u2019s action plan focuses on improving FAA\u2019s positive response rates to  selected survey items related to leadership and creating a performance  culture. Some of these items are among those that OPM has identified as  affecting an agency\u2019s recruitment, motivation, and retention. FAA has  included the activities envisioned for the Employee Engagement Steering  Committee, as we have previously described, as part of its plan to improve  leadership. These activities could help increase positive responses  regarding employee empowerment and employees\u2019 involvement in  decisions that affect their work. FAA\u2019s positive responses for these items  were, respectively, 11 and 13 percentage points behind the rest of the  federal government in the 2008 Federal Human Capital Survey.  Additionally, the section of the plan focused on creating a performance  culture contains actions aimed at improving the performance management  system\u2019s effectiveness, which FAA officials and union representatives  criticized. For example, the plan includes providing training on effectively  applying the performance management system, with the expectation of  achieving a better understanding of how to use the system so that  employees and managers establish clear performance expectations as a  basis for ongoing performance feedback and coaching. The plan also  includes improving FAA\u2019s policies and evaluation process to better ensure  that the performance management system is used effectively.", "These efforts represent a good start. MSPB noted that among the steps  that agencies can take to improve collaboration is recruiting supervisors  on the basis of their supervisory abilities, something that FAA has already  begun to do. FAA is also striving to create a line of sight between an  employee\u2019s work and the goals of the agency, which is another step  toward increased employee engagement, according to MSPB. Also, MSPB  encourages agencies to ensure a good person-to-job fit. Based on survey  responses, FAA appears to have achieved some success in this area. As  figure 1 shows, the impact items \u201cI like the kind of work I do,\u201d \u201cMy work  gives me a feeling of personal accomplishment,\u201d and \u201cMy talents are used  well in the workplace\u201d received the three highest percentages of positive  responses from FAA employees and were the closest to the percentage of  positive responses from employees in the rest of the federal government.", "However, FAA has not established accountability for the plan\u2019s success.  Although the action plan sets a goal of a 7 percent improvement in positive  response rates to the eight selected survey items, FAA has not made  successful achievement of this goal a performance expectation for  managers, according to FAA Human Resource Management officials.  Because strong leadership is key to creating a performance culture, adding  an expectation for improvement in survey responses could increase  chances for success.
