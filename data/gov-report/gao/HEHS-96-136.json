Medicaid expenditures\u2014about $159 billion in fiscal year  1995\u2014have more than tripled in the past 10 years. Under current projections, they will double again within 8 years.", "To help constrain rising costs, a number of states are making increased use of prepaid managed care in their Medicaid programs. Under this approach, a medical plan such as a health maintenance organization (HMO) agrees to make a specified set of medical benefits available in exchange for a prepaid amount of money per person. This approach is considered less expensive than the traditional fee-for-service approach because it eliminates the incentive to provide unnecessary or overly expensive services in order to maximize revenues.", "Thus far, most states have focused their Medicaid managed care efforts on programs for low-income families, which accounted for about 73 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries in fiscal year 1994. However, states are now directing more attention to using managed care for another group of Medicaid beneficiaries\u2014those who are disabled. These individuals constitute about 15 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries, but because many of them have a heavy need for specialized medical services, they account for over one-third of all Medicaid expenditures.", "For a number of reasons, such as their ongoing dependence on specialized care and the wide diversity of types and severity of conditions, bringing disabled people into managed care presents challenges that differ from covering many other segments of the population. Dealing with these challenges involves ensuring that adequate mechanisms are in place to safeguard the interests of all three major stakeholder groups: the disabled beneficiaries, who are concerned about adequate access to quality care; the managed care plans, which are concerned about not assuming inappropriate or excessive financial risk; and the states and federal government, which are concerned about protecting the interests of both beneficiaries and taxpayers. For the most part, this is new territory: Most states have little or no experience in adjusting their managed care programs to meet these specialized needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disabled People Are One of Several Groups Eligible for Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["The range of services provided under Medicaid varies from state to state. Established in 1965 as title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396-1396s), Medicaid programs are required under federal law to provide eligible beneficiaries with certain primary, acute, and long-term care benefits. Examples include physician services, hospital care, laboratory services, preventive care for children, and nursing facility care. At their option, states may also elect to provide coverage for an array of other services, such as prescription drugs, medical equipment, eyeglasses, dental care, and ancillary services such as physical and speech therapy. Medicaid is administered at the state level, with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) providing oversight and coordination at the federal level.", "Those eligible for Medicaid come primarily from two cash assistance programs: Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). AFDC is the primary route by which children and their families become eligible, while elderly, blind, and disabled individuals become eligible primarily through SSI. Coverage expansions since 1984 have also increased the number of beneficiaries not linked to cash assistance payments. These include people who are eligible for Medicare, low-income children and pregnant women who are not receiving AFDC, and several mandatory and optional coverage groups among disabled and elderly individuals.", "About 6 million disabled individuals were covered by Medicaid in fiscal year 1994. To qualify for SSI\u2014and therefore for Medicaid in most  states\u2014beneficiaries must meet certain program criteria for disability and for maximum allowable financial resources. Eligibility criteria center on an individual\u2019s ability to function in daily life and the existence of a disabling diagnosis or condition. In 1996, the maximum allowable income was $470 per month for an individual and $705 for a couple. States have the option of extending eligibility to people who receive state payments that supplement SSI benefits; to some people whose incomes are above SSI levels but who are sufficiently disabled to need institutional care; and, with federal approval, to some people who are at risk of needing institutional care. For 1996, the federally specified maximum income level for an \u201cSSI-related\u201d individual was $1,410 per month.", "More than half of all disabled people receiving SSI as of December 1994 were eligible on the basis of a mental disability. Such disabilities included mental retardation, autism, schizophrenia, paranoia, and, under certain circumstances, substance abuse. For those who were eligible on the basis of physical disabilities, the main categories were diseases of the nervous system, sense organs, musculoskeletal and connective tissues, or circulatory system. Specific conditions in these categories included blindness, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, Parkinson\u2019s syndrome, brain tumors, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and chronic heart disease.", "Children constitute about 22 percent of disabled SSI recipients. Among them, mental retardation is the leading cause for eligibility. Since a 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision, SSI disability criteria for those 18 and younger have been based on developmental delays and limitations in ability to engage in age-appropriate activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disabled People Account for Over One-Third of Medicaid Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["Many disabled Medicaid beneficiaries have a level of medical need that is atypical of the general population. A disabled person\u2019s degree of disability can range from mild to very severe. At the more severe levels, individuals may be technology-dependent, requiring medical devices to compensate for loss of a vital body function. Many of them also require ongoing nursing care to avert death or further disability.", "Because of their atypical medical needs, disabled individuals have medical costs that are generally higher than those of the typical Medicaid beneficiary. In fiscal year 1994, disabled individuals were about 15 percent of the Medicaid population and accounted for 39 percent of Medicaid expenditures, including long-term care. Table 1.1 shows an Urban Institute analysis of how expenditures for different services in 1993 were distributed on a per-person basis. Average total expenditures for disabled ($7,956) and elderly individuals ($9,293) were each more than three times the spending for other children and adults."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managed Care Is Growing Throughout the Medicaid Program", "paragraphs": ["In general terms, managed care refers to a range of health care models that use primary care practitioners to control and coordinate the delivery of services. The best-known options are prepaid (or \u201ccapitated\u201d) models that involve payment of a set monthly amount per enrollee (the capitation fee) to provide or arrange for a specified set of services. Faced with rising Medicaid expenditures\u2014the fastest-growing portion of most state budgets\u2014many states have begun to incorporate managed care into their service delivery approach. Managed care is seen as a way to help control these costs because it discourages providers from providing unnecessary services and directs beneficiaries to obtain care in the most cost-effective settings (for example, obtaining primary care at a clinic rather than a hospital emergency room).", "Managed care is also seen as a way to better ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have access to quality care. In theory, managed care improves access and quality by linking individual beneficiaries with a single provider responsible for coordinating their health care needs. Our earlier review of these efforts found that the capitated managed care programs were succeeding, at least to some degree, in providing the kinds of benefits for which they had been designed. We found access to care was slightly better than in traditional fee-for-services programs and quality was about equal between the two.", "In June 1995, almost 15 percent of all those who received Medicaid services were enrolled in prepaid managed care plans. Their numbers, while still small in relationship to the total number of beneficiaries, are growing swiftly. For example, from June 1993 to June 1995 enrollment in capitated plans more than doubled, from 2.1 million to 5.3 million.", "To date, most states have largely targeted their managed care programs\u2014particularly those that require enrollment in prepaid plans\u2014to children and adults who qualify for Medicaid through AFDC or other programs, not toward elderly and disabled individuals. However, states are increasingly including\u2014or planning to include\u2014disabled and aged populations as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Requirements Govern State Use of Managed Care in Medicaid", "paragraphs": ["A key feature of state Medicaid programs historically has been beneficiaries\u2019 freedom to choose from among participating providers. While this freedom helped protect quality because beneficiaries who felt the care they received was inadequate or inferior could simply change providers, it did not guarantee that providers would be available to treat them. Managed care approaches attempt to guarantee access to a provider but often in exchange for some limitation on beneficiaries\u2019 freedom of choice. The extent to which state Medicaid managed care programs restrict beneficiaries\u2019 choice of providers determines, in part, whether states will need to seek approval from HCFA to waive one or more provisions of Medicaid law.", "States have three options for using capitated managed care plans in their Medicaid programs\u2014one that requires no waiver of Medicaid statute and two that do. Since the late 1960s, states have had the option\u2014with no need for a waiver\u2014to contract with prepaid managed care plans to deliver health care services to Medicaid beneficiaries, provided certain conditions are met. One is voluntary enrollment: Beneficiaries must ordinarily be permitted to disenroll at any time and return to the Medicaid fee-for-service program. Other conditions relate to such matters as the kinds of plans that can participate: They must be federally qualified or state-certified HMOs, have a mix of enrollment that is no more than 75 percent Medicaid/Medicare enrollees, and engage in a range of quality assurance activities.", "The other options for using managed care exist under waiver authorities granted to the Secretary of HHS. These authorities allow the Secretary to waive certain statutory requirements\u2014including the beneficiaries\u2019 freedom to choose from among participating providers\u2014so that a state can develop alternative methods of service delivery or reimbursement. These waivers are of two general types\u2014program and demonstration.Table 1.2 compares various characteristics of the two types of waivers. Although managed care approaches and mandated enrollment (that is, a program that requires Medicaid participants to select among managed care approaches) can be authorized under either type of waiver, waiving the federal regulations concerning the types and enrollment mix of prepaid organizations can only be done under a demonstration waiver.", "The use of prepaid managed care to provide health care for disabled beneficiaries is also affected by the statutory requirements of other programs besides Medicaid. Specifically, because many disabled Medicaid beneficiaries are simultaneously eligible for one or more other federal programs\u2014most notably Medicare\u2014state prepaid programs must accommodate requirements of these other programs. The Medicare statute, in particular, contains a number of provisions that cannot be waived and that directly affect basic features of Medicaid prepaid care. For example, the Medicare statute requires participating health plans to have an enrollment mix with no more than 50 percent publicly insured enrollees, in contrast to Medicaid\u2019s allowance for up to 75 percent publicly insured members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Applying Managed Care to Disabled Beneficiaries Poses Additional Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Interest in using prepaid managed care programs for disabled Medicaid beneficiaries has prompted concerns about whether this approach is suitable to meet the needs of disabled beneficiaries. One positive viewpoint is that disabled individuals have much to gain from managed care because of its guarantee of access to a primary care practitioner and its potential for coordinating an array of available services. Improved access may particularly benefit segments of the disabled population that have historically been unable to locate practitioners willing to serve them. However, because prepaid plans typically emphasize primary care, limit access to specialty care, and carefully control the utilization of services as ways to control costs and manage care, they are potentially disadvantageous to certain disabled beneficiaries because of their need for extensive services and access to a range of highly specialized providers. For example, compared with nondisabled children in the general population, disabled children use twice as many physician visits and prescribed medications and five times as many other services, such as physical therapy. Among Medicaid children, the average per-person health care costs in 1992 were seven times higher for disabled than for nondisabled children. Other estimates place the per-person cost for moderately disabled individuals at two to three times the cost for nondisabled individuals.", "The \u201cmedical necessity\u201d standards within many prepaid plans are one example of the potential problems that disabled individuals may face, according to advocacy groups. While not unique to prepaid care, these standards often call for \u201csubstantial improvement\u201d or \u201crestoration of function\u201d as conditions for recommending therapies or certain types of medical equipment. However, many disabled people have conditions that preclude making substantial improvement or restoring functions. Advocacy groups worry that medical necessity standards may restrict disabled people from receiving therapy or equipment when they need it basically to maintain their existing level of functioning or to substitute for lost functioning. Advocacy groups have also raised concerns about the potential for managed care plans to disrupt the network of providers that disabled persons have assembled over time.", "Another concern that has been raised about using managed care for disabled people is the potential effect on what could be called the \u201cperverse incentives\u201d inherent in a prepaid managed care approach.While incentives in a fee-for-service system may encourage a provider to deliver too many services, prepaid programs may encourage health plans to deliver fewer, or less expensive, services than enrollees need, such as using a physical therapist skilled in sports medicine rather than in specific disabilities such as spinal abnormalities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on Medicaid and Health Care for Low-Income Families of the Senate Committee on Finance asked us to examine (1) the extent to which states are implementing prepaid Medicaid managed care for disabled beneficiaries and (2) what steps states have taken to safeguard the interests of the three major stakeholder groups\u2014disabled beneficiaries, prepaid health care plans, and the government\u2014with a focus on quality assurance and rate-setting mechanisms.

Specifically, long-term care in Tennessee remains fee-for-service and in Arizona is coordinated by a single contractor\u2014typically a state or county agency\u2014for each county.

Integrating primary and acute care into a single prepaid contract with long-term care presents certain challenges. Among them are the lack of generally accepted standards regarding the use of various long-term care services; prepaid plans\u2019 lack of experience providing long-term care; the potential for the demise of existing community-based providers with experience in delivering such care; and the difficulty in establishing adequate rates for the combined set of services. Concerns about integrating the two types of care include the potential for medically based prepaid plans to emphasize medical technology or institutional care over the social and supportive services that many beneficiaries prefer. In addition, integration raises concerns about who should perform care needs assessments and case management services\u2014state or prepaid plan staff\u2014given the lack of recognized standards for appropriate long-term care and the fact that in such integrated arrangements a single provider is responsible for major portions of an individual\u2019s life needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enrollment of Dually Eligible Individuals Creates Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Another consideration for states with Medicaid managed care initiatives is whether to include beneficiaries who are also eligible for medical services or supplies through another federal program.

In general, state officials cited the inflexibility of Medicare rules as a deterrent to developing a Medicaid prepaid program that includes those dually eligible for Medicare. Including those eligible for other programs gives rise to the need for negotiations and extensive coordination between the Medicaid staff, HCFA, and representatives from plans and other agencies serving those beneficiaries. Table 2.4 provides examples of barriers states encounter when attempting to include dually eligible beneficiaries.", "The nature and extent of coordination barriers between Medicare and Medicaid vary depending on the extent to which states require prepaid plan enrollment and the extent to which Medicare prepaid plans are available. Coordination issues are lessened when dually eligible beneficiaries remain in Medicare fee-for-service care and join a Medicaid prepaid plan for services not covered by Medicare. But coordination issues increase in states where beneficiaries are required to enroll in Medicaid prepaid plans and are to be \u201clocked in\u201d for specified periods. Chief among these are Medicare\u2019s requirement that beneficiaries are free to choose a prepaid plan or to use fee-for-service care and, when in a prepaid plan, are allowed to disenroll at will.

In all 17 states, one or both of these groups of dually eligible individuals may elect to enroll in prepaid plans (see table 2.5). For beneficiaries with Medicare eligibility, 12 states open their Medicaid prepaid programs to participation and 5 do not.

For more than a year before bringing disabled beneficiaries into managed care, Oregon\u2019s Medicaid staff held weekly meetings with health plan representatives, beneficiary representatives, and state social service agencies (from whom most disabled residents received case management services).

They said that once the programs had been implemented, Medicaid staff met routinely with health plan management, medical directors, and advocacy and social service agency representatives to discuss such issues as rates, data reporting, and matters related to health care. These groups sometimes formed subcommittees to study specific problem areas. For example, in Oregon and Arizona the Medicaid and health plan medical directors have subcommittees to develop practice guidelines and study issues concerning disabled children. To date the state and health plan medical directors in Oregon have adopted practice guidelines for preventive care, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and cleft palate.

This reduces the payoff for selecting only the healthiest recipients and provides better assurance that the state is not paying too much for individuals who are relatively healthy or too little for individuals who need such complex and expensive care that health plans are at best unwilling to attract and at worst unwilling or unable to accommodate them.", "However, the actual application of risk-adjustment methods to the development of capitation rates for disabled Medicaid beneficiaries is very limited. To date, only two states (Massachusetts and Ohio) have implemented any risk-adjustment methods, and only one other state (Missouri) has active plans to do so. Other states told us that risk adjustment was too administratively difficult to implement and that they looked to reinsurance to protect plans that experience adverse selection. Reinsurance does not, however, affect plans\u2019 incentive to seek favorable selection."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Risk Adjustment Is Largely Untested for Disabled Enrollees", "paragraphs": ["The three states experimenting with risk-adjusted rates have based their adjustments on a beneficiary\u2019s prior utilization of medical services or a beneficiary\u2019s clinical diagnosis. Researchers point out that such measures may better predict future costs since disabled individuals, compared with the population as a whole, have a higher percentage of their health care costs related to chronic (recurring or consistent) conditions than to acute (random) conditions.

For example, a health plan could be paid a higher-than-average amount if the person spent several days in the hospital in the last year or a lower-than-average rate if the person spent no time in the hospital or did not visit the doctor in the last year.", "To set capitation rates for its disabled population, Ohio is moving forward with a pilot project that uses a beneficiary\u2019s prior utilization (measured in dollars) in the fee-for-service system. This program, called Accessing Better Care, uses eight rate cells for the disabled population. Seven of the cells are based on prior expenditures, and the eighth is for newly eligible beneficiaries. Monthly capitation rates range from $165 (for beneficiaries with prior annual costs of $1,000 or less) to $4,501 (for beneficiaries with prior annual costs of $50,000 or more).

Various methods to identify or classify diagnoses can be used, employing inpatient data, outpatient data, or both.", "Some methods rely on an individual\u2019s primary diagnosis, and others incorporate measures of the severity of the primary diagnosis as well as the existence of secondary diagnoses of conditions that may aggravate the individual\u2019s health status.", "Massachusetts is one of two states working with a diagnosis-based approach. It has identified a few disabling conditions that warrant higher rates and, as a result, has created a three-celled, diagnosis-based risk-adjustment system for its disabled Medicaid population. Severely disabled beneficiaries and those with end-stage AIDS (in both cases meeting clinical criteria detailed by the state and receiving an enhanced benefits package) have capitation rates of about $1,500 and $4,400 per month, respectively, compared with about $500 per month for beneficiaries in the general disabled category.", "Missouri is currently developing a diagnosis-based methodology as part of a prepaid care program for disabled Medicaid beneficiaries scheduled to begin in 1997. Their methodology adjusts the capitation rate paid for an individual recipient according to both the type of diagnosis and its severity. The state identified approximately 400 distinct diagnoses and computed a rate-adjustment factor for each. The rate for an individual is the sum of the adjustment factors for each of the individual\u2019s diagnoses. The methodology accounts for multiple diagnoses: the capitation rate for an individual with diagnoses of muscular dystrophy and mild mental retardation would be higher than the rate for a mildly retarded individual with no additional disabling diagnoses. Table 4.1 shows an initial estimate of the resulting base rate along with a sample of the diagnoses identified and the associated capitation adjustment.", "Although risk-adjustment mechanisms are designed primarily to prevent adverse and favorable selection, implementing a risk-adjustment scheme involves a number of other considerations. Risk-adjustment methodologies must not only be reasonable predictors of future health care costs, they must also be relatively insulated from manipulation by health plans or providers, and they must be feasible in terms of administrative and data requirements.", "To prevent adverse or favorable selection, a risk-adjustment mechanism must be able to predict health care costs. Researchers have demonstrated that prior utilization and diagnosis-based methodologies can both have predictive power superior to that of rates based on eligibility category. Some prior utilization models are able to explain nearly 40 percent of the variation in health care costs for disabled individuals, and diagnosis-based models have been able to explain about 25 percent. However, even the best predictors of health care costs explain less than half the variation in costs of providing care. Plans then still have an incentive to avoid the higher-cost members of a rate cell.", "The basis selected for risk adjustment can affect the behavior of health plans.", "With utilization models that use cost as a measure, health plans have less of an incentive to hold down costs because less efficient health plans may be rewarded with higher capitation rates as participants are characterized as high use. Conversely, a plan that manages its enrollees\u2019 care very efficiently may be penalized with lower capitation rates in the future. Moreover, a prior utilization method based on the number of hospital admissions affects health plan behavior in a different way than one based on the number of days an individual spends in the hospital. In both cases, the health plan could manipulate the measure affecting future rates without necessarily losing much in terms of efficiency.", "With diagnosis-based risk-adjustment methods, \u201cupcoding\u201d exists in which providers and plans record the most severe diagnosis\u2014the diagnosis associated with the greatest capitation adjustment\u2014of those available for an individual\u2019s symptoms. The use of multiple diagnoses as factors in the rate-setting methodology creates a situation in which providers could record unwarranted diagnoses to raise future capitation rates.", "To be useful, risk-adjustment methodologies must also have feasible administrative and data requirements. Measures of health status, collected through surveys, may help predict the need for future health care but may be too administratively burdensome to be practical. Risk-adjustment methods based on information about the use of services are more practical. However, while such information was routinely available in fee-for-service claims, states need a new source, such as encounter data, to classify individuals enrolling in health plans.", "The lack of fee-for-service data is not a problem limited to states that adjust their capitation rates by risk. Any state that moves most or all of its Medicaid population into managed care will find that prior rate-setting methods based on averaging fee-for-service claims will be unsuitable. While rates calculated using older fee-for-service data might be trended forward using any of a variety of factors, over time such trending may cause rates to be unrepresentative of the health care services being used. To address these difficulties, some states are using or evaluating individual-level encounter data as a basis from which they can generate capitation rates in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reinsurance Relieves Financial Pressure on Plans but Not Negative Incentives", "paragraphs": ["State officials we contacted recognized the benefits of prospectively risk-adjusting capitation rates but\u2014with the exceptions of Ohio, Massachusetts, and Missouri\u2014were reluctant to do so in their programs because they felt it was too difficult administratively. Instead, officials rely on reinsurance to decrease the pressure on health plans serving high-cost individuals. With reinsurance, the reinsurer (sometimes the state) protects health plans against adverse selection or unexpectedly high-cost cases. To obtain coverage, the plan pays a reinsurance premium.", "Reinsurance programs come in many forms. Most programs involve a reinsurance threshold, or deductible, with health plans being responsible for all the costs of serving a group or an individual up to that amount. Once the threshold is met, the state shares the cost of treating the group or individual with the health plan. Table 4.2 shows the range of reinsurance options Oregon offers in its current health plan contracts.", "State Medicaid officials told us that, by protecting health plans from extraordinary costs, reinsurance also helps build health plan capacity. For example, new health plans and plans with small enrollments need time to absorb spikes in service costs and the cash flow fluctuations inherent in prepaid managed care. With reinsurance available, these plans can participate and compete in the programs.", "While reinsurance relieves some pressure on health plans faced with expensive cases, it does not remove the negative incentives discussed earlier. Plans still may benefit from enrolling the healthiest eligibles or from underserving the high-cost cases that do enroll. Reinsurance compensates plans only after they lose money on a case or on all their enrollees. While reinsurance may relieve some pressure on plans facing losses, it may not affect the incentives plans create with individual providers to limit services. These incentives set out in the provider\u2019s contract may not automatically adjust when the costs of a provider\u2019s patient reach the reinsurance threshold.", "In some areas, Medicaid managed care reinsurance may not be readily available in the private market and may not be available at all for small health plans. Consequently, state Medicaid agencies become de facto insurance companies with the associated risk and resource requirements. As reinsurers, states face the challenge of setting appropriate reinsurance premiums\u2014inappropriate premiums could lead either to plans paying too much, and thus increasing the pressure to underserve, or plans paying too little, which leaves the state in a money-losing position."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Risk Corridors Have Greatest Impact on Negative Financial Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Five states\u2014the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Ohio, Utah, and Wisconsin\u2014are building risk corridors into their contracts to help mitigate the potentially negative incentives affecting health plans\u2019 treatment of disabled enrollees. Unlike reinsurance, risk corridors work in two directions, sharing both losses and profits with health plans below and above preestablished ratios.", "As the only mechanism that specifically limits health plan profits, risk corridors have the greatest impact on incentives facing health plans to either reach for the lowest-cost recipients in any given rate cell or to underserve the high-cost enrollees they cannot avoid. The point at which profit and loss sharing begins\u2014the width of the risk corridor\u2014varies from state to state, as does the degree to which profits and losses are shared. Table 4.3 shows the risk corridor arrangement Massachusetts has in its current contract with a plan that provides prepaid care for the severely disabled.", "By reducing the potential for profits, the state is affecting implicit health plan calculations regarding the costs and benefits of restricting services. When $1 saved from restricting service translates to $1 of profit, a health plan may be willing to risk losing enrollees who are dissatisfied with health plan service. With risk corridors, however, $1 saved may only translate to 30 or 40 cents in profit, reducing the benefit side of the equation. Because health plans understand how risk corridor arrangements operate before entering into Medicaid prepaid care agreements, corridors also have the unique feature of being a retrospective adjustment with a prospective impact. Risk corridors and their profit limits may affect health plan risk arrangements established with individual providers in a way that reinsurance does not. In their provider contracts, plans may limit the incentives to reduce services when their profits will be limited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Observations, Conclusions, and Comments", "paragraphs": ["Enrolling disabled beneficiaries in prepaid managed care is a growing trend in Medicaid. Moreover, because much of the proposed expansion is directed toward mandatory managed care, the future expansion of prepaid care for disabled Medicaid beneficiaries appears likely to be even more sweeping in its effect. Thus far, two-thirds of the states providing prepaid care for disabled beneficiaries offer it on a voluntary basis. By contrast, 12 of the 13 states with newly approved or pending Medicaid managed care waivers intend to mandate participation by disabled beneficiaries.", "The implications of this shift toward mandatory programs are substantial. Prepaid care has operated in both the public and private arenas as a system based on averages. For example, populationwide averages drive the expectations of what services should be provided and how much they will be used. Likewise, prepaid rates are calculated on average costs, and quality has been monitored, in part, using aggregated average utilization rates. To adequately safeguard the interests of disabled beneficiaries, however, state programs must recognize that these beneficiaries are quite distinct from the general Medicaid population. Not only are their health needs greater than those of the general population, but included among them are a small number of highly vulnerable individuals whose needs are extensive and critical to the prevention of death or further disability. Not addressing these differences heightens the risk that prepaid care plans will try to hold down their costs by (1) discouraging enrollment from high-cost segments of the disabled population or (2) inadequately serving those high-cost beneficiaries they cannot avoid.", "Thus far, actions at the state level do not reflect a widespread acknowledgment of the changes in approach that should occur when applying managed care to disabled beneficiaries rather than the general population. In most states, the level of effort to anticipate and accommodate the needs of the various stakeholder groups (disabled individuals and their advocates, the health care plans, and the government) in their current programs has been limited largely because participation in these programs has been voluntary. The efforts have tended to be most extensive in those few states that have already put mandatory or targeted programs in place.", "No clear blueprint has yet emerged for how to incorporate disabled beneficiaries into Medicaid managed care plans. The limited efforts to date have not been in place long enough to allow definitive conclusions about how effective they are. At this relatively early stage, however, several key areas are emerging that merit consideration by all parties seeking to develop effective prepaid programs. These key areas, and examples of state actions to address them, are illustrated in figure 5.1.", "To date, few states have significant, long-term experience with programs that mandate enrollment by their disabled population. Even fairly extensive experience with voluntary programs may not fully prepare health plans and state officials if, as research suggests, those who select prepaid care in voluntary situations tend to be healthier than those who do not. A state may find it useful to develop and operate a targeted or relatively small-scale program before moving to any large-scale effort to mandate the enrollment of disabled beneficiaries. Small-scale programs would allow health plans, beneficiaries, and state staff to gain experience with meeting the diverse and complex needs of disabled individuals in a prepaid setting.", "For states that elect to move immediately into a large-scale program, the areas shown in figure 5.1 are even more critical. Adequate preparation, consensus-building, and program safeguards assume greater significance when substantial numbers of people are being added, particularly if their ability to change plans readily is limited.", "Understanding the various approaches currently being tried will provide states with a good starting point for planning their own efforts.
