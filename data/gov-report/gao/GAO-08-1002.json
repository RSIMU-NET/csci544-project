During this process, HHS did not fully examine grantees' programs as described in their applications, including the activities they planned to offer, and this created challenges and setbacks for grantees later as they implemented their programs. For example, some grantees told us that they were informed that certain activities were not permitted months into program implementation even though HHS had approved these same activities described in their grant applications. The Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood programs provide similar activities, but their focus and target populations differ. Healthy Marriage programs are more likely to provide marriage and relationship activities, while Responsible Fatherhood programs are more likely to provide parenting skills. Additionally, both programs serve low-income and minority groups, but Healthy Marriage grantees are more likely to target teenaged youth, and Responsible Fatherhood grantees are more likely to target incarcerated parents. Both programs' grantees reported that they refer domestic violence victims to specialists in their communities. HHS uses methods that include site visits and progress reports to monitor grantees, but it lacks mechanisms to identify and target grantees that are not in compliance with grant requirements or are not meeting performance goals, and it also lacks clear and consistent guidance for performing site monitoring visits. Moreover, HHS's ability to readily identify which grantees are not in compliance or not meeting goals is hindered because it currently lacks uniform performance indicators and a computerized management information system that would enable HHS to more efficiently track key information on individual grantees. HHS told us that it is in the process of developing a management information system and has submitted uniform performance indicators for review. HHS has established a rigorous research agenda to gauge the long-term impact of healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood activities on diverse, low-income populations.

With the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), Congress  appropriated $150 million in discretionary grants each year from 2006  through 2010 to implement the Healthy Marriage and Responsible  Fatherhood Initiative (Initiative). The Initiative represents an  unprecedented financial commitment by the federal government to  support marriage and fatherhood programs. The focus of the Healthy  Marriage program is to encourage the formation and maintenance of two- parent households through healthy marriage promotion activities, while  the focus of the Responsible Fatherhood program is to strengthen the role  of the father in a child\u2019s life. The Initiative supports two goals under  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the federally funded  block grant that funds programs designed to help needy families achieve  self-sufficiency. The goals are to prevent and reduce the incidence of out- of-wedlock pregnancies and to encourage the formation and maintenance  of two-parent families. To implement the Initiative, the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) competitively awarded grants to  various organizations to support a broad range of activities to promote  healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood. To address domestic  violence concerns, DRA required all grantees to consult with a domestic  violence expert and to include information on how they will address  domestic violence issues in their grant applications to HHS. It also  required that participation by individuals in the program be voluntary.", "To gain insight into how these programs are being implemented, you  asked that we determine (1) how HHS awarded grants and the types of  organizations that received funding; (2) what activities and services  grantees are providing, including those for domestic violence victims; (3)  how HHS monitors and assesses program implementation and use of  funds, and (4) how program impact is measured.", "To respond to these questions, we conducted a web-based survey of all  122 Healthy Marriage and 94 Responsible Fatherhood grantees that  provide direct services to program participants, asking them to provide  information about various aspects of their programs including the  characteristics of their organization, services they offered, curricula used,  and their process and procedures for identifying domestic violence. Of the  216 grantees to whom we sent our survey, 211 responded for a response  rate of 98 percent. Throughout this report survey results are based on the  number of grantees responding to a particular question. Additionally, to  obtain more in-depth information about services marriage and fatherhood  grantees are providing, we visited 14 grantees in Washington, Oklahoma,  New Mexico, Indiana, Oregon, and the District of Columbia. On 2 of these  visits, we accompanied HHS staff responsible for monitoring grantees. We  selected grantees to achieve variation in geographic location, type of grant  awarded, award amount, services, organization type, and the programs\u2019  target populations. In addition, we conducted telephone interviews with  organizations that were awarded grants to provide technical assistance to  grantees, and help organizations develop fatherhood programs. Moreover,  to understand the criteria HHS used to award grants and the manner in  which HHS monitors and assesses program implementation, we randomly  selected 40 Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood grantee case  files to review. In this review, we examined several documents, including  applications, semiannual progress and financial reports, grantee selection  panel score sheets, and correspondences between grantees and agency  officials. To determine how program impact is measured, we interviewed  organizations that have received contracts to conduct impact evaluations  of Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood interventions and  assessed their methodological approach to measuring impact. We also  interviewed HHS officials about the uniform, program-wide performance  indicators under development and surveyed grantees about how they  measure program performance. We conducted this performance audit  from July 2007 to September 2008, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

With the passage of the Personal Responsibility  and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which established the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, Congress  wrote into law that marriage is the foundation of a successful society and  promotes the interests of children. Congress was, in part, prompted to  address this issue because of what it deemed a \u201ccrisis in our Nation\u201d in the  rate of pregnancies and births to unmarried women. In the legislation,  Congress cited the negative consequences to children that result from  these pregnancies and births, including greater risk for child abuse and  neglect, higher rates of poverty, and lower educational aspirations.", "TANF was reauthorized under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA),  and signed into law in February 2006. DRA appropriated $150 million a  year for 5 years in discretionary grants for the Healthy Marriage and  Responsible Fatherhood Initiative (Initiative). While the Initiative was  established as part of TANF, the nation\u2019s welfare program, it does not  impose income limits for program participants. However, HHS designated  a few priority groups for funding under the Initiative, including  incarcerated fathers and low-income, unwed, expectant or new parents. In  structuring the Initiative, HHS created two distinct grant programs\u2014one  relating to Healthy Marriage and one to Responsible Fatherhood\u2014but with  common aims. The Healthy Marriage program is aimed at encouraging the  formation and maintenance of two-parent households to improve child  well-being through healthy marriage promotion, and the Responsible  Fatherhood program is designed to strengthen the role of the father as a  means of promoting child well-being, specifically within the context of  marriage. HHS has stressed that the overarching Initiative is not designed  to encourage couples to stay in unhealthy marriages.", "In the legislation, Congress prescribed the \u201callowable\u201d activities for the  Initiative (see table 1). Given the broadness of these allowable activities,  HHS developed examples of services grantees could provide, such as  providing after-school programs for high school students and marriage  education courses that incorporate information on financial literacy.  Although providing services to victims of domestic violence is not an  allowable activity (see table 1), organizations were required by DRA to  describe in their grant application how their programs or activities would  \u201caddress\u201d issues of domestic violence, and commit in their application to  consult with experts in domestic violence in developing their programs  and activities. The DRA also required that organizations describe in their  application what they would do to ensure and how they would inform  individuals that participation in programs is voluntary.", "In fiscal year 2007 most of the funding, approximately $113 million, was  used to support Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood  demonstration grants, while the remaining funds were used for research,  technical assistance, administrative costs, and other TANF-related  activities (see fig. 1).", "As part of the agency\u2019s overall research agenda, HHS has sponsored  several impact evaluations of its programs. These evaluations are  considered to be the best method of determining the extent to which the  program, rather than other factors, is causing specific participant  outcomes. Impact evaluations, which are awarded through a competitive  bid process to experienced research firms, often are complex, multiyear  studies that can be difficult and costly to undertake and require particular  attention to both study planning and execution. Moreover, maintaining  proper incentives to obtain and sustain the participation of populations  that do not have financial and familial stability can be challenging. In  previous work, we found that HHS has established a rigorous research  agenda that regularly evaluates how well its programs are working. In  particular, HHS has a diverse research agenda focused on TANF that  includes research on strategies to help low-income individuals gain self- sufficiency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Awarded Grants to a Range of Public and Private Organizations, but the Awards Process Contributed to Challenges for Some Grantees", "paragraphs": ["HHS awarded grants to a range of public and private organizations, but its  awards process later contributed to challenges for these grantees.

Under DRA, which became law in February 2006, HHS  had to award grants in 7 months. Within this time frame, HHS had to  perform several tasks related to the awards process. Specifically, HHS  staff said they developed the grant announcements and the criteria for  selecting grantees under tight time constraints and limited the amount of  time organizations could apply for grants to fewer than the 60 days  recommended in HHS\u2019s policy manual. HHS officials, who told us they had  not expected that more than 1,650 organizations would apply for funding,  hired The Dixon Group, a management consulting firm, to receive  applications, locate grant application reviewers, and assist with reviewer  training. At the same time The Dixon Group was receiving applications,  they also were selecting peer reviewers. Approximately 600 peer reviewers  served on 40 to 50 review panels for 4 weeks during July and August.  While the grant announcements stated that grant application reviewers  should be experts, HHS allowed peer review of the applications and The  Dixon Group and HHS characterized graduate students, professors, and  practitioners as peer reviewers. Further, because individuals who were  experts in the field of marriage and fatherhood applied for the grants, it  limited the pool of available expert reviewers. We reviewed several of the  resumes of the peer reviewers and found that while most had experience  as federal reviewers, their professional and volunteer experiences were  not always directly relevant to marriage and fatherhood services. For  example, one peer reviewer had experience in nursing and another listed  experience as a social studies teacher.", "To determine which organizations would receive funding, HHS developed  guidance that outlined a five-part criteria for most grants, with each  criterion worth a specific amount of points. Reviewers scored  organizations\u2019 applications using the guidance provided by HHS and by  judging how well the applicant responded to each criterion. For example,  a major criterion was the applicant\u2019s \u201capproach,\u201d worth 40 points. For this  criterion, applicants were asked to describe their approach to recruiting  and retaining participants, their proposed activities, and time frames for  accomplishing specific milestones. Applicants also were required to  demonstrate that their proposed activities were consistent with the needs  of their target population and that the rationale for the approach was  based on the demonstrated effectiveness of similar activities. Finally,  under their approach section, applicants also had to describe how they  planned to address issues of domestic violence and ensure voluntary  participation. For the \u201corganizational profile\u201d criterion, worth 20 points,  organizations had to provide information that demonstrated their  qualifications to serve participants, including organizational charts,  financial statements, resumes, letters of support, and the qualifications of  partnering organizations. As part of other criteria, applicants were asked  to provide a budget and budget justification, and information on how they  proposed to measure the outcomes of their programs. Applicants could  receive up to 5 bonus points if they demonstrated prior experience in  developing, implementing, or managing skills-based marriage or  fatherhood education programs. See appendix II for a table of the criteria  used for each type of grant.", "The peer reviewers used these criteria to score applicants, and HHS  ranked the applications based on the scores. With some exceptions,  applications that received the highest scores were awarded grants. HHS  made exceptions to ensure, among other things, that grants were  geographically distributed and reflected a diversity of target populations  and communities served.", "In September 2006, HHS began notifying grantees of their awards, but  experienced a setback when they had to reconvene review panels to  rescore 31 applications. When scoring some applications, some reviewers  incorrectly gave applicants zero points for the \u201capproach\u201d section.  According to the grant announcements, if applicants failed to discuss how  they would inform individuals that program participation was voluntary,  as well as discuss specific issues relating to domestic violence issues, they  would receive no points for the \u201capproach\u201d criterion.

For example, during a site  visit, one grantee reported that it proposed providing services to  unmarried couples in its application and was doing so until HHS informed  them that these services were not allowed under the conditions of their  award. Another grantee told us that it was providing General Educational  Development (GED) education as part of its Healthy Marriage program,  but was later notified that the activity was not allowed. These grantees  were well into program implementation when they were told to  discontinue certain activities. One grantee we visited said it engaged in  activities that were not allowable under the grant for a full year before  being informed by HHS that the activities were not permissible. The  grantee told us that it would have benefited from more timely review and  feedback from HHS. In another case, HHS told a grantee that it would have  to extend the length of its workshops for participants from 60 minutes to  90 minutes to 8 hours, even though the grant application noted that short,  workshops would be provided. To implement this change, the grantee  said it would likely incur additional expenses, such as paying facilitators  for extra time and spending more for rental space.", "HHS told us that it received more applications than expected and this was  the first time it awarded these grants.

However, according to  our survey, while both programs offer many similar activities, Healthy  Marriage programs focus more on those related to marriage and  relationship services, whereas Responsible Fatherhood programs are  more likely to focus on providing services teaching parenting skills.  Specifically, 94 percent of Healthy Marriage grantees, compared to 55  percent of Responsible Fatherhood grantees, reported offering marriage  and relationship activities. During our visits to several Healthy Marriage  grantees, we often observed activities related to marriage and  relationships. For example, we observed a Healthy Marriage workshop  where couples took quizzes to determine how well they knew one another  and then participated in a discussion about commitment, chemistry, and  compatibility. Conversely, 92 percent of Responsible Fatherhood grantees,  compared to 47 percent of Healthy Marriage grantees, reported in our  survey that they provide services related to teaching parenting skills. For  example, a Responsible Fatherhood grantee program we visited included  in its curriculum parenting skills training, such as lessons on a child\u2019s  developmental needs and how to communicate with children of different  ages. In addition, Responsible Fatherhood grantees were more likely than  Healthy Marriage grantees to report that they focused on providing  programs with specific services to help participants achieve economic  stability, including assistance with finding a job. Healthy Marriage grantees  also reported that they focus on economic stability activities, but to a  lesser extent than Responsible Fatherhood programs. According to HHS,  Healthy Marriage grantees can provide these services only within the  context of allowed activities (see table 1). For example, Healthy Marriage  grantees might discuss financial issues as part of marriage and relationship  skills. Depending on the conditions of the award, grantees might provide  more than one of the services or activities listed in figure 2.", "Both Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood grantee programs  offer services for varying lengths of time and in various settings. Some  programs have one intensive session in a lecture setting, while others offer  classroom settings that are more interactive and may be offered for 1 or 2  hours 1 night a week for up to 17 weeks. One grantee program we visited  offered marriage workshops to participants at weekend retreats with paid  lodging, and two Responsible Fatherhood programs we visited included  optional home visits by staff. In addition, some grantees run  advertisements or sponsor advertising campaigns that discuss the  importance of healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood.

Many survey respondents said they developed and used their own  curriculum (41 percent of Healthy Marriage and 47 percent of Responsible  Fatherhood respondents). For example, one grantee we visited said it  developed its own Spanish-language curriculum because the few existing  Spanish-language curricula for Responsible Fatherhood programs did not  meet the specific needs of the Latino population the grantee served. Other  grantees adapt commercially available curricula to meet the needs of  participants. The most-commonly-used, commercially available curriculum  was the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program. This  curriculum focuses on identifying strengths and weaknesses of a marriage,  improving communication skills, and increasing the connection between  the partners. Technical assistance providers make information about  curricula available to grantees on their Web site. A list of curricula used by  multiple grantees is in appendix IV.", "Most grantees\u2014about 93 percent\u2014reported in our survey that they  include information on domestic violence in their programs. For example,  several grantees modified their curriculum to include a discussion of  domestic violence with participants. One survey respondent noted that it  leads a discussion on domestic violence issues that helps participants self- identify and understand domestic violence. During our site visits, some  Healthy Marriage grantees told us that they focus on the characteristics of  a healthy relationship. In addition to discussing topics related to  relationship health and domestic violence awareness, grantees also  distribute informational materials about domestic violence (see fig. 4). For  example, during a site visit to a Healthy Marriage grantee, we observed  classroom instructors distributing pamphlets on recognizing signs of  domestic violence. Handouts include state Directories of Domestic  Violence Support Services; handbooks for domestic violence victims, and  victims\u2019 rights; and pamphlets on topics ranging from \u201crecipes for safety\u201d  to the characteristics of an abusive relationship.", "Additionally, most grantees reported in our survey that they have  protocols for how staff should handle instances where program  participants may be victims of domestic violence, and many grantees train  their staff on identifying signs of domestic violence, as well as on teaching  program participants the signs of unhealthy relationships. Moreover, most  grantees reported that they consult with domestic violence organizations  and refer potential domestic violence victims to them. For example, one  grantee we visited told us that it consulted with two different domestic  violence organizations when designing its Responsible Fatherhood  program. The domestic violence organizations helped the grantee develop  part of a workshop related to domestic violence and also presented  information to program participants. During our site visits, grantees also  told us they refer program participants to domestic violence specialists  when appropriate. For example, one of the grantees we visited said that  when it encountered a potential domestic violence situation, it held a joint  meeting with a caseworker, domestic violence expert, and a family  services coordinator.

Healthy Marriage grantee programs target high school or teenaged youths  at higher rates than Responsible Fatherhood grantee programs, in part,  because education in high schools is one of the Healthy Marriage  program\u2019s allowed activities. On the other hand, Responsible Fatherhood  programs target incarcerated parents, typically fathers, because HHS  designated a portion of the program\u2019s funding for this population. Both  grantee programs allow men and women to participate in their  programs\u2014even though the Responsible Fatherhood programs were  created specifically to target men, they are both open to men and women.  An administrative complaint was filed by a legal advocacy organization  centering on whether women have equal access to the program and  subsequently HHS reminded grantees that the Responsible Fatherhood  programs are open to eligible men and women.", "Grantees use a variety of methods to attract participants to the program.  According to our survey, grantees rely heavily on word of mouth, but they  also attract participants through educational handouts and brochures,  referrals, and advertisements such as promotion campaigns (see fig. 6).

Grantees said that HHS staff typically contact them to notify  them of opportunities for technical assistance, address errors or issues  that arise during review of required programmatic and financial progress  reports, and to notify them of upcoming events. In addition, some grantees  also initiate communication with HHS to ask questions regarding policy, to  request approval for certain activities, or to request budget modifications.", "Semiannually, HHS requires grantees to submit both programmatic and  financial progress reports, which, among other things, provide HHS with  updates on grantees\u2019 progress toward meeting performance goals that  grantees established for themselves in their applications, as well as  provide information on grantees\u2019 compliance with domestic violence and  other HHS policies. For example, some grantees report to HHS on the  number of participants they expect to serve. Some grantees also may  report on the types of activities and participant satisfaction with programs  or services as well as changes in participant behavior before and after  programs. They also may report on any problems they may be  experiencing, including recruiting challenges. Because grantees can set  their own program goals and establish their own measures for these goals,  there is considerable variation among the information being collected.  Financial progress reports contain information, such as financial  statements, that allow HHS to track the use of grant funds. HHS also  monitors grantees\u2019 use of funds by tracking grantees\u2019 draw down of funds.  Specifically, HHS also is able to compare financial progress reports  submitted by grantees with reports from the HHS electronic grant payment  management system to monitor grantees\u2019 withdrawal of funds. For  example, if HHS observes that a grantee has not withdrawn funds  according to its schedule, they will contact the grantee to determine the  reason the grantee has not been withdrawing funds. For grantees that  received federal funds in excess of $500,000, HHS monitors and reviews  audit reports in accordance with the Single Audit Act.

HHS officials told us  that staff responsible for monitoring are to use the legislation, grant  announcements, and site visit protocol as guidance to monitor grantee  performance. Although legislation and grant announcements provide some  general guidance, they do not specifically define what is permitted under  each allowed activity. For example, the grant announcement lists marriage  education as an allowed activity for some grantees, but does not  specifically describe what marriage education activities are permitted  under the grant. We also found the site visit protocol provided by HHS was  limited to a checklist of topics for HHS to cover during grantee site visits.  The checklist did not detail the process, the criteria for conducting  monitoring site visits, or the key items to be examined, leaving each  monitoring staff member the discretion to determine what information to  gather and how best to gather it. Moreover, we found other  inconsistencies in how HHS conducts monitoring visits.

According to HHS officials,  HHS staff are required only to observe services if the timing of the visit  coincides with services, but they are not required to schedule monitoring  site visits to coincide with sessions. Because some HHS officials do not  observe grantees providing services, they cannot confirm that the services  are in fact being provided or that the funding is being spent as intended.", "The lack of sufficient guidance from HHS may have led HHS staff to  inconsistently apply HHS policy among some grantees. For example, through  our interviews and file review, we found that some monitoring staff members  allowed several Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood grantees to  use incentives to retain program participants, while others were told they  were not permitted to use similar incentives. From our review of grantee files,  we found instances where HHS staff worked with grantees to adjust or lower  the goals they developed for themselves to meet second-year targets. Other  grantees who did not meet their year-1 performance goals were not permitted  to adjust their performance targets. In another example, HHS officials told us  that abstinence education was not allowable under the Healthy Marriage  program, but we observed during our site visits and review of grantee data  several Healthy Marriage grantees operating programs that focused on  abstinence education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS\u2019s Ability to Target Grantees Not in Compliance with Grant Requirements or Not Meeting Performance Goals Is Hindered by the Lack of an Effective Management Information System", "paragraphs": ["The lack of an effective management information system that captures key  information on individual grantees hinders HHS\u2019s ability to appropriately  identify which grantees are not in compliance with grant requirements or are  not meeting performance goals. Although it maintains paper files on each  grantee, the breadth and detail in these files vary considerably. For example,  some HHS staff keep very detailed logs on grantees, while others maintain  minimal records. Moreover, the information in these files is not always used  to target grantees in need of assistance or to identify how grantees are using  their funds. For example, one grantee used grant funds to provide marriage  education services not allowed under its grant to participants. Although  information such as how grantees are using their funds should be contained  in the files, the grantee in this instance was notified months after initiating  services that the program was not allowed, causing the grantee to use  alternative sources of funding to provide services. Moreover, through our  case studies, we found instances where grantees did not receive timely  feedback on progress reports, documents that are part of the files HHS  maintains on individual grantees. These files provide an early alert to  problems grantees may be experiencing and could potentially identify  grantees at risk of not meeting performance goals. Despite HHS having this  information, some grantees told us that they did not receive timely feedback  from HHS, causing them setbacks in implementing program activities.", "Without an effective management information system, HHS has not been able  to take a strategic approach to conducting grantee site visits and other  monitoring activities. Although HHS told us that grantees experiencing  challenges should receive priority for site visits, our review of a random  sample of grantee files showed that several grantees were having difficulty  recruiting participants, yet HHS did not always give them priority for on-site  review. Moreover, during our site visits, some grantees told us they were  experiencing difficulty meeting participation goals or recruiting the number of  participants they indicated to HHS they would serve through their program.  These grantees also were not targeted specifically for on-site monitoring.  Specifically, the decision of which grantees to visit and in what order was left  to the discretion of HHS staff, according to HHS officials. Because grantees  that were experiencing challenges did not always receive priority for  monitoring site visits and these site visits were scheduled based on HHS staff  scheduling preferences, we found that monitoring was not always based on  grantee risk or need.", "HHS told us it is in the process of developing a database that will help it  standardize and combine grantee communications and performance  information. According to HHS, the first phase of the web-based  management information system has been completed. The system is  designed to replace the paper files and, according to HHS, will  considerably reduce or eliminate inconsistencies in HHS\u2019s recordkeeping.  The management information system will capture performance indicators  developed by the grantee and submitted semiannually in grantee  programmatic progress reports, such as grantees\u2019 progress toward meeting  participant recruitment goals and changes in participant behavior. The  new system should allow HHS to better manage and search for grantee  information, upload grantee communications, and track data from grantee  programmatic progress reports. It is not clear, however, when HHS will be  able to include uniform performance indicators that it plans to collect  from individual grantees. HHS officials told us that performance indicators  have been developed, but are pending implementation while they are  currently under review by the Office of Management and Budget. HHS said  it anticipates having grantees begin collecting data in autumn or early  winter of 2008, the start of the third year of funding for the 5-year  initiative. According to HHS, the uniform performance indicators will  eventually be part of its planned management information system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Long-term Research Underway Intended to Assess Program Impact", "paragraphs": ["HHS has four multiyear studies of marriage and fatherhood programs  underway that are intended to assess the impact of the programs on  various populations and understudied groups, the final results of which  are expected between 2011 and 2013. Funded partially by the DRA, HHS  awarded contracts to three organizations\u2014RTI International; Mathematica  Policy Research; and MDRC\u2014that competitively bid to conduct the  evaluations, which run over several years and across several marriage or  fatherhood programs. Two of the impact studies will exclusively follow  grantees funded under the Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood  Initiative, while the other two studies will follow a mix of grantees and  healthy marriage programs not funded under the Initiative. In all cases, the  programs being studied primarily offer participants skills-based marriage  or fatherhood education. The primary focus of HHS\u2019s research is to  determine the impact, if any, marriage and fatherhood programs have on  couples, families, and fathers as a result of participation in the programs.  Impact evaluations are the strongest method for assessing the efficacy of a  program because they allow for a comparison between similar groups that  differ only with respect to whether they received a service or \u201ctreatment.\u201d  However, they often are difficult and expensive to conduct because they  take years to complete and it often is difficult to retain enough participants  to produce meaningful results. Prior research has focused on the impact of  marriage services on middle-income families and couples. A review of the  literature, sponsored by HHS, on the overall impact of marriage and  relationship programs found that, on average, middle-income couples  receiving services showed increased relationship satisfaction and  improved communication skills. HHS\u2019s research agenda represents the  first major federal effort to study the impact of healthy marriage and  responsible fatherhood programs on low-income populations and is part of  a wider body of research being developed by HHS.", "Two of the three healthy marriage studies\u2014the Building Strong Families  (BSF) and the Supporting Healthy Marriage (SHM) evaluations\u2014focus on  low-income couples who are expecting or have recently had a child. The BSF  is following 5,103 low-income unmarried couples across seven marriage  programs around the time of the birth of a child using data collected at three  stages of participants\u2019 lives. The SHM study is examining the effects of  healthy marriage programs on 6,860 married couples across eight marriage  programs. The third healthy marriage study\u2014the Community Healthy  Marriage Initiative\u2014expands its focus beyond specific target populations to  entire communities: the initiative is comparing couples in three different  geographic communities with federally funded healthy marriage programs\u2014 Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Dallas, Texas; and St. Louis, Missouri\u2014with three  demographically similar communities\u2014Cleveland, Ohio; Ft. Worth, Texas;  and Kansas City, Missouri\u2014where there are no federally funded healthy  marriage programs. The study, which involves 4,200 participants, will explore  whether the presence of intensive healthy marriage programs promotes  changes in attitudes and behavior toward marriage in the communities being  studied. In addition to the three healthy marriage evaluations, HHS also is  funding an impact evaluation of Responsible Fatherhood programs. The  National Evaluation of the Responsible Fatherhood, Marriage and Family  Strengthening Grants for Incarcerated and Re-entering Fathers and Their  Partners (MFS-IP) began in 2006, when the first year of Responsible  Fatherhood funds became available, and is currently enrolling participants.  The MFS-IP, much like the three marriage studies, will explore changes in  couple quality and changes in attitudes toward marriage. In addition, the  MFS-IP will assess changes in outcomes for employment and economic  stability, in line with the parameters of activities allowed under the legislation  for Responsible Fatherhood grantees (see fig. 8).", "For all four studies, evaluators will collect outcome data for the couples  participating in programs at various stages of the study and then compare  the results against groups of couples who did not participate in the  programs. Because the two groups are, by nature of the study design,  similar in every major respect, any differences between the two groups  can be attributed to the program. The evaluators for the four studies  differed on the methods they used to create these two groups. Two of the  four studies, the BSF and the SHM, randomly assign couples to either a  group that receives services (the experimental group) or group that does  not (the control group). The other two studies are quasi-experimental.  This type of study uses methods other than random assignment to create a  comparison group, such as selecting a set of individuals who have similar  characteristics to the group receiving the program services under study.", "To compare these groups in the four studies over time, the evaluators are  conducting surveys and interviews, generally 1 year and 3 years after  participating in a program, in order to gauge couples\u2019 and families\u2019  outcomes. The surveys ask questions about how couples are  communicating after participating in a program; whether they are using  the skills they learned in the program; and how they would rate, overall,  the quality of their relationship since participating in the program. The  evaluators also will administer the same surveys to the couples not  participating in Healthy Marriage or Responsible Fatherhood programs in  order to make comparisons between the two groups. For example, the  BSF study will examine a range of outcomes, including whether marriage  services improved marital relationships, reduced marital instability, and  improved child well-being.", "In general, we found the evaluations to be well-designed and rigorous,  however, there are inherent difficulties presented by the Community  Healthy Marriage Initiative, which assesses the impact of healthy marriage  programs on entire geographic areas. Specifically, it may be difficult to find  and study true comparison communities. One positive feature of the study is  the collection of baseline data for each of the participating communities;  however, it is difficult to determine if the contractors have captured and  controlled for the important variables needed to match the communities. In  addition, it will be difficult to determine if changes in the community stem  from Healthy Marriage program services or some other factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Marriage and fatherhood programs have emerged as a national strategy for  improving the well-being of children. The federal government has committed  $150 million annually for 5 years for these programs and provided for an  evaluation the Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood Initiative to  determine how well the Initiative is working for low-income populations.  While HHS has made an effort to visit nearly all of the programs in their first 2  years of operations, absent mechanisms for detecting grantee compliance and  performance issues, some grantees did not receive monitoring and technical  assistance soon enough and had to make modifications to their program well  into implementation. Moreover, effective monitoring was hampered by a lack  of an effective management information system that captures key  information, including uniform performance indicators for grantees, and the  lack of consistent and clear monitoring guidance.

In its comments, HHS states that it  has already developed and implemented this portion of the recommendation,  including developing a customized approach to prioritizing site visits and  technical assistance. However, HHS caveats that only the first phase of its  web-based management information system has been completed and that  performance indicators that would help them identify those grantees at risk,  are still awaiting approval by OMB.

As we stated in our report, this protocol  was limited to a checklist of topics to be covered during the site visit and did  not describe the process to be followed or criteria to be used to monitor  grantees. Moreover, the lack of clarity in this protocol may have contributed  to the inconsistencies in how site visits were administered by HHS staff, as  noted in our report.", "HHS also stated in its response that fiscal oversight or monitoring a  grantee\u2019s fiscal compliance can be used as an alternative mechanism to  confirm whether grantees are providing services or spending funds as the  grant intended. While we agree that monitoring grantee\u2019s fiscal compliance  is essential, HHS\u2019s comments do not change our view that observing  activities is critical to confirming that grantees are actually providing  services as intended by the grant.", "Finally, HHS commented on our finding that some grantees were operating  programs focused on abstinence education. HHS stated that it is  impermissible to use Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) funding for abstinence  education, however, grantees may use funding from other sources to  provide abstinence education through programs separate from the Healthy  Marriage and Fatherhood programs. We visited one such program whose  staff told us that they used DRA funding to support their abstinence  education program and that abstinence education was not provided as a  single lesson, but was the focus of the entire curriculum.", "HHS also provided technical changes to a draft of the report, which we  incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date.

We took steps in  developing the questionnaire, collecting the data, and analyzing them to  minimize such nonsampling error. For example, prior to launching our  survey, we worked with social science survey specialists to develop the  questionnaire and minimize error. We tested the content and format of the  questionnaire with multiple grantees prior to administering the survey to  address issues such as differences in question interpretation, and  differences in data tracking.

Further, the final pretests were performed using the Web-based survey  tool, which checked for accuracy and usability. To ensure grantees  responded to the survey, we sent e-mail reminders and conducted follow- up telephone calls with nonrespondents.
