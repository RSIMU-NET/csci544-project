After initial U.S. emergency relief, in October 2004 Congress appropriated $100 million in supplemental funding, primarily for Grenada, Jamaica, and Haiti, which were significantly affected. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), leader of the U.S. recovery programs, agreed, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, to complete the programs by December 31, 2005, giving the agency a 1-year time frame. GAO was asked to (1) review the nature and status of the programs in Grenada, Jamaica, and Haiti as of December 31, 2005; (2) identify factors that affected the programs' progress; and (3) assess USAID's use of guidance and lessons learned from previous similar programs and efforts to draw lessons from the current programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of December 31, 2005, USAID had spent about 77 percent of funds allocated for assistance in Grenada, Jamaica, and Haiti and completed many disaster recovery activities, such as providing business and agriculture grants. However, the agency significantly reduced its targets for building and repairing houses, in part because of cost increases, and granted contractors extensions to complete some of these projects. Severe weather delayed the progress of recovery activities in Jamaica and Haiti--for example, two hurricanes in the summer of 2005 disrupted Jamaican housing repairs. In addition, difficulty coordinating activities with the Grenadian and Jamaican governments hampered housing construction. Further, other construction-related challenges--for example, shortages of cement--delayed projects in Grenada and Jamaica. Finally, frequent security problems in Haiti hindered contractors' progress. USAID has not issued guidance that incorporates lessons learned from previous recovery and reconstruction programs, such as ways to mitigate challenges commonly faced in rebuilding after disasters. USAID staff inexperienced with disaster recovery efforts said that this made it difficult to design and implement the programs. Further, in agreeing to complete the programs within 1 year, USAID faced challenges in designing a broad spectrum of activities that would help rebuild residents' lives and that could be sustained after the programs ended. In addition, the agency did not adopt recommendations from GAO and USAID reviews of past recovery programs that could have helped it more rapidly hire and transfer staff for the Caribbean programs. Although the agency contracted with a management firm to quickly staff its program in Grenada and Jamaica, this led to additional challenges, such as confusion about the management firm's roles and responsibilities in relation to USAID staff and other contractors. USAID staff and contractors are recording lessons learned from the programs in each country."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In September 2004, Hurricane Ivan struck several Caribbean islands,  including Grenada and Jamaica, where it killed 59 people and inflicted  damage of about $1.4 billion. In the same month, Tropical Storm Jeanne  struck parts of Haiti with heavy rains, causing flash floods that killed more  than 2,000 people, affected an estimated 300,000 others through loss of  homes, schools, and livelihoods, and caused an estimated $300 million in  damage. The United States and other donors responded initially to these  disasters by providing emergency relief, such as food, water, medical  supplies, and temporary shelter. In October 2004, recognizing the need for  longer-term recovery and reconstruction assistance, Congress passed a  supplemental appropriation allocating $100 million for additional  hurricane recovery efforts in the Caribbean. The U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID), designated to lead the U.S.-funded  assistance, initiated the Hurricane Ivan Recovery and Rehabilitation  Program (Hurricane Ivan Program) in Grenada and Jamaica and the  Tropical Storm Jeanne Recovery Program (Tropical Storm Program) in  Haiti in January 2005. Following discussions with the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), USAID agreed to complete the programs  by December 31, 2005\u2014that is, within 1 year of initiating the programs;  this time frame is shorter than for previous USAID disaster recovery and  reconstruction programs, such as USAID\u2019s program in Central America  following Hurricane Mitch. In addition, instead of transferring or directly  hiring staff, as it has done in the past, USAID hired a management firm,  Wingerts Consulting, to quickly staff and establish the programs in  Grenada and Jamaica.", "Having previously examined U.S. efforts to provide disaster recovery  assistance, we were asked to monitor USAID\u2019s delivery of the assistance  in the Caribbean.

In Haiti, supplemental funds aimed to meet the immediate  needs of Haitians affected by the tropical storm, help them regain sources  of economic activity, and help them prepare for future natural disaster  threats.

We visited a total of 37 non-construction-related  sites to observe USAID\u2019s progress and interview beneficiaries.

In addition, in Haiti, USAID also helped communities clear   away flood debris and take steps to prevent similar disasters in the future.  Following are descriptions of several USAID nonconstruction activities in  the three countries:  In Grenada, USAID provided grants averaging about $6,300 to small  businesses (those with 5 to 24 employees) and grants averaging about  $15,000 to medium-sized businesses (those with 25 to 75 employees) to  reimburse them for hurricane-related repairs. We visited five grant  recipients, each of whom reported using the grants to pay for repairs or  purchase equipment. According to a survey conducted by the contractors  that implemented these grants, about half of the businesses receiving  assistance estimated that they reopened at least 6 months sooner than if  they had had to finance the repairs themselves. Fisherfolk received grants  averaging about $1,900 to replace fishing gear and equipment and repair  boats. Many of the farmers and fisherfolk also received technical  assistance\u2014for example, farmers were taught techniques for turning  backyard yam production into commercial production.", "In Jamaica, USAID grants to poultry farmers allowed them to buy egg  grading and cold storage equipment, which in turn will enable them to  increase production and incomes. We visited six horticultural farmers who  received grants from USAID consisting of a technology package, such as  seedling nurseries, drip irrigation systems, or integrated pest management  systems. According to USAID staff, they were able to provide an  unexpectedly large number of grants (11,478 versus the revised target of  2,451) to small and medium-size enterprises because the implementing  team decided to make several grants to individual beneficiaries as an  incentive for beneficiaries to continue to adopt various new technologies  and practices. According to a November 2005 USAID report, agricultural  production for farmers who received grant and technical assistance  through the program was estimated to have increased by 41 percent  compared with pre-Hurricane Ivan production levels. USAID also  conducted workshops that taught artisans how to improve and develop  products, procure goods and services, and package and label their  merchandise. In addition, fisherfolk in Jamaica received grants and  disaster preparedness training. For example, training courses in \u201cSafe  Seamanship and Environmental Management\u201d were delivered to 295  fisherfolk.", "In Haiti, USAID cleared streets of mud and improved urban drainage that  had been damaged from flooding. In addition, USAID implemented a cash- for-work program that paid local workers about $2 per day for assisting  with various activities throughout the program, including road and schools  repair, mud removal, and clearing of urban drains (see fig. 4). Further,  USAID funded training in disaster preparedness and response that,  according to a report by a USAID contractor, aimed to \u201craise disaster  awareness, reduce risks, and prepare for contingencies in vulnerable local  communities and municipalities.\u201d Among the topics covered were forming  community emergency response teams, designating first responders to  coordinate emergency activities, and developing risk management and  mitigation plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID Began Many Construction-Related Projects but Did Not Complete All", "paragraphs": ["USAID initiated construction-related projects to repair or replace  hurricane and storm-damaged structures in each of the three countries.  However, USAID contractors did not complete a number of these projects,  although USAID reduced its targets for many of the projects. According to  USAID staff and contractors, rising costs in all three countries were a  factor in USAID\u2019s decision to reduce construction targets. According to an  April 2006 Regional Inspector General (RIG) audit of the Hurricane Ivan  Program, the high cost of housing construction was due, in part, to the  contractor\u2019s unfamiliarity with the local market, which led to the  negotiation of unfavorable subcontracts. The report also indicated that the  cost of houses financed by USAID in Grenada was 37 percent to 49 percent  higher than comparable houses built by the Grenadian Housing Authority;  and, in Jamaica, USAID-funded houses were more than double the cost of  houses built by the Jamaican government. In addition, in Haiti, USAID staff  indicated that a detailed needs survey found that the costs of material and  labor needed to make repairs had more than doubled since the initial  estimates.

In Haiti, USAID granted the contractor an 18-month extension in  September 2005 to complete major infrastructure repair on a road and  bridge; however, USAID officials managing the program said they  expected to complete these activities by June 2006.", "In Grenada and Jamaica, USAID\u2019s construction efforts have focused  primarily on repairing and rebuilding houses and building new homes, and  in Haiti, on repairing infrastructure, public facilities, and houses.  Following are descriptions of several of USAID\u2019s construction-related  projects.", "In Grenada, USAID is building 55 new houses on the sites of homes that  had been destroyed by the hurricane. The new houses consist of lumber  over a concrete slab and include septic systems and electrical  connections. Of the 55 homes, 36 have an area of 400 square feet and 19  have an area of 650 square feet, with the size of the house depending on  the size of the household. We visited 11 housing construction sites in  August 2005 and revisited five of them in December, at which time, for the  most part, construction was just beginning. In addition, USAID has  initiated repairs of houses, tourist sites, and schools, among other  buildings (see fig. 5).", "In Jamaica, USAID is constructing 220-square-foot concrete-block houses  in two sites provided by the Jamaican government. The Jamaican Office of  National Reconstruction agreed to provide septic systems and electrical  connections for the houses. Most of the beneficiaries are families whose  houses were destroyed by the hurricane because they were close to the  shore; the new housing sites are near the old sites but a safe distance from  the shoreline. We visited the two sites in the early stages of construction  and several months later, after construction had begun. As of January  2006, construction was well under way in the two communities, but none  of the houses were complete.", "In Haiti, USAID funded the construction of a bridge and the repair of a  national road that runs from Gonaives to Cap-Haitien.

Grenada lacked a central  coordinating agency immediately following the hurricane to facilitate  disaster recovery within the country. Because USAID has no mission in  Grenada, staff and contractors had to work with various government  ministries to initiate the recovery process. To address the lack of a central  agency, USAID and other donors provided funds to help Grenada establish  the Agency for Reconstruction and Development to coordinate donor  hurricane recovery efforts; however, establishing the agency took several  months, contributing to delays in certain activities, such as developing  criteria for, and identifying, beneficiaries to receive housing repairs and  reconstruction.", "Coordination challenges in Jamaica.

In Grenada, disruptions following the hurricane, as  well as the island\u2019s relatively remote location, led to shortages of  construction materials that periodically delayed housing repairs and new  housing construction. According to USAID, obtaining building materials in  Grenada became more challenging following Hurricane Emily in 2005. In  Jamaica, according to USAID, increased duties on imported cement, heavy  rains that soaked the cement quarries, and a labor strike that occurred in  the country\u2019s only cement factory led to shortages that delayed housing  repairs and construction. As of March 2006, USAID reported that  construction in Jamaica continued to be slowed by a shortage of cement  because the production site that supplies the region shut down after  producing low-quality cement.", "Difficulty in establishing land titles. In Grenada, difficulties in  establishing land title or ownership caused construction delays. A USAID  housing contractor in Grenada told us that although it originally identified  400 to 500 prospective beneficiaries who met selection criteria established  by the Grenadian government, many of these people lacked the land titles  or proof of ownership, which USAID required of new-housing  beneficiaries. Because the process of verifying ownership was so time  consuming, the contractor eventually ran advertisements soliciting  respondents who met the selection criteria and had proof of land  ownership.", "Delays in obtaining bank guarantees. In Haiti, delays encountered by  contractors seeking bank guarantees contributed to implementation  delays of some construction projects. USAID staff in Haiti explained that  the agency requires construction contractors to provide a bank guarantee  in order to receive advance disbursements to buy materials and pay for  labor, which USAID officials said is common commercial practice.  However, Haiti\u2019s economic situation made it difficult for local contractors  to obtain bank guarantees, even when the contractors were reputable and  had a valid contract with an international organization. Because  contractors could not begin work without the guarantees, some  construction activities were delayed. For example, according to USAID  officials, one highway construction contractor lost a month and a half of  work time and another contractor lost 2 months while obtaining bank  guarantees.", "NGO-related and subcontractor challenges. In Grenada, contractors  encountered challenges in working with local NGOs and subcontractors.  The implementing contractor in Grenada relied on NGOs to help identify  people who met government criteria to receive housing support. However,  according to the contractor, the NGOs had difficulty quickly selecting  beneficiaries and, as a result, housing construction was delayed. In  Jamaica, USAID worked with NGOs to perform housing repairs. According  to USAID staff, it was difficult to attract NGOs that could fulfill the  agency\u2019s documentation and reporting requirements in order to receive  grants for the housing repairs.

In addition, attacks on port officials prompted them to strike  for better security, and sometimes delayed distribution of materials.  USAID officials told us that the lack of security required USAID\u2019s  contractors to take precautionary measures, such as daily monitoring of  the security situation, and invest additional resources to protect staff and  activity sites before undertaking activities. In addition, security concerns  led to the temporary evacuation of most direct-hire USAID staff from Haiti  during the summer of 2005.

However, our recent interviews with USAID staff and contractors, as well  as previous GAO work, suggests that in agreeing to the December 31, 2005,  deadline, USAID faced a trade-off in trying to complete a broad spectrum  of activities within the 1-year time frame and ensure that activities  supported through these programs have the intended impact in helping  beneficiaries recover, rebuild, and find jobs in the postdisaster  environment and can be sustained by host government staff after the  programs end.", "In Grenada, USAID provided training in various trades and also paid  participants a stipend while they attended 6-week courses.

Another agency  said future projects should have follow-on activities to assess the  implementation of technical guidance and training provided.

In its April 2006 follow-up audit, the RIG noted that  the Wingerts oversight model was problematic in that USAID\u2019s other  contractors were not accustomed to having Wingerts perform functions  that USAID staff would normally perform, and as a result, working  relationships were uncomfortable.", "Although USAID staff and contractors reported some challenges in  working with Wingerts, USAID officials in Jamaica noted that the mission  has benefited by engaging a contracting firm to fulfill specific functions,  rather than hiring staff.

The information on foreign law in this report does not reflect our  independent legal analysis but is based on interviews and secondary  sources. After our initial monitoring trip to Haiti, our ability to travel there  was curtailed when, because of security concerns, the U.S. Department of  State restricted country access to emergency personnel only.

Disaster recovery program time frames  should be based on a needs assessment of the activities that best aid  recovery and should be undertaken in phases, if necessary. In our 2002  report on USAID\u2019s Hurricane Mitch and Georges recovery program,  various agency officials said the program\u2019s time frame influenced how  planning, design, and implementation of recovery activities affected  program sustainability. For example, the Dominican Republic mission  reported that it selected some activities it knew could be completed by the  expenditure deadline despite recognizing that other activities may have  achieved greater sustainability, especially those with more cost sharing  with the host government and other implementing organizations. Other  agency officials involved in the recovery suggested that future efforts  include time for follow-on activities, such as training, to ensure better  sustainability. USAID staff and contractors implementing the Caribbean  programs\u2019 activities discussed in this report stated that the 1-year time  frame influenced the types of activities they selected and may have limited  the sustainability of some projects. One contractor explained that in a  previous program, activities were divided into different phases (e.g.,  immediate recovery activities were implemented in less than 1 year, while  road construction was given a 1.5-year time frame and railroad  reconstruction was planned for 2 years but completed in 3). In the  Hurricane Ivan Program, USAID was able to identify beneficiaries for  business and agriculture recovery grants and expend the majority of  program funds allocated to these activities within a 1-year time frame,  while reconstruction of houses in Jamaica and Grenada required an  extension several months beyond December 31, 2005. Based on their  experience in the Hurricane Mitch and Georges recovery program, USAID  officials designing and implementing the Tropical Storm Program in Haiti  said that program staff should not attempt to complete activities in an  arbitrarily short time frame. USAID staff and contractors we interviewed  stated that 15 to 18 months is a more reasonable time frame for  reconstruction activities.", "Conduct thorough cost assessments. USAID should ensure that initial cost  estimates are based on specific information about site conditions. Due to  inadequate estimates in the Caribbean programs regarding the cost of  labor and materials for reconstruction activities, USAID originally targeted  an unrealistically high number of activities that later had to be reduced.  Part of this lesson includes anticipating increases in construction  materials and labor due to increases in demand for construction after a  disaster. For example, in Indonesia, USAID\u2019s initial cost estimates for a  road to be rebuilt after the tsunami were based on limited information  about site conditions. Because of the uncertainty about the site conditions,  the Army Corps of Engineers included a 20 percent contingency in its cost  estimate. However, actual costs may still exceed this estimate because  plans for the road have changed.", "Look beyond restoration of the status quo and aim to improve  infrastructure and livelihood opportunities. In the planning of  Hurricanes Mitch and Georges recovery efforts, the U.S. and its  international partners agreed on an approach that would not simply  replace what was destroyed, but would \u201cbuild back better\u201d with a lasting  impact. This approach was adopted in the Caribbean programs. For  example, in the rehabilitation of schools, USAID repaired schools to their  pre-Ivan condition or better in compliance with the building codes and  hurricane resistance standards. In Haiti, USAID also provided household  restoration grants as well as created a cash-for-work program to help  those affected by the storm to rebuild their livelihoods and decrease their  vulnerability to future floods.", "Establish a host government agency to coordinate the international  response to the disaster. USAID worked with the governments of Grenada  and Jamaica to establish independent coordination entities separate from  those countries\u2019 ministries to facilitate the recovery process and  streamline working with the government. A central agency to coordinate  disaster recovery between donors is important for ensuring that activities  are not duplicated; however, USAID and other donors should take into  account the time needed to establish these agencies when developing  implementation schedules and setting program completion time frames.  For example, USAID reported that the Agency for Reconstruction in  Development in Grenada, funded by USAID and other donors, did not take  over coordination responsibilities until March 2005, about 3 months into  USAID\u2019s program. In Jamaica, USAID coordinated with the Office for  National Reconstruction to identify recipients for recovery assistance as  well as to build new housing communities. The Indonesian government  established the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency to coordinate  the international response to the tsunami. The entity has produced a  master plan for reconstruction that it has used to attempt to control and  track organizations involved in reconstruction.", "Channel assistance through organizations and contractors with proven  track records and a history of working in the affected country. USAID  officials administering Haiti\u2019s Tropical Storm Jeanne Recovery Program  reported that they selected contractors that had a history of working there  as a means of strengthening coordination and ensuring implementation of  program activities. This was particularly critical given Haiti\u2019s security  challenges and USAID\u2019s inability to travel to many of the project sites  regularly. In El Salvador, USAID contracted with at least five private  voluntary organizations that it had previously worked with to implement  earthquake recovery projects. According to USAID officials, using  organizations that have proven to be capable and reliable reduces the  likelihood of misuse of funds and corruption.", "Involve community-based organizations in program implementation.  Noting that this was a successful approach in Hurricane Georges, USAID  officials in Haiti worked with community-based organizations in  implementing the Tropical Storm Jeanne Recovery Program. For example,  one contractor worked with local management committees it had worked  with during a previous program in Gonaives several years before. These  groups were one of the few functioning civil society organizations in  Gonaives immediately after the flooding and served as program partners  and liaisons on community issues, security, and sustainable maintenance  efforts. Another contractor worked with already existing water user  groups organized around irrigated parcels in the Plaine des Gonaives and  Trois Rivieres areas. The use of community-based organizations also  allowed the contractor to mobilize the local population rapidly to execute  short-term employment generation activities, such as tertiary roads and  ravine protection structures. In addition, school rehabilitation frequently  was organized around parent and teacher groups that supported the  school in preflood periods.", "Avoid overlap between host governments and community-based  organizations to avoid inefficiencies.

In its  April 2005 report, the Regional Inspector General recommended that  USAID staff responsible for the Hurricane Ivan Program monitor the  program by maintaining a spreadsheet of target due dates for each activity  and verify that all activities are completed on time. USAID provided  monthly reports of its Caribbean recovery efforts that summarized the  progress of program activities, challenges in implementing and completing  activities, and the programs\u2019 expenditures to date. According to USAID  officials responsible for the Hurricane Ivan Program, the contractor hired  to assist with oversight, Wingerts Consulting, played a role in ensuring  regular and timely progress reporting and program analysis, including  capturing cross-country and cross-program implementation issues, and  providing program-level financial analyses. USAID also reported that  Wingerts conducted various site visits and served as a liaison between  USAID\u2019s technical staff and implementing contractors to better assess the  status of activities \u201con the ground\u201d and report back to the mission, the  bureau, and other stakeholders.
