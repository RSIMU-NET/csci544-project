GAO's audit used a case study approach to focus on controls over three key areas: processes, people (human capital), and automated systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The processes and automated systems relied on to provide active duty pays, allowances, and tax benefits to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers are so error-prone, cumbersome, and complex that neither DOD nor, more importantly, Army Reserve soldiers themselves, could be reasonably assured of timely and accurate payments. Weaknesses in these areas resulted in pay problems, including overpayments, and to a lesser extent, late and underpayments of soldiers' active duty pays and allowances at eight Army Reserve case study units. Specifically, 332 of 348 soldiers (95 percent) we audited at eight case study units that were mobilized, deployed, and demobilized at some time during the 18-month period from August 2002 through January 2004 had at least one pay problem. Many of the soldiers had multiple problems associated with their active duty pays and allowances. Some of these problems lingered unresolved for considerable lengths of time, some for over 1 year. Further, nearly all soldiers began receiving their tax exemption benefit at least 1 month late. These pay problems often had a profound adverse impact on individual soldiers and their families. For example, soldiers were required to spend considerable time, sometimes while deployed in remote, hostile environments overseas, seeking help on pay inquiries or in correcting errors in their active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits. The processes in place to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers, involving potentially hundreds of DOD, Army, and Army Reserve organizations and thousands of personnel, were deficient with respect to (1) tracking soldiers' pay status as they transition through their active duty tours, (2) carrying out soldier readiness reviews, (3) after-the-fact report reconciliation requirements, and (4) unclear procedures for applying certain pay entitlements. With respect to human capital, weaknesses identified at our case study units included (1) insufficient resources allocated to key unit-level pay administration responsibilities, (2) inadequate training related to existing policies and procedures, and (3) poor customer service. Several automated systems issues also contributed to the significant pay errors, including nonintegrated systems and limited processing capabilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss controls over payroll payments to  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers.

Because of the severity of the problems identified for these  mobilized Army National Guard soldiers, you, as well as other requestors,  asked us to examine the accuracy and timeliness of payroll payments to  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers.", "In response to the September 11 attacks, many Army Reserve soldiers were  activated to federal duty. A reported 98,000 Army Reserve soldiers\u2014almost  half of the soldiers in the Army\u2019s selected reserve\u2014had been mobilized to  active duty at some point since September 2001.  These forces were  deployed on various important missions across the United States and  overseas in support of Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and  Iraqi Freedom.  Their missions consisted mostly of combat support  missions, such as supply, medical, and transportation operations, as well as  military police and intelligence functions.  Given the critical and continuing  roles Army Reserve soldiers play in carrying out vital military and security  missions, effective controls are needed to provide timely and accurate pays  and allowances to these soldiers.  Pay-related problems are not only costly  and time-consuming to resolve, but result in financial hardship for soldiers  and their families.", "Because current Department of Defense (DOD) operations used to pay  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers relied extensively on error-prone, manual  transactions entered into multiple, nonintegrated systems, we did not  statistically test controls in this area.  Instead, we audited eight Army  Reserve units as case studies to provide a detailed perspective on the  nature of payroll deficiencies with respect to Army Reserve soldiers.  Each  of these units had mobilized, deployed, and demobilized at some time  during the 18-month period from August 2002 through January 2004.

To effectively account for soldiers\u2019 movements during  these transitions, unit commanders, unit administrators, as well as  individuals assigned to personnel and finance offices across the Army  Reserves, Army mobilization stations, and in theater Army locations must  work closely and communicate extensively to have the necessary data to  pay Army Reserve soldiers accurately and on time throughout their active  duty tours.", "However, we identified several critical flaws in the soldier accountability  procedures in place during the period of our audit.

However, the unit commander  did not provide a list of the unit\u2019s mobilizing soldiers to the UPC and did not provide any  information on this soldier indicating that he would not be reporting to the unit\u2019s  mobilization station.  Consequently, neither the UPC nor the mobilization station  personnel had any means of detecting that a soldier had not mobilized with his unit  and therefore was improperly receiving active duty pays.  As a result, the soldier\u2019s pay  was started on February 11, 2003, and continued through February 2004, resulting in  more than $36,000 in overpayments.

Army local area servicing finance locations  are to obtain documentation\u2014flight manifests, for example--showing  soldier arrival and departure date information to use as a basis for starting  and stopping location-based pays, allowances, and associated tax benefits.

At two mobilization stations, finance officials  provided only a unit-wide briefing and did not meet individually with the  soldiers to conduct a detailed review of their military pay accounts.

Correspondingly, pay and personnel reconciliation processes in  place during our audit were focused primarily on requirements for unit  commanders to reconcile data for reserve soldiers while they are in an  inactive (weekend drilling only) status.", "Specifically, current Army Reserve procedures require that unit  commanders review a key report, the Unit Commanders Pay Management Report, for soldiers in their units performing weekend drill activities, for  short-term active duty mobilization activities, and in planning for lengthy  active duty mobilizations.  However, these procedures do not clearly  require unit commanders to review this key report for Army Reserve  soldiers in subsequent phases of their active duty mobilization tours.  The  unit commander at one of our case study units, the 965th Dental Company,  stated that he did not believe that a review and reconciliation was needed.   Instead, he stated he relied on the unit\u2019s soldiers to identify any pay  problems.  However, in light of the extensive manual entry, and  nonintegrated systems currently relied on for mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers\u2019 pay, the timely and complete reconciliation of comparable pay and  personnel data in these key reports can serve as an important detective  control to identify any pay errors shortly after they have occurred.", "In addition, Army guidance does not specify how deployed units are to  receive these reports.  Distribution of these reports is particularly  problematic for units deployed in remote locations overseas.  Unit  commanders for several of our case study units stated they did not receive  these key reports while deployed.

However, DOD guidance  and the form for implementing this policy were not clear because they did  not provide for a determination that the soldier\u2019s family does not live near  the soldier\u2019s duty station.  Specifically, they did not require soldiers to  certify that (1) they live over 50 miles away from the unit\u2019s home station  and do not commute daily, or (2) the soldier\u2019s commander has certified the  soldier\u2019s required commute to the duty station is not reasonable.  As a  result, we found inconsistencies as to when soldiers received family  separation allowance.  For example, soldiers from the 824th Quartermaster  Company received family separation allowance payments while stationed  at their Ft. Bragg home station even though they lived within 50 miles of the  base and no documentation was available showing the unit commander  authorized an exception.

The fact that mobilized Army Reserve soldiers received any of  their entitled active duty pays, allowances, and tax benefits accurately and  on-time is largely due to the dedication and tireless efforts of many of these  pay-support personnel to do the right thing for these mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers.  However, in conjunction with our case studies, we  observed the following human capital weaknesses in the current processes  and organizational components now relied on to pay mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers: (1) inadequate resources provided to support unit-level  pay management, (2) inadequate pay management training across the  spectrum of pay-support personnel, and (3) customer service breakdowns."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequate Resourcing for Critical Unit Administrator Positions", "paragraphs": ["Vacancies and turnover in key unit administrator positions, and the  deployment of unit administrators to fill other military requirements,  impaired a unit\u2019s ability to carry out critical pay administration tasks that  could have prevented or led to early detection of pay problems associated  with our case study units.

For  example, at one of our case study units, the 965th Dental Company, the unit  commander informed us that he did not support the review of pay  management reports because soldiers had the capability to review their pay  online and would use this capability to identify and report any pay  problems.  However, as discussed earlier, while we identified numerous  instances in which soldiers received overpayments or had other pay  problems, we saw little indication that these soldiers found and reported  these problems prior to our audit.

Servicing  soldiers and their families with pay inquiries and problems is particularly  critical in light of the error-prone processes and limited automated system  processing capabilities.  Ultimately, pay accuracy is left largely to the  individual soldier.", "Although there are several sources that soldiers can turn to for pay issue  resolution, including an online system and a toll free phone pay assistance  number, soldiers at our case study units experienced problems in accessing  these sources.   Mission requirements and the distance between  deployment locations and field finance offices often impaired the soldiers\u2019  ability to utilize the in-theater customer service centers.  Also, soldiers did  not always have Internet and telephone access to utilize sources through  these media.  The lack of Internet access for deployed soldiers was  particularly problematic because it limited soldiers\u2019 access to pay,  allowance, and tax benefit data reflected in their leave and earnings  statements.  Lacking leave and earnings statements, soldiers had no means  to determine the propriety of their active duty payments.  For example,  soldiers with the 948th Surgical Team told us that their inability to access  the leave and earnings statements adversely affected their overall morale.", "Even when mobilized reservists were able to contact customer service  sources, their pay issues often continued because the office they were  instructed to contact was unable to address their inquiry or correct their  problem.  In some cases, customer service sources failed to help soldiers  because they lacked an understanding of what was needed to fix the  problems.  When representatives of the 948th Surgical Team contacted their  parent company for help in correcting pay problems, personnel with the  parent company informed them that they could not fix the unit\u2019s pay  problems because they (incorrectly) believed that the unit was paid  through the Army\u2019s active duty pay system.   Soldiers at other units were  redirected from one source to another.  Soldiers were not aware of which  sources could address which types of problems, and more significantly, the  customer service sources themselves often did not know who should  correct a specific problem.", "An Army Reserve major\u2019s experience illustrates the time and frustration  that is sometimes involved with soldiers\u2019 attempts to obtain customer  service for correcting errors in active duty pays, allowances, and related  tax benefits.", "Individual Case Illustration:  Extensive, Time-consuming Action Required to  Resolve Pay Issue  A soldier from Maryland was mobilized in March 2003 from the Army\u2019s Individual  Ready Reserve to active duty to serve as a liaison between the Army and Air Force to  help coordinate ground and air combat operations in Iraq.  After completing his 2- month active duty tour and returning to an inactive reserve status in May 2003, he  contacted Army officials to inform them that he was continuing to receive active duty  pays and volunteered to immediately repay these erroneous overpayments.  In July  2003, he wrote a check for $6,150.75 after receiving documentation showing his debt  computation.  However, he continued to receive Leave and Earnings Statements  indicating that he had an outstanding debt.  He contacted his Army demobilization  finance office to determine how to get the erroneous outstanding debt removed from  his pay records.  After being referred by officials at that location to various DFAS  locations (including once being told, \u201cThere is nothing more I can do for you.\u201d), he  contacted us for assistance.  After DFAS recomputed the soldier\u2019s debt as a result of  our inquiry, the soldier was informed that he owed an additional $1,140.54, because  the original debt computation did not fully consider the erroneous combat zone tax  exclusion benefits he received.  Overall, he spent nearly a year after his 2-month active  duty tour ended, and about 20 phone calls, faxes, and letters in contacting at least  seven different DOD representatives at five different customer service centers to  correct active duty pay and allowance overpayments and associated combat tax  exclusion benefit problems.", "Finally, soldiers expressed concern about the treatment they sometimes  received while attempting to obtain customer service.  Soldiers expressed  concern that certain customer service representatives did not treat soldiers  requesting assistance respectfully.  For example, one soldier who  attempted to make corrections to his Certificate of Discharge or Release  from Active Duty (DD 214) informed us that mobilization station personnel  told him that the citations and dates of service he was trying to add \u201cdidn\u2019t  matter.\u201d  Additionally, some soldiers told us that when they raised concerns  about the quality of customer service they received with respect to their  pay inquiries and concerns, they were sometimes ignored.  For example,  soldiers with Connecticut\u2019s 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment told us  they contacted the local Inspector General because they believed that  finance personnel at their deployment location had both actively tried to  impair the payment of their active duty entitlements and had tried to  intimidate and discourage the unit\u2019s soldiers from seeking help elsewhere.

The errors often occurred because  local area finance personnel did not receive accurate or timely  documentation such as flight manifests or data from the Tactical Personnel  System indicating when soldiers arrived or left the theater.  As a result,  finance personnel did not start these payments on time, and did not stop  these payments as of the end of the soldiers\u2019 active duty tour date recorded  in DJMS-RC.", "Use of the miscellaneous code to process hardship duty pay also precluded  the use of system edits as backup controls to prevent overpayments.   Because a miscellaneous code is used for various types of payments, DFAS  could not set up an edit to stop hardship duty pay after a soldier\u2019s active  duty tour ended in the event finance personnel mistakenly continued to  manually process hardship duty pay.  Similarly, DFAS could not establish  an edit to prevent duplicate payments of hardship duty pay processed using  the miscellaneous code.  As a result, hardship duty pay could be entered  more than once for a soldier in a given month without detection.

Therefore, as a workaround  procedure to compensate for this limitation, an automated process was  established whereby the system first withholds taxes applicable to  payments made while soldiers are in a combat zone, and then later  reimburses soldiers for these withheld amounts in the following month.  As  a result of this workaround process, with few exceptions, Army Reserve  soldiers who served in a designated combat zone received their combat  zone tax exclusion benefit at least one month late.", "Soldiers experienced longer delays in receiving this benefit if they arrived  in a combat zone after the midmonth cutoff for DJMS-RC processing,  which is approximately on the seventh day of each month.
