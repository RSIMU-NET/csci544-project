You were concerned that the current measure does not adequately recognize that residents of high-cost areas may need higher incomes to adequately meet their basic needs.", "Specifically, we agreed to (1) describe the function of market baskets in determining a COL index, including both a uniform national market basket and market baskets that reflect regional differences in consumption; (2) identify methodologies that might have potential for calculating a COL adjustment, including methodologies that researchers and private industry use for comparing costs by geographic areas; and (3) obtain expert opinions on the ability of these methodologies to adjust the poverty measurement for geographic differences in COL. As we agreed with your offices, our work was limited to the technical feasibility of these methodologies.

This poverty measure was based on the finding of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) 1955 Survey of Food Consumption that, on average, families of three or more persons spent one-third of their income on food. Poverty for a family of three was computed as three times the cost of the economy food plan, the least costly food plan designed by USDA. The poverty measure has been updated annually with a COL index to adjust for the change in prices nationwide, but the poverty measure has not been adjusted for differences in prices by geographic area. Thus, in 1993, a family of three with a cash income of less than $11,522 was considered to be living in poverty, regardless of place of residence.", "The concept of geographic COL adjustments of poverty measurement has been seen as problematic. A 1976 report to Congress on the measurement of poverty stated that \u201cone of the most troublesome concepts of poverty measurement\u201d was making adjustments for geographic differences in COL.It ultimately concluded that unresolved conceptual issues, such as the development of generally accepted market baskets of goods and services representative of the needs of the poor in various geographic areas, and data limitations precluded satisfactory geographic adjustments. More recently, in a 1992 report, we noted that there was insufficient data on which to base geographic adjustments to the measure of poverty.", "Some economists contend that adjusting the poverty measure for geographic differences in COL would be inappropriate, irrespective of the methodology used. They say that any such adjustment to reflect regional differences in market baskets would fail to recognize other regional differences that are relevant to a definition of poverty or the needs of the poor. For example, a COL index probably would not reflect differences among geographic areas in the level of support or assistance available to low-income families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address our first two objectives, describing the function of a market basket and identifying potential methods for calculating a COL adjustment, we reviewed the relevant literature on measuring poverty and on geographic adjustment for COL and discussed these issues with specialists. These specialists included individuals associated with poverty measurement or COL data at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of the Census, as well as private organizations and academic institutions. On the basis of these reviews and discussions, we identified 12 methodologies that might have potential for adjusting poverty measures to reflect geographic differences in COL. We consider these 12 methodologies to be illustrative for a wide range of potential approaches to determine geographic COL differences, but recognize that the list is not, and cannot be, exhaustive. (A more detailed account of our scope and methodology is contained in app. I.)", "To meet our third objective of obtaining expert opinion on the ability of the methodologies to adjust the poverty measure for geographic differences in COL, we identified experts and asked them to review the methodologies. From our list of more than 40 potential experts compiled during our literature review and initial discussions with specialists, we selected 15 experts to review the methodologies. (See app. II for a list of the selected experts.)", "We sent a questionnaire to these experts in which we described each methodology briefly. We asked the experts to review each of the 12 methodologies and to categorize the methodology\u2019s potential for use in adjusting the poverty measurement for geographic difference in COL. Additionally, we asked them to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each methodology. (See app. III for a copy of the information and questionnaire sent to each expert.) All 15 experts responded and we tabulated their ratings for each methodology to determine the ones the experts considered most and least promising. We also analyzed the written responses on strengths and weaknesses.", "We did our work in Washington, D.C., between September 1994 and January 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Of the methodologies we examined that calculate a COL index, none uses a uniform national market basket in which the same quantities of identical goods and services are used in all locations. In fact, these methodologies all used market baskets that have different measures for at least one component\u2014for example, transportation or housing.

The composition of the market baskets, such as the items included or the quantity of one item included in relation to other items, affects the dollar values that are determined to represent COL. Conceptually, market baskets for a COL index would accurately reflect differences in tastes, as well as needs, such that an individual would derive equal satisfaction from the various market baskets priced in different geographic locations. For example, food preferences in southeastern states for low-cost cereals, such as rice and corn, lowers COL in these areas, while climatic differences necessitates the expenditures for heating a home and warm clothing and increases the COL in northern states.", "Obtaining a consensus on what should go into a COL index\u2019s market baskets and on how to update them would be difficult. The method generally preferred by the experts we contacted to determine the items to include in market baskets is to use expert judgment to specify the requirements for physical health and social well-being. But standards have not been identified for the majority of components of a COL index\u2019s market baskets.

One expert commented that it is nearly impossible to obtain reliable evidence or credible expert judgments about the composition of market baskets to reflect specific local standards of living. This expert suggested that market baskets should be changed as acceptable standards are developed. The problem of keeping market baskets up to date was noted by other experts in their comments about the use of outdated data and concepts. For example, one expert specifically wanted a child care component to be included in the market baskets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Methodologies Exist That Potentially Could Lead to a Geographic COL Index", "paragraphs": ["We identified 12 generic methodologies that, in some part, could contribute to the development of a COL index that potentially could be used to adjust the poverty measurement for geographic differences. Four methodologies identified baseline data, or developed a market basket that could be the basis for constructing a COL index by geographic area. Six methodologies calculated a COL index from existing cost data or a previously defined market basket. Two methodologies developed an original market basket, collected data, and calculated a COL index with those data. Table 1 provides descriptions of the 12 methodologies. (Detailed descriptions of these methodologies are found in app. III.)", "A few of the methodologies are now used as COL indexes, but most have not been. For example, the norms, local indexes, and economic modeling methodologies are used in the private sector as COL indexes to make geographic COL adjustments for pay and relocation decisions. Until their discontinuance in 1981, estimates from the family budgets methodology had been used by policymakers to set income eligibility criteria for employment programs and to geographically adjust wages and salaries. Several of the methodologies that identify baseline data are used in ways other than to show differences in COL. For example, USDA uses the consumption data methodology to estimate expenditures on a child, which then are used to determine payments for the support of children in foster families. Many of the methodologies were developed by researchers to develop indexes to reflect COL differences, such as those categorized under the estimation models, interarea price index, and the consumer price index methodologies; but none of these are used to make geographic COL adjustments. (See app. III for detailed descriptions of how the data and indexes from the 12 methodologies are used.)", "We identified two additional methodologies but could not locate research that delineated how the methodologies could be implemented to develop a COL index. For example, administrative data from public assistance programs, such as the food stamp program, have been proposed as baseline data for developing a COL adjustment that would indicate the incidence of need within a geographic location. However, in our review of the relevant literature and discussions with specialists, we did not locate appropriate data that could be translated into an index to demonstrate geographic variation. Another approach to identify baseline data for a COL index would be to use information obtained from grocery stores\u2019 universal product code scanners. As in the case of administrative program data, we could not locate information that indicated how the product code data could be used to develop a geographic index or ratio.", "During the process of obtaining experts\u2019 ratings of promise for the 12 generic methodologies we identified, some experts indicated that we had not identified and presented all possible methodologies to make such a COL adjustment. A number of the experts suggested using a combination of several attributes from the methodologies that they reviewed. In addition, they identified four other methodologies that could be considered for doing geographic COL adjustments. One was a modification of the local indexes methodology, and another was a modeling technique to develop regional variables to obtain baseline data. The other two focused on ways to revise the current poverty measurement. One methodology included the most basic levels of shelter and food as the basis for measuring poverty. The other methodology, according to an expert, is what the National Academy of Sciences panel is expected to recommend in its forthcoming report. None of these methodologies was identified by more than one of the experts, however.", "We recognize that our list of 12 methodologies is not exhaustive, but consider it to provide a fair overview of the wide range of alternatives. The fact that the experts suggested further methodologies, and that no alternative was proposed by more than one expert, suggests that no agreement now exists among experts as to the best way to adjust the measurement of poverty for geographic differences in COL.

Although the majority of experts rated certain methodologies as showing little or no promise for adjusting the poverty measurement for geographic differences in COL, no clear consensus was observed overall in the ratings the experts gave regarding the methodologies\u2019 promise for making adjustments. A majority of the experts regarded local indexes, polling, family budgets, consumption data, and the consumer price index methodologies as showing little or no promise for making adjustments.

(See table 2 for experts\u2019 ratings of methodologies.)", "No methodology was rated by the majority of experts as showing great or very great promise to adjust the poverty measurement for geographic differences in COL. However, three methodologies\u2014budgets, norms, and housing data\u2014received a rating of at least moderate promise by a majority of the experts.

When three or more experts did express a similar comment, it most often concerned a weakness rather than a strength of the methodology being rated. Some experts identified an attribute but expressed different perspectives as to whether it constituted a strength or weakness. Examples of mixed responses included one expert indicating that a strength of a particular methodology was its adaptability for use by government, while another expert characterized the same methodology as not being adaptable for use by government. In some instances, experts agreed about a methodology\u2019s attribute\u2014e.g., its emphasis on children\u2014but differed as to whether the presence of this attribute should be viewed as a strength or weakness. (See figure 1 for strengths and weaknesses of the methodologies.)", "Our content analysis of the experts\u2019 comments on the strengths and weaknesses of the three methodologies that received a rating of at least moderate promise by the majority of experts illustrates both the diverse and occasionally contradictory comments of the experts. The strengths of the budgets methodology lie in its representation of low-income families and its use of health and social well-being standards in the determination of the market basket. However, its eclectic approach of using these standards from various sources, which makes it difficult to explain to laypersons, was viewed as a weakness. Another weakness of the budgets methodology cited by the experts is that it fails to make adjustments for regional differences in transportation and some of the other market basket components. The experts who commented about its use of expenditure data were evenly split between those who viewed this as a strength and those who said it was a weakness. This methodology was viewed as capturing both contemporary and outdated concepts of consumption needs. For example, one expert cited the use of current standards as a strength, whereas other experts cited the use of 1981-based data to determine the importance given to items in the market basket as a weakness.", "The norms methodology was generally rated as promising because the COL index was frequently updated. The experts, however, differed in their comments about the methodology. For example, more than one-half of the experts said that the lowest income level for which the index was provided was well above poverty and was therefore unrepresentative of low-income families. Conversely, one expert, noting the degree of variation in income levels provided in the index, described it as \u201cmore relevant to the poor than other available sources.\u201d Mixed responses of both strengths and weaknesses were indicated for the (1) appropriateness of the items in the market basket, (2) degree of geographic variation shown in the index, (3) ability of the methodology to be adapted and implemented by the government, and (4) cost associated with such implementation.", "The housing data methodology was regarded as strong in its focus on what the experts considered the major source of variation in COL. The fact that housing was the only cost measured was also cited as this methodology\u2019s major weakness. As shown in table 3, the experts had mixed views about the representation in the baseline data of families living in poverty. The experts also lacked agreement on whether the housing concepts were appropriate. For example, one expert said the methodology had the \u201cmerit of focusing on rents for a specified type of apartment,\u201d while another said that \u201cdecent, safe, and sanitary\u201d qualities of housing should be controlled in the measure to prevent downward bias in low-income areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses Identified for Methodologies With Little or No Promise", "paragraphs": ["A content analysis of the experts\u2019 comments revealed that the local indexes methodology had many weaknesses resulting from its price data collection methods, which involve volunteers from chambers of commerce collecting and averaging prices that are representative of purchases of middle-management households in their local areas. This methodology was viewed to be an unsuitable representation of the consumption needs of the poor. Another weakness of the local indexes methodology was its exclusion of nonmetropolitan and rural areas.", "The polling methodology was regarded by several experts as a means to validate the measurement of poverty, rather than as an approach to make geographic COL adjustments. These experts said that this methodology provided insight into the relationship between an absolute measure of poverty, such as the current official measure, and a measure that is relative\u2014that is, a measure that changes with growth in the economy or according to society\u2019s perception of an adequate level of income. According to the experts\u2019 comments, the main weakness of polling was in the quality of the data obtained through a public opinion survey. It was thought that the respondents would be biased in providing their estimates. For example, one expert wrote: \u201cIf respondents knew the survey results would be used to adjust poverty thresholds with implications for program expenditures and income taxes, then some may intentionally deflate or inflate their response, in their own self-interest.\u201d The experts had mixed views about the costs associated with this method; some experts said it would be cost effective, while others said it would be costly.", "According to the experts\u2019 comments, the main weakness of the comparable pay methodology was its reliance on employers\u2019 labor costs. Many experts said that such a measure included influences other than COL and that as a consequence it was inappropriate and an unsuitable substitute for COL, especially as a representation of the needs of the poor. For example, one expert said, \u201cGeographic variations in quality of life affect the relationship between wages/salaries and living costs. Use of employer costs as a measure of living costs would introduce significant regional bias.\u201d Many weaknesses, as well as several mixed responses, were noted for the remaining three methodologies\u2014consumption data, family budgets, and consumer price index."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The concept of adjusting the measurement of poverty for geographic differences in COL has been seen as problematic, and remains so.

The fact that several of these experts suggested additional methodologies, but that no additional methodology was suggested by more than one of the experts, suggests to us that a consensus on any one approach does not exist. Where there does appear to be agreement, however, is that several of the methodologies offer little or no promise of appropriately adjusting the measurement of poverty for geographic COL differences.
