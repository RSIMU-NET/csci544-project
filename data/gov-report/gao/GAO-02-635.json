DOD has taken actions to address problems with contractor overpayments. In addition to its contract audit functions and as part of a broad based program to assist the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) is auditing at least 190 large DOD contractors to identify overpayments and ensure that contractors have adequate internal controls for prompt identification and reporting of overpayments. Although DOD has several initiatives to reduce overpayments, it still does not yet have basic administrative control over contractor debt and underpayments because its procedures and practices do not fully meet federal accounting standards and federal financial system requirements for the recording of accounts receivable and liabilities. As a result, DOD managers do not have important information for effective financial management, such as ensuring that contractor debt is promptly collected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since we reported on Department of Defense (DOD) contractor  overpayments in 1994, we have issued additional reports highlighting  billions of dollars of overpayments to Defense contractors.  As a result of  these and other reports, there has been increasing congressional interest in  recovering overpayments made to contractors.  In December 2001, this  interest led to the Congress amending Title 31 of the United States Code to  require a federal agency with contracts totaling over $500 million in a fiscal  year to have a cost-effective program for identifying payment errors and for  recovering amounts erroneously paid to contractors.", "You requested that we update our previous reviews to determine whether  DOD\u2019s problems with overpayments continue.  Specifically, we determined  (1) whether overpayments and underpayments to contractors have  continued, (2) what actions DOD has taken to address payment  discrepancies with contractors, and (3) whether the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS) properly accounts for and collects amounts  due from contractors and accounts for amounts the government owes  contractors.", "Amounts due the government from DOD contractors can arise from  (1) improper payments made because of progress payment liquidation  errors, contractor billing errors, and other processing errors and  (2) contract administration actions, such as item price adjustments,  changes in delivery schedules, and changes in the quantities ordered, all of  which can occur after valid payments have been made on a contract.  The  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) refers to any amounts due the  government resulting from these actions as contractor debt or  overpayments.  However, not all of these overpayments could  appropriately be considered improper payments.  Specifically, those  resulting from contract administration actions were correct when made,  but due to subsequent changes, the excessive portion of the payment is to  be immediately pursued and promptly collected.", "To accomplish our objectives, we (1) surveyed 183 DOD contractors, as  agreed to with your staff, similar to the approach we took in our 1995  report on contractor payment problems, (2) assessed DFAS data on  contractor refunds, (3) obtained the status of DOD corrective actions on  our previous recommendations, and (4) reviewed the management of and  accounting for overpayments and underpayments.  We focused our work at  DFAS Columbus, which was also the area of emphasis in prior audit reports  on DOD contractor payment problems, because it is the largest, centralized  DFAS disbursing activity\u2014disbursing $78 billion of contract payments to  DOD contractors in fiscal year 2001.  To effectively use audit resources, the  Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), as part of its contract audits at  high-risk contractors, tested the validity of selected contractor survey  responses for us.", "Our scope and methodology are described in more detail in appendix I.   We  did not fully assess the reliability of the underlying data in the contractors\u2019  responses or the data we obtained from DFAS Columbus.  We reviewed and  discussed DCAA\u2019s work at selected contractor locations where it  performed follow-up work for us.  We requested comments on a draft of  this report from the Secretary of Defense or his designee.  We received  written comments from the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller and  have reprinted the comments in this report.  We performed our work from  August 2001 through April 2002 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s contract administration and payment processes involve numerous  organizations, including 23 DFAS offices; the contractors that perform  work and bill the government; the Defense Contract Management Agency  (DCMA), which administers most of DOD\u2019s largest procurement contracts;  military components\u2019 project and contracting offices; and DCAA, which  reviews contractors\u2019 records, internal controls, and billing systems.  The  contract administration and payment processes have been described in our  prior reports.  If DCMA administers a contract, DFAS Columbus makes  payments using the Mechanization of Contract Administration Services  (MOCAS) system, and DOD refers to the disbursements as \u201ccontract pay.\u201d   In fiscal year 2001, DFAS Columbus disbursed about $78 billion for over  300,000 contracts managed in MOCAS.  Contracts that DCMA does not  administer are paid using other systems at the DFAS offices. DOD refers to  these contract disbursements as \u201cvendor pay.\u201d  The Navy\u2019s shipbuilding and  repair contracts are viewed as vendor pay because they are not managed by  DCMA or paid by DFAS Columbus using MOCAS.  In fiscal year 2001, DFAS  processed over 10 million vendor pay invoices, valued at over $59 billion.   Large contractors with numerous DOD contracts and locations can receive  both contract pay and vendor pay.  Effective April 1, 2001, DFAS contract  pay and vendor pay management were consolidated at DFAS Columbus.", "Contract payments involve payments for the delivery of goods and services  and financing payments.  Financing payments include (1) progress  payments to cover a contractor\u2019s costs as they are incurred during the  construction of facilities or the production of major weapons systems and  (2) performance-based payments that are based on the accomplishment of  particular events or milestones\u2014typically used on production contracts.   When contractors deliver items and submit invoices for the delivered  items, DFAS Columbus deducts financing payments from the prices of the  delivered items, or \u201cliquidates\u201d the financing payments, based on a  predetermined liquidation rate.  Liquidation rates may be adjusted when  costs are higher or lower than projected.  Contract modifications can often  occur due to changes in liquidation rates, quantities ordered, and  production schedules.  These modifications and other contract  administration actions are managed by DCMA through coordination with  the contractors.", "Our prior reports on contractor overpayment problems have highlighted  that (1) Defense contractors were refunding hundreds of millions of dollars  to DFAS Columbus each year, (2) DFAS Columbus had made overpayments  due to duplicate invoices and paid invoices without properly and  accurately recovering progress payments, (3) contract administration  actions had resulted in significant contractor debt or overpayments,  (4) DOD and contractors were not aggressively pursuing the timely  resolution of overpayments or underpayments when they were identified,  (5) DFAS Columbus did not have statistical information on the results of  contract reconciliation, and (6) DOD has ongoing actions to address  contractor payment problems.", "DFAS Columbus can identify overpayments during contract reconciliation  or can be notified of an overpayment by a contractor or DCMA.  When  DFAS Columbus becomes aware of an overpayment, its Accounts  Receivable Branch is to issue an initial demand letter to the contractor and  works with the entitlement divisions, which process and pay invoices, to  collect amounts due the government by initiating an \u201coffset\u201d that reduces  the amount paid on invoices in process.  The Accounts Receivable Branch  also maintains the detailed records on the accounts receivable.  The  contract reconciliation function deals with contracts being closed out as  well as active contracts needing partial audits to resolve prior and current  payment problems, such as overpayments, underpayments, and invoice  deficiencies.  Since the mid-1990s, DFAS Columbus has contracted with a  major accounting firm to help reconcile and close out thousands of  contracts.  When an amount exceeding $600 is due to the government and  is not collected within 90 days, the debt is supposed to be transferred to  DFAS\u2019s central Debt Management Office (DMO) for further collection  actions that can include referring debts to the Defense Criminal  Investigative Service or the U.S. Treasury\u2019s centralized debt collection  programs.", "Within the last 6 months, three key actions have been taken to address  governmentwide issues on improper payments.  As previously stated, in  December 2001, the Congress amended Title 31 of the United States Code  to require an agency with contracts totaling over $500 million to have a  cost-effective program for identifying payment errors and for recovering  amounts erroneously paid to contractors.  The resources for implementing  the recovery program can include the agency, other federal departments or  agencies, and the private sector.  As of March 2002, the Office of  Management and Budget had not issued implementing guidance on this  law.  Another key action was our issuance of an executive guide, in  October 2001, that discusses strategies and control activities, such as  recovery auditing, contract audits, and data mining, to identify and correct  improper payments.  The third action, in response to our recommendation,  was a change in the FAR, effective February 19, 2002, which added a  paragraph to the \u201cprompt payment\u201d clause of contracts that requires a  contractor to notify the contracting officer if the contractor becomes aware  of an overpayment and to request instructions for disposition of the  overpayment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overpayments and Underpayments Continue", "paragraphs": ["Defense contractors\u2019 responses to our survey indicated that they have  millions of dollars in overpayments and underpayments on their records,  and based on DFAS Columbus records, they are continuing to refund  overpayments.  According to the contractors, a primary reason for these  payment discrepancies was progress payment liquidation errors.   Contractors usually did not include contractor debt arising from contract  administration actions in the overpayments amounts they reported.   However, according to DFAS Columbus records, contract administration  actions were the primary reason for the $488 million that contractors  refunded in fiscal year 2001.  Contractor refunds are likely to continue  because of DOD\u2019s complex contract management and payment processes.   Also, even when payment discrepancies are identified, they are not always  promptly resolved."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contractors Reported Overpayments and Underpayments but Extent of Them Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["Based on information from our surveys, business units of 67 contractors  reported that they had about $62 million of overpayments and about $176 million of underpayments in their records as of September or October  2001.  We sent surveys to 497 business units of 183 contractors, and at least  249 of the business units of 120 contractors responded.  The business units  of the remaining 53 contractors that responded did not report any  overpayments or underpayments in their records.  Appendix II provides the  details of our survey results and appendix III contains the survey.", "As shown in table 1, which summarizes the results of the survey, 34 of the  largest contractors did not respond to the survey.  The 10 largest  contractors\u2014according to their reported annual billings\u2014that responded  to our survey reported about 86 percent of the total overpayments and 78  percent of the total underpayments reported by all of the contractors.  One  Boeing contract alone accounted for $27 million of underpayments due to  contract funding issues.  Contractors cited DFAS progress payment  liquidation errors as a primary reason for the overpayments and  underpayments.  Contractors usually did not include contractor debt  arising from contract administration actions in the overpayment amounts  they reported.  However, as discussed later in this report, contract  administration actions are the primary source of contractor refunds.  Most  of the contractors reported that demand letters had not been issued for the  overpayments in their records but that they planned to return about 29  percent of the overpayments by check or offset.  For the remaining 71  percent of the overpayments, contractors did not indicate any planned  actions.  According to DCAA, it plans to ensure that all of the overpayments  are properly handled.", "These survey results cannot be used to determine the extent of  overpayments and underpayments in contractor records at a point in time.   Specifically, the results cannot be projected to a universe of DOD  contractors even if all contractors had reported because the surveyed  contractors were not randomly selected.  Further, our analysis of  contractors\u2019 responses showed inaccuracies in their reporting.  For  example, at least 3 contractors included information on contract payments  to federal agencies other than DOD and even to nonfederal entities.  At  least 1 contractor reported overpayments that had been refunded the  government and, therefore, should not have been reported because they  were not outstanding overpayments.  We also observed that contractors  were not consistent in reporting actions taken on overpayments.  Out of at  least 588 reported overpayments, contractors indicated in their responses  that they had notified DOD of 251 overpayments.  At the same time,  contractors reported that they had not notified DOD of 236 overpayments.   For the remaining 101 overpayments, contractors did not provide any  indication one way or the other.", "Based on factors such as contractor size, geographic location, and amount  of reported payment discrepancies, we selected, in coordination with  DCAA, 27 contractor locations involving 24 companies to test the validity  of contractors\u2019 responses.  The selected business units reported  $58 million, or 94 percent, of the total reported overpayments and  $126 million, or 71 percent, of the total reported underpayments.  We  provided our survey results to DCAA for these business units, and its  auditors found that 10 of the contractor locations underreported  overpayments by $57.2 million and underreported underpayments by $58.0 million.  DCAA stated that the remaining 17 locations had reported  accurately.  According to DCAA, 5 contractors are primarily responsible for  these large differences and most of the differences are due to contractors\u2019  billing weaknesses and erroneous reporting of unpaid invoices.  Appendix  IV summarizes the DCAA results.  At these same 10 contractor locations,  DCAA also found that (1) differences in application of liquidation rates and  weaknesses in contractor billing systems were primary reasons for both  overpayments and underpayments and (2) unpaid invoices over 30 days old  were another primary reason for underpayments.  Such results  demonstrate the need for recovery audit programs, such as DCAA\u2019s  contractor overpayment and underpayment audits to identify payment  errors, recover erroneous payments, and identify payments due to the  contractor.", "During its follow-up to our surveys, DCAA also found that contractors are  reluctant to return overpayments on a contract when underpayments on  the same contract result in a net underpaid status.  For example, 1 of the  largest DOD contractor\u2019s records showed a contract with millions of  dollars of overpayments and underpayments that resulted in a $1.8 million  net underpaid status.  According to the contractor\u2019s records, some of these  overpayments had occurred in 1997 and had not been resolved.  As of  September 30, 2001, the contract was in reconciliation, and, as of February  2002, these payment discrepancies had not been resolved.   According to  DCAA officials, they decided, after consulting with DFAS, that settlement  of any overpayments and underpayments would be deferred until contract  reconciliation is complete and the final contract amount is settled.   DCAA  officials stated that the contractor had basic internal controls for  overpayments, and DCAA is assisting the reconciliation through its project  on audits of contractor-prepared reconciliations.", "In responses to our survey, contractors also included overpayments and  underpayments associated with contracts paid through vendor pay.  For  example, at least 28 contractors, including 3 major shipbuilding and ship  repair contractors, reported overpayments and underpayments associated  with vendor pay.  These 3 major shipbuilding contractors, alone, reported  overpayments of almost $9.4 million and underpayments of about $0.5 million.  According to a response from 1 shipbuilding contractor,  overpayments and underpayments that occur on a contract are not  resolved until contract closeout, which could be several years later.   Another vendor pay contractor reported about $12 million of  underpayments primarily due to underpaid invoices.  For contractors  indicating receipt of vendor pay, we could not accurately eliminate the  vendor pay discrepancies from the total amounts reported by the  contractors because (1) not all contractors provided sufficient and  consistent detailed information and (2) we did not validate all of the  responses.  Nevertheless, we asked DFAS Columbus to compare its records  to the contractor responses for 106 contracts, and DFAS Columbus told us  it did not make the payments on 42 of the contracts because they were  vendor payments.", "Although our prior reports placed more emphasis on contract pay than  vendor pay, recent DOD Office of Inspector General (IG) audits also have  identified weak internal controls in vendor pay systems and overpayments  to contractors.  For example, in October 2001 and March 2002, the DOD IG  reported that the Computerized Accounts Payable System, a vendor pay  system used by DFAS Kansas City and DFAS Indianapolis, did not have  proper internal controls to detect and prevent improper payments, and that  DFAS had made at least $13 million of duplicate payments.  As a result,  recovery audits and recovery activities that are now required by 31 U.S.C.  3561 could be used to improve the management of contract payments  associated with both \u201ccontract pay\u201d and \u201cvendor pay.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contractor Refunds Primarily due to Contract Administration Actions but Improper Payments Also Occurred", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 1994 through 2001, DOD contractors have refunded over  $6.7 billion to DFAS Columbus.  However, as shown in table 2, DFAS  Columbus records showed that contractor refunds dropped to about  $488 million in fiscal year 2001 from $901 million in fiscal year 2000.  Of the  $488 million in refunds, DFAS Columbus collected $449 million by  contractors submitting checks and the remaining $39 million through  offsets.  However, the level of refunds could be greater because contracting  officers often collect funds from the contractors by offsets that are agreed  to during contract negotiations, and DFAS might not be notified.  Since  DFAS keeps track of only those offsets it processes, its records would not  have the number of refunds due to these other offsets handled directly by  DCMA and the contractors.", "DFAS Columbus records showed that about $360 million, or 80 percent of  the $449 million in checks sent to the government in fiscal year 2001, was  due to DCMA contract administration actions and the remaining  $89 million, or 20 percent, was due to payment problems.  This is consistent  with what we have previously reported.  For example, in February 2001,  we reported that 77 percent of $351 million in excess payments was  primarily related to contract administration actions, and, in July 1999, we  reported that about 78 percent of the contractor refunds was due to  contract administration and other actions outside of DFAS\u2019s control.", "In tracking contractor refunds due to payment problems, DFAS Columbus  distinguishes between refunds with issued demand letters and refunds  without demand letters\u2014or unsolicited refunds.  According to DFAS  Columbus records, refunds due to payment problems were caused  primarily by DFAS processing errors, including improper progress payment  liquidations.  We reviewed 12 unsolicited contractor refunds valued at  about $24.2 million, or 83 percent of the total $29.2 million in unsolicited  contractor refunds during the months of October 2000, March 2001, and  August 2001.  Our review revealed that 6 of the overpayments were due to  progress payment liquidation errors and 6 were duplicate payments caused  by contractor billing errors along with DFAS weaknesses in detecting and  avoiding overpaying in these situations.  Some examples follow.", "In September 2000, Textron Systems refunded $8,194,856 because of a  DFAS error in liquidating progress payments.  In August 2000, Textron  billed a net amount of $2,739,301, based on contract delivery price of  $10, 957,205, of which $8,217,904 should have been liquidated.  However,  DFAS paid $10,934,158 in August 2000.", "In July 2001, Boeing refunded $5,527,922 due to the incorrect liquidation  of progress payments on two invoices.  DFAS overpaid one invoice by  $2,077,922 and another invoice by $3,450,000 because it used an  incorrect liquidation rate.", "In March 2001, Northrup Grumman refunded $1,855,788 for a duplicate  payment.  DFAS first paid this amount in September 1999 for an invoice  submitted in August 1999, and it paid the same amount again in January  2000.  DFAS documentation did not indicate what allowed the invoice to  be processed twice.  The unsolicited refund was about 15 months after  the overpayment.", "In August 2001, the Eagle Support Services Corporation refunded  $958,339 because it had received two payments for the same invoice.   The contractor submitted an electronic invoice on June 28, 2001, which  DFAS paid on July 10, 2001.  However, the contractor had earlier  submitted a hard copy invoice on June 11, 2001, which DFAS paid on  July 18, 2001.  DFAS processed each invoice because the invoices had  different shipment numbers.", "DOD contract management, payment, and accounting processes are  complex and remain at risk of contractor debt arising from contract  administration actions and overpayments caused by payment and billing  errors.  We reported in January 1998 that DOD\u2019s contract management  and payment process involves numerous organizations that share data  using both manual and automated means that are not integrated.  Since  then, DOD has implemented more electronic sharing of contract  information and invoicing to reduce manual processes.  However, in  December 2000 and April 2001, the DOD IG reported that additional  controls were needed in electronic document sharing and interchange to  ensure security of the data.  In addition, DFAS personnel told us that  contract and invoicing information still must be manually entered into  MOCAS.  For example, contracts with special payment instructions need to  be processed manually because they are an exception to the MOCAS  automatic payment process.", "One effect of the overall complex process is that DFAS Columbus can  sometimes issue demand letters that it later cancels due to subsequent  contractor, contracting officer, or DFAS actions to correct or otherwise  resolve the basis for the debt.  In fiscal year 2001, DFAS Columbus canceled  $37.5 million of demand letters.  A few examples follow.", "Lucent Technologies almost received a duplicate payment of $1,397,200  when the contractor submitted invoices to DFAS Omaha in October  2000 and DFAS Columbus in December 2000 for the same amount.   DFAS Omaha, the originally designated contract payment office, paid  the first invoice.  Subsequently, DFAS Columbus became the payment  office, and the contractor resubmitted the invoice to DFAS Columbus,  which initiated payment.  However, DFAS Columbus identified the  duplicate payment, issued a demand letter, and then canceled the  demand letter when it stopped the electronic funds transfer payment  before it was processed by the contractor\u2019s bank.", "In April 2001, DFAS issued a demand to Lockheed Martin for a  $2,755,244 debt that occurred in September 1997 when a contracting  officer issued a contract modification reducing the contract amount.  An  April 1998 audit of the contract identified that the wrong accounting line  was cited in this modification, which created a debt.  Even though the  contracting officer was notified of the mistake at that time, no action  was taken until DFAS issued the demand letter.  In May 2001, a  contracting officer prepared another contract modification to cite the  correct accounting line, which eliminated the debt. DFAS then canceled  the demand.", "A demand to Litton Systems Advanced, Inc. for a $2,124,022  overpayment was canceled when the contractor sent an invoice with the  amount reduced for the overpayment.", "The entire contract management and payment process, which has been  described in our prior reports, is further complicated by how progress  payments are accounted for in contract records, a method that can  ultimately create (1) differences in contractor and DFAS Columbus records  and (2) future payment and contract reconciliation problems.  In April  1997, we reported that contract payment problems can occur when DFAS  Columbus liquidates progress payments because of payment allocations to  an accounting classification reference number on a contract that have little  relationship to the work performed.  If payment allocations must be made  using a different process than the MOCAS automated process, especially  when contracts have special payment instructions, the risk of error  increases.  As mentioned earlier in this report, contractors responded that  progress pay liquidation errors were a major reason for overpayments.   This is consistent with our October 1995 report indicating that according  to DFAS Columbus analysis the most frequent cause of an overpayment  was the incorrect recovery of progress payments.  DFAS Columbus data on  fiscal year 2001 overpayments showed that progress payment liquidation  problems were one cause of the overpayments, but that the primary  reasons were contract modification and invoice processing errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overpayments Likely to Be Identified by Contract Reconciliation", "paragraphs": ["Even though contractors or contracting officers identify many  overpayments, the DFAS Columbus contract reconciliation function is also  likely to identify many overpayments.  Of the 2,512 demand letters issued  by DFAS Columbus in fiscal year 2001, its records showed that contract  reconciliation had identified overpayments associated with 1,115 demand  letters, valued at about $83.4 million.  Its records also showed that the  contractor or a contracting officer had initiated the remaining 1,397  demand letters, valued at about $43.8 million.  The contract reconciliation  process is intended to identify and correct imbalances between (1) the  contractor\u2019s invoiced amounts and recorded amounts paid in MOCAS,  (2) contract obligation and disbursement balances in DFAS accounting  records and MOCAS, and (3) the contract obligation amount and MOCAS  obligation and disbursement amounts.  The contract reconciliation  function at DFAS Columbus deals not only with contracts that are  candidates for closure but also those contracts needing partial audits to  resolve prior payment problems and correct deficiencies so that DFAS  Columbus can pay current invoices.", "As shown in table 3, at fiscal year-end, the number of contracts waiting for  reconciliation had averaged about 2,300 for the past 7 years.  However,  during the year, the number of contracts going through reconciliation can  be much greater.  For example, in fiscal year 2001, DFAS Columbus  processed over 8,100 contracts through reconciliation.  As of September 30,  2001, DFAS Columbus had 3,249 contracts waiting for some level of  reconciliation, a higher level than in the prior 6 years.  Based on prior year  results, contract reconciliation will likely identify millions of dollar of  overpayments needing resolution.", "As shown in table 4, of the 3,249 contracts awaiting reconciliation, as of  September 30, 2001, 575 had been in this status for over 360 days, while  1,523 of the contracts had been awaiting reconciliation for 90 days or less.   This is fewer than what we reported in July 1999 when over 900 of 2,453  contracts had been in reconciliation for over a year.  Included in the  contracts awaiting reconciliation are contracts for some of the largest  contractors included in our survey.  For example, 3 of the largest DOD  contractors that responded to our survey\u2014Lockheed Martin, Raytheon,  and Boeing\u2014had 205, 191, and 119 contracts, respectively, waiting for  reconciliation as of August 31, 2001.  In addition, 1 of the large contractors  that did not respond to our survey had 56 contracts in reconciliation at  DFAS Columbus.  As noted later in this report, DCAA is auditing contractor- prepared reconciliations at these large contractors, and DFAS uses the  audit results in completing the contract closeout process.", "The error-prone nature of the contract management and payment process  is illustrated by over 15,000 contracts in fiscal years 2000 and 2001  combined that have gone through some level of reconciliation at DFAS  Columbus.  Contract provisions often change, affecting deliveries, progress  payment liquidation rates, and indirect cost rates, which creates excess  payments after invoices have been paid.  As we reported in January 1998,  MOCAS records may differ from the accounting office records because  contract information, such as modifications, may not have been properly  and consistently processed by all locations.  DFAS and contractors can  process invoices in different sequences resulting in discrepancies in how  progress payments are liquidated.  As a result, many contracts can require  some type of reconciliation more than once during their life.   DFAS  Columbus contract reconciliation results for fiscal year 2001 indicated that  the majority of payment problems identified during research were due to  payment system errors and erroneous processing of contract  modifications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overpayments Are Not Always Recovered Promptly", "paragraphs": ["We also have previously reported that overpayments are not always  recovered promptly.  As mentioned in prior reports, such delays can cost  the government in lost interest charges and use of the funds.", "According to DFAS Columbus records, even though it had collected almost  $85.7 million in fiscal year 2001, problems remain with the timely recovery  of overpayments.  For example, of the 546 overpayments, including  voluntary contractor refunds, for which DFAS Columbus had recorded in  its records both the check receipt date and the date the overpayment was  identified, only 75 were refunded within 30 days, with 294 being refunded  after 90 days.  Moreover, 360 additional refunds did not have the dates  necessary to determine the timeliness.  Further, as of August 2001, DFAS  Columbus accounts receivable records showed that about $26 million out  of $54.8 million total receivables, or 47 percent, had been outstanding for  over 90 days.  Of those outstanding for over 90 days, about $18.8 million  had not been resolved for over a year because contractors had disputed  these receivables\u2014also discussed later in this report.  We reviewed 11 files  for these old accounts receivable and some examples follow.", "In November 1997, DFAS Columbus issued a demand letter to  McDonnell Douglas for $2,294,454.  The contractor disputed the demand  and, in March 1998, the contract was submitted to audit.  As a result of  the audit, the demand was reduced to $27,904.  However, DFAS did not  issue a demand for the reduced amount.   In May 2000, DFAS decided to  update the audit on the contract.  As of December 2001, over a year   after the second audit, the recorded receivable was still $2,294,454  because the DFAS Columbus Accounts Receivable Branch had not been  informed of the audit results.", "In August 1996, DFAS Columbus issued a demand letter to Hughes  Aircraft for $2,032,113.  DFAS subsequently issued a second demand  letter in September 1996. The contractor disputed the demand but did  not provide sufficient detail to support the dispute so that an audit could  resolve the dispute.  In January 1997, DFAS Columbus asked the  contractor for additional information, and the contractor responded that  the problem might be with several different progress payment and  liquidation rates on the contract.

The contractor disputed the demand and provided  evidence that it had sent a check for $3,137,200 for the debt in August  1995.  However, according to DFAS Columbus, this left a balance due of  $749,369.  In November 1999, DFAS issued a demand letter for this new  balance due, and Raytheon disputed the remaining amount of the debt.   As of December 2001, the $749,369 demand had not been resolved.", "After we shared our concerns about aged disputes with DCAA, it attempted  to resolve these receivables as part of its recovery audit effort.

Specifically, in August 2001, DCAA agreed to assist DFAS in addressing  excess payments to contractors, debt collection, invoice payment  instructions, contract reconciliation, and professional development.   Subsequently, in November 2001, DCAA began audits on overpayments and  related contractor internal controls for identifying and promptly reporting  overpayments.  Its plan is to complete audits at 190 contractors in fiscal  year 2002.  As of March 2002, the number of contractors to be audited had  increased to 195.

From  additional special audits of progress payments, DCAA identified about  another $27.3 million of overpayments, most of which were promptly  resolved.  These results illustrate what can be accomplished from  programs to identify payment errors and recover erroneous payments.   DCAA officials stated that they would continue overpayment audits until  contractors\u2019 controls ensure prompt identification and reporting of  overpayments to DOD.  While DCAA efforts could be viewed as a type of  recovery activity, DOD does not have an overall recovery audit program  that includes all types of contract payments.  DCAA also has been involved  with the contract reconciliation of old contracts at large contractors to  facilitate contract closeout and the transition to the new systems intended  to replace MOCAS.", "DCMA, in response to DOD overpayment issues, has issued additional  guidance to its contracting officers.  For example, in April 2000 and  November 2001, it issued memorandums on the identification and recovery  of overpayments and excess progress payments, respectively.  These  memorandums emphasized the need for contracting officers to be alert to  situations in which contractor debt is incurred and to immediately issue  demand letters.  Further, in a response to our February 2001  recommendation, DCMA stated that it is using DFAS Columbus  information on refunds to identify and evaluate possible systemic contract  administration problem areas.", "DFAS Columbus, in response to prior reported deficiencies, has  implemented practices to provide better oversight of the reasons for  overpayments and the results from contract reconciliation.  For example, it  established a central-tracking database to categorize reasons for contractor  refunds.  This database identifies different types of possible DFAS  Columbus errors and the types of contract administration actions creating  the contractor debt.  In addition, DFAS Columbus has been tracking  contract reconciliation results to identify reasons for the payment  problems identified during reconciliation.

FAR and DCMA\u2019s procedures require the contracting officer to take prompt  action on contractor debt.  However, the contracting officer might not  always take immediate action to collect the overpayment due a large  workload or oversight.

The appropriate finance units for our survey were those that  handle the billings and maintain accounts receivables; some business units  for which we had addresses do not maintain these records.
