For example, the average amount sponsors of small plans reported paying for recordkeeping and administrative services was 1.33 percent of assets annually, compared with 0.15 percent paid by sponsors of large plans. Larger plans were more likely to pass recordkeeping fees along to participants, but when fees were passed along to participants in small plans, those in large plans paid lower fees than those in small plans. Participants also paid for investment and plan consulting fees\u0097through fees deducted from their plan assets\u0097in more instances than sponsors.", "GAO\u0092s survey and review of plan documents showed that some sponsors faced challenges in understanding the fees they and their participants were charged. Some sponsors did not know if their providers used complex fee arrangements, such as revenue sharing, or if their plans paid certain fees under an insurance contract, such as a group annuity contract. In addition, some sponsors reported knowing about arrangements, but did not fully understand how these fees were charged. For example, one relatively large plan underestimated recordkeeping fees by more than $58,000, because the sponsor did not include the fees charged to participants\u0092 accounts under its revenue sharing arrangement.", "The Department of Labor (Labor) has taken several actions to help sponsors understand and monitor fees charged by service providers. For example, Labor disseminates a number of publications and resources, including a 401(k) fees checklist that is available to sponsors on its website to help them better understand plan fees. However, according to GAO\u0092s survey results, more than an estimated 90 percent of sponsors either did not know about or have not used Labor\u0092s resources to compare and assess plan fees. Additionally, sponsors have access to the plan information of others, including some fees paid, through the Form 5500, but GAO\u0092s survey also shows that the information is not being used by sponsors.

Our past work has shown that the amount of  plan fees paid by participants can significantly reduce retirement savings  and is dependent on several factors, including the decisions made by the  plan sponsor to hire service providers\u2014outside entities to help administer  their plans. Studies have also been conducted by industry organizations  to better understand the decisions plan sponsors make in managing their  401(k) plans. However, these studies are generally based on surveys of  larger plans\u2014those with more than 500 participants\u2014and most have not  specifically focused on the fees charged by plan service providers. As a  result, uncertainty remains about the fees paid by small and medium-size  plans, which account for the majority of all 401(k) plans, and about the  level of knowledge and expertise sponsors of these plans have to  determine the fees charged by service providers. Consequently, you  asked us to survey sponsors of small, medium-size, and large plans with  different characteristics, such as total plan assets, geographic distribution,  and nature of business, to collect information on the following:  1.  How much do plan sponsors and participants pay for services  performed by service providers?  2.  What, if any, challenges do sponsors face in understanding how fees  are charged to their plan?  3.  What actions has the Department of Labor (Labor) taken to help plan  sponsors understand and monitor fees charged by service providers?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations pertaining to 401(k) fees and fee disclosure. We also  reviewed research and available guidance provided to plan sponsors by  Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and industry  research related to understanding and disclosing fee information. We  interviewed Labor, SEC, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials;  industry experts; plan sponsors; and service providers about factors that  affect the amount of 401(k) fees that can be charged to sponsors and  participants as well as current and proposed regulations and the  requirements governing the disclosure of fee information.", "To obtain information about the fees sponsors pay for services performed  by providers, the factors they considered in selecting service providers,  and Labor resources they may have used during calendar year 2010, we  conducted a representative survey of 401(k) plan sponsors. We drew a  stratified random sample of 1,000 plan sponsors from a population of  468,194 unique 401(k) plans from 2009 Form 5500 Annual Return/Report  filings (Form 5500). The sample was stratified by the number of  participants reported at the beginning of plan year 2009 into five groups:  fewer than 10 participants, 10-49 participants, 50-99 participants, 100-499  participants, or 500-plus participants. This stratification emphasized  smaller plans because the vast majority of plans in the 401(k) plans  universe have fewer than 500 participants. Although our sample was  grouped into five strata, for the purposes of comparison and to help  increase the statistical power of our estimates, we analyzed survey  results by three groups: fewer than 50 participants, 50 to 499, and more  than 500. Our survey yielded a weighted response rate of about 39  percent. We conducted a nonresponse bias analysis to see if the  characteristics of survey respondents generally reflected population  characteristics, such as plan size (i.e., the total number of participants),  total plan assets, geographic distribution, and nature of business. The  results of our nonresponse bias analysis enable us to generalize our  results to the total population of 401(k) plan sponsors for most survey  questions. We make note of instances in which survey responses are not  generalizable. To encourage survey participation, we obtained permission  from our congressional requesters to remove links in our paperwork  between individuals\u2019 identities and their responses. We informed  sponsors of this agreement in the introductory letter transmitted with the  survey. A detailed description of our sampling methodology can be found  in appendix I. The survey instrument and a more complete tabulation of  the results can be viewed at GAO-12-550SP.", "As part of our analysis of fees for recordkeeping and administrative  services; investment management; retirement plan consulting; and other  fees, such as legal or trustee fees, we generated estimates of the  amounts paid by sponsors and participants. Although all of our fee  estimates are not generalizable to the population of 401(k) plan sponsors,  we feel they are illustrative of the amounts paid by sponsors and  participants. We calculated our estimates as a percentage of plan assets  and on a per participant basis using the annual amounts reported by  sponsors for each service, plan assets, and number of plan participants  for calendar year 2010. To supplement our analysis of the fee amounts  sponsors reported paying and their understanding of how fees are  charged to plans, we also analyzed documents, such as investment  reports, that sponsors submitted with their survey responses. We also  reviewed investment fund prospectuses associated with the investment  options included in the documents sponsors submitted to determine  whether plans paid certain fees. Finally, for respondents for whom data  were available, we reviewed fee reports generated by a third party,  BrightScope, to determine the estimated fees associated with transaction  costs for individual investment options. BrightScope estimates fee  amounts of 401(k) plan fees by drawing on publicly available data,  primarily Form 5500 filings, which include independently audited  information.

These services include  investment management (e.g., selecting and managing the securities  included in a mutual fund),  consulting and providing financial advice (e.g., selecting vendors for  investment options or other services),  recordkeeping (e.g., tracking individual account contributions),  custodial or trustee services for plan assets (e.g., holding the plan  assets in a bank), and  telephone or web-based customer services for participants.", "As shown in figure 1, services can be provided by a single \u201cbundled\u201d plan  service provider or through contracts with a combination of several  different entities\u2014also known as an \u201cunbundled\u201d arrangement. In a  bundled arrangement, the sponsor hires one company that provides the  full range of services directly or through subcontracts with other providers.  Using a bundled provider, the sponsor might also delegate the oversight  for the selection and monitoring of plan services, except with respect to  the bundled provider itself. In contrast, in an unbundled arrangement, the  sponsor, acting in a fiduciary capacity, selects each service provider and  retains an ongoing duty to monitor service providers.", "Service providers can be compensated for their services either directly  from the plan sponsor or indirectly\u2014payments from sources other than  the plan or plan sponsor. Typically, service provider compensation comes  in the form of fees charged as a percentage of total plan assets, per  participant, an itemized fixed rate, or a combination of all three. How fees  are assessed largely depends on the type of service provided and the  plan sponsor. For example, fees for investment management services,  which can vary by investment option, are generally charged as a  percentage of assets and indirectly charged against participants\u2019  accounts, because they are deducted directly from investment returns.  Administrative fees, on the other hand, can be assessed as an overall  percentage of total plan assets regardless of participants\u2019 investment  choices, in addition to a flat rate for some fixed services, such as the  printing of plan documents. In the latter, the sponsor has the option of  passing along some or all of the administrative fees to participants. We  previously reported that recordkeeping and administrative fees are often  paid by the plan sponsors, but participants bear them in a growing  number of plans.", "Service providers charge an array of fees depending on the type of  product and arrangement the provider may have with other entities that  provide plan services. Some common investment-related fees are the  following:", "Management fees: These fees are paid out of fund assets to the  fund\u2019s investment adviser for investment portfolio management, other  management fees payable to the fund\u2019s investment adviser or its  affiliates, and administrative fees payable to the investment adviser  that may not be included in some of the fees identified below.", "Marketing and distribution fees, also known as 12b-1 fees: These  fees may be used to pay commissions to brokers and other  salespersons, to pay for advertising and other costs of promoting the  fund to investors, and to pay various service providers of a 401(k)  plan pursuant to a bundled services arrangement.

The sponsor who said participants  paid approximately 3.24 percent in plan assets reported using an  insurance company for investment options and did not know if different  types of investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, were offered to  participants. However, most respondents reported their plans paid less  than 1 percent of plan assets. These tended to be older plans, in  existence for at least 10 years, and those having more than $1 million in  plan assets.

Revenue sharing arrangements, in  which fees for plan services are indirectly charged to the plan through an  outside entity, can benefit plans if sponsors clearly understand how much  they are paying for these types of arrangements and the services they can  help provide. For example, according to a 2007 report by the ERISA  Advisory Council\u2019s Working Group on Fiduciary Responsibilities and  Revenue Sharing Practices, many of these arrangements may help reduce  overall plan costs and provide plans with services and benefits that may not  otherwise be affordable to them. In addition, as we have previously  reported, revenue sharing arrangements can be used to offset expenses the  plan has agreed to pay, and can either be cost-neutral to the plan or may  instead result in increased compensation to the service providers. Our  review found examples in which revenue sharing arrangements for  recordkeeping and administrative services did not offset other fees, namely  investment fees. In these cases, an additional asset-based fee for  recordkeeping under a revenue sharing arrangement was charged on top of  each fund\u2019s reported expense ratio, as opposed to a lower rate.", "Service providers and consultants we spoke with noted that plan sponsors  typically do not fully understand revenue sharing arrangements. One industry  expert explained that plan sponsors are commonly not aware of fees or fee  arrangements disclosed outside of the expense ratio. Representatives from a  consulting firm told us that some of their clients possess a good  understanding of revenue sharing, but most have no understanding of  revenue sharing and the potential impact on plan fees. As shown in figure 6,  sponsors of an estimated 48 percent of plans did not know if their service  providers had revenue sharing arrangements with other providers.  Furthermore, 51 respondents that reported being aware of revenue sharing  also reported that they did not consider the revenue sharing arrangements  when selecting service providers, or that they did not have enough  information to do so.", "Plan sponsors who reported not having or not knowing if their providers  had revenue sharing arrangements may, in fact, have had these  arrangements and were not aware of it. Our review found that at least 45  of the 91 plan sponsors who provided investment reports had revenue  sharing arrangements, despite reporting not having or not knowing of  such arrangements. Some of the documents provided by these plan  sponsors specifically identified revenue collected from or paid to third  parties for plan services, such as recordkeeping and investment adviser  fees. Evidence of revenue sharing was also found through our review of  some of the funds these plans invested in, which showed that 12b-1 fees  were charged. Similarly, plans paid sub-TA fees, but about 50 percent  of sponsors reported not knowing if these fees were paid during calendar  year 2010. For example, one provider discloses that it receives revenue  sharing fees, including sub-TA fees, but 7 of the 24 survey respondents  that contracted with this provider reported that they did not know if their  plans paid these fees. According to examples we found, in which the plan  sponsor may not have been aware of revenue sharing arrangements,  fees paid under such arrangements varied.", "Examples in Which Sponsors Unknowingly Paid Certain Fees  under a Revenue Sharing Arrangement", "The sponsor of a plan that had about $6 million in assets reported  not knowing if its plan paid 12b-1 fees, even though a review of its  investment documents indicated that the plan paid about $5,000 in  12b-1 and other revenue sharing fees.", "The sponsor of a medium-size plan with over $4 million in plan  assets reported that participants did not pay for recordkeeping and  administrative services\u2014when in fact the provider estimated that  about 43 percent of the fees collected by fund providers from  participants\u2019 accounts, roughly $13,000, would be used to pay for  recordkeeping and administrative services.", "Moreover, even plan sponsors that were aware of revenue sharing  arrangements may not fully understand the impact of these arrangements  on plan services and plan fees, and therefore likely paid higher fees than  they reported. For example, our review of the fee report of a 401(k) plan  that used revenue sharing and had over 500 participants and  approximately $13.5 million in plan assets found that the plan sponsor  and participant paid 16 times more in recordkeeping and administrative  fees during calendar year 2010 than the sponsor reported on our survey,  when we included revenue sharing fees, as shown in figure 7. Similarly,  the plan sponsor of a small plan that had about 65 participants and about  $5.8 million in plan assets reported that the company did not pay anything  for recordkeeping and administrative fees, though the fee report the  sponsor provided indicated that these fees in total were about $10,700\u2014 about $5,900 was invoiced to the company and roughly $4,800 was paid  to the provider from revenue sharing fees collected from participants\u2019  asset accounts.", "A failure to understand these arrangements can have adverse effects on  the plan sponsor and participants. For example, because recordkeeping  fees under a revenue sharing arrangement can be based on the amount  of plan assets under management, the amount paid to the provider for  recordkeeping services could increase as the fund grows and may get  quite large if the sponsor is unaware of these asset-based fees. This  could result in the plan\u2014the sponsor and participants\u2014continuing to pay  more for recordkeeping services as assets grow, although the level of  recordkeeping services provided tends to remain the same.

Some service providers we met with said that  plan sponsors do not often know they are invested in insurance products  such as group variable annuities, which are products that place a  \u201cwrapper\u201d of benefits, namely a guaranteed lifetime annuity income or a  minimum death benefit, around a bundle of investments that are similar to  mutual funds\u2014called separate accounts or subaccounts\u2014and are  unaware of the associated fees. They suggested that it is difficult for  sponsors to distinguish between group variable annuity contracts and  mutual funds, because the insurance company\u2019s separate or subaccounts  often use the same name as the mutual funds, as depicted in figure 8.  However, representatives from one insurance provider said its separate  accounts are invested in the mutual fund for which it is named, but  acknowledged that other providers may mimic the fund rather than  investing in the fund.", "In addition, our survey shows that about 17 percent of sponsors did not  know if their plans had group variable annuity contracts. Furthermore,  although sponsors of 72 percent of plans reported not having a group  variable annuity contract, our analysis of their submitted investment  statements indicates that some do currently have these contracts and are  unaware of them. According to our review, it appears that at least 15 of  the plans that provided investment documents and reported not being in a  group variable annuity contract may actually be under such a contract.", "The various ways that information about these contracts is disclosed can  make it difficult to determine with certainty whether or not sponsors have  these contracts. As shown in figure 9, a 401(k) group annuity contract and  a 401(k) plan without such a contract may look very similar. For example,  the sponsor of a small plan with about 12 plan participants did not know if  the plan had a group variable annuity contract. However, the statement  provided by the sponsor noted that the plan was a group variable  contract, and included a mortality, expense, and administrative charge\u2014 charges by an insurance company to cover the cost of insurance features  in an annuity contract. Similarly, another plan sponsor we met with told us  its plan did not use group annuity contracts; its advisers, however, later  clarified that the sponsor\u2019s plan is, in fact, a group variable annuity  contract and charges wrap fees at 0.1 percent of plan assets. The  advisers explained that these contracts are not often identified as group  variable annuity contracts and suggested that a lot of sponsors would not  know if their plans had such contracts. Another sponsor told us that its  third-party administrator told it that its plan was not under a group annuity  contract, even though it was stated on the plan\u2019s investment report,  because the provider, which is an insurance company, was required to  disclose its group annuity contract terms on all plan documents,  regardless of the actual terms.", "Fees associated with group annuities can add significant costs to a plan.  The additional fees for group annuity contracts\u2014known as wrap fees\u2014 include administrative fees and a mortality and expense risk charge,  which is typically in the range of 1.25 percent of assets per year. We also  found that in addition to each fund\u2019s expense ratio, an insurance  provider\u2019s administrative service fees were up to 2.00 percent of plan  assets for a few plans that responded to our survey. Furthermore, two  service providers we met with said that they will often discourage their  clients from using group annuities, and one noted that it was able to  reduce one plan sponsor\u2019s fees by about $90,000 off a total of $300,000  by switching the plan away from group annuities to mutual funds.  However, another provider told us that it packages a range of services  into its group annuity contracts and spread fees out over a number of  years, making it more affordable for smaller plans to offer their employees  a retirement plan. In addition to ongoing fees, these contracts also  typically charge a surrender fee for terminating the contract, which may  begin in excess of 4 or 5 percent, according to one service provider, but  typically decline over a period of about 5 or 7 years after a purchase  payment. As these fees can be significant, plan sponsors are likely  contracting with providers that charge higher fee rates without knowing  the benefits for which they and their participants are paying. Moreover,  without being aware of whether or not their plan is a group annuity  contract, for example, plan sponsors cannot adequately assess whether  or not the benefits tied to that product are worth the fees associated with  them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Majority of Sponsors Did Not Know about Commonly Charged Transaction Costs", "paragraphs": ["Many plan sponsors may not be aware that their participants are paying  potentially significant transaction costs (also known as trading costs),  which are commonly paid for indirectly by plan participants out of fund  assets and typically include commissions associated with an investment  manager\u2019s buying and selling of securities within a particular investment  vehicle. While transaction costs are common among mutual funds, and  more than 80 percent of 401(k) plans in our survey offer mutual funds,  sponsors of an estimated 48 percent of plans did not know if their plans\u2014 through the deduction from participants\u2019 returns of investments\u2014incurred  transaction costs.

Even those that did ask about these fees sometimes did not  know whether their plan participants were charged transaction costs. For  example, a plan sponsor of a large plan with 15,000 participants and over  $100 million in plan assets told us that its plan does not pay transaction or  trading costs, and that it has asked its service provider for information on  these fees. However, on the basis of BrightScope\u2019s estimates, the plan  was charged about $310,400 in transaction costs.", "SEC has identified four major types of mutual fund transaction costs:  commissions, spread costs, market impact costs, and opportunity  costs. However, no industrywide standard currently exists for  calculating transaction costs. Different researchers and private sector  companies have developed various methods to determine transaction  costs. For example, one researcher focuses on spread costs,  brokerage commissions, and tax costs using individual fund quarterly  reports of stocks traded and SEC filings, while another researcher  estimates trading costs using price impacts and effective bid-ask  spreads. Adding to the difficulty of estimating transaction costs is the  fact that even though mutual funds have transaction costs associated  with them, they are not uniformly measured or disclosed  Transaction costs vary by different types of investment vehicles. Our review  of BrightScope data for 83 plan sponsors that responded to our survey and  had corresponding BrightScope data suggests that transaction costs for an  investment option can be as high as 2.72 percent. However, average  transaction costs for the investment options offered in the plans we  reviewed were approximately 0.45 percent of assets. Even though  transaction costs for individual funds are high, the amount a participant or  plan pays may be lower depending on how much is invested in these high- cost options; for example, for the plan that had an investment option with a  transaction cost of 2.72 percent, only 6.57 percent of plan assets were  invested in that option, resulting in transaction costs of 0.18 percent of total  plan assets. Different types of investment options yield different amounts of  transaction costs. For example, more actively managed funds may have  higher transaction costs than less actively managed funds because they  often have a higher turnover. More actively managed investment options  with higher turnovers could benefit participants by producing a higher  return; however, their higher transaction costs may or may not lead to a  higher net return."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Labor Has Taken Actions to Help Sponsors, but Additional Efforts Are Needed to Effectively Oversee Fees Charged by Service Providers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Labor Has Educational Resources, but Sponsors Reported Not Using Them", "paragraphs": ["Labor has made information, guidance, and tools regarding plan fees  available to plan sponsors on its website, but our survey shows that many  sponsors are not using these resources.

In addition to the  resources we specifically asked about, one sponsor noted using Labor\u2019s  Frequently Asked Questions, available on its website, but also reported  not knowing how much the plan paid in investment management and  consulting fees.

These changes would likely  allow Labor to oversee a broader range of plan providers.

Our survey results show  that, on the basis of respondents\u2019 perceptions, various providers other  than investment advisers also serve as plan fiduciaries, but some may not  be considered fiduciaries under current and proposed regulations. For example, of those that use a third-party administrator, sponsors of an  estimated 14 percent of plans reported that their administrator also  served as a plan fiduciary. Sponsors also reported that some bundled  service providers served as fiduciaries. However, most service providers,  including some investment advisers, are not considered to be plan  fiduciaries by plan sponsors, according to information on our survey.", "We also found that some sponsors relied on providers, who may not be  considered plan fiduciaries under current regulations, to perform fiduciary  functions, which can lead to gaps in plan oversight. As shown in figure 13,  service providers who perform certain activities could be considered  ERISA fiduciaries, and thus under the authority of Labor; however there  are circumstances that may result in an unclear fiduciary role. During the  course of our review, we found instances in which plan fiduciary roles  were unclear. For example, we met with a sponsor of a small plan that  told us the plan relied on its bundled provider to the extent that the  sponsor considered the provider a plan manager and never felt the need  to negotiate plan fees, because the sponsor trusted that the provider\u2019s  representatives would let the sponsor know if the plan was being  overcharged. This sponsor also told us that the provider\u2019s representative  was always very clear that the information provided was not investment  advice, and therefore the provider may not be considered an ERISA  fiduciary.

We previously reported that Labor generally would not be able to take  action against a provider that was not considered a fiduciary under  ERISA, and even in instances in which the courts have allowed Labor to  pursue nonfiduciaries that contribute to a fiduciary breach, Labor officials  noted that remedies were limited. These limitations are further  exacerbated by the fact that, as our survey shows, in the current  retirement market, sponsors heavily rely on providers that may not be  considered plan fiduciaries to help them manage their plans. Therefore, in  addition to Labor\u2019s ongoing effort to amend the definition of an ERISA  fiduciary, Labor may need to conduct a separate evaluation of  relationships between sponsors and providers, whose fiduciary status is  unclear.

Our previous  work on issues related to retirement plan sponsorship among small  employers indicated that starting and maintaining a plan can be  challenging. Some small plan sponsors are overwhelmed by the various  administrative and fiduciary responsibilities and use service providers to  help manage their plans, which can be costly. Regardless of plan size,  many of these fees charged in 401(k) plans are passed along to plan  participants, which ultimately results in reduced retirement savings. In this  regard, plan sponsors may need to be aware of and closely monitor the  fees charged by various service providers to help ensure the fees they  and their participants pay are not excessive. However, in several  instances, sponsors of large and small plans did not know or fully  understand the fees charged to their plans, because fee arrangements  have become so complex and may be disclosed differently, adding to  sponsor confusion about plan fees. In addition, because sponsors of  plans of all sizes may not be aware of certain fees that participants are  paying, such as transaction costs and wrap fees, it is difficult to get a  clear understanding of the total fees that participants are actually paying.", "Labor has taken actions to help educate plan sponsors and provide them  with complete information about fees, but our survey shows that Labor\u2019s  efforts are not reaching its target audience. While Labor\u2019s service provider  disclosure regulation is likely to provide plan sponsors with information to  help them assess the reasonableness of fees received by plan service  providers, our survey results show that sponsors whose providers are  already disclosing revenue sharing arrangements have trouble  understanding the impact of these arrangements on plan fees.  Furthermore, sponsors in our survey had more than one provider and will  likely receive multiple disclosure statements under the new regulation.  Thus, more disclosures from multiple service providers about their fees  may not be enough to ensure sponsors, and ultimately participants, are  paying the most appropriate fee for plan services if they do not fully  understand how certain arrangements work. By taking a more proactive  approach to its educational outreach efforts, thereby ensuring its efforts  are more effective at reaching plan sponsors, particularly those of small  plans, who may lack the in-house expertise and resources necessary to  manage their plans, Labor can increase the awareness of how fees are  charged under complex arrangements and reduce the likelihood that  sponsors and participants pay higher fees than necessary.", "Although the Form 5500 was not intended to be a comprehensive  database of plan fees, it could be a valuable source of information for  sponsors to help them compare the fees they pay with those paid by  other plans of similar size. Without enhancements to Labor\u2019s website,  such as search functions for multiple purposes and different audiences, it  will be difficult for users, namely plan sponsors, to use Form 5500 data, if  they so choose, to compare the fees charged by service providers. Labor  has a unique opportunity to make the information it collects available to  sponsors in a way that will help them compare and negotiate their fees. In  the absence of better access to high-quality plan fee information,  sponsors will continue to rely on service providers for comparative fee  information, which may or may not be unbiased. In addition, sponsors will  continue to believe filing the form is onerous and not beneficial to them,  because they cannot easily access and use it to determine fees.", "Finally, our work shows that numerous providers have significant  influence over sponsors and plan decisions but do not consider  themselves to be fiduciaries, are not considered fiduciaries by plan  sponsors, and may not be considered fiduciaries under Labor\u2019s proposed  changes because they do not provide investment advice or have not  already identified themselves as fiduciaries. In addition to Labor\u2019s ongoing  efforts, an evaluation of the entire definition of the term \u201cfiduciary\u201d would  be helpful to plan sponsors and service providers.

Of the three regulations Labor  noted, two\u2014Labor\u2019s regulations regarding service provider disclosures to  plan fiduciaries and disclosures to participants and beneficiaries\u2014had not  yet been implemented during our review, and therefore their effectiveness  remains to be seen. With respect to the third regulation noted in Labor\u2019s  written comments regarding changes to Schedule C of the Form 5500  Annual Report, which began with the 2009 plan year, our report and e- supplement describe these changes and how sponsors have used the  additional information collected on the Form 5500. Our survey results  show that the additional information collected on Schedule C provided  some plan sponsors more useful information about their provider\u2019s  compensation, but it did not help many sponsors negotiate plan fees nor  did it result in the ability to compare fees paid with those charged by other  service providers.", "We commend Labor for quickly responding to our prior recommendation  to finalize the regulation regarding disclosures of service providers\u2019 direct  and indirect compensation from plan investments and Labor\u2019s efforts to  collect information on a guide or similar requirement to assist plan  sponsors in identifying and understanding the disclosures. As we noted  in the third section of this report, service provider disclosures under the  new regulation may be difficult to understand, and multiple disclosures in  different formats may further contribute to sponsors\u2019 confusion about plan  fees. Labor shared our concerns about how plan fee information could be  presented to sponsors and stated it will propose for public comment a  supplement to the service provider disclosure regulation to fully address  our previous recommendation.", "Regarding our third objective, Labor appreciated our interest in EBSA\u2019s  outreach and educational efforts on key fiduciary responsibilities, such as  the fees paid for operating retirement plans. With respect to our  recommendation on Labor\u2019s approach to plan sponsor outreach and  education, Labor cited several ongoing efforts to engage sponsors and  stated that it is exploring new ways to reach plan sponsors. We commend  Labor for its efforts to provide educational information to the public; host  webcasts on complex topics, such as its new fee regulations; and work  with stakeholders, such as the Small Business Administration, to reach  plan sponsors with its limited resources. However, throughout the section  we illustrate through various survey results that Labor\u2019s efforts are not  currently reaching its target audience. Specifically, our survey results  show that sponsors of more than 90 percent of 401(k) plans either did not  use or did not know about Labor\u2019s resources. We recognize that reaching  sponsors may be challenging, but attempts to directly reach sponsors and  help ensure they are considering all the relevant information when making  plan decisions will be even more important as Labor\u2019s regulatory changes  take effect. Consequently, we continue to believe new approaches to  outreach are needed to help educate sponsors about complex fee  arrangements and ensure sponsors and participants do not pay higher  fees than necessary.", "With respect to our findings on the availability of Form 5500 data, Labor  shares our interest in making the data collected accessible to the public.  Regarding our recommendation that Labor provide additional  documentation to help users of the unedited Form 5500 data, Labor plans  to explore the implementation of our recommendation. With respect to our  recommendation that Labor enhance web access to facilitate sponsors\u2019  ability to compare and benchmark fees, Labor noted that a web tool for  these purposes would have a limited effectiveness because of some  inherent limitations to the Form 5500 data. Our report also outlines  limitations with the data including the fact that not all plan fees are explicitly  reported on the Form 5500. However, we continue to believe that the fee  information collected could help sponsors monitor and compare fees.  Additionally, while Labor also noted that it believes its new fee disclosure  regulations will be a better tool for expanding transparency and  encouraging informed comparison shopping by plan fiduciaries, as we  previously noted, the effects of these regulations remain unclear.  Furthermore, although Labor notes that the Form 5500 was not designed to  be a government database for evaluating compensation arrangements in  the pension plan market, it remains the primary and most comprehensive  source of information on U.S. private pension plans and could be more  effectively used to help sponsors. Thus, we reaffirm our recommendation to  enhance web access to publicly available Form 5500 data.", "Finally, with respect to our findings about the fiduciary status of service  providers, Labor stated that it appreciated our support for its recent effort  to update its rule defining the persons who are investment advice  fiduciaries under ERISA. Regarding our recommendation to evaluate the  types of individuals who should be considered ERISA fiduciaries, Labor  agreed that there are individuals and service providers who exert  significant control over plan decisions and should be held accountable for  the advice they provide as fiduciaries. Labor noted that this regulatory  initiative continues to be a high priority and that the agency plans to craft  a clear and workable regulation that provides the strongest possible  protections to individuals as well as to plan sponsors who offer retirement  plans for their workers. While our review focused on plan sponsors, we  recognize that 401(k) plan participants generally make investment  decisions for their own accounts and ultimately pay the vast majority of  plan fees. Therefore, we also agree with Labor\u2019s position that the  absence of adequate fiduciary protections and safeguards is particularly  problematic for plan participants.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

To help  ensure the plan was still within the scope of our review and that the  identified individual was the appropriate survey respondent to complete  the survey, we contracted with a survey research firm to call sampled  sponsors to confirm the name and contact information of the target.  Contractor staff used a call script, which we drafted, and included  questions about whether the plan was still active. The script also included  several screening questions to help determine whether our identified  target was the appropriate survey respondent. These questions were as  follows:", "Are you or a committee you serve on responsible for selecting the  companies that provide services such as recordkeeping, financial  advice, or managing securities, for your 401(k) plan?", "Are you or a committee you serve on responsible for selecting the  menu of investment options for your company\u2019s 401(k) plan?", "Are you or a committee you serve on responsible for handling non- investment decisions for your company\u2019s 401(k) plan, such as the  level of the employer match and rules about loans, vesting, and  coverage?", "We included these questions to help ensure that a person knowledgeable  about the plan received the survey and reduce the likelihood of response  bias being introduced by nonfiduciaries completing the survey.

We initially used  variables available in the Form 5500 data to look at plans\u2019 propensity to  respond to the survey. We looked at a couple of models, but found that  the stratification variable did as good a job of predicting response as the  other models. The differences between the models were not substantively  significant. The number of participants is the basis of our stratification  variable and a significant factor for the propensity of response.

We also reviewed  investment fund prospectuses associated with the investment options  included in the documents sponsors submitted to determine if their plans  paid these fees.

During our initial meeting with Labor officials on  November, 30, 2010, the most complete dataset available was for plan  year 2007 and plan year 2008 data would be available in the spring of  2011. However, according to Labor officials, 2008 data are the least  accurate and reliable of years 2007, 2008, and 2009\u2014with 2009 being  the most accurate. By January 2011, about 85 percent of the expected  filings for 2009 were received and validated. The main reason that Labor  has not received the remaining 15 percent of expected filings is because  plans can have later beginning and ending plan dates (i.e., December 30,  2009-December 31, 2010) and therefore are not yet required to file. For  example, if a plan\u2019s begin date is December 31, 2009, and end date is  December 31, 2010, the normal statutory deadline to file would be July  31, 2011.

On the basis of testimonial evidence from Labor  officials and representatives from other entities that regularly use Form  5500 data, and our review of key variables, we determined that the 2008  data were not sufficiently reliable for our purpose of identifying the  population of 401(k) plans for a single year.", "To assess the reliability of Labor\u2019s data, we (1) performed electronic  checking for errors in accuracy and completeness; (2) reviewed related  documentation, such as the system\u2019s Data Element Requirements; and  (3) held numerous meetings and remained in ongoing correspondence  with Labor to discuss data fields and analysis procedures. When we  found inconsistencies, for example, between the data and information  Labor officials told us about the structure of the file, we clarified them with  Labor. For example, during our interviews with Labor, we learned that the  unedited Form 5500 datasets contained duplicate filings for unique plans  (with a unique combination of an Employer Identification Number   and plan number), because filers may amend their returns and, for data  file pre-2009, steps would need to be taken to identify the most current  filing.

We also took the  following steps to edit the data:  Excluded other plan year filings: We first checked for and  removed records in the dataset that were not for the 2009 filing year.  Labor accepts and processes Form 5500 filings as companies  submit information, which could be for an earlier plan year, but  included in a different year\u2019s Form 5500 dataset.  401(k) plans: Because the scope of the job focuses on 401(k) plans  and not other pension plans, such as defined benefit plans, we  created a subset of the data for only 401(k) plans by reviewing  records in which the filer indicated \u201c2J\u201d as a pension feature. Labor  officials recommended that we review the plan name for variations of  401(k), such as \u201c401(k)\u201d or \u201c401k\u201d, because some filers do not  correctly complete or update their pension feature codes, a  recommendation that we incorporated into our design.", "Single-employer plans: We exclude multiemployer plan and  multiple-employer plan filers, because these plans are maintained by  more than one employer for special groups such as labor unions and  are typically managed by going to another source for a pension plan  model.
