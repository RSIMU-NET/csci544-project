GAO was asked to identify the (1) federal entities involved in cyber security R&D; (2) actions taken to improve oversight and coordination of federal cyber security R&D, including developing a federal research agenda; and (3) methods used for technology transfer at agencies with significant activities in this area. To do this, GAO examined relevant laws, policies, budget documents, plans, and reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Several federal entities are involved in federal cyber security research and development. The Office of Science and Technology Policy and OMB establish high-level research priorities. The Office of Science and Technology Policy is to coordinate the development of a federal research agenda for cyber security and oversee the National Science and Technology Council, which prepares R&D strategies that are to be coordinated across federal agencies. The Council operates through its committees, subcommittees, and interagency working groups, which oversee and coordinate activities related to specific science and technology disciplines. The Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development and the Cyber Security and Information Assurance Interagency Working Group are prominently involved in the coordination of cyber security research. In addition, other groups provide mechanisms for coordination of R&D efforts on an informal basis. The National Science Foundation and the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security fund much of this research. Federal entities have taken several important steps to improve the oversight and coordination of federal cyber security R&D, although limitations remain. Actions taken include chartering an interagency working group to focus on cyber security research, publishing a federal plan for guiding this research, reporting budget information for this research separately, and maintaining repositories of information on R&D projects. However, a federal cyber security research agenda has not been developed as recommended in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the federal plan did not fully address certain key elements. Further, the repositories do not contain information about all of the federally funded cyber security research projects in part because OMB had not issued guidance to ensure that agencies provided all information required for the repositories. As a result, information needed for oversight and coordination of cyber security research activities was not readily available. Federal agencies use a variety of methods for sharing the results of cyber security research with federal and private organizations (technology transfer), including sharing information through agency Web sites. Other methods include relying on the researcher to disseminate information about his or her research, attending conferences and workshops, working with industry to share information about emerging threats and research, and publishing journals to help facilitate information sharing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Dramatic increases in computer interconnectivity, especially in the use of  the Internet, continue to revolutionize the way our government, our  nation, and much of the world communicate and conduct business.  However, computers, networks, and their infrastructures were not always  designed with security in mind.

Federal law and policy call for critical infrastructure  protection activities to enhance the cyber and physical security of the  infrastructures that are essential to national security, national economic  security, and national public health and safety. These activities include  building public-private partnerships, identifying critical infrastructure  sectors, identifying federal agencies to work with the sectors to coordinate  efforts to strengthen the security of critical infrastructures, and research  and development (R&D) of cyber security tools and techniques. Research  in cyber security technology is essential to creating a broader range of  choices and more robust tools for building secure, networked computer  systems in the federal government and in the private sector.

As public and private  organizations use computer systems to transfer more and greater amounts  of money, sensitive economic and commercial information, and critical  defense and intelligence information, the likelihood increases that  malicious individuals will attempt to penetrate current security  technologies, disrupt or disable our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures, and  use sensitive and critical information for malicious purposes.", "In a May 2004 report, we discussed how cyber security technologies can  provide a near-term solution for improving critical infrastructure security  vulnerabilities. However, these technologies offer only single-point  solutions by addressing individual vulnerabilities; they do not provide a  complete solution. For example, firewalls can control the flow of traffic  between networks but cannot protect against threats from within the  network; antivirus software can provide some protection against viruses  and worms but cannot protect the confidentiality of the data residing on  the system. As a result, many researchers have described the use of these  types of near-term solutions as being short-sighted. They argue that it is  necessary to design systems with built-in security because it is difficult to  deploy secure systems based on insecure components. In addition,  researchers have indicated that long-term efforts are needed, such as  researching cyber security vulnerabilities, developing technological  solutions, and transitioning research results into commercially available  products. Research in cyber security technology can help create a broader  range of choices and more robust tools for building secure, networked  computer systems.", "Recent cyber attacks and threats have underscored the need to strengthen  and coordinate the federal government\u2019s cyber security R&D efforts.

However, key  elements of the federal research agenda called for in the National Strategy  to Secure Cyberspace have not been developed, thereby increasing the  risk that mid- and longer-term research priorities may not be achieved.  Without sufficient guidance on reporting R&D information for  governmentwide repositories, the repositories cannot be fully populated  with data on all cyber security research projects, diminishing their  usefulness for coordinating research activities and facilitating technology  transfer of research results. Until these issues are addressed, federal  research for cyber security and information assurance may not keep pace  with the increasing number of threats and vulnerabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen cyber security research and development programs, we  recommend that the Director of the Office of Science and Technology  Policy take the following action:    Establish firm timelines for the completion of the federal cyber security  R&D agenda that includes near-term, mid-term, and long-term research.  Such an agenda should include the following elements: timelines and milestones for conducting research and development  activities;    goals and measures for evaluating research and development activities;    assignment of responsibility for implementation, including the  accomplishment of the focus areas and suggested research priorities; and  the alignment of funding priorities with technical priorities.", "We also recommend that the Director of the Office of Management and  Budget implement the following action:  Issue guidance to agencies on reporting information about federally  funded cyber security R&D projects to the governmentwide repositories."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["A Senior Policy Analyst in the Office of Science and Technology Policy  provided technical comments on a draft of this report, but did not  comment on our recommendation that the office establish timelines for  the completion of the federal cyber security R&D agenda. We have  considered and incorporated the technical comments into the report as  appropriate.", "In providing oral comments on a draft of this report, OMB officials stated  that OMB\u2019s August 2006 Fiscal Year 2006 E-Government Act Reporting  Instructions require agencies that fund federal R&D activities to describe  how they fulfill their responsibilities under section 207(g) of the E- Government Act, including how their R&D information is available  through RaDiUS, science.gov, or other means. The officials stated that  after reviewing the agencies\u2019 reports and other information, they will  consider whether specific guidance is necessary to further ensure agencies  provide all R&D information as required under section 207(g) of the E- Government Act.", "In addition, they were concerned with the report\u2019s limited scope\u2014cyber  security R&D\u2014and stated that the requirement to specify and report cyber  security as a separate category of R&D is a recent change and therefore  might bias the report\u2019s findings. We acknowledge that the scope of our  review was limited to cyber security R&D which is why we limited the  scope of our findings and recommendations to cyber security R&D. The  recent change in reporting requirements relates to the reporting of  budgetary information and does not affect our finding on reporting project  information to the central repositories.", "The National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards  and Technology provided technical comments, which we have  incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  date of this letter.

We also reviewed NITRD budgetary documents,  examined federal policy, reviewed the Office of Management and Budget  reports and guidance, observed meetings and reviewed meeting agendas  and minutes to determine the extent of coordination for federal cyber  security R&D. To evaluate the development of a governmentwide research  agenda, we reviewed the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace to  determine the requirements for the annual federal cyber security R&D  agenda and compared them to the Federal Plan for Cyber Security and  Information Assurance Research and Development issued by the  Interagency Working Group on Cyber Security and Information Assurance.  To evaluate the completeness of the RaDiUS repository, in March 2006, we  executed search queries on \u201ccybersecurity\u201d, \u201ccyber security\u201d, \u201ccyber\u201d,  \u201ccyber trust\u201d and \u201cinformation assurance\u201d to determine whether the  database contained cyber-related program data for the federal agencies.
