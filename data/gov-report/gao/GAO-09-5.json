While DOD recently established criteria for identifying supplier-base characteristics that could be problem indicators--such as sole-source suppliers and obsolete or emerging technologies--these criteria have primarily been applied to the missile and space sectors and have not been used to guide the identification and monitoring of supplier-base concerns for all sectors departmentwide. DOD uses an informal approach to identify supplier-base concerns, often relying on the military services, program offices, or prime contractors to identify and report these concerns, including gaps or potential gaps. As no requirement for when to report such gaps to higher-level offices exist, knowledge of defense supplier-base gaps across DOD may be limited. While 16 of the 20 program officials GAO surveyed reported that they identified supplier gaps or potential gaps over the past 5 years, only 4 reported sharing this information with Industrial Policy. These gaps included obsolescence of components and items with only one available supplier. Program offices often relied on the prime contractor to identify and help address supplier-base gaps, and prime contractors and programs generally used their discretion as to when to report gaps to higher levels. As a result, Industrial Policy may not be receiving information to help it activate available tools, such as the authorities under the Defense Production Act, to mitigate supplier-base gaps."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on thousands of suppliers to  The Department of Defense (DOD) relies on thousands of suppliers to  ensure that it has the weapons, supporting equipment, and raw materials  ensure that it has the weapons, supporting equipment, and raw materials  that it needs to meet U.S. national security objectives and maintain U.S.  that it needs to meet U.S. national security objectives and maintain U.S.  military superiority.

Its mission is to sustain an environment that ensures the industrial  base on which DOD depends is reliable, cost-effective, and sufficient to  meet its requirements. Industrial Policy defines reliability as suppliers  providing contracted products and service in a timely manner; cost- effectiveness as the delivery of products and services at or below target  costs; and sufficiency as suppliers delivering contracted products and  services that meet prescribed performance requirements. DOD\u2019s Program  Executive Officers manage a portfolio of programs related to weapon  systems. DOD also relies on a cadre of military and civilian officials\u2014 known as program managers\u2014to lead the development and delivery of  individual weapon systems. Program managers or their designees interact  with prime contractors who manage subcontractors to provide the final  good or service to DOD. Currently, DOD relies primarily on about six  prime contractors who manage thousands of subcontractors for DOD  systems.", "DOD has a variety of authorities, including laws, regulations, and an  executive order, that govern its interaction with the defense supplier base.  There are several key authorities available to DOD for maintaining  information on its suppliers as well as ensuring a domestic capability for  certain items, such as radiation-hardened microprocessors. In addition,  the Department of Commerce has authority to assess the supplier base to  support the national defense, and has conducted 15 supplier-base  assessments in the past 5 years, including studies on imaging and sensor  technology.

The military services,  Industrial Policy, and other DOD components collect information about  the health and viability of certain defense supplier-base sectors. However,  DOD has not applied departmentwide criteria to determine supplier-base  characteristics that could result in reduced or nonavailability of needed  items. As part of its supplier-base monitoring efforts, DOD has previously  created lists of specific items that are considered critical at a point in time,  but lists such as these run the risk of becoming obsolete and do not focus  on supplier-base characteristics that could guide identification of  problems. To better target its monitoring resources, Industrial Policy  recently established criteria for supplier-base characteristics that could be  indicators of supply concerns.  These criteria have primarily been applied  to the missile and space defense sectors and have not been used to guide  the identification and monitoring of supplier-base concerns for all sectors  departmentwide.", "The military services and other DOD components conduct studies on their  respective suppliers, often in response to supplier concerns for individual  programs. For example, the Army\u2019s Aviation and Missile Research,  Development, and Engineering Center studies availability issues for Army  missile and space programs, such as the availability of raw materials for  these programs. The Air Force Research Laboratory conducts assessments  that range from annual studies of key supply sectors to evaluations of the  supplier base for individual components or materials, such as beryllium.  Within the Navy, the Fire Scout vertical takeoff and unmanned aerial  vehicle program had an industrial capability assessment conducted of its  supplier base before it proceeded to the production phase of the program.  Officials from the Missile Defense Agency told us they have dedicated staff  to monitor the supplier base for each of the agency\u2019s 12 programs and  have contracted for support to help improve supply-chain management  between the agency\u2019s program offices and their prime contractors.", "The Secretary of Defense is required by legislation to report annually to  Congress on the supplier base. Industrial Policy prepares these reports,  which provide a broad analysis of supplier trends and summarize supplier- base studies performed by various DOD components. For example,  Industrial Policy reports on the percentage of prime contracts with a value  of $25,000 or greater awarded to foreign suppliers. In addition, Industrial  Policy also intermittently reports on foreign reliance for selected weapon  programs. For example, in both 2001 and 2004, Industrial Policy reported  to Congress on overall foreign reliance for 8 and 12 selected weapon  programs, respectively. Industrial Policy also reports annually on  industrial capabilities, including a macro-level summary of DOD\u2019s seven  supplier sectors and a summary of capabilities assessments conducted  within DOD\u2014which totaled 47 in 2007. Industrial Policy also provides  quarterly updates on the financial and economic metrics of various  defense suppliers; convened a roundtable of companies to identify barriers  to conducting business with DOD; chartered a cross-department work  group to collaborate on tasks related to defense supplier-base challenges,  such as sole sources of supply and barriers to competition; and conducted  other activities to foster knowledge of the defense supplier base. To  support supplier-base analyses by Industrial Policy and the military  services, the Defense Contract Management Agency\u2019s Industrial Analysis  Center conducts program- and sector-specific defense supplier-base  studies, as well as conducting analysis to support DOD\u2019s studies of foreign  reliance. While these multiple efforts have provided the various DOD  components with information about specific suppliers, they have not  provided a DOD-wide view of supplier-base characteristics that could be  indicators of problems\u2014in large part because the efforts are not guided by  departmentwide criteria for identifying and monitoring supplier-base  concerns.", "In addition, DOD has also developed lists of items deemed critical at a  point in time as part of its supplier-base monitoring efforts. For example,  in 2003, after insufficient visibility, planning, and programming led to  shortages of several mission-essential items during Operations Iraqi  Freedom and Enduring Freedom, the Joint Staff directed the military  services, the Defense Logistics Agency, the Defense Contract Management  Agency, and the Combatant Commanders to create a list of the their  respective top 20 \u201cCritical Few\u201d material readiness-shortfall items. Criteria  for selecting items included those with high variances in wartime versus  peacetime demand, military-unique characteristics without a commercial  substitute, and limited industrial-base capacity. DOD developed a  classified list of 25 items in 2003 that, according to officials, has not been  updated. Similarly, an Army regulation and Air Force directive cite the  development and use of \u201ccritical items lists.\u201d However, officials from both  services stated that the language in these authorities is outdated and the  lists, if ever developed, are no longer used. According to Industrial Policy,  lists such as these only capture items that are deemed critical at a point in  time and, therefore, do not reflect changes in industry, technology, and  DOD requirements.", "The Air Force has initiated efforts to establish criteria to track supplier- base concerns. Specifically, the Air Force\u2019s Space and Missile Systems  Center, under direction from the National Security Space Office,  established a Space Industrial Base Program in order to address issues  affecting the Air Force\u2019s ability to develop and deploy space systems.  According to Air Force officials, this action was a result of DOD Directive  5101.2. The center developed a method for identifying and tracking  defense items with supplier-base concerns, defining such items as those  whose loss or impending loss of manufacturers or suppliers has the  potential to severely affect the program in terms of schedule, performance,  or cost if left unresolved. Specifically, criteria for identifying and  monitoring these items is based on supplier-base characteristics such as  uneconomical production requirements, foreign-source competition,  limited availability, or increasing cost of items and raw materials used in  the manufacturing process. According to the Space and Missile Systems  Center, based on the criteria it developed, it identified approximately 80  critical items in its space systems and coordinated with the Aerospace  Corporation, a federally funded research and development center, to track  the supplier base for these items.", "According to Industrial Policy, the breadth of DOD\u2019s programs requires  that it selectively monitor DOD\u2019s supplier base. In turn, to better target  supplier-monitoring resources, Industrial Policy recently established  criteria for identifying conditions that could be indicators of supplier-base  concerns for certain defense items, deeming these items as \u201cimportant.\u201d Its  criteria for such important items include those produced by a sole source;  used by three or more programs; representing obsolete, enabling, or  emerging technologies; requiring long lead times to manufacture; or having  limited surge-production capability. According to Industrial Policy, this  internal effort grew out of DOD\u2019s development of its critical asset list, and  the organization uses the \u201cimportant\u201d designation to help it identify  components and their suppliers that have the most potential to negatively  affect production across program and service lines. However, while  Industrial Policy uses these criteria, it is not aware of similar use by other  DOD organizations. Industrial Policy has used these criteria to identify  important components in the missile and space sectors, and has yet to use  these criteria to guide the identification and monitoring of supplier-base  concerns for all sectors departmentwide. According to Industrial Policy,  the missile and space sectors have the preponderance of important items  because they contain few commercial off-the-shelf components and a  greater number of defense-unique components and, therefore, these  sectors contain the most sole-source suppliers. According to Industrial  Policy, these sectors are most likely to experience rapid production  increases during times of conflict\u2014another contributing factor. Examples  of items identified in these sectors include thermal batteries, tactical  missile rocket motors, lithium-ion batteries, and traveling-wave tubes.  While still early in the process, Industrial Policy reported that it has used  these criteria to help identify and work towards mitigating supplier-base  concerns within the space and missile sectors. Specifically, the Defense  Production Act Title III was used to improve domestic manufacturing  performance for two items deemed important\u2014traveling-wave tubes and  long-life lithium-ion batteries. In a separate effort, Industrial Policy stated  it is collaborating with the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s National Defense  Stockpile Center to create departmentwide criteria for the terms,  \u201ccritical,\u201d \u201cstrategic,\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d and expects the Defense Logistics  Agency to report to Congress by the end of calendar year 2008 on the  results of this effort.", "As required by statute, in 2007 DOD established a Strategic Materials  Protection Board to determine the need to provide long-term domestic  supply of materials critical to national security to ensure that national  defense needs are met, analyze risks associated with potential  nonavailability of these materials from domestic sources, and recommend  a strategy to the President to ensure domestic availability of these  materials. The Board has initially defined critical materials as those that  perform a unique function for defense systems and have no viable  alternative; DOD dominates the market for the material; and has  significant and unacceptable risk of supply disruption if there are  insufficient U.S. or reliable non-U.S. suppliers. However, the Board\u2019s focus  is to assess only the criticality of materials, such as specialty metals, not to  identify and track critical defense items or components."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Uses an Informal Approach to Identify Supplier-Base Concerns, with No Departmentwide Reporting Requirement on When to Elevate These Concerns", "paragraphs": ["DOD often relies on the military services, program offices, or prime  contractors to identify supplier-base concerns, including gaps and  potential gaps, with no departmentwide requirement for when to report  these gaps to higher-level offices.

Most of the program officials we surveyed had supplier-base concerns in  the last 5 years (see table 1). Specifically, 16 of the 20 program officials we  surveyed reported facing supplier gaps or potential gaps, including  obsolescence of component parts or technologies, diminishing  manufacturing sources for components, and production challenges. In  addition, 15 of the 20 program officials identified sole sources of supply  for components of their weapon systems. Seventeen of the program  officials we surveyed said these supplier-base concerns were identified by  their prime contractors, which maintain detailed knowledge of the  supplier base.", "Many of the program officials we interviewed maintain frequent contact  with their prime contractors and noted that this level of communication  facilitates supplier-base knowledge. Specifically, 19 out of 20 program  officials we surveyed said their prime contractor often identified and  provided supplier-base information to them and that communication was  frequent when a supplier-base concern arose. Program officials had  varying degrees of knowledge of their supplier tiers\u201418 reported that they  maintain knowledge of their program\u2019s supplier base at the prime- contractor level, while 9 maintained knowledge of the lowest-tier  subcontractor of the supply chain. One program official noted that  knowledge of the lower-tier suppliers is gained as issues arise, and another  stated that knowledge of these lower tiers is based on assessed  \u201ccriticality\u201d to the program\u2014which is defined on a program-by-program  basis.", "The four prime contractors that we interviewed about their own corporate  insight into the supplier base noted that they had extensive internal  corporate metrics to evaluate the health and performance of their  subcontractors, which offered the companies a degree of visibility into  their supply chains, from second-tier subcontractors to lower-tier  suppliers of raw materials. For example, one of the prime contractors had  software that allowed it to analyze and measure data on each supplier  within its network. It captured data on each supplier\u2019s performance  based on the quality of its work and the delivery of its product, which  resulted in a combined performance rating. Examples of other metrics  tracked include supplier biography, report card results, trend analysis of  performance ratings over a period of time such as a calendar year, and the  combined performance rating of a part that a supplier manufactures for a  particular system.", "To address reported supplier gaps, program offices took a variety of  actions. For example, actions to address supplier gaps in the area of  obsolescence ranged from large-scale purchases, known as life-time buys,  to initiating component redesign. In other instances the gap has not yet  been solved. The Space Tracking Surveillance System program relies on  one company to supply the base materials used to produce nickel- hydrogen batteries, which are critical to this program. However, this  company plans to cease production of these batteries in 2009 or shortly  thereafter; yet an alternate source of supply has not been identified. In  another instance the Hellfire Missile program is working with the Army  Program Executive Officer for Missiles and Space along with Industrial  Policy to request a waiver to procure a chemical that is no longer  produced in the United States from a company in China. The program is  also exploring whether a Navy facility could produce the chemical in the  quantities needed by this and other military programs that use this  chemical."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Programs Lack Requirements for Elevating Supplier-Base Concerns to Higher DOD Levels", "paragraphs": ["Program officials and prime contractors we spoke with stated that they  use their discretion for when to report supplier-base concerns. Programs  are not required to report supplier issues to their program executive  officer or to higher levels within DOD, such as Industrial Policy, and most  programs do not have contractual requirements with their prime  contractor to direct when a supplier issue must be reported.", "While program officials reported working closely with their prime  contractors to address concerns once they were identified, program  officials and prime contractors we spoke with told us that it is a judgment  call as to when to report supplier-base concerns to higher levels within  DOD. For example, for the 20 program officials we surveyed, 17 reported  that they had shared information on supplier concerns with their  cognizant program executive officer. However, only four programs, all of  which faced supplier gaps in the last 5 years, reported sharing such  information with Industrial Policy. Thirteen program officials we surveyed  stated that no requirement exists for when their program office should  report supplier-base concerns to higher levels within DOD.", "Similarly, nine of 20 program officials told us that no requirement exists  for what should trigger a prime contractor to report a supplier-base  concern to them. One of these programs, the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, is  in the process of creating a requirement for when its prime contractor  should notify it of supplier concerns. According to program officials, the  Hellfire missile and Navy Fire Scout programs have imposed contractual  requirements on their prime contractors to report any supplier concerns.  Other program officials stated that while no formal requirement existed,  there was an understanding between their prime contractor and the  program office that any activity that will affect schedule, which could  include supplier-base concerns, must be reported to the program office.", "While addressing supplier gaps at the program- or program executive  officer\u2013level may be appropriate in many cases, program offices across the  military services rely on the same supplier base in some instances. In such  cases, concerns with these suppliers can become even more crucial if it is  a sole-source supplier. For example, multiple DOD programs in the space  sector rely on one provider for traveling-wave tube amplifiers needed for  satellite navigation purposes. According to officials from the Air Force\u2019s  Space and Missile Systems Center, it closely tracks this supplier because  any disruption in its production capability could adversely affect the cost,  schedule, and performance of multiple space programs. In addition,  officials from the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile program told us  that production delays with its inertial measurement unit also affected the  Army\u2019s Tactical Missile System program, as it uses this same unit from this  company. However, DOD may not be aware of these types of cross- department concerns in other supplier-base sectors because it does not  have a framework for programs to report information on supplier gaps and  vulnerabilities for critical items.", "In addition, Industrial Policy may benefit from receiving information on  supplier gaps and vulnerabilities to help it achieve its mission to sustain an  environment that ensures the industrial base on which DOD depends is  reliable, cost-effective, and sufficient to meet its requirements. A  framework for programs to report supplier-gap information could assist  Industrial Policy\u2019s decisions on when to activate available tools to mitigate  supplier-base concerns, such as the authorities under the Defense  Production Act. As we recently reported in a review of Defense  Production Act use since its 2003 reauthorization, 25 DOD projects have  received Title III funding over the past several years, totaling almost $420  million in assistance. Almost half of the projects received funds in order to  establish a domestic source of supply or to help alleviate dependence on  sole sources of supply.

While DOD components, such as the Air  Force\u2019s Space and Missile Systems Center, have taken action to identify  and monitor supplier-base concerns, these efforts have been limited in  scope or lacked departmentwide involvement. DOD has an opportunity to  leverage the various efforts taken by its components into a  departmentwide framework for identifying and monitoring supplier-base  concerns. Considering the dynamic nature of the defense supplier base,  this model could take into account recent efforts by Industrial Policy to  establish characteristics that could be indicators of supply concerns.  Further, by relying on individual program offices and their contractors to  determine when it is appropriate to raise concerns, DOD cannot be  assured that it is identifying all gaps that may need to be addressed at a  departmentwide level.

Create and disseminate DOD-wide written requirements for reporting  potential concerns about supplier-base gaps.

DOD indicated  that its ongoing Defense Acquisition Guidebook update presents a fitting  and timely opportunity to institutionalize these criteria into departmental  acquisition policy.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation, stating that  while there is merit in having formal, published criteria for making  judgments regarding when program offices should report supplier issues  to Industrial Policy, similar formal reporting criteria or contractual  mechanisms are not needed for prime contractors to report supplier-base  concerns to the program office. DOD expects prime contractors to  maintain internal corporate metrics to evaluate the health and  performance of their subcontractors and likewise expects program offices  to maintain frequent and open communication with their prime  contractors on supplier-base issues. Our recommendation is for DOD to  consider how best to facilitate the flow of this information between  program offices and their prime contractors, regardless of whether it is  through a contractual requirement or other means. This is particularly  important given the large role that contractors play in monitoring the  supplier base.  While we found that almost all of the 20 program officials  we surveyed relied on their prime contractors to provide supplier-base  information, including identification of supplier-base concerns, there is no  guidance to ensure that information is consistently elevated to the  appropriate levels. As such, we maintain that a mechanism is needed to  facilitate the flow of information from the prime contractor to the program  office, and from the program office to higher levels within DOD\u2014 especially for those concerns whose characteristics meet the criteria for  making judgments regarding suppliers and components for DOD.", "We also provided a draft of this report to the Department of Commerce.

We pretested a draft of our survey during  January and February 2008, with officials at five DOD program offices. In  the pretests, we were generally interested in the clarity of the questions as  well as the flow and layout of the survey. After these pretests, we then  made appropriate revisions to the survey instrument. We conducted the  survey between April and June 2008, through a series of e-mails beginning  on April 1 with prenotification e-mails, activated the survey on April 7, and  sent follow-up e-mails to nonrespondents on April 14 and 22, 2008. We  closed the survey on June 6, 2008, with a 100 percent response rate.", "To further determine how programs maintain knowledge of and monitor  their supplier base, we then tailored follow-up questions to all 20 program  officials to solicit information and documentation in areas such as  communication between and among DOD and its prime contractors, and  expansion on areas where programs experienced supplier gaps. We also  met with and obtained information and documentation from the prime  contractor for several of these programs, including officials from Boeing,  Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2007 to August 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Key Authorities for DOD Supplier Base", "paragraphs": ["Table 3 below describes several key authorities available to the  Department of Defense (DOD) for both maintaining information on its  suppliers as well as ensuring a domestic capability for certain items."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact name above, John Neumann, Assistant Director;  Tara Copp; Lisa Gardner; Michael Hanson; Ian Jefferies; Marie Ahearn;  Jean McSween; and Karen Sloan made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Defense Production Act: Agencies Lack Policies and Guidance for Use of  Key Authorities.
