On the other hand, companies faced almost no opposition in Dade County, where private management was used in a new school for which teachers and staff had not been hired, or in Minneapolis, where the private intervention involved primarily the superintendent position.", "Although scores on standardized achievement tests did not substantially improve in the three districts where test scores were available for analysis, in all four districts, the private management companies made changes that benefited students.

In explaining its preference for using spring 1993 test score results, EAI stated that its first priority after it was awarded the Baltimore contract in July 1992 was to focus on failures of the physical plant and safety issues. According to EAI, initial resistance to staff development programs also hindered progress in implementing improved instructional techniques. In addition, it took until February 1993 to install approximately 1,100 computers in the nine Baltimore contract schools. Because the CTBS test was again given in March 1993, EAI believes that the spring 1993 testing date is a far more accurate baseline date than is March 1992.", "We disagree with EAI\u2019s position on this issue and believe that 1992 is the appropriate baseline year. Using spring 1992 scores as a baseline provides a benchmark of student performance immediately before EAI\u2019s assuming management in the fall of 1992. Our goal was to assess changes in student performance that occurred while these schools were under EAI management. Using 1993 scores as the baseline ignores the impact of the first year of EAI management and thus fails to assess the entire experience.", "EAI also maintained that we failed to note the results of the Maryland State Performance Assessment Program (MSPAP) in our report.

In this regard, the company believes accountability must be adopted by stakeholders throughout the educational system, including teachers in their classrooms, principals in their schools, and parents and community members. Accountability throughout the system is imperative, PSG believes, for students to succeed.", "PSG also provided technical comments on the information contained in our draft report that we incorporated as appropriate. The most significant point on which we disagree with PSG concerns payment for superintendent services. Our report states that PSG was to receive a monthly fee of $5,000 for serving as superintendent. PSG said that, instead, the fee for superintendent services is paid on a pay-for-performance basis; that is, it would only be paid if the district were satisfied with PSG\u2019s progress as superintendent.
