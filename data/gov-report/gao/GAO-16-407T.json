For example, according to DHS, the  department does not have information on all of its employees, which  reduces its abilities to strategically manage its workforce and best deploy  people in support of homeland security missions. Additionally, according  to DHS, reporting and analyzing enterprise human capital data are  currently time-consuming, labor-intensive, and challenging because the  department\u2019s data management largely consists of disconnected,  standalone systems, with multiple data sources for the same content.", "To address these issues, in 2003, DHS initiated the HRIT investment,  which is intended to consolidate, integrate, and modernize the  department\u2019s and its components\u2019 human resources IT infrastructure.  These components include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the  Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Law Enforcement  Training Center, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the  Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Services, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Secret Service.", "HRIT is managed by DHS\u2019s Human Capital Business Systems unit, which  is within the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer and has overall  responsibility for HRIT.

This was due to, among other  things, limited coordination with and commitment from DHS\u2019s  components. To address this problem, in 2010 the DHS Deputy Secretary  issued a memorandum emphasizing that DHS\u2019s wide variety of human  resources processes and IT systems inhibited the ability to unify DHS and  negatively impacted operating costs. Accordingly, the Deputy Secretary  memorandum prohibited component spending on enhancements to  existing human resources systems or acquisitions of new solutions,  unless those expenditures were approved by the Offices of the Chief  Human Capital Officer or Chief Information Officer. The memorandum  also directed these offices to develop a department-wide human  resources architecture.", "In 2011, in response to the Deputy Secretary\u2019s direction, the department  developed a strategic planning document referred to as the Human  Capital Segment Architecture blueprint, which redefined the HRIT  investment\u2019s scope and implementation time frames. As part of this effort,  DHS conducted a system inventory and determined that it had 422  human resources systems and applications, many of which were single- use solutions developed to respond to a small need or links to enable  disparate systems to work together. DHS reported that these numerous,  antiquated, and fragmented systems inhibited its ability to perform basic  workforce management functions necessary to support mission critical  programs.", "To address this issue, the blueprint articulated that HRIT would be  comprised of 15 strategic improvement opportunity areas (e.g., enabling  seamless, efficient, and transparent end-to-end hiring) and outlined 77  associated projects (e.g., deploying a department-wide hiring system) to  implement these 15 opportunities.", "HRIT\u2019s only ongoing program is called PALMS and is intended to fully  address the Performance Management strategic improvement opportunity  area and its three associated projects.

Further,  HRIT officials stated that DHS has not yet started to work on the  remaining nine improvement opportunities, and the officials did not know  when they would be addressed.", "Additionally, DHS developed an HRIT strategic plan for fiscal years 2012  through 2016 that outlined the investment\u2019s key goals and objectives,  including reducing duplication and improving efficiencies in the  department\u2019s human resources processes and systems. The strategic  plan identified, among other things, two performance metrics that were  focused on reductions in the number of component-specific human  resources IT services provided and increases in the number of  department-wide HRIT services provided by the end of fiscal year 2016.", "However, DHS has also made limited progress in achieving these two  performance targets. Figure 1 provides a summary of HRIT\u2019s progress  towards achieving its service delivery performance targets.", "Key causes for DHS\u2019s lack of progress in implementing HRIT and its  associated strategic improvement opportunities include unplanned  resource changes and the lack of involvement of the HRIT executive  steering committee. These causes are discussed in detail below:", "Unplanned resource changes. DHS elected to dedicate the vast  majority of HRIT\u2019s resources to implementing PALMS and addressing  its problems, rather than initiating additional HRIT strategic  improvement opportunities. Specifically, PALMS\u2014which began in July  2012\u2014experienced programmatic and technical challenges that led to  years-long schedule delays. For example, while the PALMS system  for headquarters was originally planned to be delivered by a vendor in  December 2013, as of November 2015, the expected delivery date  was delayed until the end of February 2016\u2014an over 2-year delay.  HRIT officials explained the decision to focus primarily on PALMS was  due, in part, to the investment\u2019s declining funding. However, in doing  so, attention was concentrated on the immediate issues affecting  PALMS and diverted from the longer-term HRIT mission.", "Lack of involvement of the HRIT executive steering committee. The  HRIT executive steering committee\u2014which is chaired by the  department\u2019s Under Secretary for Management and co-chaired by the  Chief Information Officer and Chief Human Capital Officer\u2014is  intended to be the core oversight and advisory body for all DHS-wide  matters related to human capital IT investments, expenditures,  projects, and initiatives. In addition, according to the committee\u2019s  charter, the committee is to approve and provide guidance on the  department\u2019s mission, vision, and strategies for the HRIT program.", "However, the executive steering committee only met once from  September 2013 through June 2015\u2014in July 2014\u2014and was  minimally involved with HRIT for that almost 2 year period. It is  important to note that DHS replaced its Chief Information Officer (the  executive steering committee\u2019s co-chair) in December 2013\u2014during  this gap in oversight. Also during this time period HRIT\u2019s only ongoing  program\u2014PALMS\u2014was experiencing significant problems, including  schedule slippages and frequent turnover in its program manager  position (i.e., PALMS had five different program managers during the  time that the HRIT executive steering committee was minimally  involved). As a result of the executive steering committee not meeting,  key governance activities were not completed on HRIT. For example,  the committee did not approve HRIT\u2019s notional operational plan for  fiscal years 2014 through 2019. Officials from the Offices of the  Chief Human Capital Officer and Chief Information Officer attributed  the lack of HRIT executive steering committee meetings and  committee involvement in HRIT to the investment\u2019s focus being only  on the PALMS program to address its issues, as discussed earlier.  However, by not regularly meeting and providing oversight during a  time when a new co-chair for the executive steering committee  assumed responsibility and PALMS was experiencing such problems,  the committee\u2019s guidance to the troubled program was limited.", "More recently, the HRIT executive steering committee met in June  and October 2015, and officials from the Offices of the Chief Human  Capital Officer and Chief Information Officer stated that the committee  planned to meet quarterly going forward. However, while the  committee\u2019s charter specified that it meet on at least a monthly basis  for the first year, the charter does not specify the frequency of  meetings following that year. Furthermore, the committee\u2019s charter  has not been updated to reflect the increased frequency of these  meetings.", "As a result of the limited progress in implementing HRIT, DHS is unaware  of when critical weaknesses in the department\u2019s human capital  environment will be addressed, which is, among other things, impacting  DHS\u2019s ability to carry out its mission. For example, the end-to-end hiring  strategic improvement opportunity (which has an unknown  implementation date) was intended to streamline numerous systems and  multiple hand-offs in order to more efficiently and effectively hire  appropriately skilled personnel, thus enabling a quicker response to  emergencies, catastrophic events, and threats.", "We recommended in our report that DHS\u2019s Under Secretary for  Management update the HRIT executive steering committee charter to  establish the frequency with which the committee meetings are to be  held, and ensure that the committee is consistently involved in overseeing  and advising HRIT. DHS agreed with both of these recommendations and  stated that the executive steering committee charter would be updated  accordingly by the end of February 2016; and that by April 30, 2016, the  Under Secretary plans to ensure that the committee is consistently  involved in overseeing and advising HRIT."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HRIT Lacked a Current Schedule, Life-Cycle Cost Estimate, and Cost Tracking", "paragraphs": ["According to the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide, a key activity in  effectively managing a program and ensuring progress is establishing and  maintaining a schedule estimate.

Specifically, neither schedule was updated to reflect that  DHS did not implement 13 of the 15 improvement opportunities by their  planned completion dates\u2014several of which should have been  implemented over 3 years ago. HRIT officials attributed the lack of  schedule updates to the investment\u2019s focus shifting to the PALMS  program when it started experiencing significant schedule delays.

According to the Human  Capital Segment Architecture blueprint, the Office of the Chief Human  Capital Officer roughly estimated that implementing all of the projects  could cost up to $120 million. However, the blueprint specified that this  figure did not represent the life-cycle cost estimate; rather it was intended  to be a preliminary estimate to initiate projects.

However, the September 2015  schedule reflected the deployment-related milestones (per component)  for only the learning management capabilities and did not include the  deployment-related milestones for the performance management  capabilities.", "In September 2015, PALMS officials stated that the deployments related  to performance management were not reflected in the program\u2019s  schedule because the components had not yet determined when they  would deploy these capabilities. Since then two components have  determined their planned dates for deploying these capabilities, but seven  (including headquarters) remain unknown. As a result, the program does  not know when PALMS will be fully implemented at all components with  all capabilities.", "Moreover, the schedule did not include all government-specific activities,  including tasks for employee union activities (such as notifying employee  unions and bargaining with them, where necessary) related to the  proposed implementation of the performance management capabilities.", "Without developing and maintaining a single comprehensive schedule  that fully integrates all government and contractor activities, and includes  all planned deployment milestones related to performance management,  DHS is limited in monitoring and overseeing the implementation of  PALMS, and managing the dependencies between program tasks and  milestones to ensure that it delivers capabilities when expected.  Consequently, we recommended that DHS develop and maintain a single  comprehensive schedule. DHS agreed and stated that, by May 30, 2016,  the PALMS program office will develop and maintain a single,  comprehensive schedule that includes all government and contractor  activities, and all planned milestones related to deploying the PALMS  system\u2019s performance management capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The PALMS Program Management Office Did Not Monitor Total Costs", "paragraphs": ["According to CMMI-ACQ and the PMBOK\u00ae Guide, a key activity for  tracking a program\u2019s performance is monitoring the project\u2019s costs by  comparing actual costs to the cost estimate. The PALMS program  management office\u2014which is responsible for overseeing the PALMS  implementation projects across DHS, including all of its components\u2014 monitored task order expenditures on a monthly basis. As of December  2015, DHS officials reported that they had issued approximately $18  million in task orders to the vendor.", "However, the program management office officials stated that they were  not monitoring the government-related costs associated with each of the  PALMS implementations. The officials stated that they were not tracking  government-related implementation costs at headquarters because many  of the headquarters program officials concurrently work on other  acquisition projects and these officials are not required to track the  amount of time spent working specifically on PALMS. The officials also  said that they were not monitoring the government-related costs for each  of the component PALMS implementation projects because it would be  difficult to obtain and verify the cost data provided by the components.  We acknowledge the department\u2019s difficulties associated with obtaining  and verifying component cost data; however, monitoring the program\u2019s  costs is essential to keeping costs on track and alerting management of  potential cost overruns. As such, we recommended that DHS track and  monitor all costs associated with the PALMS program. DHS concurred  with our recommendation and stated that it plans to have the PALMS  program office track and monitor all costs associated with the PALMS  program by March 30, 2016.", "In summary, although the HRIT investment was initiated about 12 years  ago with the intent to consolidate, integrate, and modernize the  department\u2019s human resources IT infrastructure, DHS has made very  limited progress in achieving these goals. HRIT\u2019s minimally involved  executive steering committee during a time when significant problems  were occurring was a key factor in the lack of progress. Moreover, DHS\u2019s  lack of use of program management best practices for HRIT and PALMS  also contributed to the neglect this investment has experienced.  Implementing our recommendations is critical to the department  addressing its fragmented and duplicative human resources environment  that is hindering the department\u2019s ability to efficiently and effectively  perform its mission.", "Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Watson Coleman, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
