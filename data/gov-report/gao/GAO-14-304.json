Contracts that use the urgency exception to competition must generally be no longer than one year in duration.", "The conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2013 mandated GAO to examine DOD's, State's, and USAID's use of this exception. For the three agencies, GAO assessed (1) the pattern of use, (2) the reasons agencies awarded urgent noncompetitive contracts and the extent to which justifications met FAR requirements; and (3) the extent to which agencies limited the duration. GAO analyzed federal procurement data, interviewed contracting officials, and analyzed a non-generalizable sample of 62 contracts with a mix of obligation levels and types of goods and services procured across the three agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Departments of Defense (DOD) and State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) used the urgency exception to a limited extent, but the reliability of some federal procurement data elements is questionable. For fiscal years 2010 through 2012, obligations reported under urgent noncompetitive contracts ranged from less than 1 percent to about 12 percent of all noncompetitive contract obligations. During that time, DOD obligated $12.5 billion noncompetitively to procure goods and services using the urgency exception, while State and USAID obligated $582 million and about $20 million respectively, almost exclusively to procure services. Among the items procured were personal armor, guard services and communications equipment to support missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. GAO found coding errors that raise concerns about the reliability of federal procurement data on the use of the urgency exception. Nearly half\u201428 of the 62 contracts in GAO's sample\u2014were incorrectly coded as having used the urgency exception when they did not. GAO found that 20 of the 28 miscoded contracts were awarded using procedures that are more simple and separate from the requirements related to the use of the urgency exception. Ensuring reliability of procurement data is critical as these data are used to inform procurement policy decisions and facilitate oversight.", "For the 34 contracts in GAO's sample that were properly coded as having used the urgency exception, agencies cited a range of urgent circumstances, primarily to meet urgent needs for combat operations or to avoid unanticipated gaps in program support. The justifications and approvals\u2014which are required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to contain certain facts and rationale to justify use of the urgency exception to competition\u2014generally contained the required elements; however, some were ambiguous about the specific risks to the government if the acquisition was delayed.", "Ten of the 34 contracts in GAO's sample had a period of performance of more than one year\u20148 of which were modified after award to extend the period of performance beyond 1 year. The FAR limits contracts using the urgency exception to one year in duration unless the head of the agency or a designee determines that exceptional circumstances apply. Agencies did not make this determination for the 10 contracts. The FAR is not clear about what steps agencies should take when a contract is modified after award to extend the period of performance over 1 year. Some contracting officials noted that these modifications are treated as separate contract actions and would not require the determination by the head of the agency or designee. Others considered them cumulative actions requiring the determination. Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government calls for organizations to maintain proper controls that ensure transparency and accountability for stewardship of government resources. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP)\u2014which provides governmentwide policy on federal contracting procedures\u2014is in a position to clarify when the determination of exceptional circumstances is needed to help achieve consistent implementation of this requirement across the federal government. Further, under the urgency exception, the FAR requires agencies to seek offers from as many vendors as practicable given the circumstances. For some contracts in GAO's sample, lack of access to technical data rights and reliance on contractor expertise prevented agencies from obtaining competition."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD, State and USAID provide guidance to improve data reliability and oversight for contracts awarded using the urgency exception.

Competition in contracting  is a critical tool for achieving the best return on investment for taxpayers  and can help save the taxpayer money, improve contractor performance,  and promote accountability for results. While federal statute and  acquisition regulations generally require that contracts be awarded on the  basis of full and open competition, they also allow agencies to award  noncompetitive contracts in certain circumstances. For example, when  the agency\u2019s need for goods and services is of an unusual and  compelling urgency that precludes full and open competition, agencies  may be permitted to award noncompetitive contracts where a delay in  award would result in serious financial or other injury to the government.  Nonetheless, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) pertaining to the  award of a noncompetitive contract on the basis of urgency requires that  agencies request offers from as many sources as is practicable given the  circumstances; however, agencies may limit the number of sources from  which it solicits offers.", "Promoting competition\u2014even in a limited form\u2014increases the potential  for quality goods and services at a lower price in urgent situations. Past  GAO work has found that the federal government may realize significant  cost savings when awarding contracts competitively. In fiscal year 2013,  the federal government obligated about $3 billion through noncompetitive  contracts on the basis of a compelling urgency to procure goods and  services. Noncompetitive contracts carry the risk of overspending  because, among other things, they have been negotiated without the  benefit of competition, to help establish pricing; one way to mitigate risk is  to limit the contract\u2019s performance period. In 2009, a new requirement  was included in the FAR that, among other things, limits the period of  performance for contracts awarded noncompetitively on the grounds of  urgency to no longer than 1 year unless there is a determination that  exceptional circumstances apply.", "The conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2013 mandated that GAO review the use of the unusual and  compelling urgency exception to full and open competition by the  Departments of Defense (DOD) and State and the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID). pattern of DOD\u2019s, State\u2019s, and USAID\u2019s use of the unusual and  compelling urgency exception, including the range of goods and services  acquired; (2) the reasons that agencies awarded noncompetitive  contracts on the basis of urgency, and the extent to which justifications  met requirements in the FAR; and (3) the extent to which agencies limited  the duration of the contract and achieved competition in urgent situations.", "H.R.

Examples of allowable exceptions  to full and open competition include circumstances when the contractor is  the only source capable of performing the work or when disclosure of the  agency\u2019s need would compromise national security. An agency may also  award a contract noncompetitively when the need for goods and services  is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the federal  government faces the risk of serious financial or other injury.", "When using the urgency exception to competition, an agency may limit  competition to the firms it reasonably believes can perform the work in the  time available. However, an agency is not permitted to award a  noncompetitive contract where the urgent need has been brought about  due to a lack of advanced planning. Unlike the other exceptions to  competition provided by the FAR, awards that use the urgency exception  have certain time restrictions. Specifically, the total period of performance  is limited to the time necessary to meet the requirement and for the  agency to enter into another contract through the use of competitive  procedures. Further, the period of performance may not exceed 1 year  unless the head of the agency or appointed designee determines that  exceptional circumstances apply.", "Generally, noncompetitive awards must be supported by written  justifications that contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify use of the  specific exception to competition that is being applied to the procurement.  At a minimum, justifications must include 12 elements specified in the  FAR, including a description of the goods and services being procured,  market research conducted, and efforts to solicit offers, among other  things, as shown in figure 1.", "For noncompetitive awards using the urgency exception, justifications  may be prepared and approved within a reasonable time after award  when doing so prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.  Justifications are to be published\u2014on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FedBizOpps)\u2014generally, within 30 days after contract award.Additionally, justifications must be approved at various levels within the  contracting organization. These levels vary according to the estimated  total dollar value of the proposed contract, including all options. As  outlined in table 1, the approval levels range from the contracting officer  for smaller dollar contracts up to the agency\u2019s senior procurement  executive for larger dollar contracts.", "The FAR has more streamlined procedures for awarding contracts under  the simplified acquisition threshold\u2014generally less than $150,000. These  smaller dollar awards are exempt from the justification and documentation  requirements described above for contracts over this threshold. For  example, contracting officers awarding a contract under simplified  acquisition procedures must only document the determination that  competition was not feasible; no approval beyond the contracting officer  is required. Further, agencies do not have to document the extent and  nature of the harm to the government that necessitates limiting  competition when using simplified acquisition procedures. When using  these procedures, agencies may solicit an offer from one contractor in  certain circumstances, including when the contracting officer determines  that only one source is reasonably available.", "In general, once a contract is awarded, the awarding agency must enter  certain information into FPDS-NG, the federal government\u2019s database  that captures information on contract awards and obligations.

Consistent  with FPDS-NG database instructions, using this approach would restrict  the data entry options available when reporting the reason not competed  to simplified acquisition procedures. During the course of our review, the  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) within DOD used this approach to  correct the entry in FPDS-NG for two awards under $150,000 that are  now recorded as sole-source awards using simplified acquisition  procedures which is consistent with the records maintained in the  corresponding contract files. In 2010, DOD issued guidance to, among  other things, help improve the quality of data reported in FPDS-NG for  contracts awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.

GAO and the DOD Inspector General have  previously reported that the program faced various challenges. In 2009,  the Air Force first identified the need for the program following a  presentation from the contractor for an airship concept that could take off  and land vertically while requiring fewer personnel to assist with landing  than traditional airships. In March 2010, the contractor submitted an  unsolicited proposal to the Air Force for the development of the Blue Devil  Block 2 airship. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) conducted an  assessment of the program and determined that the proposed 24 month  schedule was aggressive and likely unachievable. As an alternative,  AFRL proposed a strategy to develop the airship in 34 months using  competitive procedures. In September 2010, the Secretary of Defense  designated the procurement of the airship as an urgent need to be rapidly  acquired, and set the expectation that it be deployed within 13 months.  The following month, AFRL conducted a second assessment of the  program and again determined that it was not suitable for rapid fielding  within 24 months due to concerns about the technical capability of the  contractor and poorly defined requirements. Despite AFRL\u2019s assessment,  the Air Force awarded an $86.2 million contract in March 2011 based on  urgency for delivery of the airship in January 2012. In an October 2012  report, GAO found that this program experienced significant technical  problems resulting in cost overruns and schedule delays that led to  termination of the program in June 2012, which was 5 months after the  planned fielding date of January 2012. Ultimately, the program was  terminated after spending more than $149 million and without fulfilling the  urgent requirement for a deployable ISR airship.", "In the second example, the Air Force awarded a noncompetitive contract  in 2011 on the basis of urgency for the development of the Orion  unmanned aerial system in response to an urgent operational need for  ISR capabilities to support multiple services in Afghanistan. The new  system was expected to provide greater uninterrupted flight times than  other available systems. The contract was awarded with a period of  performance of 13 months; however, the justification did not specify a  fielding date. After award, the cost of the contract nearly tripled from the  initial estimate of $5 million to a total of about $15 million and the period  of performance doubled from 13 months to 26 months. Contracting  officials said that cost increases and schedule delays were due to  technical problems experienced by the contractor in developing the  proposed technology.

In addition, nearly  all of the justifications that we reviewed were prepared and approved prior  to award. The FAR permits agencies to prepare and approve justifications  within a reasonable time after contract award when doing so prior to  award would unreasonably delay the acquisition. This provision is unique  to use of the urgency exception, as preparation and approval of the  justification prior to award can delay the quick response time needed to  meet urgent needs.

For example,  a USAID justification to award a $5 million contract to support missions in  Afghanistan was not signed by the Competition Advocate due to an  administrative oversight. In a second example, officials at the Defense  Logistics Agency did not obtain the necessary written approvals justifying  a $32 million award for an emergency fuel purchase also due to an  administrative oversight; however, according to officials, verbal approvals  had been obtained from all requisite approving officials including the head  of the contracting activity prior to award. After we brought this to their  attention, DLA officials obtained the necessary signatures on the  justification for this contract, even though the contract was complete. The  office that awarded this contract has since put a tool in place to route  justifications and ensure appropriate signatures are obtained in a timely  manner. Lastly, an Air Force justification for a noncompetitive award  valued at $130 million was not signed by the Senior Procurement  Executive, as required by the FAR. Officials we spoke with could not  confirm the reason the procurement executive did not sign the justification  and this individual is no longer employed by the Air Force.", "We also found four DOD justifications that were not signed in time to  meet the FAR requirement to make them publicly available within 30 days  of award. While the FAR permits agencies to prepare and approve  justifications awarded using the urgency exception within a reasonable  time after award; it does not identify a specific timeframe to do so.  However, agencies are required to make justifications for urgent  noncompetitive contracts available on the FedBizOpps website within 30  days of award. Thus, agencies would need to prepare and approve  justifications within 30 days in order to meet FAR requirements to make  them publicly available. DOD contracting officials who administered the  awards included in our sample told us it is customary to obtain verbal  approvals on justifications for noncompetitive procurements prior to  award; but such justifications are not made publicly available without  signatures from the appropriate approving official. The justifications for  these contracts were not signed until 58 to 314 days after award,  meaning that the fully approved justifications were not made publicly  available within 30 days of award as required by the FAR. In one of these  cases, an Army justification for a 3-month noncompetitive award for  satellite equipment was not prepared and approved, in writing, until 138  days after award. Citing concerns about compliance, the Army attorney  who provided legal review of the justification noted the absence of  regulatory procedure or agency policy when approval of the justification  has far exceeded the timing requirements for making the justification  publicly available. Officials subsequently posted the justification which  occurred more than 6 months after the contract award date and 90 days  after the contract expired. Some DOD, State, and USAID contracting  officials we spoke with emphasized the importance of complying with the  posting requirement to provide transparency into agency\u2019s contracting  activity, but others were unsure of the appropriate course of action when  approval of the justification does not occur within 30 days.", "For 15 of the justifications we reviewed, we could not confirm whether  justifications were posted to the FedBizOpps website within the required  timeframes, or at all, as no documentation was available. The FAR does  not require agencies to maintain documentation that the justification was  made publicly available; however, we found that in some instances,  officials printed the confirmation page from the FedBizOpps website to  document compliance with the requirement.

The FAR states that  agencies may use the urgency exception when delay of the contract  award would pose a serious injury\u2014financial or other\u2014to the  government. The FAR further provides that agencies are to include other  facts, such as data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and  nature of the harm to the government \u2014which provides some flexibility  about how such risks should be described in the justification.", "Most of the justifications in our sample\u201423 of 34\u2014quantified the potential  harm to the government if the acquisition was delayed by using  competitive procedures in terms of potential dollars lost or schedule  delays. The Air Force and the Army have guidance for preparing  justifications which states that the most critical aspect of justifications that  cite use of the urgency exception is quantifying the nature of the serious injury to the government if the urgent requirement is competed.Accordingly, nearly all of the Air Force and Army justifications we  reviewed estimated the potential costs to the government if the urgent  award were to be delayed by using competitive procedures. For instance,  one Air Force justification for an unmanned aerial system explained that  no other vendors had mature technology and estimated that the effort of  bringing at least one other vendor to an equivalent capability would cost  $5.7 million and result in at least a 3-month delay. Further, the justification  stated that it is unlikely these costs would be recovered through  competition. Similarly, the justification for an Army contract to obtain new  parts for tactical wheeled vehicles to help protect against attacks from  improvised explosive devices estimated that DOD would incur $2.5 million  in transportation costs if the parts were not acquired by a certain date to  meet the time frame of a scheduled ship deployment.", "By contrast, 11 of the justifications we reviewed were more ambiguous in  describing the nature of the harm if a noncompetitive contract was not  awarded.

For such events,  according to agency officials, security concerns often hinder the  agency\u2019s ability to conduct advanced planning; thus necessitating the  use of the urgency exception.", "Two USAID justifications did not fully describe the harm to the  government. The justifications cited the need to comply with a  requirement to conduct annual financial audits of local expenses  incurred in Afghanistan; however, the extent and nature of the serious  risk of financial or other injury to the government was not stated.  Officials justified the noncompetitive award citing a shortage of  qualified audit firms in Afghanistan which could affect USAID\u2019s ability  to meet auditing requirements.

However, during the bridge contract period of performance,  State realized that the new awardee could not establish its operations to  meet the timeframes required in the contract and therefore defaulted,  leading to termination of the competitive award. To allow sufficient time to  re-compete the requirement and transition to a new vendor, State used  the contract clause to extend the existing bridge contract for an additional  6 months but did not seek a determination of exceptional circumstances.

In their view, each additional justification represents an  individual contract action; thus, there is no need to consider the  cumulative effect of a modification resulting in a period of performance  beyond 1 year.", "In one of these instances, the Army TACOM Life Cycle Management  Command identified an urgent operational need for 513 medium armored  security vehicles and related support\u2014valued at more than $757 million  to support the Afghanistan National Army. To meet the timeframes for  delivery, officials determined that the circumstances warranted use of a  noncompetitive award on the basis of urgency to one contractor with prior  experience on similar acquisitions. After identifying a multi-year  requirement to provide vehicles to the Afghanistan National Army,  contracting officials planned to fulfill the requirement in multiple phases.  For the first phase, the Army decided to purchase 73 vehicles and  prepared a noncompetitive justification citing the urgency exception for an  award valued at $85.1 million\u2014which is $0.4 million below the level that  requires approval from the Senior Procurement Executive. The first phase  was awarded in January 2011 as an undefinitized contract action which  allows the contractor to start the work quickly without negotiating all the  terms and conditions for a contract. However, 3 months into the  performance of the contract, another justification for a modification to the  undefinitized contract action was approved by the Senior Procurement  Executive using a different exception citing that only one responsible  source could fulfill the procurement of the remaining 440 vehicles needed  to meet the requirement. The additional justification for the second phase,  valued at more than $576 million, added 3 years (a base year and two 1- year options); extending the procurement to 2014. According to the  contracting officer, a determination from the head of the agency was not  obtained as the second phase is considered a separate action rather than  cumulative; thus the period of performance under the urgency justification  would not exceed 1 year. Approving the requirement between two  justifications allowed for the initial contract award to be within the 1 year  period of performance as required. However, when the contract exceeded  a year with the subsequent modification on the grounds that only one  source was capable; no additional oversight was performed by the head  of the agency to determine if exceptional circumstances applied.    .

In these cases where total  obligations grew considerably, contracting officials did not alert senior  procurement officials when these increases occurred. In one example,  Navy officials modified a contract to provide training and other support  services for a surveillance system several times which grew to more than  three times the estimated value. The contract value at time of award was  $30 million, and the justification was signed by the head of the procuring  activity, as required by the FAR for awards greater than $12.5 million but  not exceeding $85.5 million. However, after award, three modifications  added a total of $31 million to the contract primarily due to cost overruns.  Additionally, four modifications with accompanying justifications\u2014 because the work being added was determined to be outside the original  scope of the contract\u2014added $12 million each time, bringing the total  contract value to more than $109 million, as illustrated in figure 5.", "The four supplemental justifications were each approved by the  competition advocate, as required.

If this  contract had been estimated to be $109 million at the time of award, the  senior procurement executive would have had oversight through approval  of the justification. The FAR does not provide guidance to contracting  officials on the degree of oversight senior agency officials should exercise  when contract modifications significantly raise the cumulative dollar value  of a contract awarded using the urgency exception.", "Using multiple modifications to increase funding or extend the period of  performance and treating these as separate rather than cumulative  contract actions make it harder for senior department officials to provide  oversight. Competition advocates at DOD, State, and USAID had differing  views about whether contract modifications to extend the period of  performance should be considered cumulatively. Some thought the  actions should be viewed cumulatively as it provides greater oversight;  while others thought the actions should be considered independent of  each other. OFPP officials told us that generally, the total period of  performance of urgent contracts should be considered cumulatively either  at time of award or when the contract is modified to extend the period of  performance to more than 1 year. While OFPP officials stated that the  period of performance should be considered cumulatively, the FAR does  not specify what to do when these contracts are modified beyond 1 year,  and no guidance is available on what to do in these situations.

For  example, to avoid an unanticipated disruption in supplying fuel to the  government of Israel, DLA solicited four firms the agency had worked with  on similar acquisitions in the past. In the justification, DLA cited that  having the benefit of market information from prior competitive awards  helped the agency reduce the time it would normally take to compete the  new procurement. In another instance, State had an existing indefinite  delivery indefinite quantity contract in place for the purchase of ballistic  resistant doors for embassy security. During embassy renovations it was  determined that the required specification could not be met through the  negotiated terms of the existing contract. State officials conducted a  limited competition among three vendors who were approved vendors  under the existing contract. Further, State justified this limited competition  as the preferred cost-effective method as these three vendors had been  the lowest bidders on similar procurements, thus, limiting the risk of  overspending.", "For 10 DOD contracts in our sample, the government was unable to  compete requirements because of a lack of access to technical data  packages or proprietary data coupled with the urgency of the  requirement. In some instances, program officials explored the possibility  of acquiring the data only to learn that the package was not available for  sale or would be cost-prohibitive. In our prior work, DOD described the  acquisition of technical data for weapon systems, such as design  drawings and specifications as critical to enabling competition throughout  a system\u2019s life cycle. Within our sample, we found in one instance  where DLA was in the process of negotiating the purchase of the  technical data, but the purchase could not be completed in a timeframe  that would have allowed competition for the urgent requirement. While  DLA was not able to benefit from the purchase of the technical data  package for the current award, the agency would be better positioned to  compete future procurements. For more than a decade we have reported  on the limitations to competition when DOD does not purchase technical  data rights and the increased costs as a result. In May 2013, DOD  implemented guidance for program managers to consider acquiring  technical data rights as part of the acquisition planning.", "In examining the procurement history for two contracts in our sample, we  found one DOD program involving an aerostat, the Persistent Threat  Detection System (PTDS) that spanned 10 years without achieving  competition for the acquisition of the aerostat.

However, the Army determined  that only one contractor with prior experience could satisfy the urgent  requirement at that time. In May 2011, the Army awarded a  noncompetitive urgency contract to that contractor for 29 aerostats and  cited the future need for spares in fiscal year 2012 when additional  funding would be available. The senior procurement executive approved  the May 2011 urgency justification nearly a year after award\u2014due to  confusion about changes in the review process\u2014on the condition that all  future related procurements be competed. However, by the time that the  senior procurement executive approved the justification for the May 2011  urgent award, the Army had already awarded the follow on urgent award  for spares in December 2011. While the Army identified six sources that  were capable of competing and providing the PTDS aerostat in 2011, it  ultimately awarded a 3-year noncompetitive contract to the same  contractor valued at $306 million on the basis of \u201conly one responsible  source\u201d because the government did not own the technical data  packages.

This recommendation was, in part, intended to help senior department  officials capture the benefit of information on past procurements when  approving individual justifications for subsequent noncompetitive awards.  To address concerns about missed opportunities for learning why past  acquisitions were not competed and to help remove barriers to  competition in future procurements, in April 2013, the Air Force  implemented a new policy to include justifications from predecessor  acquisitions as a reference document to justification approving officials.  Air Force officials observed that contracting officers were splitting  requirements across multiple justifications at lower approval thresholds,  which reduced oversight by higher level approving officials. The Navy has  a similar policy in place and DLA officials told us they are planning to  implement a similar process.

Awarding a noncompetitive contract on the  basis of unusual and compelling urgency is necessary in select  circumstances. However these contracts should be limited in duration to  minimize the amount of time that the government is exposed to the risks  of contracts that are awarded quickly without the benefits of competition.  Mechanisms for transparency and oversight of these contracts \u2014such as  posting justifications publicly and a determination that exceptional  circumstance apply to extend the contract period of performance beyond  1 year\u2014are necessary to ensuring that they are used only in  circumstances when no other option is available and to promote  competition in the future. Transparency and oversight during performance  of the contract, particularly when adding significant time or money,  ensures that the government is making sound decisions in the best  interest of taxpayers. In light of this, having OFPP provide guidance to  clarify when determinations are needed when extending the period of  performance on an urgency contract could help achieve consistent  implementation of the duration requirement across the government.  Additionally, having agencies develop mechanisms to ensure that senior  procurement officials are made aware of noncompetitive contracts with  significant increases in value, particularly those that were not initially  approved at the senior procurement executive level, could help to  increase transparency in noncompetitive awards and strengthen  oversight.

We selected a non-generalizable, random sample of  62 contracts by using data from FPDS-NG to analyze which components  within DOD, State, and USAID had the most obligations using the  urgency exception for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, which, at the time,  were the most recent fiscal years for which data was available. To narrow  our focus on which contracts to include in our review, we identified the  contracting offices within DOD, State, and USAID that had the largest  total obligations for contracts reported as being awarded using the  urgency exception under the \u201creason not competed\u201d field in the FPDS-NG  database. We then selected contracts that represented a mix of large and  smaller dollar awards and types of products and services procured. Table  2 below shows the contracting offices and the number of contracts  included in our review.", "To assess patterns in DOD\u2019s, State\u2019s, and USAID\u2019s use of the unusual  and compelling urgency exception to competition, we analyzed data from  the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG). We  included contracts and task orders coded as using the urgency exception  under the field \u201creason not competed\u201d from fiscal years 2010 through  2012 which represented the time period after the requirement to limit the  duration of urgent contracts went into effect and reflected the most  current reliable data to show trends over time. We determined that a  contract was miscoded if it was coded in FPDS-NG as being awarded  under the urgency exception, but our analysis of the contract file  documentation showed that the contract was awarded using other  procedures\u2014such as the streamlined procedures under the simplified  acquisition threshold\u2014generally $150,000\u2014or other exceptions to full  and open competition such as national security. We analyzed DOD,  State, and USAID obligation data and the types of goods and services  based on product code fields. We assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG  data by (1) performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2)  reviewing existing information about the data and the system that  produced them; and (3) comparing reported data to information from  contract files that we sampled. In our analysis we excluded awards that  were below $150,000 because of the high likelihood that these  procurements followed simplified acquisition procedures which are  separate from the procedures that apply to the urgency exception. Taking  this approach allowed us to account for known data limitations. Thus, we  determined that the federal procurement data were sufficiently reliable to  examine patterns in DOD\u2019s, State\u2019s, and USAID\u2019s use of the urgency  exception. To compare use of the urgency exception versus other  exceptions to full and open competition, we conducted an analysis of the  other values listed under the \u201creason not competed\u201d field. In addition, we  reviewed FPDS-NG instructions to identify protocols for entering contract  data in the database and interviewed DOD, State, and USAID contracting  officials and FPDS-NG subject matter experts about their procedures and  processes for entering data in the procurement database.", "To assess the reason that agencies awarded noncompetitive contracts on  the basis of urgency and the extent to which justifications met FAR  requirements, we performed an in depth review of contract files for 34  selected contracts that we determined\u2014based on our review of contract  file documentation and interviews with contracting officials\u2014were  awarded using the unusual and compelling urgency exception. Of the 62  contracts that we initially selected for our sample, we narrowed our  analysis to 34 because 28 of the contracts were miscoded in FPDS-NG.  For these 34 contracts, we reviewed contract file documentation such as  acquisition plans, justifications and other documents agencies used to  seek approval to limit competition on the selected contracts to determine  agencies\u2019 rationale for using the urgency exception. We also reviewed  DOD, State, and USAID guidance regarding the preparation and approval  of justifications to use the urgency exception. Additionally, we reviewed  the Federal Acquisition Regulation and reviewed agency policies and  guidance to inform our analysis of the extent to which justifications met  FAR requirements such as ensuring the justifications were signed by the  appropriate individuals and made publicly available within the required  timeframes. We compared agencies\u2019 policies and procedures with the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government which calls for  documentation of transactions that is readily available for inspection, thus  providing evidence of implementation. We interviewed contracting and  acquisition policy officials, procurement attorneys, program officials, and  competition advocates at DOD, State, and USAID to discuss the facts  and circumstances regarding use of the urgency exception and agency  policies and procedures to implement FAR requirements for publicly  posting justifications   To determine the extent to which agencies complied with the FAR  requirement to limit the total period of performance of a contract awarded  using the urgency exception to no more than a year unless the head of  the agency makes a determination of exceptional circumstances, we  reviewed contract file documents for 34 selected contracts that we  identified were awarded using the urgency exception. We also conducted  legal research and interviewed contracting and acquisition policy officials  at DOD, State, and USAID on the implementation of the duration  requirement. We reviewed contract file documentation such as contract  awards to determine the estimated period of performance. Further, we  reviewed contract modifications and additional justifications prepared  after award to determine the actual period of performance and action  taken by the agencies when extending the period of performance for  urgency contracts, such as preparing additional justifications for other  than full and open or exercising the option to extend services. We also  interviewed officials from the Office of Federal Procurement Policy within  OMB to obtain their perspectives on the approaches that DOD, State, and  USAID used to address the FAR requirement to limit the period of  performance or obtain a determination from the head of the agency that  exceptional circumstances necessitate a period of performance greater  than 1 year. We also analyzed contract documents to identify instances  where DOD, State, and USAID increased funding for the 34 contracts in  our sample. We assessed the implications of inconsistent implementation  of the FAR requirement to limit the period of performance of urgent  contracts and the absence of an oversight mechanism to monitor  increases in contract value against criteria in Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. These criteria call for organizations  to maintain proper controls that ensure transparency and accountability  for stewardship of resources. To determine the extent to which DOD,  State and USAID achieved competition with the use of the urgency  exception, we interviewed contracting officials and reviewed contract  documents, such as acquisition plans and price negotiation  memorandums, to identify the barriers to competition that agencies cited  and, to assess the extent to which the agencies solicited offers from  multiple vendors.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2013 through March  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
