These concerns focused on declines in visitor services, extensive needs for repairs and maintenance at the facilities and infrastructure that support recreation, and a lack of information on the condition of natural and cultural resources and the trends affecting them. In addressing these concerns, the Congress faced a dilemma: While the needs of federal recreation areas and the rate of visitation to these areas were increasing, the funding for addressing these needs and providing visitor services was growing tighter. As a result, the Congress was looking for means, other than appropriations, to provide additional resources to these areas. The recreational fee demonstration program was one such means.", "Authorized by the Congress in 1996 as a 3-year pilot program, the recreational fee demonstration program allows the Park Service, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the Fish and Wildlife Service to experiment with new or increased fees at up to 100 demonstration sites per agency. The program aims to bring additional resources to recreation lands by generating recreational fee revenues and spending most of the fee revenues at the sites where the fees are collected to increase the quality of the visitors\u2019 experience and to enhance the protection of the sites\u2019 resources. In addition, in carrying out the program, the agencies are to (1) be creative and innovative in designing and testing the collection of fees, (2) develop partnerships with federal agencies and with state and local agencies, (3) provide higher levels of service to the public, and (4) assess the public\u2019s satisfaction with the program. The conference report on the program\u2019s original legislation requested that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture each prepare a report that evaluates the demonstration program, including recommendations for further legislation, by March 31, 1999. The program is currently authorized through fiscal year 2001. The agencies have until the end of fiscal year 2004 to spend money generated under the program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Each of the four federal land management agencies included in the program provides a variety of recreational opportunities to the visiting public. Together, these agencies manage over 630 million acres of land\u2014over one-quarter of the land in the United States. In 1997, they received over 1.2 billion visits. Table 1.1 provides information on the acreage, visitation, and lands managed by the four agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Deteriorating Conditions Have Created a Need for Additional Financial Resources", "paragraphs": ["The fee demonstration program was established to test ways to address deteriorating conditions at many federal recreation areas, particularly those managed by the Park Service, which collects the most fee revenues, and the Forest Service, which hosts the most recreational visitors. Our prior work has detailed significant needs, including the following:", "The federal land management agencies have accumulated a multibillion-dollar backlog of maintenance, infrastructure, and development needs.", "The quality and the scope of visitor services at federal recreation sites have been declining. Some sites have closed facilities, while others have reduced their hours of operation or are providing fewer services.", "The condition of many key natural and cultural resources in the national park system is deteriorating, and the condition of many others is not known.", "Despite annual increases in federal appropriations for operating the national park system, the financial resources available have not been sufficient to stem the deterioration of the resources, services, and recreational opportunities managed by the agency.", "One way of addressing these needs was providing additional financial resources to these agencies through new or increased recreational fees. But while new or increased fees could have increased the federal land management agencies\u2019 revenues, generally these additional fees did not directly benefit the agencies\u2019 field units until the fee demonstration program was established. The Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965, as amended, limited the amount of revenues that could be raised through collecting recreational fees and required that the funds be deposited in a special U.S. Treasury account. The funds in the special Treasury account could only be used for certain purposes, including resource protection and maintenance activities, and only became available through congressional appropriations. These amounts were generally treated as a part of, rather than a supplement to, the agencies\u2019 regular appropriations, and were included under the spending limits imposed by the Budget Enforcement Act. In the context of the Budget Enforcement Act\u2019s limits, in order for the agencies to address deteriorating conditions at recreation areas through fee revenues, the Congress had to provide authority for the agencies to retain the fees.", "In 1996, the Congress authorized the fee demonstration program to test recreational fees as a source of additional financial resources for the federal land management agencies. The Congress directed that at least 80 percent of the revenues collected under the program be spent at the units collecting the fees; the remaining 20 percent could be spent at the discretion of each agency. By allowing the local units to retain such a large percentage of the fees they collected, the Congress created a powerful incentive for unit managers to emphasize fee collections. In essence, the more revenues that field units could generate through fees, the more they would have to spend on improving conditions in the areas they managed. In addition, the program\u2019s legislative history reflected the congressional belief that allowing the local units to retain most of the revenues they collected would be likely to improve the public\u2019s acceptance of the fees. This belief was consistent with past studies of visitors to recreation areas that indicated that most visitors would support increases in fees if the fees remained at the local units.", "Under the legislation, the program\u2019s expenditures were to be used to increase the quality of visitors\u2019 experiences at public recreation areas and to enhance the protection of resources. Specifically, authorized expenditures were to address backlogged repair and maintenance projects; enhancements to interpretation, signage, habitats, or facilities; and resource preservation, annual operations (including fee collections), maintenance, and law enforcement relating to public use. In broad terms, these authorized expenditures cover the principal aspects of managing recreation areas on federal lands.", "The legislation also provided an opportunity for the agencies to be creative and innovative in developing and testing fees by giving them the flexibility to develop a wide variety of fee proposals, including some that were nontraditional as well as others that simply increased previously existing fees. During the demonstration period, the agencies were to experiment with (1) various types of fees to determine what does and does not work and (2) various methods of collecting fees to make payment easier and more convenient for the visiting public. In addition, according to the program\u2019s legislative history, the agencies were expected to coordinate with each other, as well as with state and local recreation areas, so that visitors did not face numerous fees from several agencies in the same geographic area. Coordination among the agencies could yield better service to the public, thereby potentially improving the program\u2019s chances of success."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies May Charge Several Types of Fees", "paragraphs": ["Federal land management agencies have traditionally charged several types of fees to visitors, all of which may still be charged under the fee demonstration program. Most of these fees can be categorized generally as either entrance or user fees.", "Entrance fees are generally charged for short-term access to federal recreation sites. Most are charged on a per-vehicle basis, but some are charged to individuals hiking or cycling into a recreation area. The entrance fee gives the visitor access to the key features of the area. For example, visitors pay $10 per car to enter Zion National Park in Utah; this fee covers everyone in the vehicle and is good for up to a week. Another example of an entrance fee is collected within the Wasatch-Cache National Forest in Utah, where visitors to the Mirror Lake area pay an entrance fee of either $3 per vehicle for a day or $6 per vehicle for a week.", "Annual passes allow entrance or use of a site for the next 12 months, benefiting frequent visitors to a single recreation area, such as a park or forest. For example, instead of paying a $10 entrance fee every time they drive into Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, frequent visitors can purchase an annual pass for $20, which will give them unlimited access to the park during the next year. Similarly, in the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire, visitors can pay $20 for an annual pass rather than pay $5 for a daily vehicle pass.", "The Golden Eagle Passport provides unlimited entry for a year to most national parks, Fish and Wildlife Service sites where entrance fees are charged, and several Forest Service and BLM sites. Costing $50 for the purchaser and his or her passengers in a privately owned vehicle, the passport can be economical when people are planning to visit a number of sites that charge entrance fees within a single year. While the Golden Eagle Passport covers entrance fees, it does not cover most user fees;hence, passport holders pay separately for activities such as boat launching, camping, parking, or going on an interpretive tour.", "User fees are charged for engaging in specific activities. They are generally charged to individuals or groups for activities such as boat launching, camping, parking, or going on an interpretive tour. For example, individuals pay $3 for a guided interpretive tour of the Frederick Douglass home at the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site in Washington, D.C. Another example of a user fee is at Paria Canyon, a BLM demonstration site in Utah, where visitors pay $5 per day for hiking or backpacking.", "Individual sites may charge several types of fees for entry and other activities. For example, a demonstration site may have a $10 entrance fee, good for 7 days, and a $20 annual pass. In addition, visitors to the site may pay user fees for a variety of specific activities, such as backcountry hiking, camping, interpretive tours, or disposing of waste from a recreational vehicle."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our review included fee demonstration sites in the Park Service, the Forest Service, BLM, and the Fish and Wildlife Service. At each of these agencies, we contacted staff from headquarters and at least two regional offices. In addition, we visited 15 judgmentally selected sites operated by the four agencies. More of the selected sites were operated by the Park Service than by any other agency because the Park Service (1) had the most sites in the program and (2) generates considerably more fee revenues than any of the other agencies. The 15 selected sites were both large and small and were located throughout the country in eight different states and the District of Columbia. Table 1.2 lists the sites, by agency.", "We collected information on revenues, expenditures, and visitation from the headquarters offices of the four agencies and the 15 sites we visited. For each agency\u2019s revenues and expenditures, we collected actual data for fiscal year 1997 and the agency\u2019s estimates for fiscal year 1998. At each of the 15 sites, we collected more detailed information on revenues, such as the types of fees and the methods used to collect fees. We also compared actual with planned expenditures and classified the expenditures, using the broad purposes authorized in the program\u2019s legislation.", "To determine the extent to which the agencies had adopted innovative or coordinated approaches to the fee program, we used the information we collected to accomplish our first two objectives. Various agency officials, agency task forces, and officials from the industry and user groups we contacted provided comments and ideas on innovative or coordinated approaches available to the agencies\u2014including identifying practices employed by the private sector. To prepare for our review of the implementation of the demonstration program to date, we reviewed prior fee legislation, the program\u2019s authorizing legislation, and its legislative history.", "To determine what, if any, impact the fee demonstration program had on visitation, we attempted to compare data on visitation during the demonstration period with baseline information on visitation developed since 1993. Since visitation at the Park Service\u2019s sites accounted for over three-fourths of total visitation among all fee demonstrations at the four agencies, we compared trends in visitation at their demonstration sites with nondemonstration sites for the 1993-97 period. To conduct this analysis, we obtained visitation data from the Park Service\u2019s Public Use Statistics Office.", "For each of the agencies, we collected anecdotal information on trends in visitation from officials at agency headquarters and at the sites we visited as well as officials from each of the affected industry and user groups we contacted. We also contacted six experts who either had conducted surveys of visitors concerning the recreational fee demonstration program or had prior experience with recreational fees on federal lands. These individuals were Dr. Deborah J. Chavez, Research Social Scientist, Pacific Southwest Research Station, U.S. Forest Service; Dr. Sam H. Ham, College of Forestry, Wildlife and Range Sciences, University of Idaho; Dr. David W. Lime, Senior Research Associate, University of Minnesota, Department of Forest Resources; Dr. Gary E.

We spoke with these groups to obtain their views on the agencies\u2019 management of the program. We selected these groups because they (1) had participated in congressional hearings on the demonstration fee authority, (2) had been identified as affected parties by agency officials or officials from other industry or user groups, or (3) were widely known to be involved with recreation on federal lands. Table 1.3 provides the names and a brief description of each group we contacted.", "In addition to contacting these industry and user groups, we reviewed the testimonies of several other affected groups that participated in congressional hearings on the fee demonstration program.

Some of the agencies had more demonstration sites operational earlier than others. This difference is a result of the agencies\u2019 experiences in charging fees prior to the demonstration.

Each agency estimated that it has generated at least 70 percent more in fee revenues than it did prior to the demonstration program, and the combined estimated revenues for the four agencies have nearly doubled since fiscal year 1996.

As a result of these differing approaches, the pace of implementation among the agencies has varied.", "Fees are not new to the four agencies in the demonstration program. Prior to the program, each of the agencies collected fees from visitors at recreation areas. However, the agencies\u2019 experiences with fees have differed. For example, prior to the demonstration, the Park Service collected entrance fees at about one-third of its park units. The Forest Service and BLM collected user fees at many of their more developed recreation areas\u2014predominantly for camping\u2014and the Fish and Wildlife Service charged a mix of entrance and user fees at about 65 of its sites.", "Not only did their past experiences with fees differ, but the geographical characteristics of the lands they were managing also were different, making fee collection easier in some areas and more difficult in others. For example, many sites in the Park Service have only a few roads that provide access to them. With limited access, collecting fees at an entrance station is very practical. In contrast, many Forest Service, BLM, and Fish and Wildlife Service sites have multiple roads accessing areas they manage. Multiple roads make it difficult for an agency to control access to an area, thus making it difficult to charge entrance fees. As a result, most Forest Service, BLM, and Fish and Wildlife Service sites have not charged entrance fees but instead charged user fees for specific activities.", "Figures 2.1 and 2.2 further illustrate the varying characteristics of federal lands. As an example, figure 2.1 shows the relatively few access points to Arches National Park in Utah. This park has only one paved road going in and out of the park. In comparison, figure 2.2 shows the multiple access points that exist along the many roads that go through the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire and Maine.", "Many of the traditions in collecting fees have influenced the agencies in both their pace of implementation and the types of fees they charge. Because many sites in the Park Service previously charged entrance fees, the agency was quickly able to bring a large number of sites into the demonstration program by increasing the entrance fees that existed prior to the demonstration. For the Park Service, of the 96 demonstration sitesin the first year of the program, 57 of them increased existing entrance fees. According to officials in several of the agencies, it is generally easier for the agencies to increase existing fees than to implement new fees because (1) the fee-collection infrastructure is already in place and (2) the public is already accustomed to paying a fee.", "The three other agencies were collecting predominantly new fees at their demonstration sites during fiscal year 1997, the first year of the program, including all 10 of BLM\u2019s sites, 29 of 39 Forest Service sites, and 35 of 61 Fish and Wildlife Service sites. Compared with increases in existing fees, new fees are generally more difficult to implement because the agencies need to (1) develop an infrastructure for collecting fees and (2) inform the public and gain acceptance for the new fees. This infrastructure could include new facilities; new signs; new collection equipment, such as cash registers and safes; and new processes, such as implementing internal control standards for handling cash. Figures 2.3 and 2.4 show examples of new facilities that were constructed or put in place during the demonstration period to collect new fees.", "Through the first half of fiscal year 1998\u2014that is, as of March 31, 1998\u2014each of the four agencies added sites to the program. Through March 1998, the four agencies had 284 sites in the program, compared with 206 sites through fiscal year 1997. The Park Service added 4 sites through March 1998 and has a total of 100 sites in the program\u2014the maximum allowed by law. Each of the other three agencies has added sites to the program, with the majority of new sites coming from BLM\u2014the agency that had the fewest sites in fiscal year 1997. For the second half of fiscal year 1998 and fiscal year 1999, the Forest Service plans to add as many as 38 to 45 sites to the program. Officials from BLM indicated they plan to add 15 to 20 sites to the program. The Fish and Wildlife Service has added six sites during the last half of fiscal year 1998 but does not plan to add any further sites unless the demonstration program is extended beyond fiscal year 1999. Table 2.1 lists the number of fee demonstration sites, by agency, for fiscal year 1997 and through the first half of fiscal year 1998.", "An amendment to the law authorizing the demonstration program was one of the factors contributing to the addition of sites to the program. The law originally authorized each agency to retain the fee revenues that exceeded the revenues generated prior to the demonstration. As a result, the agencies could only retain the portion of the fee revenues that were in addition to existing fees. In November 1997, the law was amended to permit the agencies to retain all fee revenues generated by demonstration sites.

We disagree with the Park Service\u2019s comment on this point. We acknowledge that regardless of what happens to the repair and maintenance backlog, there may continue to be needs related to the natural and cultural resources at the parks we reviewed and at other sites. However, early in its implementation of the demonstration program, the Park Service directed its demonstration sites to focus program expenditures on addressing backlogged repair and maintenance items. Because of this Park Service emphasis, we sought to determine to what extent the new fee revenues would be able to address these items. We found that park managers at several parks indicated that they could address their existing repair and maintenance backlog in a few years (5 years or less) through these fee revenues. For example, managers of some of the parks we visited, such as Zion and Shenandoah, indicated that they could resolve their backlog of repair and maintenance needs in a few years through revenues from the demonstration program. In our view, this belief that individual park units may be able to eliminate their repair and maintenance backlog is not consistent with the Park Service\u2019s past portrayal of a large repair and maintenance backlog, especially since the backlog, and not resource needs, is the agency\u2019s stated focus for new revenues.", "The Fish and Wildlife Service disagreed with what it viewed as \u201can inference in the draft report that the practice of retaining 80 percent of the revenues at the station where fees are collected may not be a good practice.\u201d In fact, the 80-percent requirement is appropriate in some cases; however, providing the agencies with greater flexibility may enable them to better address their highest-priority needs.

For example, the Grand Canyon National Park sells entrance passes at machines located in several areas outside the park, including in the towns of Flagstaff and Williams, Arizona, which are both along frequently used routes to the park and more than 50 miles from the park\u2019s south entrance. The park has dedicated one of the four lanes at its entrance station for visitors who have already purchased their entrance passes. Thus, visitors who use the machines outside the park can avoid lines of cars waiting to pay fees at the park\u2019s entrance station. At other demonstration sites within the Park Service, visitors can use automated fee-collection machines to pay for entrance fees, annual passes, or boat launch fees.", "As part of the demonstration program, the Forest Service is looking for ways to make paying fees more convenient for the visitor and more efficient for the agency. In some instances, paying fees at a location inside a forest may not always be convenient for visitors\u2014particularly if that location is not near where visitors enter the forest, according to a Forest Service headquarters official. Some sites have experimented with having businesses and other groups outside of the forest collect entrance and user fees from visitors before they come into the forest. The vendors of the entrance and user permits are frequently small businesses, such as gas stations, grocery stores, or fish and tackle stores, that are located near the forest. For example, 350 vendors sell passes to visitors for recreation on any of four national forests in southern California. By having vendors sell entrance and user permits, a forest can increase the number of locations where visitors can pay fees and can thereby make paying fees more convenient.", "At Paria Canyon-Coyote Buttes in Arizona, one of BLM\u2019s demonstration sites, the agency is experimenting with selling hiking and camping permits via the Internet.

BLM, working in cooperation with Northern Arizona University and the Arizona Strip Interpretive Association, has developed a website that allows visitors to obtain information on the area, check on the availability of permits for future dates, make reservations, fill out and submit detailed application forms, or print out the application forms for mailing.

This concept is generally referred to as differential pricing and has resulted in greater equity in pricing at the sites where it has been tried.", "For example, in Utah, Uinta National Forest and Wasatch-Cache National Forest have both experimented with differential pricing. At American Fork Canyon/Alpine Loop Recreation Area, within the Uinta National Forest, the forest began charging a new entrance fee under the demonstration program of $3 per car for a 3-day visit and $10 for a 2-week visit. Similarly, at the Mirror Lake area within the Wasatch-Cache National Forest, visitors pay a new entrance fee of either $3 per vehicle for a day or $10 per vehicle for a week. Thus visitors to both the Uinta and Wasatch-Cache National Forests pay fees that vary with the extent of use. Fees that vary with use are more equitable than a single fee for all visitors regardless of use, as has been the traditional practice at many federal recreation sites.", "The Forest Service and BLM have also experimented with charging fees that differ based on peak and off-peak periods. For example, at Tonto National Forest in Arizona, the entrance fees vary depending on the day of the week. The forest sells two annual passes for day use, including use of the boat launch facilities, at six lakes within the forest. One pass sells for $90 per year and is valid 7 days a week. The other pass sells for $60 per year and is valid only Monday through Thursday, the forest\u2019s off-peak period. Another example of peak pricing is at the Lower Deschutes Wild and Scenic River in Oregon, one of BLM\u2019s sites, where as part of the demonstration program, the agency charges a camping fee of $10 per site per day on weekends in the summer and a $5 per site per day fee midweek and during weekends in the off-season.

However, visitors to units of the national park system having entrance fees (about one-third of the 376 units) generally pay the same fee whether they are visiting during a peak period, such as a weekend in the summer, or an off-peak period, such as midweek during the winter, and whether they are staying for several hours or several days. A more innovative fee system would make fees more equitable for visitors and may change visitation patterns somewhat to enhance economic efficiency and reduce overcrowding and its effects on parks\u2019 resources.", "For example, managers at several of the parks we visited, including Assateague Island National Seashore and Shenandoah National Park, discussed how during peak visitation periods, such as summer weekends, long lines of cars frequently form at entrance stations, with visitors waiting to pay the fee to enter the parks. The lines are an inconvenience to the visitors and the emissions from idling cars could affect the sites\u2019 resources. By experimenting with pricing structures that have higher fees for peak periods and lower fees for off-peak periods, sites might be able to shift more visitation away from high-use periods. Our past work has found that increased visitation has eroded many parks\u2019 ability to keep up with visitors\u2019 and resource needs. Innovative pricing structures that result in less crowding in popular areas would also improve the recreational experience of many park visitors. Furthermore, according to the four agencies, reducing visitation during peak periods can lower the costs of operating recreation sites by reducing (1) the staff needed to operate a site, (2) the size of facilities, (3) the need for maintenance and future capital investments, and (4) the extent of damage to a site\u2019s resources. As we already pointed out, the private sector uses such pricing strategies as a matter of routine\u2014including when the private sector operates within parks. The private sector concessioner that operates the lodging facilities in Yosemite National Park in California, for example, employs peak pricing practices. Lodging rates are higher during the peak summer months and lower during the months when the park attracts fewer visitors.", "Furthermore, most parks with entrance fees charge the same fee regardless of the extent of use. For example, Zion and Olympic National Parks both charge an entrance fee of $10 per vehicle for a visit of up to 1 week. This fee is the same whether visitors are enjoying these areas for several hours, a day, several days, or the full week. This one-size-fits-all approach is convenient for the agency but may not be equitable or efficient because visitors staying longer enjoy more benefits from a site.", "At one park, the lack of an alternative to the 7-day entrance fee has contributed to the formation of a \u201cblack market\u201d in entrance passes. According to recent media reports, some visitors to Yellowstone National Park are reselling their $20 1-week entrance passes\u2014after staying only a few days or less at the park\u2014to other visitors planning to enter the park. Since the passes are valid for 7 days, a family could sell its pass to another carload of park visitors for perhaps half price and reduce the cost of visiting the park for both parties. Even though the entrance pass is nontransferable and selling a pass is illegal and subject to a $100 fine, the park does not have an estimate of the extent of the situation. The park has not experimented with an entrance fee for visits of less than 7 days, a pricing option that would be likely to address the illegal resale of passes.", "Park Service headquarters officials indicated that the agency had not tried differential pricing at demonstration sites because, in their view, it (1) would be difficult to conduct sufficient enforcement activities to ensure compliance, (2) would increase the costs of fee collection, and (3) may result in a decrease in fee revenues. While we acknowledge that it may be simpler to charge only one rate to visitors at demonstration sites, the agencies that are currently using differential pricing\u2014the Forest Service and BLM\u2014have been able to address the concerns raised by the Park Service.

The monument is surrounded by Forest Service land, and the same roads provide access to both areas. Because of this configuration, the agencies generally share the same visitors and charge one fee for entrance to both areas. The sites also have similar public service and resource management goals. Fee-collection responsibilities are shared between the two agencies, and expenditures are decided upon by representatives from both agencies as well as from two other partners in the project\u2014the State of Utah Department of Transportation and the county government. Figure 4.1 shows the partnership\u2019s entrance station for the area. Since 1997, fee revenues from the project have paid for the rehabilitation of several bridges in popular picnic areas (see fig. 4.2).

The area is surrounded by two Indian reservations.", "The only access road for vehicles to Tent Rocks crosses land owned by Pueblo de Cochiti. In 1998, a cooperative partnership agreement gave visitors access to Tent Rocks, while specifying prohibited activities to preserve the tranquility of the pueblo community. The agreement also specifies resource preservation measures to protect the Tent Rocks area. Annually, Tent Rocks is visited by about 100,000 people. Under the terms of the agreement, BLM is responsible for collecting fees and shares $1 of the $5 vehicle fee with Pueblo de Cochiti. The pueblo provides interpretive talks, trash pickup, and road maintenance. As of July 1998, this interorganizational demonstration project was working satisfactorily, according to BLM officials.", "The Oregon Coastal Access Pass has been proposed for visitors to enter several adjacent federal and state recreation sites, each of which now charges a separate entrance fee.

During the last 2 years, representatives from the federal and state agencies involved have held meetings to develop an Oregon Coastal Access Pass, which would be good for entrance and use at all participating federal and state sites along the Oregon coast. According to a Forest Service official, two issues need to be resolved before implementing the pass: (1) the estimation of the revenues from each of the facilities to determine the amount of anticipated revenues to be shared and (2) the development of and agreement on an equitable formula to share fee revenues among the federal and state sites.

Even at the few participating sites we visited, we identified three areas where better interagency coordination would provide improved services and other benefits to the visiting public, while at the same time generating increased fee revenues.", "For example, in New Mexico, BLM administers a 263,000-acre parcel called El Malpais National Conservation Area. Within the BLM boundaries of this site is the El Malpais National Monument created in 1987 and managed by the Park Service (see fig. 4.3).

Presently, neither parcel has an entrance or user fee.", "In 1997, as part of the fee demonstration program, BLM proposed a $3 daily fee to the site. According to a BLM official, the proposed demonstration site was to be managed as a joint fee demonstration project with the Park Service, with the fee applicable to both areas. According to BLM, a demonstration project would not only increase revenues to pay for work needed at the site but also increase the presence of agencies\u2019 officials at the site, which would help deter vandalism and other resource-related crimes. Because it is difficult for visitors to distinguish between the two sites, a unified and coordinated approach to fee collection made good management sense and would avoid confusion among fee-paying visitors to the sites.", "The surrounding communities endorsed BLM\u2019s proposal, but Park Service officials at the site did not. They told us that they believed that there would be low compliance with any fee requirements because of the multiple access roads to the site, that potentially delicate situations would arise with Native Americans using the land for ceremonial purposes, and that theft and vandalism would increase because of the proposed project\u2019s unstaffed fee-collection tubes. A local BLM official, however, said that the site could generate significant revenues (over $100,000 annually), that fee exemption cards could be developed for Native Americans using the land for traditional purposes, and that past experience in the southwest has not shown extensive damage to unstaffed fee-collection devices like those proposed for use at this site. As a result of the differing views between BLM and Park Service officials at this site, no coordinated approach has been developed. However, our work at the site indicated that experimenting with a new fee at the location would be entirely consistent with the objective of the demonstration program. As of August 1998, neither agency had documented its analysis of the situation, and BLM was considering deleting the site as a potential fee demonstration project.", "In the state of Washington, we found another opportunity for interagency coordination. Olympic National Park and the Olympic National Forest share a common border for hundreds of miles and are both frequently used by backcountry hikers. For backcountry use, hikers are subject to two separate fees at Olympic National Park\u2014a $5 backcountry hiking permit and a $2 per night fee for overnight stays in the park. In contrast, Olympic National Forest does not have an entry fee, a backcountry permit fee, or any overnight fee in areas that are not specifically designated as campsites. However, the forest does have a trailhead parking fee of $3 per day per vehicle or $25 annually per vehicle. As a result, backcountry users who hike trails that cross back and forth over each agency\u2019s lands are faced with multiple and confusing fees. Figure 4.4 shows an example of a backcountry hike from Lena Creek (Olympic National Forest land) to Upper Lena Lake (Olympic National Park land)\u201414 miles round-trip\u2014where backcountry users would face such multiple fees. Table 4.1 lists the fees involved for the hike.", "We discussed this situation with on-site managers from both agencies. They agreed that they should better coordinate their respective fees to reduce the confusion and multiplicity of fees for backcountry users. However, so far, neither agency has taken the initiative to make this happen. At the time of our review, no one at the departmental or agency headquarters level routinely got involved in these kinds of decisions. Instead, the decisions were left to the discretion of the site managers.", "A third example of where greater coordination and cooperation would lead to operational efficiencies and less visitor confusion is in Virginia and Maryland at the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Assateague Island National Seashore, administered by the Park Service. Although the sites adjoin each other on the same island (see fig. 4.5), they are not a joint project in the fee demonstration program\u2014each site is a separate fee demonstration project.", "During our review, we found many similarities between these two sites that offer the possibility of testing a single entrance fee for both sites. Both sites charge a daily entrance fee ($5 per vehicle), cooperate on law enforcement matters, and run a joint permit program for off-road vehicles. In 1997, according to Park Service officials, the two agencies together issued 5,000 annual off-road vehicle permits at $60 each. By agreement between the two agencies, the permit revenues are shared, with one-third going to the refuge and two-thirds going to the Park Service. The Park Service already provides staff to operate and maintain a ranger station and bathing facilities on refuge land.", "Despite these overlapping programs and similarities, the units still maintain separate, nonreciprocal entrance fee programs. This situation is continuing even though officials at the refuge told us that visitors are sometimes confused by separate agencies managing adjoining lands without any reciprocity of entrance fees. For example, during a 7-day period in July 1998, refuge officials counted 71 of 4,431 visitor vehicles as wishing to use their vehicle entrance passes for Assateague to gain admittance to Chincoteague. Similarly, during the 7-day period of July 31 through August 6, 1998, Assateague officials counted 40 of 4,056 visitor vehicles as presenting Chincoteague entrance passes to gain admittance to Assateague.

Congressional interest in encouraging more interagency coordination and cooperation was focused not only on seeking additional revenues but also on developing ways to lessen the burden of multiple, similar fees being paid by visitors to adjoining or nearby recreation sites offering similar activities.

The Park Service raised concerns about experimenting with differential or peak-period pricing. The agency said that experimenting with fees could result in complex fee schedules, increased processing times at entrance stations, confused visitors, and more difficult enforcement. In addition, the agency took exception to the draft report\u2019s comparisons to the differential pricing practices used at amusement parks, golf courses, and ski areas, noting that the agency\u2019s purpose is different from the purposes of such operations. However, we disagree that these concerns are reasons not to implement different pricing policies at some parks. We recognize that the Park Service\u2019s current fee schedule has been successful but question whether the agency has responded sufficiently to one of the intents of the recreational fee demonstration program: that agencies experiment with innovative pricing structures. If done well, experimenting with differential pricing at Park Service demonstration sites need not result in complex fee schedules, delays at entrance stations, confused visitors, or significant increases to the cost of collection. It is in this context, that we provided the examples of golf courses, amusement parks, and ski areas\u2014recreation activities that routinely use differential pricing to which the public is already accustomed. In many cases, these fee systems are equitable, easily understood by the public, and do not cause delay or confusion.", "Furthermore, the Park Service comments on this point are not consistent with the January 1998 report to the Congress on the status of the fee demonstration program, which was jointly prepared by the Park Service, the Forest Service, BLM, and the Fish and Wildlife Service and transmitted by the Undersecretary of the Department of Agriculture and an Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior. In that report, the four agencies noted that among the lessons learned up to that point was that differential pricing could be used to maximize resource protection or to minimize infrastructure investment. The report states that \u201chigher fees on weekends, summer months, or other  traditionally-high recreation use, might reduce the peak loads on resources and  facilities . . . . Reductions in peak loads can directly reduce the cost to taxpayers associated with operating the recreation sites, providing services to these sites, and any attendant damage to the resource.\u201d", "The Park Service also raised concerns about the draft report\u2019s discussion of the potential for a joint fee demonstration site between the Park Service and BLM at El Malpais National Monument and El Malpais National Conservation Area. (BLM did not comment on this point.) The Park Service said that (1) a cost-benefit analysis showed it was not worth collecting fees and (2) collecting fees would affect the use of the area by five neighboring Native American tribes. It was clear from our work that there was disagreement among Park Service and BLM officials over whether El Malpais was a suitable site for inclusion in the demonstration program and that this disagreement continues. The boundaries of the agencies\u2019 land make it unlikely that the project could succeed without a joint effort. We disagree with the Park Service\u2019s concerns raised on this point and question their accuracy since the analysis showing that fee revenues would be low, referred to in the Park Service\u2019s comments, has not been completed. We obtained a draft of that analysis which, according to Park Service staff at El Malpais National Monument, was the most recent analysis available as of October 15, 1998. The draft analysis contains no information on anticipated costs or revenues from charging fees at this site. Furthermore, we disagree with the Park Service\u2019s assertion that fees would affect Native American use of the site. According to the Park Service regional fee demonstration coordinator, at park units where similar situations existed, local managers were able to resolve cultural issues with the Native Americans using the sites.", "The Fish and Wildlife Service commented that there may be opportunities for the agency to experiment with off-peak pricing, but such opportunities would be limited to those sites where there is sufficient visitation to create crowding and provide an incentive for off-peak use. We agree. In fact, crowded parking at one refuge was a big enough concern that managers were considering measures to better handle visitation during peak periods.", "The Fish and Wildlife Service also commented on the need for greater coordination among the agencies.

Visitation increased at 50 sites, decreased at 45 sites, and remained unchanged at 1 site. Some sites that raised existing fees in 1997 experienced significantly higher rates of visitation after the increased or new fees went into effect. For example, at one site we visited, Timpanogos Cave National Monument in Utah, a new entrance fee plus increased fees for cave tours allowed the park to hire additional cave interpreters, which lengthened the season for cave tours by 3 months.

The higher fees might be one factor accounting for a smaller percentage increase in visitation at the demonstration sites, but other factors might be more important. We found that the larger percentage increase at the nondemonstration sites in 1997 was consistent with changes in visitation over the last few years (1993-97) and, therefore, might have occurred even if fees had not been increased at the demonstration sites. Since 1994, there has been a steady trend in which visitation at nondemonstration sites has grown relative to visitation at demonstration sites. In fact, there was a much more substantial difference between the two groups in the changes in visitation from 1995 to 1996 before fees were increased at any of the sites.

According to 96 percent of respondents, the fees would not affect their current visit or future plans to visit the park. Visitors supported the new fees in large part because they wanted all or most of the fee revenues to remain in the park where they were collected or with the Park Service so that the funds could be used to improve visitor services or protect resources, rather than be returned to the U.S. Treasury.", "Three surveys at fee demonstration sites administered by the Forest Service found general support for the program. A survey of over 400 visitors at the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument in Washington State in 1997 found 68 percent of those surveyed said their visitor experience was worth the fee they paid. Although over 50 percent of those surveyed were not aware of the new fees prior to coming to Mount St. Helens, 69 percent said their visitation plans did not change as a result of the new fees. Overall, 92 percent of those surveyed were either very satisfied or satisfied with their experience at the site.", "A June 1997 to May 1998 survey of 1,392 backpackers and hikers at Desolation Wilderness, Eldorado National Forest, in California found that a majority accepted the concept of wilderness use fees and considered the amount charged to be about right.

In 1998, both BLM and the Fish and Wildlife Service began their initial evaluations of the impact of the fee demonstration program on visitors. These surveys will be included as part of the final evaluation report of the demonstration program, which is intended to be a comprehensive evaluation on the impact of fees on visitation by each of the four agencies. Additional research by all four agencies, when completed, should more fully illustrate public acceptance and reaction to new or increased fees. Surveys on the impact of fees on visitation and other issues planned for 1998 and 1999 include the following:", "The Park Service plans additional research on visitation in 1998 that will (1) survey the managers at all 100 recreational fee demonstration sites concerning visitation and obtain their perceptions of the equity, the efficiency, and the quality of visitors\u2019 experiences resulting from the fee demonstration program; and (2) conduct detailed case study evaluations at 13 fee demonstration sites, including a detailed visitor survey at each site. The case study sites will explore such questions as whether fees affected the mix of sites\u2019 visitors and how fees and changes in fee levels have affected the visitors\u2019 experience at the sites, among other questions. The surveys are being administered for the Park Service by the University of Idaho with assistance from the University of Montana and Pennsylvania State University. Survey results are expected by April 1999.", "The Forest Service plans to survey visitors at several national forests in 1998 to assess their views on new or increased fees under the demonstration program. Several visitor surveys will be completed at the national forests in Southern California as part of the fee demonstration project. The primary objectives of the surveys are to assess visitors\u2019 responses to new recreational fees and the effects of the new fees on visitation patterns and to complete a follow-up survey of users who visited the demonstration sites before the new fees were in place. The surveys are being done by the Pacific Southwest Research Station in Riverside and by California State University, San Bernadino, and should be completed in 1999. In addition, a follow-up to a 1997 visitor survey is planned to assess the opinions of campers on new fee charges at the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota. The survey is being done by the College of Natural Resources, University of Minnesota, and should be completed by November 1998.", "A 1998 survey of a total of 2,600 visitors is planned at nine of the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s wildlife refuges, according to an agency official. The survey objectives are to obtain visitors\u2019 opinions on the fairness and equity of the fee being charged, alternative fee-collection methods, and the use of revenues from fee collections, among other topics. The nine sites selected will include those charging both entrance and user fees as well as sites with new fees and those that changed existing fees. The study is being completed for the Service by a contractor to the Department of the Interior\u2019s National Biological Survey with assistance from Colorado State University. Survey results will be available by the end of 1998.", "During September 1998, BLM plans to survey a total of 800 people who visited eight different demonstration sites to assess their views on the program. The specific objectives of the survey are to determine the appropriateness of the fees charged, how revenues from fees should be used, and how fees will affect future visitation, among other topics. The sites selected will represent a cross-section of both dispersed and developed recreation sites. The survey is being done with assistance from the University of Virginia Survey Research Center and should be completed by December 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Areas in Need of Further Research", "paragraphs": ["While much of the completed research on visitors\u2019 opinions about recreational fees shows general support for the demonstration program, recreation fee experts and some interest groups we contacted raised concerns about some effects that completed or planned visitation research, generally, does not address. The concerns fell into three areas: the impact of new or increased fees on those not visiting recreation sites, backcountry users, and low-income users.", "First, almost all completed and planned visitation surveys concerning the recreational fee demonstration program have assessed or will assess visitors who have paid a user or entrance fee at the recreation site. This practice is consistent with the agencies\u2019 evaluation approach of assessing visitors\u2019 reactions to paying new or increased fees. However, potential visitors who do not come to the recreation site or who come to the site but leave because of new or increased fees have not been included in the surveys. For example, at Glacier National Park in 1997-98 a fee was collected at the park\u2019s western entrance on certain winter weekends. According to reports in the media, during this period, passengers in a number of cars refused to pay the fee and canceled their visit to the park. It is because of situations like this that several recreation fee researchers we contacted said further research is needed to determine whether recreational fees are precluding potential recreation users from visiting the sites in the demonstration program.", "Representatives from two of the four agencies participating in the fee demonstration program agreed this was an important research concern that completed or planned visitation research will not address. The Forest Service plans a national recreation survey in 1998-99 that, among other topics, will address the general public\u2019s reaction to new or increased fees. In commenting on this report, the Park Service said it plans to conduct a survey of the general public to determine the impact of new or increased fees on visitation. This survey should be completed by December 1999. Fish and Wildlife Service officials said they had not planned such research because (1) this type of research was expensive to conduct and (2) it was not yet a high enough priority among competing research needs within the agency. Officials from BLM said that if fee increases appeared to be a factor in causing a decline in 1998 visitation figures, the agency would be likely to conduct research on this topic.", "Second, limited visitation surveys have been completed or are planned on the impact of new or increased fees on backcountry recreation. Only one of the completed surveys and one survey planned for 1998 has or will focus exclusively on backcountry recreation: the Forest Service\u2019s 1997-98 survey of Desolation Wilderness in northern California and its summer 1998 survey of visitors to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota. Furthermore, only 1 of the 11 national park units included in the Park Service\u2019s 1997 visitation survey had instituted fees for backcountry use. One interest group contacted, Outward Bound USA,suggested that visitors\u2019 acceptance of new or increased fees was greater in developed recreation areas and that backcountry users were less enthusiastic about the program because agencies charge multiple fees for backcountry activities in the same area and many backcountry fees are new fees rather than increases in existing fees. Several recreation fee researchers contacted said that since many backcountry use fees were new, additional research was needed to determine if fees were affecting backcountry visitation patterns.", "While representatives from the Park Service and the Forest Service agreed this was an important research concern, Fish and Wildlife Service officials did not, since their recreation sites do not involve nearly as much dispersed backcountry recreation as the Park Service\u2019s and the Forest Service\u2019s. A BLM official acknowledged this was an important issue, but said the agency\u2019s visitation survey would only be administered at a small number of sites with dispersed backcountry recreation. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Park Service said that it plans to conduct a survey of backcountry/winter recreation users, to be completed by December 1999, to determine the impact of new or increased fees on visitation. A Forest Service official said the agency\u2019s two surveys would shed some light on the impact of fees on backcountry use but believed more research was needed to fully assess the impact of fees on the Forest Service\u2019s many sites with backcountry use. The Forest Service official favored more emphasis on such research but said that funding it would have to be balanced with other research priorities.", "Third, concerns have been expressed about the effect of new or increased fees on low-income visitors to federal recreation sites participating in the fee demonstration program. While BLM and the Fish and Wildlife Service plan surveys to address this issue, neither the Park Service nor the Forest Service has completed or plans research sufficient to address this topic at a number of sites participating in the demonstration program. Two groups we contacted, the National Parks and Conservation Association and Outward Bound USA, emphasized that although recreational fees are becoming more common, at some point fee increases will affect the demographics of recreation users, particularly those with limited means. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Forest Service stated that it is considering requiring fee demonstration sites to (1) collect data on the impact of fees on low-income and ethnic populations and (2) offer proposals to mitigate any impacts.", "Prior recreation fee research has also raised concerns about the impact of fees on the visitation patterns of low- and moderate-income users. For example, a study of the impact of fees on recreational day use at Army Corps of Engineers recreation facilities suggests that a larger proportion of low-income users would stop visiting a site if fees were charged and, since low-income users are more sensitive to the magnitude of fees charged, that higher fees would displace a higher proportion of low-income users. In addition, a 1997 survey of 1,260 visitors to 11 national park units found that 17 percent thought the fees charged were too high and that the lower the respondent\u2019s income, the greater the tendency to think the fees charged were too high. Several recreation fee researchers contacted said that while some completed research has shown support for new fees among users of all income levels, further research is needed to understand how new fees and fee levels affect visitation of low-income users at federal recreation sites."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Interest Groups Generally Support New Fee Program, but Some Voice Concerns", "paragraphs": ["A number of interest groups we contacted, while generally supportive of the program, had some concerns about how the program was being implemented and were withholding a strong endorsement until more tangible results of the program were available. Some groups were concerned that recreational fee increases represented an unfair burden on commercial recreation providers and that public acceptance of fee increases may diminish if fee increases go much higher. Also, some users were concerned that fees were too high and amounted to double taxation.", "All nine of the interest groups we contacted supported the recreational fee demonstration program, but some had concerns about how the program was being implemented. For example, the American Recreation Coalition supports the program because fees have generated funds to preserve aging agency facilities, provide new interpretative services, or experiment with new or innovative fee-collection initiatives, such as a regional trail pass program. However, the coalition was concerned that, in some cases, new or increased fees were being added to permit fees already paid by commercial recreation providers to the agencies, which represented an unfair and costly burden to their operations. The National Parks and Conservation Association told us it supports the fee demonstration program because fees are retained at the sites where they are collected and are used to reduce maintenance backlogs. At the same time, however, the association was concerned that at some point the public\u2019s acceptance of fee increases may erode. For example, according to the association, excessive use fees for private boaters along the Colorado River and a doubling or tripling of entrance fees at certain popular national parks such as Yosemite are actions that are likely to stretch the limit of public acceptance of new recreational fees. Another group from Washington State, the Mountaineers, told us that while the public has initially accepted the program, the group was withholding a strong endorsement of it until it could see the results from the agencies\u2019 spending on increased maintenance, enhanced visitor services, or interpretative programs and the results of visitor surveys.", "Some visitors to federal recreation sites under the demonstration program have voiced opposition to new or increased fees. For example, a Forest Service analysis of 528 comment cards found that about 26 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that the value of the recreation opportunities and services the visitors had experienced was at least equal to the fee they paid. In addition, 43 percent of the 420 people providing written comments on the cards made negative statements about the recreational fees, such as \u201cthe price is too high,\u201d \u201cthis is double taxation,\u201d or \u201cI oppose the fees.\u201d Similarly, an analysis of 484 pieces of correspondence received by the Park Service between July 1996 and September 1997 showed that 67 percent of respondents expressed some opposition to new fees. According to Park Service and Forest Service officials, the surveys were not based on statistical sampling and, therefore, are not representative of all users. Comment cards and correspondence are more likely to be completed by those having a strong opinion on fees, especially those who are opposed to fees."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
