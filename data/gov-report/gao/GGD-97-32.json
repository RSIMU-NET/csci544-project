This federal legislation encourages states to enact statutes authorizing fingerprint-based national searches of criminal history records of individuals seeking paid or volunteer positions with organizations serving children, the elderly, or the disabled. As agreed with you, we conducted work in five states (California, Florida, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) to address the following questions:", "To what extent have selected states enacted statutes authorizing national background checks of child care providers? Also, what fees are charged for background checks of volunteers, and how do these fees compare with the actual costs in these states?", "What effects have these states\u2019 laws and related fees had on volunteerism?", "For instance, have the laws and fees discouraged volunteers from participating in child care programs at nonprofit entities?", "Have selected state agencies and other organizations found national background checks a useful screening tool? More specifically, for selected job or position categories in selected jurisdictions, how often have fingerprint-based background checks identified individuals with criminal histories?", "What is the status of the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) being developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and what are the selected states\u2019 plans for using the system when it becomes available?", "Initially, we identified and reviewed relevant child care-related statutes enacted by each of the five states. Also, we identified the FBI\u2019s and the selected states\u2019 fees for background checks. We compared these fees to the actual costs of such checks, as reported by the FBI and the respective state agencies; however, we did not independently verify the accuracy of these amounts. To determine the effects (if any) of these laws and related fees on volunteerism, we reviewed applicable studies and interviewed officials of 3 national and 20 local nonprofit youth-serving organizations. Regarding the usefulness of national checks, we obtained views from officials at relevant national, state, and local organizations. Also, for at least one job or position category in each of the five states, we analyzed available statistics on the number and the results of national fingerprint-based background checks of applicants. To determine the status of IAFIS, we interviewed FBI officials and reviewed documentation regarding the system\u2019s schedule and progress. Also, we contacted responsible officials in each of the five states to determine their plans for interfacing with IAFIS.", "We did our work from March to October 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Because our work covered only selected child care organizations and/or positions and selected locations within five states, our findings (1) should not be considered representative of statewide conditions in the selected states and (2) are not projectable to other states. Appendix I provides further details about our objectives, scope, and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over 87 million children in the United States participate in activities provided by child- and youth-serving organizations each year. Many of these organizations have formalized and structured environments, such as schools, which children are required to attend. Others are voluntary, extracurricular activities, such as clubs and sports activities. The known adult-child interactions that involve child abuse in these out-of-home settings, although a relatively small percentage of child abuse overall,have drawn public attention and generated parental alarm about the safety of children in such settings. In 1996, the Department of Justice issued a report that examines the most serious crimes against children. For example, the report provides analyses of more than 35,000 cases of child murder that occurred between 1976 and 1994.", "Criminal history records checks are one of several methods of predicting the suitability of individuals seeking paid or volunteer positions with organizations that interact with children. National fingerprint checks can help identify criminal histories of individuals convicted of a crime anywhere in the United States who are seeking a volunteer or paid position in any state.", "The checks of criminal history records for civil (noncriminal justice) purposes have long been a part of the FBI\u2019s workload. Public Law 92-544, which was enacted in 1972 and preceded NCPA, authorizes the FBI to exchange identification records with officials of state and local governments for purposes of licensing and employment\u2014if such exchanges are also authorized by a state statute that has been approved by the U.S. Attorney General.", "NCPA did not give the states any new access to national fingerprint-based background checks and did not mandate the states to pass laws. Rather, NCPA highlighted the need for such background checks and encouraged the states to pass appropriate legislation. Thus, under NCPA, background checks must be handled in accordance with the requirements of Public Law 92-544. For example, each state that wants the FBI to conduct national criminal history records checks of child care or youth service workers must have in place a law defining what categories of jobs or positions require the background checks. It is left up to each state to decide how broadly to extend the background check requirement. But, whatever the scope, there must be a state law requiring fingerprinting of the employee or volunteer and allowing the FBI to conduct criminal history background checks of persons in or applying for the specified categories of jobs or positions.", "Further, NCPA specifies that the criminal records search must be based upon fingerprints. Thus, each request for a criminal history background search must be accompanied by a set of 10-print fingerprint cards. These submissions must be made by (and the results returned to) a designated governmental agency, such as a state Department of Education, Department of Social Services, or a state public safety or police department. NCPA requires that these designated agencies be responsible for determining whether the provider has been convicted of, or is under pending indictment for, a crime that bears upon the provider\u2019s fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children. However, the act does not provide a specific list of disqualifying offenses; rather, each state must make these determinations.", "When enacted in 1993, NCPA specified that fees collected by the FBI and authorized state agencies, respectively, for fingerprint-based background checks of volunteers with a qualified entity could not exceed the actual cost. The provision was amended in 1994 to specify that the fee for these volunteers could not exceed $18 or the actual cost, whichever is less.Also, the act specifies that the states shall ensure that fees to nonprofit entities for fingerprint-based background checks do not discourage volunteers from participating in child care programs.", "According to the FBI, advances in electronic communications, expanding legislative mandates, and increased sophistication of law enforcement technology are expected to double the number of all types of criminal history information requests by the end of the century. IAFIS, which has been under development since the early 1990s, is being designed to provide more efficient identification services by, among other means, eliminating the need to transport and process paper fingerprint cards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variations in Scope or Coverage of Statutes in the Five Study States", "paragraphs": ["According to the FBI, 37 of the 50 states have enacted legislation authorizing use of national fingerprint-based checks of criminal history records for purposes of checking applicants for paid or volunteer positions involving interaction with children. The 5 states we selected for review are among these 37. Applicable statutes in the five states vary considerably in scope or coverage (see app. II). For example, Tennessee\u2019s statute covers a broad range of positions or work settings involving interaction with children, while Virginia\u2019s statutes cover only selected school districts and juvenile residential facilities. Also, some statutes cover new applicants only, while other statutes cover both current employees and new applicants. The statutes also differ regarding whether national checks are required or permitted. For example, the Florida child care-related statutes shown in appendix II require national checks, whereas Tennessee\u2019s statutes permit but do not require national checks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Even When National Fingerprint Checks Have Been Authorized, Few Volunteers Have Been Checked", "paragraphs": ["Three of the five states (California, Tennessee, and Texas) have authority to request national checks of volunteers at nonprofit youth-serving organizations, such as the Boy Scouts of America and Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America. Within these states, in reference to these volunteers, the use of fingerprints to nationally check criminal history records has been limited. For example, in California, although all nonprofit youth-serving organizations have authority to request national checks, only 12 checks had been requested from January through June 1996. In Tennessee, only two such checks were requested in 1995. In Texas, four nonprofit youth-serving organizations are authorized to request national checks. From August 1, 1995, through July 17, 1996, a total of 98 national checks were requested, all by one local affiliate of the Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America.", "Officials at most of the nonprofit youth-serving organizations we contacted suggested several reasons why the use of national checks of volunteers has been limited. One reason suggested was that the states\u2019 statutes permit rather than require such checks. The officials commented that the fact that state statutes permit rather than require national fingerprint-based checks of volunteers may derive from concerns about the fees for such checks. According to these officials, the use of national background checks may also have been limited because the FBI\u2019s response or turnaround time can be weeks or months, which may be unacceptable for many organizations that use volunteers for seasonal or part-time positions. In Texas, for instance, officials at the Volunteer Center of Dallas County told us that state name-based searches generally meet their clients\u2019 needs because the fee ($4) is reasonable and the results are available in a week or less. Thus, Center officials told us that they do not plan to push for legislation requiring national fingerprint checks.", "Another reason for limited fingerprint-based background checks of volunteers may be lack of authorization awareness by certain groups. For example, two of the youth-serving organizations that we contacted in California were not aware that they are allowed to request national fingerprint-based background checks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fees for Fingerprint Checks Varied, and Some States Have Not Calculated Their Actual Costs", "paragraphs": ["A complete check of criminal history records has both FBI and state agency components. At the time of our review, the FBI\u2019s fee for national fingerprint-based background checks was $18 for volunteers and $24 for all others. The fee amount for volunteers equates to the FBI\u2019s reported costs. That is, according to expenditure and workload data provided us by the FBI, the Bureau projected that actual costs would average $18 for each fingerprint-based background search of criminal history records during fiscal year 1996.", "Of the five states we studied, only California had recently (in 1996) calculated its actual costs ($32.62) for conducting a fingerprint-based check of state records. This reported cost figure was considerably higher than the NCPA-imposed fee cap for volunteers of $18. However, California was not charging a fee for fingerprint-based checks of volunteers at nonprofit youth-serving organizations.", "Florida Department of Law Enforcement officials told us that the state does not perform fingerprint-based checks of criminal history records for purposes of licensing and employment. These officials explained that the state\u2019s computer system for fingerprint searches was not sufficient to handle such requests. Thus, our questions regarding the fees for and the actual costs of state fingerprint checks were not applicable to Florida.", "By state statute, Tennessee\u2019s fee structure matches that of the FBI; thus, the state\u2019s fee is $18 for volunteers and $24 for all others. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation officials told us that given this statutory basis for setting fees, the state has not attempted to calculate its actual costs.", "Texas\u2019 fee is $15 for fingerprint checks of applicants, whether volunteers or nonvolunteers. This fee amount, according to Texas Department of Pubic Safety officials, was first established in 1990 on the basis of a study that calculated actual costs totaling $11.42 per applicant. However, the study recommended a fee of $15 to ensure that Texas was consistent with other states\u2019 fees for similar services.", "Virginia\u2019s fee is $13 for fingerprint checks of applicants, whether volunteers or nonvolunteers. Virginia Department of State Police officials told us that this fee amount has been in effect for several years and, at the time of implementation, was set to match the FBI\u2019s then-current fee.", "Without knowledge of actual costs, states that charge fees cannot ensure compliance with federal law. Specifically, as amended in 1994, NCPA provides that fees collected by authorized state agencies for fingerprint-based background checks of volunteers may not exceed $18 or the actual cost, whichever is less."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Voluntarism Apparently Not Affected by Background Check Laws and Related Fees, Although Concerns Exist", "paragraphs": ["In the states we studied, because nonprofit youth-serving organizations had requested relatively few national fingerprint-based checks on volunteers, the applicable statutes and related fees do not appear to have negatively affected volunteerism. However, officials at the various nonprofit organizations we contacted were concerned about state and FBI fees. Many of these officials commented that the fees were too high and, thus, if state laws were changed to require fingerprint checks, the number of volunteers and/or the scope of program services probably would be reduced.", "On the basis of discussions with officials at various national and local nonprofit entities, we identified only two studies\u2014completed in 1994 and 1995, respectively\u2014that had attempted to assess the potential effects of background check fees on volunteerism. Both studies were conducted or sponsored by the Boy Scouts of America. The respondents to both studies generally endorsed the concept that adult volunteers should be required to have a background check, but the respondents also indicated that personal cost was a factor influencing their willingness to maintain their volunteer status. Due to sampling and other methodological limitations, however, neither study can be used to draw conclusions about the overall scouting volunteer population. Also, the reported results are speculative because reactions were solicited regarding fees not actually in place.", "A minority view was presented by officials at 2 of the 20 nonprofit organizations we contacted in the study states (see table I.1 in app. I). These officials\u2014who represented entities located in California\u2014commented that the current fees for national checks were reasonable and easily could be borne by applicant volunteers.

These officials emphasized that although it is not quantifiable, the deterrent effect of the prospect of national background checks is significant\u2014and, indeed, is a factor perhaps more important than any other aspect of such checks. Where applicable, for example, experienced officials told us of instances where individuals reconsidered their interest or withdrew their applications after learning that criminal history records would be checked. These officials acknowledged that such background checks may also deter a few qualified applicants who object to such checks due to privacy or other concerns. On balance, however, the officials said that the deterrent effect of national background checks was largely positive, that is, unsuitable applicants were being deterred from applying for child care-related positions.", "Further, officials at most of the organizations we contacted said that national fingerprint-based checks can be an important supplement to traditional screening tools, such as personal interviews, reference queries or follow-ups, and checks of local and state records. According to these officials, in screening applicants, child care entities should not rely solely upon checks of criminal history records\u2014whether national, state, or local\u2014because such records may be incomplete or even nonexistent for many unsuitable applicants. On the other hand, national fingerprint-based background checks may be the only effective way to readily identify the potentially worst abusers of children, that is, the pedophiles who change their names and move from state to state to continue their sexually perversive patterns of behavior. Further, national checks can identify out-of-state criminal histories involving certain offenses that although not directly involving child abuse, may nonetheless be important in considering an applicant\u2019s suitability. These offenses include, for example, offenses involving drug possession or trafficking, assault or other violent acts, and theft\u2014and even the offense of driving while intoxicated, which may have particular relevance in checking prospective applicants for positions involving transportation of children.", "By focusing on selected job positions, organizations, or local jurisdictions within each state, we were able to identify situations clearly showing the usefulness of national fingerprint-based checks. For example:", "An individual moved from Texas to California and obtained a teaching position in a special education program. In conducting a national background check in 1996, as requested by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, the FBI identified records showing that the individual had been convicted of sexual battery (rape) in Florida. In one school district in Florida, national fingerprint checks of noninstructional staff hired in 1995 resulted in the firing of at least seven individuals. The search of criminal history records showed that each individual had been convicted for a serious offense, such as drug possession or trafficking or aggravated battery.", "Fingerprint searches of prospective foster parents in Tennessee during the period October 1995 through May 1996 showed that 120 (or 9.3 percent) of 1,293 applicants had criminal felony records. Of the 120 criminal history records, 58 involved out-of-state records, which were not identifiable based solely upon a search of Tennessee records. In Texas, a local nonprofit youth-serving organization requested a total of 98 national fingerprint-based checks from August 1, 1995, through July 17, 1996. One applicant was rejected as a volunteer, in part, because the criminal history records showed a drug possession conviction. In Virginia, from July 1993 through June 1996, one county requested approximately 3,800 state and national fingerprint checks on new-hire school employees. A total of 111 individuals were subsequently fired on the basis that they had lied on their applications (claiming no criminal conviction).", "Appendix IV presents more details about these and related examples.

In a March 1996 status report submitted to the Senate Appropriations Committee, the FBI acknowledged that problems with various components prompted a decision (in February 1996) to adopt a new approach for developing and deploying IAFIS, which may lead to further revision of schedule and cost estimates. In its next status report, the FBI\u2019s schedule and cost estimates were unchanged. However, in December 1996, in commenting on a draft of our report, FBI officials told us that the IAFIS completion date had been revised to July 1999.", "The new approach for developing and deploying IAFIS\u2014reflecting the February 1996 decision mentioned above\u2014called for the incremental availability of certain functions earlier in the process, rather than offering all IAFIS services at the final completion date.

These forums were attended by officials from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and by representatives from all of the major vendors for automated and live-scan fingerprint equipment. The resulting national standards for the transmissions of fingerprint data have been approved by the American National Standards Institute.", "Among other purposes, these standards were to provide a basis for state and local law enforcement officials to begin planning to ensure that their agencies had the capability to participate in the new federal system. However, it is important to note that no agency is required to participate in IAFIS. Each state can decide the extent to which it wants to be \u201cconnected\u201d to and compatible with IAFIS. That is, each state must decide for itself what equipment and system changes or upgrades are needed (if any), desirable, and affordable.", "Recognizing that the various states are at different stages of automation with respect to fingerprint identification services, the FBI is planning to accommodate different levels of participation in IAFIS\u2014ranging from minimal to full participation. At the minimal end, for example, some states may decide to continue using the U.S. Postal Service to transmit paper fingerprint cards. For this reason, as noted earlier, IAFIS will have a \u201cFingerprint Image Capture System\u201d that will allow the FBI to scan and digitize data from these cards.
