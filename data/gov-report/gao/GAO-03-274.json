Its objectives are threefold: (1) to examine the historical funding trends and their impact on the condition of the active forces' facilities, (2) to evaluate the consistency of the services' information on facility conditions, and (3) to assess the Department of Defense's (DOD) long-term strategic plan and objectives to improve facility conditions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the amount of money the active forces have spent on facility maintenance has increased recently, DOD and service officials said these amounts have not been sufficient to halt the deterioration of facilities. Too little funding to adequately maintain facilities is also aggravated by DOD's acknowledged retention of facilities in excess of its needs. From fiscal year 1998 to 2001, obligations for facility maintenance rose by 26 percent with increases coming from higher annual budget requests, congressional designations that exceeded those requests, supplemental appropriations, and the services' movement of funds to maintenance projects. Funding for military construction also increased during this period. However, military reports and testimonies state that these amounts have been insufficient, and GAO's recent visits to installations document the deteriorated conditions of facilities. There is a lack of consistency in the services' information on facility conditions, making it difficult for Congress, DOD, and the services to direct funds to facilities where they are most needed and to accurately gauge facility conditions. Although DOD developed a standard rating scale to summarize facility conditions (C-ratings), each service has the latitude to use its own system for assessing conditions, including the types of facility raters, assessment frequencies, appraisal scales, and validation procedures. Although DOD has a strategic plan for facilities, it lacks comprehensive information on the specific actions, time frames, responsibilities, and funding needed to reach its goals. Also, DOD has set up three objectives to improve its facility conditions--to fully fund sustainment, to achieve a 67-year average recapitalization rate by fiscal year 2007, and to improve facility conditions so that deficiencies have limited effects on military mission achievement by fiscal year 2010. However, the services have not proposed to fully fund all the objectives and have developed funding plans to achieve others that have unrealistically high rates of increase during the out-years. At the same time, the services have not developed comprehensive performance plans to implement DOD's vision for facilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Department of Defense (DOD) installations and facilities are critical to  supporting U.S. military forces, but they have not been sufficiently  maintained or recapitalized for years. Defense facilities are durable capital  assets that, if properly built and sustained, have useful lives ranging from  50 years and beyond. However, in the absence of proper maintenance,  these facilities perform poorly and decay prematurely. Without periodic  recapitalization, they can become obsolete and no longer be cost- effectively renovated and must be replaced with new construction.  Consequently, DOD and active military service officials report that 68  percent of facility classes rated by major commands are in such a  deteriorated condition that they negatively affect the quality of life of  military personnel and their families and their ability to achieve their  mission. Some officials estimate that it will cost tens of billions of dollars  spread over 6 to 9 years to restore DOD\u2019s facilities, along with a steady,  predictable stream of sustainment and recapitalization funding after that  to prevent problems from reoccurring. DOD and Congress have  recognized the need to fully fund maintenance and recapitalization of  facilities, as well as to reduce the department\u2019s inventory of facilities  through an upcoming round of base realignments and closures scheduled  for fiscal year 2005.", "We prepared this report under our basic legislative responsibilities. We are  providing it to you because of your oversight responsibilities for DOD\u2019s  facilities. This report (1) examines the historical funding trends for facility  maintenance and military construction (including budget requests, initial  congressional designations, and obligations) and their impact on the  condition of the active forces\u2019 facilities, (2) evaluates the consistency of  the services\u2019 information on facility conditions to help ensure that funding  decisions effectively target facilities in greatest need and reported ratings  accurately measure facility condition improvements, and (3) assesses the  department\u2019s long-term strategic plan and objectives to sustain and  improve the condition of facilities. This is one of several reviews that we  have underway examining various aspects of facility conditions in the  department. We are also reviewing the physical condition of and  maintenance and recapitalization plans for military reserve facilities and  the management of housing for unaccompanied personnel.", "In performing our work for this review, we examined DOD\u2019s budget  requests, congressional designations, and obligations data for facilities  maintenance and construction since fiscal year 1998. In addition, we  visited 10 military installations and met with officials of the department,  the services, and six major commands to review the management and  physical condition of their facilities. During our visits to installations, we  discussed the evaluation methods and the condition assessment processes  with the facility raters and reviewers and toured various facilities to  observe their physical condition and deficiencies. We reviewed each  service\u2019s system for assessing facility conditions and compared this  information across the services. We also examined DOD\u2019s plans and  objectives to address the condition of facilities. We did not attempt to  validate DOD\u2019s reported requirements for the sustainment of its facilities,  nor did we validate DOD\u2019s facility inventory database. We conducted our  work between February and November 2002 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. A more thorough description of  our scope and methodology is in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the United States, the active military services are responsible for nearly  380,000 facilities, with an estimated plant replacement value of over $435  billion.

If family housing  were included, the total number of facilities would rise to more than  524,000, with a plant replacement value of more than $477 billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding for Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Historically, the military services used their own metrics, terminology, and  accounting structures to manage their facilities. In fiscal year 2002, DOD  replaced the operation and maintenance funded real property  maintenance program with two distinct activities and accounting  structures for (1) sustainment and (2) restoration and modernization,  having already created a separate accounting structure for demolition and  disposal in fiscal year 1999. In addition, DOD has developed a model for  estimating sustainment funding needs, and it is developing a model for  forecasting restoration and modernization funding requirements. The  Army and the Air Force began using the sustainment and restoration and  modernization programs in fiscal year 2002, while the Navy and the Marine  Corps asked for and were given permission to delay implementation of  these new programs until fiscal year 2003.", "Operation and maintenance funds primarily support sustainment activities,  which are designed to keep facilities in good working order. Sustainment  funds cover expenses for all recurring maintenance costs and contracts, as  well as for major repairs of nonstructural facility components (e.g.,  replacing the roof or repairing the air-conditioning system) that are  expected to occur during a facility\u2019s life cycle. Restoration includes repair  and replacement work to restore facilities damaged by inadequate  sustainment, excessive age, natural disaster, fire, accident, or other  causes. Modernization includes altering, or modernizing, facilities to meet  new or higher standards, accommodate new functions, or replace  structural components. Both operation and maintenance and military  construction monies fund these activities, as well as demolition and  disposal activities. A fourth activity\u2014new construction\u2014is also funded  with both military construction and operation and maintenance monies.  This activity involves the construction of new buildings and other  facilities, referred to as new footprint projects. There are limitations to  the amount of operation and maintenance funds that can be used for new  construction and the alteration or conversion of existing facilities: a  maximum of $750,000 per project or up to $1.5 million if the project is  designed to correct a deficiency that threatens life, health, or safety. As  figure 1 illustrates, overlapping funding sources support DOD\u2019s  sustainment, restoration, and modernization of military facilities, along  with its demolition program and new military construction.", "According to DOD, fully funding sustainment is the most cost-effective  approach to managing facilities because it provides the most performance  over the longest period of time for the least investment. Without adequate  sustainment, expected service life is reduced and facilities must be  recapitalized sooner than expected. Yet, even with adequate sustainment,  over time facilities eventually either physically wear out or become  obsolete. An obsolete facility is one that is irrelevant to present-day  missions regardless of its condition; for example, a firehouse built in 1930  that is too narrow or too short to accommodate modern fire trucks. Once  facilities reach the end of their expected service life, they must be  replaced or extensively renovated or modernized\u2014referred to as  recapitalization\u2014if they are to continue providing adequate performance.  DOD estimates that an average recapitalization rate of 67 years allows  fully sustained facilities to meet their requirements. In fiscal year 2002,  DOD\u2019s average recapitalization rate was 101 years, and it is projected to  increase to about 150 years in fiscal year 2003. Recapitalization  investments can also be made periodically throughout a facility\u2019s service  life, which extends service life and delays the need for replacement.  Moreover, even after recapitalization investments are made, facility  performance can rapidly decline in the absence of adequate sustainment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rating of Facilities", "paragraphs": ["In an attempt to standardize the rating of facilities across the services and  to provide a measure of facility conditions, DOD issued its first  Installations\u2019 Readiness Report in 1999. Within the report, the services\u2019  major commands report on each of their nine facility classes using a scale  of C-1 through C-4, as defined in table 1. For example, a C-4 rating is an  indication that a facility class for a specified installation or major  command has deficiencies that require workarounds or effectively  preclude satisfactory mission accomplishment. According to DOD\u2019s  guidance to the services, they could implement this readiness reporting  system without modifying their existing assessment processes. As a result,  all four services are using different systems to assess facility conditions  and develop C-ratings. However, reporting their ratings to DOD requires  the services to implement additional processes to summarize information  by major commands using C-ratings for facility classes.", "The nine facility classes are groupings of like facilities. These facility  classes are similar to the groupings traditionally used for military  construction budgets and are consistent with the real property inventories  the military services maintain. Table 2 lists the nine classes with examples  of the types of facilities included in each class.", "In fiscal year 2001, DOD reported that 68 percent of facility classes rated  by the services\u2019 major commands received C-3 or C-4 ratings, indicating  that they were in such deteriorated condition that they negatively affected  the quality of life of military personnel and their families and their ability  to achieve their mission. For example, the Army Forces Command did not  rate any of its facility classes as C-1, but it rated its medical class as C-2  and its remaining eight classes as C-3. During the same period, the Navy\u2019s  Pacific Fleet did not rate any of its facility classes as C-1 or C-2, but it  rated its community and housing class as C-4 and its remaining seven  classes as C-3. The Pacific Fleet does not report ratings for the mobility  class."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic Plan and Objectives for Facilities", "paragraphs": ["DOD has labored in recent years to develop its Defense Facilities  Strategic Plan, which outlines a set of initiatives over a 20-year period that  are directly linked to the plan\u2019s vision, mission, and goals. The vision set  forth in the plan is to have installations and facilities available when and  where needed to effectively and efficiently support missions. To achieve  its vision, the plan\u2019s strategic goals are to (1) locate, size, and configure  defense installations and facilities to meet the requirements of today\u2019s and  tomorrow\u2019s force structures; (2) acquire and sustain defense installations  and facilities to provide mission-ready installations with quality living and  work environments; (3) leverage resources\u2014money, people, and  equipment\u2014to achieve the proper balance between requirements and  available funding; and (4) improve facility management and planning by  embracing best business practices and taking advantage of modern asset- management techniques and performance-assessment metrics.", "In addition to the broad goals set forth in its strategic plan, DOD  established three key objectives. The objectives are (1) to fully fund  sustainment, starting in fiscal year 2004; (2) to achieve an average  recapitalization rate of 67 years, by fiscal year 2007; and (3) to concentrate  funding so as to eliminate C-3 and C-4 facility ratings, bringing the ratings  up to a minimal C-2 level by fiscal year 2010. As a point of reference,  although there were no specific funding targets for fiscal year 2002, the  military services intended to fund sustainment between 78 and 98 percent  of requirements and reach an average recapitalization rate between 63 and  163 years in fiscal year 2002. As well, departmentwide facility ratings show  that major commands rated 68 percent of facility classes C-3 or C-4. DOD  gradually phased in its guidance to the services on sustainment beginning  in fiscal year 2002 when it instructed the services to fund sustainment to  the maximum extent possible. For fiscal year 2003, DOD instructed the  services to attempt to fully fund sustainment to the levels specified by its  facilities sustainment model. For fiscal year 2004 and thereafter, DOD  instructed the services to fully fund sustainment to the levels defined by  the facilities sustainment model. To reduce the recapitalization rate and  eliminate C-3 and C-4 ratings, facilities need to be fully sustained.", "The Defense Facilities Strategic Plan also notes that DOD needs to better  focus its sustainment and restoration and modernization dollars to cost- effectively operate and maintain its facilities to support its military  missions. The plan states that DOD should only fund sustainment and  restoration and modernization of those facilities that are needed. As  authorized by Congress in 2001, DOD intends to reduce its inventory of  facilities as the result of closing some installations and by consolidating  overlapping activities within and across the services through a round of  base realignments and closures scheduled for fiscal year 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO Reports", "paragraphs": ["We have conducted a number of reviews where we identified areas in  which DOD and the services could improve their facilities management  program.

We updated this report in January 2003, as well as  designated federal real property as a new high-risk area at the same time.  In September 1999, we reported on the management of DOD\u2019s facility  maintenance and repair programs and recommended that the Secretary of  Defense (1) develop a way to link needs assessment with both resource  allocations and tracking systems that show whether high-priority needs  are receiving funding, (2) establish standardized condition assessment  criteria, and (3) have the services adopt a valid engineering-based  assessment system for facilities maintenance. In February 2000, we  reported on the funding amounts that Congress had designated for DOD\u2019s  operation and maintenance subactivities and compared the amounts with  DOD\u2019s obligations for those same subactivities. We found that DOD  consistently moved operation and maintenance funds into and out of  certain activities, usually because they were needed elsewhere.

In general, the funding  increases for facility maintenance resulted from moderately higher annual  requests by the services, except in fiscal year 2000; congressionally  designated funding that was higher than that requested by the services;  supplemental appropriations; and the services\u2019 movement of funds to  maintenance projects at the end of each fiscal year. The funding increase  in military construction resulted primarily from congressional  designations greater than initially requested by DOD. Even with these  increases, funding has fallen short of what is needed to reverse the  deteriorated state of many facilities, as highlighted in recent congressional  testimony and various studies conducted by the services.

During the  same period, Congress consistently designated more funding for facility  maintenance than DOD had requested. In addition, DOD\u2019s reported  obligations for facility maintenance increased from over $3.8 billion in  fiscal year 1998 to more than $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2001, a 26 percent  increase during fiscal years 1998 through 2001, unadjusted for inflation.", "While some funding increases for facility maintenance resulted from  moderately higher requests by the services (except in fiscal year 2000),  most of the growth stemmed from congressionally designated funding that  was above that requested by the services; supplemental appropriations  that increased facility maintenance funding in each fiscal year; and the  services\u2019 internal movement of funds into facility maintenance from other  operation and maintenance-funded programs, such as operating tempo  programs. According to a DOD official, some of the growth in the  reported maintenance funding resulted from internal adjustments among  accounts\u2014intrabudget transfers from other appropriations to facility  maintenance. The services also moved funds out of facility maintenance to  other programs such as base operations and force readiness during this  period; however, the outward movements of funds were generally less  than the amounts moved into facility maintenance. For example, during  fiscal year 2000, the Army initially moved $6.8 million out of facility  maintenance to base operations support but, by the end of the fiscal year,  had moved more than $10 million back into facility maintenance from base  operations support. In addition, it is important to note that in fiscal year  2000, DOD split its budget request for facilities between $2.8 billion for  facility maintenance and $1.8 billion for quality of life enhancements.  DOD specifically requested funds for quality-of-life enhancements in fiscal  year 2000 to reduce the services\u2019 facility maintenance backlog and to  repair barracks, dormitories, and related facilities.

Congress makes appropriations  at the aggregated account level\u2014that is, for the Army, the Air Force, the  Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Defense-wide operation and maintenance  accounts. However, to indicate how it expects operation and maintenance  funds to be spent, Congress designates, in its conference report on annual  appropriations acts, specific amounts for each subactivity group, such as  sustainment, restoration and modernization, or base operations.

During the same period, as figure 3 shows, Congress  consistently appropriated more funding for military construction than  DOD had requested by adding construction projects. Although the  appropriated amounts slightly decreased between fiscal year 1998 and  1999 and again between fiscal year 2000 and 2001, total appropriations  increased from $2.1 billion in fiscal year 1998 to more than $4.1 billion in  fiscal year 2002, a 95 percent increase, unadjusted for inflation.", "In fiscal year 2000, DOD requested less in military construction funds than  it had asked for in the previous two fiscal years but it also requested  advance appropriations for fiscal year 2001 totaling more than $1.5 billion  for the active services.

In its  report on the fiscal year 2000 military construction appropriation bill, the  Senate Committee on Appropriations noted that the use of advance  appropriations was not consistent with the long-standing policy of fully  funding military construction and directed DOD to fully fund all military  construction projects in future budget requests. The Committee also noted  that it was concerned about DOD\u2019s continued lack of investment in  military facilities and indicated that the fiscal year 2000 military  construction request failed to request sufficient funds to support DOD\u2019s  efforts to modernize, renovate, and improve aging facilities.

For example, Army officials  testified that average facility maintenance funding since the early 1990s  was approximately 60 percent of what was needed. These officials also  testified that available maintenance funding met only 70 percent of their  needs in fiscal year 2001. Likewise, Air Force officials testified that facility  maintenance funding shortfalls have hindered the service\u2019s efforts to  sustain and operate Air Force facilities and only allow the Air Force to  provide day-to-day maintenance for facilities. Navy and Marine Corps  officials also testified that their services consistently underfunded facility  maintenance.", "In addition to congressional testimony, DOD and the military services have  issued a number of recent reports that further underscore the insufficiency  of funding for facility maintenance. In its annual financial reports, DOD  reported that its deferred maintenance increased from $35.9 billion in  fiscal year 1998 to $50 billion in fiscal year 2001\u2014a $14.1 billion increase  in 3 years. However, it is important to note that in fiscal year 2001, DOD  stopped reporting deferred maintenance because it found deferred  maintenance to be inaccurate, subjective, and unverifiable. In the  Installations\u2019 Readiness Report for fiscal year 2001, the services reported  that 68 percent of their facility classes rated by major commands were C-3  or C-4. In a report on its facilities investment plan, the Air Force indicated  that, since fiscal year 1998, operation and maintenance facilities funding  was limited to 1 percent of the service\u2019s total plant replacement value.  However, the full 1 percent rarely reached Air Force installations because  the funds were moved to other needs or used to pay for critical repairs or  upgrades to facilities, which are not considered maintenance activities.  Based on DOD\u2019s facilities sustainment model, 1 percent of plant  replacement value is not enough to fully sustain facilities. In a 2002 report  on the Navy\u2019s facilities maintenance program, the Naval Audit Service  stated that the Navy historically understated its maintenance requirements  and used its facility maintenance funds to resolve funding shortfalls in  other Navy programs. The Naval Audit Service concluded that, as a result  of these movements and the resulting reductions in maintenance funding  at the beginning of the fiscal year, it is difficult for the Navy to make or  implement rational plans for maintaining and repairing its facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deteriorated Condition of Military Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Although we found new construction and renovations of buildings taking  place, we also observed numerous examples of deteriorated conditions of  military facilities during our visits to 10 installations across the country.

In fiscal year 2001, Naval Station San Diego\u2019s operations and  training class, of which these facilities are part, was rated C-3, which is  defined by DOD as having significant deficiencies that prevent performing  some missions.", "During our visit to Naval Base Coronado, California, which was  established as Naval Air Station North Island in 1917 and is comprised of  the naval air station, Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, and five other  activities, we observed a severely deteriorated runway with large sections  of cracked and broken concrete that had, on at least one occasion, caused  minor damage to aircraft using the runway (see fig. 8). The operations and  training facility class, including runways, at Naval Base Coronado was  rated C-3 in fiscal year 2001. Moreover, officials told us that the base  continually dealt with large problems created by small maintenance  problems that were not addressed. For instance, they told us a toilet,  which did not shut off properly, flooded out one building, resulting in  $140,000 in cleanup costs. We also saw one of the base\u2019s child  development centers, which was permanently closed in January 2002  because of severe problems with mold that had rotted the support  structure underneath the building\u2019s floor. The building\u2019s closure, which  affected more than 160 children for whom alternate care had to be found,  had a significant impact on the quality of life of military families at this  base.", "At Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, established in 1917 and homeport for 76  ships and 138 aircraft, we observed several facilities under renovation, but  we also saw many deteriorated facilities, including a large warehouse that  was evacuated because the wooden beams supporting the roof broke.  Likewise, during our visit to Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia,  established in 1952 and home to 23 aircraft squadrons assigned to both the  Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, we saw several newly constructed facilities,  some of which were replacing obsolete facilities. Still, officials told us that  sections of the installation\u2019s aircraft intermediate maintenance depot, the  Navy\u2019s only F-14 aircraft electronics maintenance support center,  frequently shut down because the facility\u2019s failing air-conditioning system  could not adequately cool room temperatures to the levels necessary for  aircraft repair equipment to function. As a result, according to base  personnel, there was a backlog of aircraft parts that needed repairs,  grounding some aircraft and forcing sailors to work long hours to make up  the backlog. In fiscal year 2001, Naval Air Station Oceana\u2019s maintenance  and production facilities, including avionics maintenance shops, were  rated C-4. Figure 9 shows the aircraft intermediate maintenance depot\u2019s  portable generator, used to supplement the internal air-conditioning  system, being cooled by a garden hose and a sprinkler to prevent  overheating. In addition, officials told us that some barracks at Naval Air  Station Oceana were not occupied because their heating, ventilation, and  air-conditioning systems were not maintained, allowing mold and mildew  to grow in walls, carpeting, and ceilings\u2014all of which must be replaced.  Personnel who occupied these buildings had to find housing off base.", "Quantico Marine Corps Base, Virginia, established in 1917, serves two  primary roles\u2014as the location where Marine Corps\u2019 concepts, doctrine,  training, and equipment are developed and as the focal point for Marine  Corps\u2019 professional military education. While we saw a number of new  buildings in good exterior condition, we also saw a number of older,  deteriorated facilities at the base. For example, we observed buildings  with doors falling off their frames, barracks room walls cracked and  covered with mold, and air-conditioning systems close to failure. In one  building with a mess hall, living quarters, and classrooms, base officials  showed us corroded valves from the air-conditioning system (see fig. 10).  They told us that the system, which was imported from India in 1999,  constantly leaked and had corroded the two valves in only one year. They  added that because the system was only one of three in use in the United  States, it was difficult to obtain the parts needed to repair it.", "Although the base\u2019s operations and training facility class was rated C-2 in  fiscal year 2001, we visited two old classroom buildings that were still in  use but did not have adequate indoor bathroom facilities.

The Atlantic Fleet, the Navy\u2019s  second largest major command, however, developed its own assessment  system that uses criteria different from Navy-wide standards to classify  deficiencies.

A green rating signifies  that a facility meets standards and is in overall good condition. An amber  rating indicates that a facility does not fully meet facility standards, while  a red rating signifies a facility is substandard and in overall poor condition.  In the Air Force, projects are prioritized using the Facility Investment  Metric, which weights repair project costs by mission area, such as  primary mission and base support, and mission impact. Projects, not  facilities, are rated as minimal, degraded, or critical. A minimal rating  indicates marginal or little adverse impact to installation mission  capability. A degraded rating indicates a limited loss of installation mission  capability. A critical rating indicates a significant loss of installation  mission capability and frequent mission interruptions. In the Navy,  facilities are rated good, fair, or poor based on deficiencies identified  during assessments. A good rating indicates that a facility complies with  facility standards. A fair rating denotes a facility that does not meet  standards and is in overall poor condition. A poor rating indicates that a  facility requires replacement. In the Marine Corps, facilities are rated as  adequate, substandard, or inadequate based on renovation costs or the  condition of major facility components, as well as health or safety issues.  An adequate rating indicates that facility components (such as electrical  systems or fire protection) have only minor deficiencies, a substandard  rating signifies that facility components have significant deficiencies, and  an inadequate rating indicates that facility components have major  deficiencies that impair functionality.", "In translating facility condition or project ratings into C-ratings reported to  DOD, the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps use similar computation  methods while the Air Force employs a different method.

These formulas  vary slightly from service to service. In contrast, the Air Force uses its  Facility Investment Metric to weight repair project costs by mission area  and impact. The total weighted repair project costs are summed and  divided by the total plant replacement value to obtain a percentage for  each facility class.

By comparison, at Fort Bragg there is no review  process. During our visit to that base, we reviewed Installation Status  Report worksheets where facility assessors rated all assessment  categories as amber. Facilities personnel told us that since an amber rating  requires no written explanation of deficiencies, as does a red rating,  building users often assign amber ratings so they can quickly complete  their assessment worksheets. Moreover, at Fort Leavenworth we found  that all building users responsible for assessing facilities were required to  attend a training session on completing Installation Status Report  worksheets. At Fort Bragg, on the other hand, we were told that no facility  assessors attended this year\u2019s 1-hour training session while last year only  two individuals attended the training.

Marine Corps officials acknowledged that,  although they had recently inspected the barracks and had identified  significant deficiencies, the updated data had not yet been entered into the  ratings database. On the other hand, the barracks at the Marine Corps  Recruit Depot, San Diego, were rated C-3, primarily because of noise from  the adjacent San Diego airport. Otherwise, our observations indicated that  these barracks appeared to be in much better physical condition than  those at Parris Island. After we completed our work, the Marine Corps  revised its ratings for the Parris Island and San Diego barracks to C-4 and  C-2, respectively, in its fiscal year 2002 report.

The reason that  service officials most often cited for moving funds was that these funds  were needed to cover more pressing needs or emerging requirements. As  figure 13 illustrates, in fiscal year 2002, service headquarters withheld  sustainment money to cover must-pay bills, such as civilian pay, emergent  needs, and other nonsustainment programs. Similarly, major commands  withheld sustainment funds to pay for emergent needs, nonsustainment  must-pay bills, commandwide sustainment contracts, restoration and  modernization projects, and other unspecified reductions. Finally,  individual installations that we visited moved sustainment funds in fiscal  year 2002 to pay for restoration and modernization emergent needs and for  other nonsustainment programs, such as utilities. As a result of fund  movements at all three levels, the amounts that installations obligated for  sustainment purposes were far less than the amounts necessary to meet  requirements as identified by DOD\u2019s facilities sustainment model. In  addition, installation officials told us that because of these holdbacks and  movements, it was difficult for them to make or implement rational plans  for maintaining and repairing their facilities.", "Some specific examples of where major commands moved sustainment  funds to cover emergencies or other priorities follow:  In fiscal year 2002, the Army\u2019s Forces Command told us that it received  about 92 percent of its sustainment requirement, but it then had to  reduce the amounts passed on to component installations to 79 percent  in order to pay for expanded utilities modernization, engineering  services, municipal services upgrades, and fire emergency services.", "In fiscal year 2002, the Navy Pacific Fleet moved about $130 million, or  29 percent of its total sustainment funding of $452 million, to support  nonsustainment programs such as base operating support functions,  unspecified requirements by the fleet\u2019s commander in chief, and  reserve force mobilization after the September 11th attacks. Of the  $130 million, $25 million for reserve force mobilization was returned at  the end of the fiscal year, and the fleet applied this amount to  sustainment projects.", "Early in fiscal year 2002, the Navy\u2019s Atlantic Fleet used $146 million, or  34 percent, of its total sustainment funding of $425 million to help pay  for reserve force mobilization, the facilities condition assessment  program, the design of recapitalization and demolition projects for the  following fiscal year, the management of the facility maintenance  program, and a reserve fund for major storm damage. A fleet official  told us that the funds obligated for the assessment program, the design  of recapitalization and demolition projects, and the facility  management program benefited all of the fleet\u2019s installations. At the  end of the fiscal year, the fleet received $98 million for reserve force  mobilization back, which it applied to sustainment projects, and  provided the remaining balance of the reserve fund to the installations.", "Officials told us that the fiscal year 2002 actual obligations for 7 of the 10  installations we visited were well below the services\u2019 planned funding  levels (see fig. 14). The Marine Corps base at Quantico, Virginia, Pope Air  Force Base, North Carolina, and Los Angeles Air Force Base, California,  which funded 97, 95, and 113 percent, respectively, of their sustainment  requirements in fiscal year 2002, were the exceptions. However, after  using a portion of their sustainment funding to pay for nonsustainment  related costs, the other 7 installations had only enough sustainment funds  to meet from 35 to 77 percent of their requirements as identified by DOD\u2019s  facilities sustainment model (see fig. 14). Installation officials told us that  they had to obligate a portion of their fiscal year 2002 sustainment funds  for a variety of nonsustainment-related purposes, such as paying for  utilities and for restoration and modernization projects, including  emergency repairs. They said that their installations received very little  operation and maintenance funds for restoration and modernization  projects in fiscal year 2002. At Fort Bragg, North Carolina, sustainment  funding was reduced to just 57 percent of its requirement because of the  movement of funds to nonsustainment activities. This leads us to question  whether DOD\u2019s guidance on fully funding sustainment is directed toward  the service or installation level. Thus, it is uncertain that the stated  objective of fully funding sustainment, as currently implemented by the  services, will address all sustainment problems at the installation level.", "The Marine Corps base at Quantico, Virginia; Pope Air Force Base, North  Carolina; and Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, clearly stand out as  exceptions to the sustainment funding levels at the other installations (see  fig. 14). According to Marine Corps officials, their service does not permit  sustainment funds to be taken away from installations by intermediate  commands without the explicit permission of headquarters\u2019 facilities staff.  There is no intermediate command between Quantico Marine Corps Base  and headquarters. Furthermore, the officials said the base received   $1 million in sustainment funding in September 2002 to replace heating,  ventilation, and air-conditioning systems in two buildings; this amount  alone accounted for 5 percent of its $18.6 million obligation for  sustainment in fiscal year 2002. Officials at Pope Air Force Base told us  that the base received 95 percent of its sustainment requirement in fiscal  year 2002 because its major command, Air Mobility Command, made a  concerted effort to repair some key facility problems at the installation  with funds the command had received at the end of the fiscal year. Air  Force officials also told us that Pope Air Force Base\u2019s and Los Angeles Air  Force Base\u2019s fiscal year 2002 sustainment obligations were higher than  amounts initially received by the bases for sustainment because major  commands provided additional funds during the fiscal year and moved  funds from other sources.", "In addition to the 10 installations we recently visited, we found similar  underfunding for sustainment at bases with barracks used to house  military recruits. Our analysis of cost data generated by DOD\u2019s facilities  sustainment model showed, for example, that Fort Knox required about  $38 million in fiscal year 2002 to sustain its facilities. However, base  officials told us they had received about $10 million, or 26 percent, of the  required funding. Officials at other Army basic training sites also told us  that they had received less funding, typically 30 to 40 percent, than what  they considered was required to sustain their facilities.

According to DOD officials, one reason for the success of this program is  that the services\u2019 budgets were not reduced in advance by the estimated  maintenance costs of the facilities to be demolished. Instead, as an  incentive to dispose of what the services did not need, their budgets were  left intact and the forecasted savings were reprogrammed by the services  to other needs within their programs.

The key objectives of the new organizational  structure include ending the movement of sustainment funds and  restoration and modernization funds to other priorities by major  commands and implementing consistent standards across the Army for  allocating these funds. The organizational structure has a centralized base  operations funding process that funnels sustainment funds and restoration  and modernization funds directly to installations without major commands  moving funds away from facilities. Army officials said that if the total  funding allocated by the service for these purposes continues to fall short  of requirements, the new agency would be greatly challenged in meeting  its facilities goals.

Specifically, it noted that both the Atlantic and  Pacific Fleets were using sustainment funds and restoration and  modernization funds to resolve other base operating support shortfalls.

At the end of the life cycle in figure 17, a  facility may be worn out or functionally obsolete or will require  recapitalization by either replacement or large-scale renovation.", "According to DOD\u2019s facilities life-cycle model, full sustainment and  restoration and modernization investments are necessary to maintain the  condition and performance of facilities. Without full funding of  sustainment activities, facilities can deteriorate more quickly than would  be expected under their average life cycle, requiring premature  recapitalization of facilities (see fig. 18). As facilities deteriorate without  full sustainment, their level of performance also diminishes. For example,  Naval Station San Diego, California, has deferred a project to repair quay  walls and pier fenders for the past 4 years, resulting in continued  deterioration and increased costs to maintain service. In 2 of these years,  the installation spent more than $100,000 annually for temporary repairs to  fenders. DOD estimates that, with full sustainment funding, facilities  should have an expected average life of 67 years. Expected service life is  defined as the number of years a fully sustained inventory provides service  before requiring a major restoration or replacement project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: How Operation and Maintenance Funds Are Moved during the Fiscal Year", "paragraphs": ["DOD has considerable flexibility in using and moving operation and  maintenance funds.
