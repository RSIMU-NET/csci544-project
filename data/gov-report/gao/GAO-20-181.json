For example, specific lease requirements such as early termination (see table) can lead lessors to increase their rent rates or decide not to bid on a lease\u2014thereby increasing federal leasing costs or decreasing competition. According to GSA officials, many of these lease aspects reflect contracting policy rather than being required by law, regulation, or executive order. GSA has made some changes, such as lengthening the term of some leases, to address stakeholder concerns. Stakeholders also identified the time it takes to complete a lease and GSA's propensity for staying in a space beyond the term of a lease as increasing costs and making GSA leases less attractive to potential bidders.", "Source: GAO analysis of stakeholder information. | GAO-20-181", "GSA has undertaken initiatives to identify stakeholders' concerns to inform its reform efforts, but it lacks complete information to address concerns or evaluate its efforts. Specifically, GSA has not gathered information from a representative group of lessors because its recent outreach has involved two industry groups that focus primarily on organizations such as real estate brokers and investment trusts that are experts in GSA leasing. These organizations may not have the same concerns as smaller, less experienced, organizations. By obtaining information from a broad spectrum of stakeholders, GSA would be better positioned to know whether its leasing reforms are addressing stakeholders' concerns. Additionally, to expedite processing of lower-value leases, GSA developed a simplified lease model that excludes some requirements that stakeholders identified as challenging but may protect GSA, such as tenant substitution. GAO found that for fiscal years 2016 to 2018, GSA used the model for only about one-third of potentially eligible leases. GSA has proposed increasing use of the model, but it does not know whether the model as currently used is achieving the anticipated benefits, including reduced lease processing times, or the impact of financial or other risks from this model because GSA has not evaluated its use. Without such an assessment, GSA does not have the information needed to determine whether the simplified lease model is achieving its intended results, whether to make improvements, or how to mitigate any risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including that GSA: (1) expand its outreach as appropriate to obtain feedback from lessors that are representative of its entire lease portfolio, and (2) evaluate whether the simplified lease model is achieving its intended results.

As of fiscal year 2019, GSA leased nearly 188  million square feet of space from private sector building owners\u2014known  as \u201clessors\u201d\u2014for a total of $5.7 billion to accommodate the needs of  federal agencies. These leases come with requirements not commonly  used in the private sector, such as allowing for tenant substitution during  the term of the lease and requiring the responsible lessor to pay for  services such as utilities. These leases also involve lengthy  negotiations\u2014at times longer than a year\u2014to finalize the lease. While  lessors have traditionally valued GSA leases for the government\u2019s reliable  credit and stable tenancy, stakeholders such as lessors and real estate  brokers have raised concerns that the additional requirements and a  lengthy process increase the lessors\u2019 costs, which they then pass through  to the federal government. GSA has sought input from stakeholders to  identify areas where its lease requirements may be increasing costs or  affecting lessors\u2019 willingness to compete for leases as well as to inform its  reform efforts. In response, GSA made some changes to its lease  requirements and developed a simplified lease model as a faster and  more efficient way to process lower value leases. However, questions still  remain as to whether its lease requirements are increasing costs or  affecting lessors\u2019 willingness to compete for leases.", "You asked us to review issues related to cost and competition for GSA  leases with private sector lessors. This report examines  lease requirements selected stakeholders identified as affecting cost  and competition and steps GSA has taken to address stakeholders\u2019  concerns, and how GSA has identified stakeholders\u2019 concerns and evaluated its  simplified lease model.", "To address both objectives, we collected information from stakeholders  including current GSA lessors and real estate brokers to obtain their  perspectives on GSA leases and the GSA leasing process. We selected a  non-generalizable sample of 20 current GSA lessors by first obtaining  data from GSA on each of the leases it entered into during fiscal years  2016 to 2018, the most recent data available. We assessed the reliability  of this data by reviewing documentation, interviewing GSA officials,  electronically testing the data, and verifying data with GSA officials. We  concluded that the data were reliable for the purposes of our reporting  objectives. We used this data to group GSA\u2019s leases into three categories  based on total annual rent and then selected leases randomly from each  group. To obtain a broader perspective on GSA\u2019s leasing process, we  also interviewed the six real estate brokers who participate in GSA\u2019s  Leasing Support Services program, and four other experts on the GSA  leasing process, such as professional organizations who represent  building owners. We used a semi-structured interview format with open- ended questions and conducted a content analysis of the lessors\u2019  responses to identify recurring themes. The information gathered from our  interviews with these stakeholders is useful in illustrating a range of views  on the GSA leasing process but is not generalizable.", "To identify the lease requirements these stakeholders identified as  affecting cost and competition and what GSA has done to address their  concerns, we selected the eight most commonly mentioned requirements  and the most commonly mentioned areas of GSA\u2019s leasing process  based on responses from both the lessors and the brokers. We grouped  the lessors by those who told us they had experience with three or more  GSA leases\u2014we called these \u201cmore experienced\u201d lessors\u2014and those  who told us they had experience with one or two leases\u2014we called these  \u201cless experienced\u201d lessors.

To determine  how GSA and tenant agencies develop space requirements\u2014one of the  requirements stakeholders identified as having effects on cost and  competition\u2014we selected a non-generalizable sample of five executive  branch bureau-level and independent agencies to include those with the  greatest number of GSA leases entered into during fiscal years 2016\u2013 2018. These agencies were (1) the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS); (2)  the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (3) the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI); (4) the Social Security Administration (SSA); and (5)  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). We reviewed documents  and interviewed officials from each of these five agencies to learn about  how they develop space requirements, work with GSA to identify feasible  properties, participate in the development of the final space design and  construction, and plan for their future leased space needs.", "To identify the steps GSA has taken to identify stakeholder concerns and  evaluate its simplified lease model, we reviewed pertinent GSA  documents and interviewed GSA officials. We also obtained views of  lessors and brokers about GSA\u2019s lease reform efforts, including whether  they were aware of the efforts, and what effects they had observed. We  determined how often GSA has used a simplified lease model that  contains fewer of the requirements that stakeholders identified as  concerns. We also assessed the characteristics of the leases for which  GSA used the simplified model, based on the GSA fiscal year 2016-2018  lease data described previously. We analyzed the data to obtain  information about the number of leases that had used each of GSA\u2019s  lease models, and the average rent amounts, size, security levels, and  terms.

The Administrator of GSA  delegates leasing authority to GSA regional commissioners, who further  delegate authority to lease contracting officers.", "For leases that GSA procures for tenant agencies, GSA serves as the  lessee and pays rent to the building owner, who serves as the lessor. The  tenant agency pays monthly rent to GSA, which includes a fee for GSA\u2019s  services, and uses the leased space subject to the terms of an occupancy  agreement with GSA. This agreement typically specifies not only the rent  fee but also the amount the tenant agency must reimburse the lessor for  improvements to the leased space\u2014such as changes to walls, electrical  outlets, telephone lines, and secure rooms\u2014these are known as \u201ctenant  Improvements.\u201d", "GSA leasing process. GSA uses different processes to carry out the  leasing process depending on the size, cost, and type of the lease. For all  of these processes, the leasing-planning process begins when GSA  receives a request for space from a tenant agency and determines that  fulfilling the request will require leasing space. According to the typical  process outlined in the GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) PBS Desk  Leasing Guide, officials work with the tenant agency to define the  requirements for the leased space, including the geographic area in which  GSA will search for available properties. After this initial stage, GSA takes  additional steps to acquire a new lease, see figure 1.", "For certain office space leases larger than 500 square feet, which  represent more than 90 percent of GSA\u2019s leases as of the end of fiscal  year 2019, GSA can deviate from its typical leasing process and instead  use what it calls the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).  GSA began using a predecessor to this program in 1991 in the National  Capital Region only and rolled out the current version to all national  markets in 2015. In this program, instead of GSA\u2019s first proposing  requirements to potential lessors, the lessors first submit offers to GSA for  pre-existing available space, including the space\u2019s size, location, and  features, and the rent amounts the lessor is offering for different lease  durations. Once GSA develops a set of requirements with a tenant  agency, it evaluates these standing offers to eliminate those that would  not meet the space requirements, ranks the bids by present value, and  selects the lowest cost option, see figure 2.", "GSA is required to take further steps for high value leases with a net  annual rent above the statutory \u201cprospectus\u201d threshold\u2014adjusted by GSA  to $3.1 million in fiscal year 2019.", "For these leases, GSA must submit a prospectus, or proposal, to the  House and Senate authorizing committees for their review and approval.  As of the end of fiscal year 2019, GSA managed 8,045 leases, of which  291, or about 4 percent, had current annual rents above the 2019  prospectus level. These leases, however, accounted for about 41 percent  of GSA\u2019s total annual rent obligations.", "GSA leases. GSA leases differ substantially from typical commercial  leases. For example, in a GSA lease, GSA\u2014as the lessee\u2014proposes the  lease requirements. In a typical commercial office space lease, however,  the lessor drafts the lease requirements and proposes them to the  prospective tenant. For additional examples of the differences between  GSA and typical commercial leases, see table 1.", "GSA\u2019s lease reform efforts. In 2011, GSA issued a lease-reform  implementation plan in response to comments from lessors and tenant  agencies. In this plan GSA recommended changes including developing  new lease models to better tailor its lease requirements to specific  circumstances, and improving elements of its leasing process. As part of  this and other initiatives since then, GSA developed leasing products and  tools that it can use in various situations. These include:", "Simplified lease model: GSA developed this lease model for lower  value leases with a facility security level of I or II, and a net annual  rent\u2014total rent minus operating expenses\u2014of up to $150,000.

As compared to GSA\u2019s standard and  global lease models\u2014which can be used on leases of any size\u2014this  model contains fewer requirements and may not have certain more  complex elements such as annual operating-cost adjustments, real  estate tax adjustments, or an allowance for tenant substitution. In  addition, the model requires GSA and the tenant agency to finalize the  complete set of space requirements prior to GSA\u2019s advertising the  lease, a requirement that eliminates negotiations on the tenant  improvements after GSA awards the lease.", "Net-of-utilities leases: As discussed in table 1, in most GSA leases  the lessor is responsible for paying the utilities, and must estimate  future utility costs as part of its bid for the lease. In a net-of-utilities  lease, the tenant pays the utility costs for tenant space directly. A  2016 GSA study indicated that GSA could achieve savings through  net-of-utilities leases for a small number of leases with certain  characteristics including: the lease being over 50,000 square feet, a  single tenant agency occupying the entire space, the tenant agency  consuming large amounts of energy, and several other factors. GSA  estimates that around 360 of its more than 8,000 leases meet these  criteria.", "Succeeding and superseding leases: In most cases, GSA is  required to conduct a full and open competition for leases. However,  in certain circumstances GSA instead pursues succeeding or  superseding leases. In circumstances where relocating to a new  leased property would result in substantial relocation or duplication  costs that GSA could not reasonably expect to recover through  competition, GSA is allowed to pursue a succeeding lease, and when  market conditions warrant renegotiation of an existing lease or when  the tenant agency needs to make substantial modifications to a space  before the expiration of a lease, GSA is allowed to pursue  superseding leases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Stakeholders Identified Several Aspects of GSA Leases That Affect Cost and Competition, and GSA Has Taken Some Steps to Address These Concerns", "paragraphs": ["The GSA leasing stakeholders we spoke with identified some aspects of  GSA leasing that are attractive to potential lessors such as the  government\u2019s good credit and GSA\u2019s long average occupancy.

In addition, these  lessors said that in a GSA lease, the lessor is typically responsible for  providing utility services and that lessors pass these costs through to  GSA as part of the operating cost portion of the rent. In a private sector  lease, these costs are typically the tenant\u2019s responsibility.

In our leases, the base rent is  frozen throughout the term of the lease and only the operating  expenses are allowed to increase based on inflation.

GSA reimburses lessors for  tenant improvement costs over the firm term of the lease, but lessors told  us that these payments do not begin until after the space is occupied,  which can be delayed by the tenant agency\u2019s changing its requirements.  In prior work we found that this process of paying tenant improvements  over the firm term of a lease increases the overall cost to the federal  government of leasing space, primarily due to interest costs passed  through by the lessors.

In 2016 we  reported that the total length of GSA\u2019s leasing process could be up to six  to eight years. Because GSA does not generally begin to pay rent until  after the space is fit for occupancy, lessors said that the length of time it  takes to complete the lease award, design and construction processes  can create financial stress on a lessor. For example, one lessor said that  GSA\u2019s overall leasing process was challenging, and the largest issue,  rather than any particular requirement, was agreeing on the design after  lease award. This length of time was because the tenant agency was  slow to make decisions about the space design, and while GSA tried to  coordinate by setting up weekly meetings about this design among GSA,  the tenant agency and the lessor, there were also several layers of time- consuming GSA review. About one-third of the lessors we spoke with also  identified challenges communicating with GSA and the tenant agency  during the lease negotiation process, including challenges identifying  points of contact and resolving disputes. Three lessors said that they or  other lessors might not bid on additional GSA leases specifically because  of the lengthy and complex process to finalize a lease.

Lessors also noted communications difficulties with GSA, for  example some said that they had reached out to GSA to negotiate a  lease well in advance of an incumbent lease\u2019s going into holdover, but  this action did not help them get a new lease on time. Lessors told us that  they bid much higher rates for short-term extensions than they do for  leases awarded through the normal process.

These organizations are not  representative of GSA\u2019s total population of lessors, which also includes  many smaller organizations that have less experience with the GSA  leasing process.

Concerns about early  termination clauses in GSA leases were cited by less than half of the less  experienced organizations, but all of the more experienced organizations  mentioned this clause as affecting their willingness to do business with  GSA. Also, one of the brokers we spoke with said that smaller lessors  tend to have different concerns about leasing requirements than larger  lessors, but also have less ability to react to those concerns by, for  example, raising their bid prices. In addition to limiting outreach to two  groups that do not represent all types of GSA lessors, GSA has not  maintained official records of the information it receives from these  efforts.

For example, in 2011  GSA performed formal outreach in order to inform decisions about  significant changes to its leasing process. Officials told us that they  selected a wide variety of lessors and held formal outreach sessions  where GSA took minutes and maintained a record of all of the comments.  GSA then analyzed the comments and used the results of its analysis to  inform the initiatives it was conducting at that time, including the  development of the simplified lease model. In addition, in 2017 GSA  established the Office of Leasing Industry Outreach Program, which was  a formal program to allow industry representatives to discuss various  leasing issues with GSA officials through conference calls, webinars, and  in-person sessions. GSA conducted nine monthly sessions with this  program in 2017 and kept a formal record of only the first four sessions.

In addition, officials said that they  believe greater use of the simplified lease model would increase  competition for leases, particularly in real estate markets with high  demand for office space. Since initial implementation, GSA has  undertaken initiatives to increase the use of this model, including by  raising the eligibility threshold from $150,000 to $250,000, and GSA  officials told us that they have proposed raising the threshold to $500,000,  a move that would cover more than 70 percent of GSA\u2019s leases.

We found that the  group of leases where GSA had used the simplified lease model had  achieved lower rents both overall and per square foot than the group of  potentially eligible leases where GSA had used its standard or global  models (see table 2). These leases had lower average costs even though they had shorter average total terms and firm terms. This finding  is notable because, according to GSA, longer leases typically have lower  costs than shorter ones.

First, lease contracting officers  must choose to use the simplified model as opposed to GSA\u2019s standard  lease model. While GSA\u2019s leasing policy states that lease contracting  officers should use the simplified lease model to the maximum practical  extent, the lease contracting officers generally have wide discretion in  selecting the type of lease to use for a particular acquisition. GSA officials  told us that they believe some lease contracting officers may be hesitant  to use the model because it is less familiar to them. GSA officials also told  us that they have provided training for lease contracting officers on the  appropriate use of the simplified lease model and have encouraged them  to use it.", "Second, in order for GSA to use the simplified lease model, tenant  agencies must provide a complete set of space requirements that GSA  can use in a lease solicitation\u2014what GSA calls biddable requirements\u2014 prior to GSA\u2019s advertising the lease. According to GSA officials, tenant  agencies do not always provide these requirements on time. By having  biddable requirements in place before receiving bids, GSA can avoid  negotiating these requirements after the lease is awarded. GSA officials  and lessors told us that not having these requirements in place is a major  source of project delays. GSA tracks both when it receives initial  requirements from the tenant agencies and when the more fully  developed requirements that GSA uses in its standard lease model  solicitations are in place. In order to use the simplified lease model, GSA  and the tenant agency then develop biddable requirements that need  additional detail.", "An Example of challenges agencies face in providing lease  requirements to the General Services Administration (GSA):  Officials from three of the five tenant agencies we spoke with told us   that it can be difficult for them to provide GSA with requirements two or  more years in advance because agency missions and space needs  change. For example, Internal Revenue Service officials told us that  providing requirements 36 months in advance of a lease\u2019s expiring is  difficult for them because they may not know what their agency budget  and personnel will be that far in advance. Officials from the Federal  Bureau of Investigation said that lead times greater than three years   are challenging because their agency missions change frequently,   which leads to changing space needs.", "GSA has taken some steps to increase use of the simplified lease model.  For example, several GSA regions have begun to work with SSA on a  pilot program to reduce the time it takes for GSA to complete leases with  that agency, including by increasing the availability of the simplified lease  model. This program is in the early stages and, according to the charter,  developed in August 2019, its objectives are to reduce the total time it  takes to complete leases, increase up-front knowledge of project costs,  and minimize the number of changes needed to leases all while  maintaining or reducing the average costs for these projects. GSA and  SSA plan to accomplish these objectives by identifying the areas of the  leasing process most prone to delays, developing strategies for more  quickly finalizing the complete requirements needed to use the simplified  lease model, and testing the improvements in both large and small real  estate markets. GSA plans to begin testing the changes developed by  this program during the first half of 2020. SSA officials told us that they  typically begin planning approximately 42 months prior to lease expiration  with the goal of providing initial requirements to GSA by 36 months prior.", "GSA lacks comprehensive information on the benefits and challenges of  using the simplified lease model because it has not evaluated the results  it has obtained from using it. For example, officials told us that they have  not analyzed the lease processing times or rental rates they have  achieved using the model. Officials also said that they already collect the  data they would need to study the model and they have used this data to  analyze related issues such as lease holdovers and short-term  extensions. Officials also told us that they do not consider use of the  simplified lease model to pose any financial risks provided that lease  contracting officers follow GSA\u2019s existing policies. However, they told us  that GSA has not reviewed financial and other risks that may arise from  using the model. These factors include risks due to the model\u2019s not  containing certain provisions that may protect GSA, such as tenant  substitution.

We also obtained data from GSA on each of the 1,618 leases it entered  into between the beginning of fiscal year 2016 and the end of fiscal year  2018, the most recent data available. This data included fields for the  current annual rent, the size of the lease in rentable square feet, the lease  model GSA used, the facility security level, the occupying agency, and  the lease\u2019s effective and expiration dates, among others. We assessed  the reliability of this data by reviewing documentation; interviewing GSA  officials; electronically testing the data by, for example, examining missing  values and outliers; and verifying the accuracy of potentially erroneous  data with GSA officials. We concluded that the data were reliable for the  purposes of selecting a sample of GSA lessors and reporting on GSA\u2019s  portfolio of leases and the general characteristics of the groups of leases  that used different lease models.", "In addition, to address both objectives, we collected information from and  interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 20 GSA lessors to obtain their  perspectives on GSA leases and GSA\u2019s leasing process. To select these  lessors, we used the fiscal year 2016\u20132018 lease data that GSA provided  and selected leases using the annual rent amount as the primary  selection criteria. We excluded leases that used models designed for  specific lease products, such as leases for parking structures or leases on  airport properties, and we also excluded leases that were successions or  supersessions of leases that had already been established under different  models. To make the selections, we first split the data into three groups  based on annual rent, the first group of leases with annual rents under  $150,000; the second group with annual rents between $150,000 and  below $500,000; and the last group with annual rents above $500,000.  We then randomly ordered the leases within each of the three groups,  and selected 53 total leases in that order from the three groups. We  checked this grouping to ensure that the selected leases had similar  characteristics to GSA\u2019s general population in other important lease  characteristics such as lease model used and GSA region. We then  randomly ordered the selected leases and contacted the lessors for those  leases in that order.", "We interviewed the first 20 lessors from our selected leases who agreed  to be interviewed. When contacting the lessors we found that in most  cases the lessor named in GSA\u2019s data was a subsidiary to another  organization. In those cases, we interviewed the organization that self- identified as being responsible for the selected lease, or their  representative. We conducted these interviews between March 2019 and  June 2019 and used a semi-structured interview format with open-ended  questions for those interviews. During these interviews, we asked for  lessors views on the requirements in GSA\u2019s leases that can affect their  willingness to bid on GSA leases and the prices they can offer, actions  they take in response to those requirements, other areas of GSA\u2019s  leasing process that can be difficult for them, the benefits to leasing to  GSA, and their perspectives on GSA\u2019s recent lease reform efforts. To  obtain a broader perspective on GSA\u2019s leasing process, we also  conducted semi-structured interviews on the same topics with six real  estate brokers who are participating in the GSA Leasing Support Services  contract. We asked the brokers to provide their experiences on which  areas of GSA leases result in the greatest number of cost and  competition issues from lessors, and what the lessors do about those  areas. We also interviewed four other experts on GSA leasing including  professional organizations and attorneys who represent building owners,  and former GSA officials. Although the results of these stakeholder  interviews are not generalizable to the entire population of GSA lessors,  they provide illustrative examples of lessors\u2019 experiences with GSA  leases and the leasing process.", "After conducting these semi-structured interviews with lessors and  brokers, we conducted a content analysis of the interview data. To  conduct this analysis, we organized the responses by topic area, and  then one GAO analyst reviewed all of the interview responses and  identified recurring themes. Using the identified themes, the analyst then  developed categories for coding the interview responses and  independently coded the responses for each question. To ensure  accuracy, a second GAO analyst reviewed the first analyst\u2019s coding of the  interview responses, and then the two analysts reconciled any  discrepancies.", "To identify the lease requirements that stakeholders we spoke with  identified as affecting cost and competition, we synthesized information  from our content analysis of interview responses to identify the most  commonly mentioned requirements. We selected the eight most  commonly mentioned requirements by summing the total number of  responses from both the lessors and the brokers. As part of this analysis  we also selected the four areas stakeholders most often mentioned as  challenges that were related to GSA\u2019s leasing process, as opposed to a  specific requirement, but that stakeholders nonetheless identified as  having effects on cost and competition. To assess how the responses  from lessors may have differed based on how much experience a lessor  has with GSA, we grouped the lessors we spoke with into two categories.  The first category was those lessors who had told us that they had  experience with three or more GSA leases, we referred to these lessors  as \u201cmore experienced,\u201d and the second category was those lessors who  had experience with one or two GSA leases, we referred to those lessors  as \u201cless experienced.\u201d To identify the source of the GSA requirements  stakeholders identified, we reviewed GSA documents and interviewed  officials to learn about each of the requirements.

We selected these  agencies by the number of GSA leases they had entered into during fiscal  years 2016-2018, using the lease data for that time period provided by  GSA. We selected the agencies that had entered into the greatest  number of leases, and in order to ensure that we had a diversity of  experiences from across the federal government, and we limited our  selection to executive branch independent agencies and one-bureau-level  entity from each cabinet department. Based on these factors, we  selected (1) Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS);  (2) Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service (IRS); (3)  Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (4) Social  Security Administration (SSA); and (5) Department of Homeland Security  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). While the views of these  agencies are not representative of all executive branch agencies, they  provide a range of examples and experiences with leasing space through  GSA. We reviewed documents and interviewed officials from each of  these five agencies to learn about how they develop requirements for  leased space, how they work with GSA to identify feasible properties, how  they participate in the development of the final space design and  construction, and how they plan for their future leased space needs.", "To identify the steps GSA has taken to identify stakeholder concerns and  evaluate its simplified lease model, we reviewed pertinent GSA  documents and interviewed GSA officials on recent lease reform efforts,  including how GSA has defined them, what information GSA used to  develop them, how GSA has implemented them, and how GSA has  assessed their performance. In addition, we obtained information from our  interviews with lessors and real estate brokers about their impressions of  GSA\u2019s lease reform efforts, including whether they were aware of the  efforts, and what effects they had observed. We compared GSA\u2019s efforts  to identify and address stakeholder concerns to Federal Standards for  Internal Control related to external communication.", "To identify how often GSA has used its simplified lease model and the  characteristics of the leases for which GSA used the model, we used the  GSA fiscal year 2016\u20132018 lease data described previously. We  analyzed the data to obtain information about the number of leases that  had used each of GSA\u2019s lease models, and the average rent amounts,  size, and terms. Even though the facility security level is an additional  eligibility requirement for the model, we could not include it in this analysis  because GSA does not have security level information for many of the  leases in this dataset. However, we determined that omitting this data field did not substantially change the results of this analysis because only  a small number of leases with costs below $150,000 also had a facility  security level of III or above. We were not able to assess the extent to  which the lower rental costs might be attributable to the use of the  simplified lease model because there are other factors that that contribute  to its use that are not included in GSA\u2019s data. For example, in order for  GSA to use the simplified lease model, tenant agencies must provide fully  developments prior to GSA advertising the lease. The data do not include  the date GSA received these requirements. We compared GSA\u2019s efforts  to evaluate its simplified lease model to criteria from our prior work on the  use of performance information for decision-making.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2018 to December  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Amelia Bates Shachoy, Assistant  Director; Alex Fedell, Analyst-in-Charge; James Duke; Cynthia Grant;  Geoffrey Hamilton; Gina Hoover; Terence Lam; Malika Rice; Kelly Rubin;  Jim Russell; Patrick Tierney; and Amelia Michelle Weathers made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["The General Services Administration (GSA) leases space for federal agencies.

For example, lengthy negotiations can increase costs and make federal leases less attractive to lessors. GSA has simplified some of its less-expensive leases to start addressing these concerns.", "We recommended that GSA study whether the simplified lease has reduced costs or saved time."]}
