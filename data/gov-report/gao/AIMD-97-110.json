Two key laws\u2014the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and the Energy Policy Act of 1992\u2014have resulted in an increasingly competitive wholesale electricity market. PURPA authorized operation of electric power-generating entities that were exempt from many federal regulations. Called \u201cindependent power producers\u201d (IPPs), these entities typically use new technologies, such as natural gas-fired generation units, to produce power. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required that a utility make its transmission lines accessible to other utilities (called \u201copen transmission access\u201d). This open access has enabled wholesale customers to obtain electricity from a variety of competing suppliers, even if that power must be transmitted over lines owned by another utility\u2014referred to as the \u201cwheeling\u201d of power. This ability to wheel power has resulted in increasing wholesale competition in the electricity industry across the United States, with competition becoming intense in some areas. As a result, wholesale electricity rates have decreased in many parts of the country over the last several years, which has impacted, to varying degrees, the PMAs, TVA, and RUS borrowers. On a retail basis, the traditional regulated utility monopoly still exists in most states. However, issues relating to retail open access are being addressed on a state-by-state basis and in the Congress, with end-use customer choice expected to result.", "Electricity generation, transmission, and distribution in the United States involves several government entities, including the following:", "RUS, an entity within the Department of Agriculture (USDA), provides direct or guaranteed loans primarily to rural electric cooperatives that market power on a wholesale and retail basis.", "Federal PMAs within the Department of Energy (DOE) market wholesale power generated primarily at federal water projects.", "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) in the Department of Defense and the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) in the Department of the Interior both operate multipurpose water projects, many of which generate electric power. Other multipurpose project purposes include flood control, navigation, irrigation, and recreation.

The Corps and the Bureau are referred to as the operating agencies.", "TVA, a multipurpose, independent government corporation generates and transmits electricity, primarily on a wholesale basis, to distributors.", "To some extent, these entities interact with each other in the electricity market.

Appropriated debt carries a fixed interest rate with no ability for Treasury to call the debt. Although PMAs are generally required to pay off highest interest rate debt first, they cannot refinance the debt. Thus, Treasury bears the risk of increases in interest rates and PMAs, to some degree, bear the risk of decreases in interest rates. The interest rates on outstanding PMA appropriated debt are substantially below the rates Treasury incurs to provide funding to the PMAs and other federal programs. Thus, interest income earned by Treasury on the appropriated debt is less than Treasury\u2019s interest expense, which it incurs to finance this debt. The PMAs have accumulated substantial amounts of appropriated debt at low interest rates primarily because, in accordance with applicable guidance, they repay high interest rate debt first and because PMA appropriated debt incurred prior to 1983 was generally at below-market interest rates in effect at the time.

The total amount of debt written off for the entire RUS electricity loan portfolio between fiscal years 1992 and 1996 was about $1.05 billion (in constant 1996 dollars)\u2014with $0.5 billion in additional write-offs in the early part of fiscal year 1997."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Losses From Financially Stressed G&T Borrowers Are Probable in the Short Term", "paragraphs": ["It is probable that RUS will have additional loan write-offs and therefore that the federal government will incur further losses in the short term from borrowers that RUS management has identified as financially stressed. According to RUS reports, about $10.5 billion of the $22.5 billion in G&T debt is owed by 13 financially stressed G&T borrowers. Of these, 4 borrowers with about $7 billion in outstanding debt are in bankruptcy. The remaining 9 borrowers have investments in uneconomical generating plants and/or have formally requested financial assistance in the form of debt forgiveness from RUS. According to RUS officials, these plant investments became uneconomical because of cost overruns, continuing changes in regulations, and soaring interest rates. These investments resulted in high levels of debt and debt-servicing requirements, making power produced from these plants expensive.", "Since cooperatives are nonprofit organizations, little or no profit is built into their rate structure, which helps keep electricity rates as low as possible. However, the lack of retained profits generally means the cooperatives have little or no cash reserves to draw upon. Thus, when cash flow is insufficient to service debt, cooperatives must raise electricity rates and/or cut other costs enough to service debt obligations, or default on government loans.", "This was the scenario for the previously discussed write-offs in fiscal year 1996 and through July 31, 1997. Additional write-offs are expected to occur. For example, according to RUS officials, the agency may write off as much as $3 billion of the total $4.2 billion debt owed by Cajun Electric, a RUS borrower that has been in bankruptcy since December 1994. Cajun Electric filed for bankruptcy protection after the Louisiana Public Service Commission disapproved a requested rate increase and instead lowered rates to a level that reduced the amount of revenues available to Cajun to make annual debt service payments. Several factors contributed to Cajun\u2019s heavy debt, including its investment in a nuclear facility which experienced construction cost overruns and its excess electricity generation capacity resulting from overestimation of the demand for electricity in Louisiana during the 1980s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Losses From Loans Currently Considered Viable Are Probable in the Future", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the loans to financially stressed borrowers, RUS has loans outstanding to G&T borrowers that are currently considered viable by RUS but may become stressed in the future due to high production costs and competitive or regulatory pressures.

To assess the ability of RUS cooperatives to withstand competitive pressures, we focused on the average revenue per kWh of 33 of the 55 G&T borrowers with about $11.7 billion of loans outstanding as of September 30, 1996. We excluded 9 G&Ts that only transmit electricity and the 13 financially stressed borrowers. Our analysis shows that for 27 of the 33 G&T borrowers, average revenue per kWh was higher in their respective regions than IOUs, and 17 of the 33 were higher than POGs. Additionally, as shown in figure 1, in 1995, RUS cooperatives\u2019 average revenue per kWh was higher than IOUs in all of the eight primary North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) regions in which the cooperatives operate. The relatively high average production costs indicate that the majority of G&Ts may have difficulty competing in a deregulated market. RUS officials told us that several borrowers have already asked RUS to renegotiate or write off their debt because they do not expect to be competitive due to high costs. However, RUS officials stated that they will not write off debt solely to make borrowers more competitive.", "As with the financially stressed borrowers, some of the G&T borrowers currently considered viable have high debt costs because of investments in uneconomical plants. In addition, according to RUS officials, two unique factors cause cost disparity between the G&Ts and IOUs. One factor is the sparser customer density per mile for cooperatives and the corresponding high cost of providing service to the rural areas. A second factor has been the general inability to refinance higher cost FFB debt when lower interest rates have prevailed. However, RUS officials said that recent legislative changes that enable cooperatives to refinance FFB debt with a penalty may help align G&T interest rates with those of the IOUs.", "In the short term, G&Ts will likely be shielded from competition because of the all-requirements wholesale power contracts between the G&T and their member distribution cooperatives. With rare exceptions, long-term contracts obligate the distribution cooperatives to purchase all of their respective power needs from the G&T. In fact, RUS requires the terms of the contracts to be at least as long as the G&T loan repayment period. However, wholesale power contracts have been challenged recently in the courts by several distribution cooperatives because of the obligation to purchase expensive G&T power. According to RUS officials, one bankrupt G&T\u2019s member cooperatives are currently challenging their wholesale power contracts in court in order to obtain less expensive power. RUS officials believe that the long-term contracts will come under increased scrutiny and potential renegotiation or court challenges as other sources of less expensive power become available.", "Wholesale rates under these contracts are currently set by a G&T\u2019s board of directors with approval from RUS. In states whose commissions regulate cooperatives, the cooperative must file a request with the commission for a rate increase or decrease. Several of the currently bankrupt borrowers were denied requests for rate increases from state commissions. However, RUS officials indicated they do not expect G&Ts to pursue rate increases as a means to recover their costs because of the recognition of declining rates in a competitive environment. RUS officials also acknowledge that borrowers with high costs are likely to request debt forgiveness as a means to reduce costs in order to be competitive in the future.", "As discussed above, denials of requested rate increases by state commissions culminated in several G&Ts filing for bankruptcy. Eighteen of the RUS G&T borrowers operate in states where regulatory commissions must approve rate increases. These commissions may deny a request for a rate increase if they believe such an increase will have a negative impact on the region. According to RUS officials, some commissions have denied a rate increase to cover the costs of projects that the commission had previously approved for construction.

Second, BPA management entered into a MOA with various federal agencies that has limited its fish mitigation costs through fiscal year 2001. This agreement also created a contingency fund of $325 million comprised of past BPA nonpower fish mitigation expenditures.

One of the key market uncertainties that will determine whether cheaper power will be available is the future production cost of gas-fired generation plants. This generation source has become increasingly competitive due to low natural gas prices and improving gas turbine technology. Natural gas prices in the Pacific Northwest are low due to several factors, including a large supply coming from Canada. Also, recent technology advances have improved the efficiency of gas turbines by more than 50 percent. According to BPA, natural gas-generated power has driven down the price of wholesale electricity and resulted in customers leaving or obtaining some of their power at rates well below BPA\u2019s current rate.", "According to BPA, a surplus of power on the west coast is also driving down the price of wholesale power. Because utilities are still able to pass on fixed costs to captive retail customers, surplus wholesale power is being sold on a marginal cost basis. According to BPA, other utilities and power marketers are offering wholesale power at as low as 1.5 cents per kWh, which is lower than BPA\u2019s price for sales of comparable products of 2.14 cents per kWh. It is uncertain whether surplus power and low cost natural gas generation will continue to drive down wholesale power prices after fiscal year 2001.", "It is also uncertain what impact retail open access will have on BPA\u2019s competitive position. Retail open access\u2014which would provide retail consumers freedom to choose among suppliers\u2014could result in BPA\u2019s wholesale customers being uncertain about the size of their own future power needs. These power needs will be directly impacted by retail customers being able to choose their supplier. BPA\u2019s customers may be hesitant to sign long-term contracts to purchase power from BPA to the extent they face uncertainty about future power needs. However, even without long-term contracts, BPA is likely to remain a major supplier.

As a result, TVA had accumulated about $28 billion of debt as of September 30, 1996, which resulted in over $2 billion of interest expense in fiscal year 1996. By not recovering these costs from ratepayers and using the cash to pay off debt in prior years, TVA has developed a high level of fixed costs and deferred assets which will leave it vulnerable to future competition if it loses its protections.

BPA also suggested a loan-by-loan approach, stating that determining the cost to Treasury of providing BPA\u2019s financing should be done \u201con the basis of an assessment of each loan incrementally, as a commercial lender would do.\u201d Finally, the three PMAs and BPA disagreed with our using the interest rate on Treasury\u2019s outstanding bond portfolio to estimate net financing costs on outstanding appropriated debt.", "As discussed in appendix II of volume 2 of this report, we defined the net financing cost to the federal government as the difference between Treasury\u2019s borrowing cost or interest expense and the interest income received from RUS borrowers, the PMAs, and TVA. Our basic methodology was to determine whether the federal government received a return sufficient to cover its borrowing costs and, if not, to estimate the net financing cost. RUS, the PMAs, and TVA had several forms of federal debt outstanding at September 30, 1996. Each of these forms of federal debt had different terms and thus required us to apply variations of our basic methodology in assessing whether there was a net financing cost and, if so, estimating the amount.", "For the PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt, the portfolio methodology best captures the combined impact of the four distinct aspects of the net financing cost that we identified: (1) the difference between the PMAs\u2019 borrowing rate and Treasury\u2019s borrowing rate for securities of similar maturity at the time the appropriation was made (interest rate spread), (2) the PMAs\u2019 ability to repay the highest interest rate debt first (prepayment option), (3) the interest rate risk arising from Treasury\u2019s general inability to refinance or prepay outstanding debt in times of falling interest rates (Treasury borrowing practices), and (4) the difference in the maturities of the three PMAs\u2019 and BPA\u2019s appropriated debt and Treasury\u2019s bonds (maturity differential). The loan-by-loan methodology suggested by the three PMAs and BPA is limited in that it captures only that portion of the net financing cost arising from the interest rate spread and not the other three aspects of that cost.", "We noted in appendix II of volume 2 of this report that as a comparison to our portfolio analyses, we did perform loan-by-loan assessments to estimate the net financing cost to the federal government for one of the three PMAs\u2014Southwestern\u2014as well as for BPA and RUS. In our loan-by-loan analyses, we attempted to match the PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt and RUS federal debt with Treasury borrowing. In these analyses, we assumed that to provide financing for up to 50 years for a PMA project and 40 years for RUS debt, Treasury had to borrow an equivalent amount via the sale of long-term bonds. Because Treasury does not generally borrow for more than 30-year terms, in the loan-by-loan analyses, we also assumed that Treasury had to refinance each borrowing to extend the financing to the PMAs or RUS borrowers for the remainder of the terms of the debt.", "Our loan-by-loan analyses resulted in a net financing cost for fiscal year 1996 that was higher than under the portfolio methodology for two of the three entities (BPA and Southwestern) and the same for the third (RUS). For BPA, the net financing cost for fiscal year 1996 was about $445 million under the loan-by-loan analysis (versus $377 million under the portfolio analysis), for Southwestern it was about $54 million (versus $42 million under the portfolio analysis), and for RUS it was about $874 million (the same as under the portfolio analysis).", "The criticism of our use of the portfolio methodology is also inconsistent with another BPA comment asserting that a portfolio methodology estimate of net financing costs using a lower Treasury interest rate\u2014the rate on Treasury\u2019s entire portfolio of outstanding marketable securities, including short-term securities\u2014would be appropriate. BPA stated that in using only long-term Treasury debt to gauge Treasury\u2019s cost of funds for appropriated debt, our report inflates Treasury\u2019s true cost of funds and, therefore, the net cost to the government of BPA\u2019s operations. BPA stated that a more appropriate measure of Treasury\u2019s cost of carrying this debt is Treasury\u2019s composite rate for all marketable interest-bearing debt, which was about 6.7 percent at the end of fiscal year 1996.", "The composite interest rate that BPA proposed includes recently issued short-term Treasury bills and some notes with maturities of only several months. Using this composite interest rate that includes short-term securities is inappropriate because it would match short-term Treasury borrowing costs with long-term PMA appropriated debt. Because Treasury\u2019s bond portfolio includes debt issued over the last several decades, the average interest rate on this portfolio is a reasonable approximation of the federal government\u2019s cost of funds relating to the PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt, which also was incurred over the last several decades.", "Moreover, the interest rate BPA is to pay on its appropriated debt under the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 supports our position that a long-term Treasury rate is the correct rate to use in our portfolio analysis. Under this act, that interest rate is based on long-term Treasury bond interest rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assertion That Financings Provided by Treasury Are Analogous to Mortgage Loans", "paragraphs": ["The three PMAs and BPA also asserted that appropriated debt is analogous to fixed-rate mortgage loans issued by a commercial lender. The three PMAs stated that their concern over our estimate of net financing costs might be best explained by using a mortgage loan example. They stated that a fixed interest rate is assigned to each investment that the PMAs\u2019 customers are required to repay, just as a homeowner receives a fixed rate mortgage from a lender. They further stated that to assert that the PMAs impose a net cost to Treasury in a year in which market interest rates have risen above the interest rates on the PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt is equivalent to saying that the homeowner imposes a net cost on a lender whenever market rates for home loans rise above the homeowner\u2019s fixed mortgage rate. Similarly, BPA stated that a 30-year fixed rate mortgage entered into in a year with low interest rates would not result in a cost to the lender simply because interest rates increased over time.", "We do not agree that the PMAs\u2019 financing is analogous to a mortgage lending situation for several reasons. First, in a mortgage-type lending arrangement, if the lender wants to remain in business, it establishes a spread between the rate charged the borrower and the rate it must pay for the capital it lends. In the case of the PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt, the PMAs do not pay higher interest rates than the interest rates Treasury pays on its bonds. On the contrary, in most instances the rates the PMAs paid on currently outstanding appropriated debt were significantly lower than the rates Treasury paid when the financings were provided. In addition, the PMAs do not pay any transaction fees (for example, points or closing costs) associated with the financings, which homeowners generally pay. The highest interest rate the PMAs are subject to for new financing is based on the rates on long-term Treasury securities issued the previous year, which generally have maturities of 30 years or less even though the repayment periods for the PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt are up to 50 years. No attempt is made to charge a differential or take into account the greater risk of having appropriated debt outstanding for 50 years; in contrast, 30-year mortgages have higher interest rates than 15-year mortgages. Also, the PMAs are able to receive interest rates based on Treasury bonds that are \u201crisk-free.\u201d If the PMAs were required to obtain financing in the private market, without any implicit or explicit federal guarantee, they would likely pay interest rates higher than the risk-free Treasury rate.", "Furthermore, a mortgage lender typically requires that borrowers repay their loans, including principal and interest payments, on a fixed schedule, while the PMAs are not required to make fixed principal payments. Instead, the PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt is similar to a balloon loan that is due in full at the end of the term\u2014up to 50 years for the PMAs. The PMAs are required to repay debt with the highest interest rate first to minimize interest expense. Since the PMAs\u2019 interest expense is minimized, this requirement minimizes interest income to Treasury and maximizes Treasury\u2019s interest rate risk. The PMAs currently have debt outstanding from decades ago at extremely low and outdated interest rates and upon which no principal has been paid. If the PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt had been paid back like a mortgage, their current weighted-average interest rates would be far higher. The result of this type of arrangement, along with Treasury\u2019s general inability to call its outstanding bonds, is that the interest income Treasury receives on the PMAs\u2019 appropriated debt is considerably less than the interest Treasury pays to bondholders on a comparable amount of Treasury debt. We are not aware of any mortgage lender who would be able to remain in business over the long term if it operated similarly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Net Financing Cost Comments by BPA", "paragraphs": ["BPA stated that our draft report disregards the fact that the interest charges BPA pays on its appropriated debt were determined years ago using interest rates prevailing at that time. While the interest rates assigned to some Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) appropriations approximated Treasury\u2019s long-term interest rate, BPA\u2019s statement is not factually accurate. Over the last 4 decades, BPA has incurred substantial debt at below-Treasury interest rates, as shown by the following examples:", "BPA incurred over $250 million in appropriated debt in 1969 at an interest rate of 2.5 percent when Treasury\u2019s long-term bond rate was 6.67 percent; less than 1 percent of this has been repaid.", "BPA incurred over $250 million in appropriated debt at 2.5 percent in 1975 when Treasury\u2019s long-term bond rate was 7.99 percent; less than 1 percent of this has been repaid.", "BPA incurred over $399 million in appropriated debt at 3.25 percent in 1982 when Treasury\u2019s long-term bond rate was 12.76 percent; none of this has been repaid.", "BPA currently has outstanding appropriated debt bearing interest at 2.5 percent that was borrowed as recently as 1992 when Treasury\u2019s long-term bond rate was 7.67 percent, and 3.125 and 3.25 percent debt incurred as recently as 1990 when long-term Treasury bond rates were 8.61 percent.", "In addition, BPA stated that we were inconsistent in assessing the net financing cost for BPA and TVA appropriated debt because we used a 9.0 percent interest rate to assess BPA\u2019s net financing cost but used a 6.87 percent interest rate to determine the federal government\u2019s net cost of providing financing to TVA. We disagree with BPA\u2019s assessment. Since the terms of BPA\u2019s and TVA\u2019s appropriated debt differ markedly, it is reasonable to reflect this in assessing the net financing cost to the federal government. TVA is generally required to make payments on its outstanding principal balance every year, whereas BPA is required to pay outstanding principal only in the year of maturity. Also, the interest rate on TVA\u2019s appropriated debt is revised annually to reflect the cost to Treasury of providing the financing. In contrast, BPA is allowed to repay appropriated debt with the highest interest rate first and keep appropriated debt with a low interest rate on the books for decades.", "Since TVA appropriated debt is in effect refinanced annually, it can reasonably be assigned an interest rate based on Treasury\u2019s composite interest rate on all outstanding marketable securities, which includes short-term securities. Moreover, the different terms result in different exposures to interest rate risk. TVA bears interest rate risk in that if Treasury\u2019s interest rates rise, TVA\u2019s interest expense rises. In contrast, once BPA\u2019s interest rates are assigned, they remain the same over the life of the debt. As a result, BPA bears interest rate risk only in the unlikely event that Treasury rates fall below BPA\u2019s weighted-average interest rate of 3.5 percent. For example, in 1982 (because of high inflation and resultant high interest rates), TVA\u2019s weighted-average interest rate on its appropriated debt was over 12 percent while BPA\u2019s was approximately 3.3 percent. Moreover, TVA\u2019s appropriated debt currently carries a weighted-average interest rate of 6.87 percent, while BPA\u2019s weighted-average rate is 3.5 percent.", "BPA also stated that we inadequately addressed the restructuring of BPA\u2019s appropriated debt and that we \u201chint\u201d that BPA has an imbedded interest rate advantage that the Congress has ignored. In making this observation, BPA appears to be suggesting that the restructuring of its appropriated debt has permanently eliminated any net financing cost to the federal government.", "We do not agree. Under the terms of BPA\u2019s appropriated debt restructuring, more than $2.5 billion of appropriated debt will be written off in exchange for increasing the interest rates on BPA\u2019s revised appropriated debt balance to market interest rates. BPA will also pay an additional $100 million over the remaining terms of the debt. Other than this $100 million, the net cash flow to Treasury is essentially unchanged as a result of the restructuring. We acknowledge that Treasury will receive $100 million more under the restructured repayment plan than under the existing arrangement if BPA pays off the debt when it matures. However, this $100 million is less than one-third of the $377 million net financing cost we estimate that Treasury incurred in 1996 alone. This net negative cash flow to the federal government will continue as long as the appropriated debt and the corresponding Treasury debt are outstanding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Net Financing Cost Comments by TVA", "paragraphs": ["TVA suggested that our report include an income item of approximately $100 million in our presentation of \u201cannual costs to the government.\u201d It contends that this amount represents what TVA pays Treasury each year in excess of the government\u2019s current cost of financing TVA\u2019s Federal Financing Bank (FFB) loans. We disagree. Treasury\u2019s current interest rate is not an appropriate measure of its cost of financing loans issued in the past. Rather, the interest rates in effect at the time the loans were issued represents Treasury\u2019s cost. Because FFB is charging TVA the long-term borrowing rate of similar Treasury debt at the time the loan was made, the federal government is receiving a return sufficient to cover its borrowing costs.", "If TVA is permitted to refinance these loans without penalty, the federal government will suffer a significant loss. This loss represents the difference between the interest rate at the time of the borrowing and the interest rate on current debt Treasury could avoid incurring today. In 1995, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) was asked to review proposed legislation that would have authorized TVA to prepay the $3.2 billion in loans made by FFB without paying the prepayment premiums. CBO estimated that enacting such legislation in 1996 would increase federal outlays by about $120 million per year through 2002 with amounts declining thereafter until the last notes matured in the year 2016.

This assumes that the entity\u2019s competitive position is such that it can charge sufficiently high rates to recover all costs from customers. For IOUs, average revenue per kWh should represent cost plus the regulated rate of return. Given that a large portion of an IOU\u2019s rate of return (net income) is used to pay common stock dividends, which is a financing cost, average revenue per kWh, while somewhat higher because it includes a profit, is a reasonable approximation of IOUs\u2019 power production costs. In addition, analysts and bond rating agencies commonly use average revenue per kWh in assessing the competitiveness of power rates.", "We do recognize, however, that using average revenue per kWh as an analytical tool has some limitations. We clearly state in appendix III of volume 2 of this report that the price that any one utility charges another for wholesale energy comprises numerous transaction-specific factors, including fees charged for reserving a portion of capacity, consumption during peak and off-peak periods, and the use of the facilities. In appendix III, we have also clarified our discussion of the current electricity market, in which utilities are generally able to recover their fixed costs from retail customers. Thus, when competing for new wholesale customers, utilities with excess capacity and the ability to recover fixed costs from retail customers are able to sell surplus power at less than full production cost (that is, marginal cost). However, despite these limitations, average revenue per kWh is a good indicator of production costs since, over time, utilities must recover all costs to remain in business.", "The PMAs also stated that because of the variability in output of certain hydropower projects, our use of average revenue per kWh to indicate competitiveness could result in wide variations in a PMA\u2019s competitive position from year to year. To address this concern, in this report and our September 1996 report, we compared the overall average revenue per kWh for the three PMAs, IOUs, and POGs from 1990 through 1995. In each year, the overall average revenue per kWh for each of the three PMAs were lower than IOUs and POGs by at least 40 percent.
