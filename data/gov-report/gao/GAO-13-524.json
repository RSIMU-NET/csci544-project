GAO's objectives were to (1) identify key characteristics of TechStats held to date; (2) evaluate whether selected agencies are conducting TechStats in accordance with OMB guidance, and (3) analyze the extent to which reported TechStat results are tracked and validated. To do so, GAO selected four agencies--Agriculture, Commerce, HHS, and DHS--because these were the agencies with the highest number of at-risk investments.

As of April 2013, OMB reported conducting 79 TechStats, which focused on 55 investments at 23 federal agencies. The four agencies conducted 37 TechStats covering 28 investments. About 70 percent of the OMB- and 76 percent of agency-led TechStats on major investments were considered medium- to high-risk at the time of the TechStat. However, the number of at-risk TechStats held to date is relatively small compared to the current number of medium- and high-risk IT investments. Until OMB and agencies develop plans to address these investments, the investments will likely remain at risk.", "The selected agencies are generally conducting TechStats in accordance with OMB guidance. OMB's TechStat guidance includes 15 key requirements, such as when TechStats should be implemented, what participants should be included, and how outcomes should be tracked and reported. DHS implemented all of the TechStat requirements. Commerce, HHS, and Agriculture implemented a majority of the requirements, but each had shortcomings. For example, these agencies did not consistently create memorandums with responsible parties and due dates for action items. Fully implementing OMB's guidance could better position agencies to effectively manage and resolve problems on IT investments.", "OMB and selected agencies have tracked and reported positive results from TechStats, with most resulting in improved governance. OMB also reported in 2011 that federal agencies achieved almost $4 billion in life-cycle cost savings as a result of TechStat sessions. However, GAO was unable to validate OMB's reported results because OMB did not provide artifacts showing that it ensured the results were valid. From GAO's selected agencies, three investments had cost implications. Agencies provided supporting documentation for about $22.2 million in cost savings and avoidances.

For example, in May 2010, we reported  that after spending $127 million over 9 years on an outpatient scheduling  system, the Department of Veterans Affairs has not implemented any of  the system\u2019s capabilities and was essentially starting over. Further, in  May 2012, we reported that while IT should enable government to better  serve the American people, the federal government had not achieved  expected productivity improvements\u2014despite spending more than $600  billion on IT over the past decade.", "OMB plays a key role in overseeing how federal agencies manage their  IT investments by working with them to better plan, justify, and determine  how to manage them. Each year, OMB and federal agencies work  together to determine how much the government plans to spend on IT  projects and how these funds are to be allocated. OMB also guides  agencies in developing sound business cases for IT investments and  establishing management processes for overseeing these investments  throughout their life cycles. The scope of this undertaking is quite large: in  planning for fiscal year 2014, 27 federal agencies reported plans to spend  about $76.5 billion on 8,142 IT investments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Roles and Responsibilities for Overseeing Federal IT Investments", "paragraphs": ["Over the last three decades, Congress has enacted several laws to assist  agencies and the federal government in managing IT investments.

Federal law, specifically the Clinger-Cohen Act, has defined the role of  the CIO as the focal point for IT management, requiring agency heads to  designate CIOs to lead reforms that would help control system  development risks; better manage technology spending; and achieve real,  measurable improvements in agency performance. In September 2011,  we reported that federal CIOs are not consistently responsible for all of  the areas assigned by law or identified as critical to effective IT  management. For example, although most of the CIOs were responsible  for capital planning and investment management, we found that CIOs are  less frequently responsible for information management duties such as  records management and privacy requirements. In an August 2011  memo, OMB reiterated the primary areas of responsibility for agency  CIOs. This memo detailed four areas in which the CIO should have a  lead role: IT governance, program management, commodity services,  and information security.

According to OMB,  these data are intended to provide both a historical and a near-real-time  perspective on the performance of these investments. OMB analysts are  expected to use the Dashboard to identify IT investments that are  experiencing performance problems.", "Using data drawn from federal agency budget submissions, the IT  Dashboard provides information on an IT investment\u2019s primary function,  as defined by the Federal Enterprise Architecture. For fiscal year 2012  submissions, agencies were required to select a primary function from  categories within the Federal Enterprise Architecture business reference  models. The primary functions available for IT investments in fiscal year  2012 submissions were: administrative management community and social services controls and oversight correctional activities defense and national security disaster management economic development education energy environmental management financial management general government general science and innovation health homeland security human resource management information and technology  management  intelligence operations  internal risk management and  mitigation  international affairs and  commerce  law enforcement  legislative relations  litigation and judicial activities natural resources planning and budgeting public affairs workforce management  regulatory development  revenue collection  supply chain management  transportation  The Dashboard visually presents performance ratings for individual  investments using metrics that OMB has defined\u2014cost, schedule, and  the CIO\u2019s evaluation of risk. To develop the CIO\u2019s risk evaluation, OMB  instructed agency CIOs to assess their IT investments against a set of six  evaluation factors, including risk management, requirements  management, contractor oversight, historical performance, and human  capital. The CIO assigns a rating of 1 to 5 based on his or her best  judgment of the level of risk facing the investment. OMB then translates  the agency CIO\u2019s numerical assignment for an investment into a color for  depiction on the Dashboard, with green signifying low or moderately low  risk, yellow signifying medium risk, and red signifying moderately high or  high risk (see table 1).", "In January 2010, OMB began conducting TechStats to enable the federal  government to intervene to turnaround, halt, or terminate IT projects that  are failing or are not producing results.

OMB provided additional details as follows:  In commenting on our finding that it did not ensure the validity of  the outcomes and savings it reported, OMB noted that it is  confident in the agency validation of cost-savings and avoidances  through the TechStat sessions, and that it was speculative to  conclude that the reported cost savings data were not valid  because we could not actually assess these figures. OMB did not  provide supporting documentation for the cost savings  calculations and explained that the process used to validate the  cost figures was deliberative.
