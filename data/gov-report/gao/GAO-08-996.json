Quantitative performance targets are established for corporate and unit indicators. Corporate indicators apply to all participants and include measures of timely delivery, productivity, revenue, and net income, among others. Unit indicators apply to selected groups of participants and vary according to the groups' responsibilities and span of control. Individual performance elements are tailored to the participant group and, within some groups, to individuals. Individual performance elements may be defined by narrative standards or may be quantitative indicators defined with specific target performance levels. The overall PFP rating is based on results of corporate and unit indicators and individual performance elements and is used to determine the salary adjustment and any lump sum award. PFP indicators related to three USPS strategic goals--increasing efficiency, improving service, and generating revenues--collectively account for two-thirds of the average participant's rating (see fig.). However, indicator weights vary considerably by participant group, based on the responsibilities and span of control of various positions. As USPS implements requirements of the postal reform law for measuring delivery performance, it will have opportunities to incorporate new indicators into its PFP program, notably for timely delivery of Standard Mail (49 percent of mail volume in fiscal year 2007) and bulk First-Class Mail (25 percent of volume). Once new delivery performance measurement systems are fully implemented and mailers' participation is sufficient to generate representative data, USPS will be able to incorporate new delivery performance indicators into its PFP program.

USPS uses this approach to help balance the need to keep postal rates  affordable, address increasing financial pressure, and maintain quality  delivery service for different types of mail. Specifically, according to  USPS, the PFP program is a mechanism to help manage the organization  and its employees; align organizational, unit, and individual objectives; link  individual contributions to organizational success; compare individual  performance with established targets; recognize and reward individual  successes; and ensure accountability at all levels of the organization.

As some  communications and payments have migrated to electronic alternatives,  including the Internet, First-Class Mail, which historically has covered  most overhead costs, has declined in volume, and more declines are  expected. According to USPS, \u201cThe projected decline of First-Class Mail  impacts the Postal Service\u2019s ability to continue to finance the growing  universal service network. This is the single greatest challenge facing the  Postal Service.\u201d Although Standard Mail (primarily advertising) is USPS\u2019s  largest class of mail and key growth product, it is more price sensitive.  Standard Mail volume has recently declined in the wake of postal rate  increases and the economic downturn, and its future prospects are unclear  as advertising expenditures continue to shift to the Internet. In this regard,  a joint USPS-mailer work group recently reported that \u201cStandard Mail  must be delivered in a timely and consistent manner to the end customer  according to published standards, in order to remain a viable growth  product for its users and the Postal Service, and to remain competitive  with alternative advertising media.\u201d Standard Mail growth will be critical  to offset rising costs, primarily rising compensation and benefits costs that  have consistently represented nearly 80 percent of USPS\u2019s expenses.", "USPS has restrained cost growth in recent years, in part through  automation and other productivity initiatives that helped reduce the  number of career employees from a peak of nearly 800,000 in September  1999 to fewer than 670,000 in September 2007. However, as USPS has  recognized, continued productivity gains are needed in the face of the  changing mail mix, sustained and evolving competition, and a challenging  economic environment. USPS has recognized that given its workforce  costs, continued work hour reductions are necessary to achieve  productivity gains.", "The 2006 postal reform act generally limits rate increases for most mail to  an inflationary price cap. The reform act also abolished the statutory  mandate to break even financially over time. As a result, USPS generally  cannot address financial losses with above-inflation rate increases, which  underscores the need to remain financially viable by sufficiently growing  revenues, restraining costs, or both.

To  this end, target levels of performance, expressed in quantitative terms, are  established for the corporate and unit indicators, and PFP participants  receive higher ratings as higher targets are achieved. In fiscal year 2008, 12  corporate indicators apply to all PFP participants, including measures of  timely mail delivery, productivity, revenue, and net income, among other  things. A total of 53 unit indicators apply to selected groups of  participants, such as groups of postmasters and managers at various mail  processing facilities, depending on their responsibilities and spans of  control. Some unit indicators apply to most participants, such as the  indicator of total operating expenses. Other indicators apply to relatively  few participants, such as indicators of international mail delivery, which  apply exclusively to managers at USPS International Service Centers.", "Besides being rated on results for corporate and unit indicators, each PFP  participant is rated on individual performance elements that vary  depending on the participant group and, within some groups, are tailored  to each participant. Some individual performance elements have target  levels of performance defined by narrative standards that are centrally  established by USPS. For example, EAS postmasters have two individual  performance elements that are defined by narrative standards: (1) fiscal  management and (2) leadership and communication. Alternatively, other  individual performance elements may be selected from a predefined list  and then defined more specifically with target performance levels, based  on a discussion that involves the participant and the participant\u2019s rater.  For example, some individual performance elements for a field operations  manager must be selected from a list, which includes, among other things,  operational productivity, the rate of scanning barcodes on mail pieces, and  overtime usage.

In some cases, targets are based on the USPS budget. For example, unit  indicator targets are defined for total operating expenses relative to the  final budget. To the extent that operating expenses are reduced below the  budgeted level, higher target levels are achieved. These targets can be  adjusted by various levels of management throughout the fiscal year,  depending on numerous factors, such as changes in USPS\u2019s overall  financial condition, increases in fuel prices, changes in local mailing  volumes, and unexpected local expenses, among other things.", "Corporate and unit indicators are measured against targets at various  levels of geographic aggregation, depending on the indicator and the  participant\u2019s group. For example, some corporate indicators are measured  at the national level, such as indicators of productivity, revenue, and net  income. Other indicators are measured at different geographic levels. For  example, for a postmaster of a small post office, the unit\u2019s total operating  expense indicator is defined as the total expenses of that post office. For a  district executive, the unit operating expense indicator is defined as the  total expenses of the entire district.", "In some instances, USPS permits \u201cmitigation\u201d adjustments to the data used  to measure achievement against targets.

To address these objectives, we obtained documentation from USPS on its  PFP program and interviewed USPS officials responsible for the program.  To assess opportunities for USPS to incorporate new delivery  performance indicators into its PFP program, we also obtained  documentation on USPS\u2019s plans to implement new delivery performance  measurement systems. We primarily based our assessment on applicable  laws\u2014such as laws related to USPS\u2019s statutory mission of providing  prompt, reliable, and efficient postal services to patrons in all areas at  reasonable rates and statutory reporting requirements related to USPS\u2019s  delivery performance\u2014as well as on interviews with senior USPS officials.  We also developed assessment criteria from our past work on other  agencies\u2019 PFP programs and best practices used by high-performing  organizations. We conducted a data reliability assessment of USPS\u2019s PFP  information and determined that the information was sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our report. Our assessment was based on a review of  the documentation and data provided, comparing the consistency of  information provided by multiple sources and in multiple data files;  interviews with USPS officials to discuss the documentation; and data,  including how the data were developed; and follow-up questions to obtain  further information.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2007 to September  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
