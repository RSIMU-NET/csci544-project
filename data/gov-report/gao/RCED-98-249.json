This DOE mission, which is expected to continue for many years, involves a number of activities, with the most ambitious and far-ranging being the cleanup of the hazardous and radioactive contaminants that resulted from the production of nuclear weapons at DOE facilities. The challenges of this task are technical, institutional, and economic. For example, thousands of tons of radioactive waste must be treated and put into permanent storage; contaminated soil must be stabilized; contaminated water must be treated; and nuclear reactors and materials-processing facilities must be decontaminated, decommissioned, and demolished. In some cases, no safe and effective technology is currently available to address the more complex contamination problems.", "In June 1998, DOE estimated that it will be very expensive, about $150 billion, to clean up the legacy of the Cold War. However, DOE has also stated that the cost of cleaning up its contaminated facilities and sites can be significantly reduced through the use of innovative cleanup technologies. It supports the development of these technologies through its Office of Science and Technology (OST), within the Office of Environmental Management (EM)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OST Established to Develop Innovative Technologies", "paragraphs": ["In 1989, DOE established EM to clean up and restore its contaminated facilities and sites in compliance with federal and state environmental laws and regulations.

The Office of Technology Development was renamed the Office of Science and Technology in 1994, when basic science research for waste cleanup was added to its responsibilities. OST\u2019s projects are intended to produce technologies that could accelerate cleanups, reduce costs, enable cleanup activities for which there are no existing cost-effective technologies, or reduce risks to cleanup workers. From fiscal year 1990 through fiscal year 1998, the Congress appropriated approximately $2.5 billion for OST\u2019s development of innovative waste cleanup technologies, and OST has initiated over 700 projects. OST\u2019s budget for technology development activities in fiscal year 1998 is about $220 million. OST requested a total of $180.5 million for technology development activities for fiscal year 1999.", "OST develops technology at DOE\u2019s national laboratories, private companies under contract to OST, and universities.

OST first established focus areas in 1994 in order to better serve the cleanup sites by concentrating technology resources on each of the major cleanup problems DOE faces. OST currently has the following five focus areas:", "Mixed Waste Characterization, Treatment, and Disposal. Known as \u201cmixed waste,\u201d this focus area addresses the large inventory of mixed, low-level, and transuranic waste;", "Radioactive Tank Waste Remediation. Known as \u201ctanks,\u201d this focus area addresses the hundreds of large storage tanks containing over 100 million gallons of radioactive waste;", "Subsurface Contaminants. This focus area addresses hazardous and radioactive contaminants in soil and groundwater and the remediation challenges posed by numerous DOE landfills;", "Deactivation and Decommissioning. This focus area addresses the deactivation, decommissioning, and disposal of aging and contaminated DOE weapons complex facilities; and", "Plutonium Stabilization and Disposition. This focus area addresses the over 20 tons of excess plutonium that must be stabilized.", "OST has established a lead field office to manage each focus area. For example, the Savannah River site manages the Subsurface Contaminants Focus Area.

In addition, no technology exists to address some cleanup problems. For example, no technology exists for some aspects of removing and treating the radioactive waste now in large tanks at several major DOE facilities. Furthermore, some cleanup activities could be dangerous or impossible for cleanup workers unless innovative technologies, such as remote robotic devices to clean inside radioactive waste tanks, are used.", "Those in the Congress and in DOE who led the effort to establish OST believed that the use of innovative technology would reduce the cost of waste cleanup. For example, in 1995, DOE estimated that it would cost between $200 billion and $350 billion and take another 75 years to complete the cleanup. However, DOE also estimated that the use of new technologies could reduce cleanup costs by a minimum of $9 billion to as much as $80 billion, depending on the cleanup scenario. More recently, in 1997, the Army Corps of Engineers reviewed cost savings estimates developed by OST for 37 of its technology projects and concluded that these 37 projects could potentially save about $20 billion over the use of conventional technology.

In 1992, we reported that EM had not established key management tools, such as cost estimates and schedules, and decision points for evaluating technology projects. In January 1993, EM implemented a management plan for the technology program that incorporated our recommendations. The program established cost estimates and schedules for projects. EM also developed decision points (called gates) and related requirements for evaluating projects and making \u201cgo/no-go\u201d decisions.", "In 1994, we reported that officials at DOE cleanup sites may not be familiar with innovative technologies and may fear that using new technologies may lead DOE to miss cleanup deadlines if the technology fails to perform as expected. In response to our report, OST took several actions, including establishing the site technology coordination groups discussed earlier, to improve communication on sites\u2019 technology needs and the capabilities of newly developed technologies. In addition, to help ensure that development activities were concentrated on the most pressing cleanup needs, EM restructured its technology development program into the focus areas.", "In 1996, we reported that EM had not coordinated technology development to prevent duplication of effort, particularly between OST and the Office of Waste Management, which together had 60 projects to develop equipment to melt and immobilize waste. A key reason for the duplication was EM\u2019s lack of a comprehensive list of technology development projects. EM subsequently developed a list of its technology projects. We also found that more technology projects were being started at the sites where the focus areas were physically headquartered. In following up on this situation in 1997, we found that this concentration had decreased.", "In 1997, we testified before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, House Committee on Commerce, that OST appeared to have made some improvements in its project management, but we had continuing concern about the extent of use of OST-developed technologies at DOE\u2019s waste cleanup sites and the validity of OST data on deployments and expected cost savings. OST had also proposed a new initiative, Accelerated Site Technology Deployment (ASTD), to facilitate the use of its technologies. We expressed several concerns about the likely effectiveness of this initiative, which provides funding to DOE sites for the first use of an innovative technology.

This information provided project names and numerical identifiers, research stage, deployment sites (if any), and other project information, as of January 1998. We also obtained information about OST\u2019s use and definition of the term \u201cdeployment\u201d and OST\u2019s procedures for entering and updating the information in this system. In order to assess the accuracy of OST\u2019s deployment data, we used a random sample of the projects that OST listed as deployed, and we verified the claimed deployments with site operations officials. Upon finding a significant error rate, we used our sample results to estimate a range for the actual number of OST project deployments. The methodology for our verification is described in appendix I.", "To compare the rate of deployment for OST\u2019s technologies with the rates of other government organizations that develop environmental technologies, we used database searches and contacts with federal agency officials to identify federal government programs that develop environmental technologies. We contacted the eight government programs whose research and development work was most comparable to OST\u2019s in mission and scope, and two of these programs\u2014EPA\u2019s Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation Program and the Department of Defense\u2019s Environmental Security Technology Certification Program\u2014were able to provide deployment data for comparison with OST\u2019s data. We also contacted two private sector organizations that develop environmental technologies but found that they did not maintain deployment data. Because the two federal programs providing deployment data conduct technology demonstrations but not earlier phases of research and development, we identified OST projects that had reached a similar stage of maturity to provide an equitable group for comparison. (See app. II for a detailed discussion of these two programs.)", "To identify obstacles that exist to deploying innovative technologies at DOE sites, we first reviewed past reports on this subject by GAO, DOE, and advisory groups to DOE. In order to obtain more current and specific information about obstacles to deployment and EM\u2019s progress in overcoming them, we visited five DOE sites: Hanford (Washington State), Savannah River (South Carolina), Oak Ridge (Tennessee), Fernald (Ohio), and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (California). We selected these sites to provide varied perspectives: The first three sites are among the largest DOE cleanup sites; Fernald is far along in its cleanup efforts and represents a medium-sized cleanup effort; and Lawrence Livermore has a smaller cleanup effort and budget. For the site visits, we identified OST-developed technologies that were either selected for use at the site, considered for use but not selected, or potentially applicable to the site\u2019s cleanup problems. We identified technologies to discuss with site officials from our meetings with managers of OST\u2019s focus areas, records maintained by EM\u2019s Office of Environmental Restoration, and discussions with headquarters EM officials. The technologies were judgmentally selected to provide coverage of (1) EM\u2019s various cleanup challenges and the related OST focus areas and (2) innovative technologies selected or not selected for use.", "We discussed with EM field personnel and contractor staff the obstacles they faced to using particular technologies, the ways they addressed and overcame these obstacles (for deployed technologies), and the reasons they did not select the technologies. We discussed a total of 30 OST-developed technologies with one or more of the five sites and obtained documentation on related selection decisions. We analyzed this information to identify (1) commonly cited obstacles to deployment and (2) the means by which sites overcame these obstacles in those cases in which OST-developed technologies were selected or in use.", "In order to identify EM\u2019s actions to overcome deployment obstacles, we reviewed a memo from the Assistant Secretary for EM that directed a number of actions to increase deployment, and we obtained information about the status and results of these actions.

This definition, which OST had formalized and distributed in April 1996, defined implementation to mean that the technology was used or selected for use to meet specified user performance measures (e.g., completion of an assessment or treatment of waste for disposal). However, officials of the Subsurface Contaminants Focus Area provided us with a definition of deployment that they received along with the instructions for responding to the Committee\u2019s data request. This definition stated that the number of deployments means the number of \u201chot\u201d demonstrations (that is, demonstrations in radioactive environments) and that deployment site means the location of a hot demonstration.", "We found that OST focus area personnel entering the data frequently regarded demonstrations as deployments. For example, OST counted as a deployment the use of a characterization technology called Laser Ablation/Mass Spectroscopy at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington State. In response to our questions, site contractor officials stated the technology\u2019s use at the laboratory had been a demonstration in which data derived from the laser technology were compared with data derived from a conventional technology.

Furthermore, when the use of a new technology is clearly and significantly advantageous, cleanup sites make a strong effort to overcome any obstacles to its use.", "Specifically, when regulators and stakeholders are concerned about a technology\u2019s effectiveness, sites have provided additional data or testing and, occasionally, modified technology to satisfy some concern or implemented an innovative technology in phases to obtain performance data. For example, according to Hanford officials, using a new technology to encapsulate certain carbon-based waste would be much less costly than incinerating it. State regulations, however, called for incinerating such waste. Nonetheless, Hanford persisted and obtained a waiver from the state to encapsulate the waste. At Oak Ridge, DOE and its contractors wanted to use a frozen soil barrier to contain a relatively small pool of water that had been contaminated with reactor waste. However, regulators and stakeholders were skeptical that this innovative technology would work and be cost effective. Oak Ridge demonstrated the technology to obtain cost and performance data and provided this information to regulators and stakeholders. The technology has since gained wide acceptance by these groups.", "Some technology may have to be modified to satisfy regulatory concerns. For example, Hanford officials wanted to test an innovative technology for cleaning up contaminated soil, which they believed was better than current methods. However, regulators were concerned about the possible expulsion of carbon tetrachloride contaminants into the air. Hanford officials convinced the regulators to allow them to experiment with the new technology by offering to add a filter to the equipment to catch any contaminants. The modification was a low-cost and easy addition to the equipment.", "In some cases, sites implement a technology in phases to obtain performance data and to assure themselves and convince regulators and stakeholders of the technology\u2019s viability. For example, OST funded the development of a robotics device, called Houdini, that could help clean up waste in tanks. Oak Ridge, with the help of the manufacturer, adapted Houdini to help clean up radioactive waste stored at the bottom of the site\u2019s large tanks. However, because Houdini had never been used to clean up radioactive waste, no information was available on the device\u2019s performance and reliability. Oak Ridge therefore had to implement Houdini in phases using nonradioactive \u201ccold\u201d testing; followed by treatability tests in a lower radiation environment; and finally, \u201chot\u201d testing on the radioactive waste in its tanks.", "Field officials also told us that the projects in which OST and an EM operating group get involved as a joint venture seem to work well. In these cases, OST provides funding and some technical assistance, and the operating group also provides funding and implements the project. If there are also partners from industry, they further enhance the chances for success. For example, at Hanford, OST and EM\u2019s environmental restoration group are participating in a large project to demonstrate a number of technologies that can be used to put Hanford\u2019s old, shutdown reactors into safe interim storage. Hanford officials were convinced that if the demonstrated technologies were successful, the time needed to prepare the reactors for storage could be cut by 7 years.", "The demonstration project started in 1996, with contributions totaling about $8 million from OST and about $16 million from the environmental restoration group. However, the project did not have the extra money to make needed refinements and modifications to technologies. Consequently, Hanford officials suggested partnering with private contractors who would assume the risk and cost of getting the technologies to perform. OST\u2019s Deactivation and Decommissioning Focus Area, which routinely works with the private sector, helped to bring about this partnership with private contractors. As of July 1998, the project had successfully demonstrated 20 technologies and deployed 13 of them at Hanford\u2019s C Reactor, two other Hanford reactors, and a number of other DOE reactors throughout the complex. In addition, the technologies have been transferred to the commercial reactor sector and will be used to help put the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine, into safe storage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OST Has Developed Innovative Technologies Without Sufficient User Involvement", "paragraphs": ["Despite the progress that has been made, some obstacles internal to EM and OST operations continue to slow the deployment of innovative technologies. In particular, OST has developed technologies that tend to be generic solutions to cleanup problems and, if usable at all, have to be modified to fit a site\u2019s specific problem. These problems occur in part because OST had not, until 1996, comprehensively assessed the technology needs of the cleanup sites and has not involved potential technology users in the development of technology that might be used to address specific cleanup problems. Without user involvement, there have been no identified customers for some of the technology that OST has sponsored.

However, these solutions either do not fit a site\u2019s specific needs or must be modified before they can be used. For example, Fernald workers needed portable equipment that would allow them to characterize contamination within buildings without climbing ladders to obtain samples from contaminated areas. OST said that, although its laser-induced fluorescence imaging equipment had not been field-tested, the equipment had been designed to meet needs such as Fernald\u2019s. However, when Fernald workers attempted to use the equipment, they found that it was not ready for field use. It was cumbersome (not really \u201cportable\u201d) and light interfered with measurement readings. As a result, the equipment was not usable and was returned to the manufacturer for modifications. Consequently, Fernald personnel continued to take samples from the contaminated building areas by hand. Although they realized that the OST equipment had not been thoroughly tested before they tried it, Fernald officials said, they believed that if OST had involved them in the design and development of the equipment, the problems would have been avoided, or at least identified and corrected earlier.", "Similarly, officials at DOE\u2019s Hanford site tried two OST technologies that promised to support faster remediation of contaminated soil but had to reject them because they were not designed to work in Hanford\u2019s arid soil. The officials said that the concept for faster remediation of contaminated soil was attractive and probably would have been acceptable to Hanford\u2019s regulators, but the generic design of the technologies did not meet Hanford\u2019s specific needs.", "Furthermore, some site officials said that they would like to use some OST technologies, but the technologies require modification to fit the site\u2019s situation. They pointed out that it is not clear who should make and pay for these modifications. For example, a project manager at DOE\u2019s Savannah River Site told us that he would like to use more innovative technology in his projects, but it is unclear who is responsible for making site-specific modifications, and his program does not have funding to make such modifications. At Hanford, officials were interested in using OST\u2019s Electrical Resistance Tomography to help detect leaks in their high-level radioactive waste tanks. (Hanford has 67 known or suspected leaking tanks.) However, a Hanford official said that the technology needed substantial fine-tuning to make it work on the Hanford tanks, and no funding was available to pay for this. He said that it was unclear who is responsible for funding modifications to OST technologies.", "When only minor, inexpensive modifications are required, site representatives said that they have made and usually paid for them.

EMAB has questioned whether the focus areas currently have the expertise needed to provide such assistance. The Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for OST acknowledged that the focus areas vary in their degree of expertise and ability to provide technical assistance. He noted that the Tanks Focus Area works closely with one of the national laboratories, which can provide in-depth expertise, and stated that the other focus areas need to develop a roster of technical experts who can be consulted for particular site cleanup problems that the focus areas cannot solve.

Officials at three of the five sites we visited told us that OST sometimes considers its technology development work completed before technologies are ready for specific applications in the field. The Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for OST agreed that this is a problem and told us that, while the Tanks Focus Area develops technologies fully to the point of use, technologies from the other focus areas were not always ready for field use. For example, he stated that the Mixed Waste Focus Area had not tested its thermal treatment technologies on actual radioactive waste. The Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary stated that sites and focus areas should work together to enable and jointly fund the first use of an OST-developed technology.", "While joint OST and site support for deployment has occurred for some projects\u2014including the reactor safe-storage project at Hanford and the use of the Houdini robot in tanks at Oak Ridge that are described in chapter 3\u2014EM lacks an overall policy, procedure, and designation of responsibilities for situations in which OST-developed technologies may require modification for site use. Nor has EM identified resources for this purpose, except to the extent that some projects under the Accelerated Site Technology Deployment program may address this need.

Sites\u2019 Accelerating Cleanup plans, issued in draft in June 1997 and most recently submitted in June 1998, provide a comprehensive compilation of sites\u2019 technology needs, as well as detailed information on each cleanup project across the DOE complex. OST has developed a database, called a linkage table, that identifies links between its completed and ongoing projects and the sites\u2019 technology needs. EM could identify OST-developed technologies that could provide cost-effective solutions to sites\u2019 needs and set priorities for deployment assistance to cleanup projects, including technical assistance and technology modifications, if needed.

Selection criteria included the technical merit of the approach, interest in deploying the technologies at multiple locations, and commitment of additional funding by the site.", "While ASTD may be helping these selected projects in addressing obstacles to deployment, the program has not fostered interaction among technology developers and users in many instances.

To promote deployment, EM and OST have initiated a number of actions aimed at improving the relationship between technology developers in OST and the users at EM\u2019s cleanup sites. However, we are concerned that the committees and processes that EM and OST are now creating will be ineffective if they are not accompanied by more fundamental changes in how EM conducts technology development and deployment.", "We believe that EM and OST need to take three relatively straightforward actions to increase the deployment of existing innovative technologies First, OST must make sure that it has adequate technical expertise to assist users in evaluating and implementing innovative technologies that it and others have developed. The focus areas are the logical source for this expertise; however, if they are unable to meet this need, other centers of expertise, possibly in the national laboratories, need to be developed.", "Second, we continue to believe that OST staff, equipped with the appropriate expertise, need to be formally involved in evaluating and selecting technologies for use at the cleanup sites. We believe that the program\u2019s experience has shown that without a specific requirement to bridge the gap between developers and users, each party will continue to operate in its own environment, with users deploying only those technologies with which they are familiar, and OST developing technologies that are generic and not designed for specific situations.", "Third, existing innovative technologies could be implemented, as we found repeatedly, if they could be modified or fine-tuned to address a specific site cleanup problem. Information now exists from sites\u2019 Accelerating Cleanup plans and OST\u2019s linkage tables to identify technologies that can be modified to fit specific situations. However, such modification takes money, and without specific action by EM management, neither users nor developers are likely to provide these funds on their own. For example, if OST uses its funds to fine-tune an existing technology, it is reducing the funds available for its other missions. Similarly, users can logically view the use of their funds to modify a technology as taking away resources that they need for other cleanups. However, EM\u2019s experience, for example, from the project for safe storage of the C reactor at the Hanford site or from the ASTD program, has shown that successful deployment can occur if both parties make a financial commitment.", "Additional technology development will be needed to address technology problems for which no cost-effective solution exists, such as high-level waste tanks at Hanford. To ensure the deployment of technologies that are currently under development or will be developed, EM does not need additional processes and procedures. Rather, it needs to rigorously and consistently apply its current gates system. Consistent use of this system by focus areas would help ensure that technology developers and users communicate and cooperate throughout the development of individual technologies, and that, if technologies are not living up to their potential or there is not adequate commitment from users, the project can be terminated and the funds redirected to more productive uses.", "Ensuring that these actions are taken consistently will require the commitment of top management in the EM program. The Technology Acceleration Committee is a sound idea; however, it has already missed a planned meeting, and we are concerned that it could easily slip into disuse. We believe that continuing a committee of senior EM managers is a key element in ensuring that top management is focused on formulating policy for technology deployment. An additional important element is the establishment of performance measures that hold EM\u2019s top managers accountable for technology deployment. While EM has made clear to field managers that they are responsible for deploying innovative technologies, this commitment needs to be reflected throughout the organization if additional innovative technologies are to be successfully deployed.", "Finally, with an increased emphasis on deployment, EM will need more accurate data than it currently has on deployment efforts. A verification effort similar to the one we undertook will be needed to provide valid data on future deployments. On the other hand, we recognize that improving data on prior deployments may not be cost-effective. Therefore, reporting existing data as estimates could lend more credibility to the data and the overall program. In addition, EM has recognized that deployment is not the only relevant measure of success in technology development.

In 1994, we also recommended that OST be given a formal role in the technology selection process. During our current review, we found that this recommendation had not been implemented primarily because site officials were skeptical about OST\u2019s ability to provide quality technical advice and were therefore reluctant to allow OST more of a role in selecting cleanup technologies. We believe that it will take more specific actions by OST, beyond the generalized user steering committees cited in its response, to develop credible expertise and thus gain a role in the technology selection process.", "In response to our recommendation that DOE rigorously and consistently use the gates system as a decision-making tool for managing technology development, DOE also agreed with the recommendation but noted that it had incorporated the gates system into its system of peer review. While we recognize the value of peer review as a mechanism for obtaining independent technical judgments about projects OST is pursuing, we note that peer review can occur infrequently over the life of a project and after significant decisions are made. Therefore, we do not believe that peer review is a substitute for focus area managers using a disciplined decision-making system that involves users throughout the technology development and deployment process."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
