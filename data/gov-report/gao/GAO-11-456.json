The committee report accompanying a proposed bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 directed GAO to review several issues related to language and culture training for Army and Marine Corps general purpose forces. For this report, GAO evaluated (1) the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps had developed strategies with elements such as goals, funding priorities, and metrics to guide training approaches and investments that were aligned with Department of Defense (DOD) planning efforts and (2) DOD's approach for identifying training requirements for Army and Marine Corps forces that will deploy to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. To do so, GAO analyzed Army and Marine Corps strategies and training requirements and interviewed cognizant officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army and Marine Corps developed service-specific language and culture strategies, but did not include some key elements to guide their training approaches and investments, and DOD-wide efforts to establish a planning process that could better align service training approaches are incomplete. The Army and Marine Corps developed broad goals and objectives within their strategies and identified some training programs and activities tied to these goals. However, the services did not always identify priorities and the investments needed to implement the training or a set of results-oriented performance metrics to assess the contributions that training programs have made collectively, which GAO and DOD have recognized can help ensure training investments are making progress toward achieving program goals and objectives. GAO found that the Army and Marine Corps did not complete underlying analyses and assign responsibilities for program performance prior to designing and implementing their strategies and associated training programs. DOD has taken steps to develop a strategic planning process to align service training approaches. For example, in February 2011, DOD published a strategic plan for language skills and cultural capabilities that outlines a broad departmentwide planning process. However, DOD has not yet set up internal mechanisms, such as procedures and milestones, by which it can reach consensus with the military services on priorities and investments. Without a clearly defined planning process, DOD does not have the tools it needs to set strategic direction for language and culture training efforts, fully align departmentwide efforts to develop plans and budget requests that reflect its priorities, and measure progress in implementing various initiatives. DOD components identified varying language and culture training requirements for Army and Marine Corps general purpose forces that will deploy to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility, but the Command did not use a comprehensive process to synchronize these requirements. GAO surveyed 15 documents issued since June 2008 and found several variances with respect to the language to be trained and the type and duration of training. For example, in July 2010 the Army required that all forces deploying to either Afghanistan or Iraq complete a 4- to 6-hour online training program for language and culture. In September 2010, a senior Marine Corps commander directed that ground units preparing for Afghanistan deployments complete a 2-day culture course. Army and Marine Corps officials noted that training requirements changed constantly and this led to some confusion in developing training programs as well as considerable time and resources that were spent adjusting training. GAO found that contrary to DOD guidance, U.S. Central Command had not yet established a comprehensive process to approve training requirements and coordinate them with key stakeholders to ensure alignment with DOD guidance and obtain feedback on service training approaches. Without a comprehensive process, U.S. Central Command will not have a mechanism to identify and synchronize training for current and future operations, which may result in deploying forces that receive training that is inconsistent and may not meet operational needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Army and Marine Corps assign responsibilities for program performance, and identify training investments and metrics; DOD establish a defined planning process with internal mechanisms, such as procedures and milestones, to align training efforts; and U.S. Central Command establish a process to identify and synchronize training requirements.

Referring both to the long-term efforts to prepare  military forces for future conflicts and the near-term needs of current  operations, the Department of Defense (DOD) emphasized in the 2010  Quadrennial Defense Review the importance of developing the language  and culture skills of the military and civilian workforce. DOD concluded  that U.S. forces would be able to perform their missions more effectively  with more and better key enabling capabilities, including language  expertise. On the basis of their operational experiences in Afghanistan and  Iraq, ground commanders have expressed the importance of language and  culture skills for general purpose forces in counterinsurgency and stability  operations, stressing, for example, that language training is as important  as marksmanship and other key training. Reinforcing the importance of  language and culture skills, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness issued guidance in December 2010 setting out  DOD policy that training and personnel processes and programs should be  aligned to prepare deploying units, leaders, and staffs with the language  and cultural knowledge and skills, commensurate with their duties,  needed for the successful conduct of counterinsurgency operations. The  Army and Marine Corps have taken a variety of steps to develop language  and culture skills for general purpose forces, including the issuance of  servicewide strategies, and implementing predeployment training  programs to address the needs of current operations.", "Since 2009, we have made recommendations to address a number of  challenges the department faces in developing language and culture skills  in the military. For example, in June 2009, we recommended that DOD  develop a strategic plan that includes measurable performance goals and  objectives and investment priorities and a validated methodology for  identifying language and regional proficiency requirements, which  includes cultural awareness.In June 2010, we testified before the House  Armed Services Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations to provide an update on DOD\u2019s progress in implementing  recommendations from our June 2009 report. At that time, we noted that  DOD had not yet produced a comprehensive strategic plan to synchronize  language and culture transformation efforts and that the department did  not have complete language and culture requirements data needed to  properly assess capability gaps and associated risks. In February 2011,  DOD published the Department of Defense Strategic Plan for Language  Skills, Regional Expertise, and Cultural Capabilities (2011-2016) noting  that a more detailed implementation plan would be issued separately with  elements such as action plans that detail specific tasks to be accomplished  and performance measures.", "The committee report accompanying a proposed bill for the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (H.R. 5136) directed us to  review a number of issues related to language and culture training for the  Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 respective general purpose forces. For this  report, we evaluated (1) the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps  had developed language and culture strategies with key elements, such as  goals, funding priorities, and metrics to guide training approaches and  investments that were aligned with departmentwide planning efforts; and  (2) DOD\u2019s approach for identifying language and culture training  requirements for Army and Marine Corps general purpose forces that will  deploy to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.

Therefore, excluded from this review were  training programs for language and regional experts (e.g., foreign area  officers and intelligence specialists), special operations forces, and service  efforts (e.g., human terrain teams) to provide culture experts to deployed  forces. We examined the Army Culture and Foreign Language Strategy  and the Marine Corps Language, Regional and Culture Strategy: 2011-2015  and training documents to determine training priorities and metrics that  have been used to measure progress in meeting service and DOD  capability needs. We reviewed these documents in the context of our prior  work, DOD budget documents, and service guidance to determine the  extent to which the Army and Marine Corps developed strategies that  identified key elements, such as goals and objectives, training programs  and priorities, resource requirements, and approaches for measuring  progress, including results-oriented performance metrics. We also  reviewed Army and Marine Corps funding data associated with the  implementation of the two services\u2019 respective language and culture  strategies for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. To corroborate our  understanding of the documents provided, we conducted interviews with  officials responsible for developing the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019  respective language and culture strategies and related training programs,  as well as with Office of the Secretary of Defense officials responsible for  providing strategic direction and programmatic oversight of the  department\u2019s language and culture programs.

We reviewed statutory provisions, including certain  sections of Title 10 of the U.S. Code and related DOD guidance that  characterize the training roles and responsibilities of combatant  commanders and the military services. We examined Office of the  Secretary of Defense, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Forces Afghanistan, and  Army and Marine Corps documents published from 2008 to 2011 and  identified specific language and culture training requirements. To  corroborate our understanding of the documents provided, we conducted  interviews with officials representing the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Forces Afghanistan, and Army and  Marine Corps force provider and training commands to discuss the  processes they use to identify language and culture requirements for Army  and Marine Corps general purpose forces that will deploy to the U.S.  Central Command area of responsibility and steps taken to synchronize  service predeployment training so that it addresses operational needs.

Officials with Army and Marine Corps  headquarters and training commands told us that there is not a cohesive  picture of language and culture training investments and that multiple  commands and units have separately developed and funded language and  culture training programs. For example, the Marine Corps\u2019 Center for  Advanced Operational Culture Learning has funded language and culture  training for all marines in the general purpose forces, while operational  units have also funded predeployment language training for these marines  to attend classes at a local community college and university. In addition,  other DOD organizations, such as the Defense Language Office, have  funded language and culture training for Army and Marine Corps general  purpose forces. For example, the Defense Language Office has funded  some language and culture predeployment training for Army and Marine  Corps general purpose forces and also the development of interactive  training tools to enhance the cultural proficiency skills of service  members.

An official from the Marine Corps\u2019 Center for  Advanced Operational Culture Learning told us that the Marine Corps had  not formally assigned it or any other service organization with the  responsibility and accountability for language and culture program  performance. For example, the center is responsible for developing  training programs of instruction and other materials, but not for ensuring  that operational units complete the training programs in total or assessing  training programs in meeting strategic goals and objectives. The Marine  Corps plans to develop a concept of operations document that will  formalize stakeholder roles and responsibilities for implementing its  strategy and conduct additional analyses to identify language and culture  capability needs that are not currently being addressed by current training  programs. However, at the time of our review, these efforts were in the  planning stage and are not yet complete.

In particular, we identified examples  of language and culture predeployment training requirements that varied  even at similar points in time with respect to the specific language to be  trained\u2014whether Dari, Pashto, or both languages, as well as variances in  the type and duration of training. For example, the language designated as  the focus of training varied amongst multiple pieces of guidance issued  since 2009. In November 2009, U.S. Forces Afghanistan issued guidance  recommending that all forces deploying to Afghanistan focus their  predeployment language training on Dari. In that same month, the Marine  Corps issued an administrative message directing that certain  commanders deploying to Afghanistan develop a basic language capability  in Pashto. From November 2009 to March 2011, the Office of the Secretary  of Defense, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Forces Afghanistan, and the Army  and the Marine Corps issued additional guidance addressing language  training, and the language focus has continued to vary among the different  pieces of guidance. For example, in October 2010, U.S. Forces Afghanistan  published an order that required all forces to complete training with a  focus on Dari, and included an option for commanders to specify training  with a focus on Pashto in certain cases. In November 2010, the Secretary  of Defense approved Afghanistan counterinsurgency training standards  that include a requirement that U.S. forces understand basic phrases in  both Dari and Pashto. Additionally, just as the focus of training has varied,  the type and duration of training has varied as well. For example, in July  2010, the Army required that all forces deploying to either Afghanistan or  Iraq complete a 4- to 6-hour online training program for language and  culture. In September 2010, the Marine Corps directed that all ground units  assigned to the I Marine Expeditionary Force preparing for Afghanistan  deployment complete a 2-day culture course and receive an introduction  to software used for self-paced study. During the course of our review,  Army and Marine Corps officials noted that language and culture  predeployment training requirements changed constantly, which led to  some confusion over the training that was needed to meet operational  needs and that considerable time and resources were spent adjusting  training programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Central Command Did Not Clearly Identify and Approve Predeployment Training Requirements and Synchronize Them among and within DOD Components", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD guidance, the Commander of U.S. Central Command is  to coordinate and approve training necessary to carry out missions  assigned to the command. DOD\u2019s 2010 strategic plan calls for the  establishment of a robust, relevant requirements process that includes  investing in front-end analysis and supporting requirements identification  activities and synchronizing service training programs with combatant  commander requirements. Moreover, in 2011 guidance, the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that DOD will convert requirements into  deployable capabilities more quickly and effectively, synchronizing force- providers with force-commander needs.", "At the time of our review, we found that U.S. Central Command had not  yet developed a comprehensive, analytically based process for identifying  and synchronizing predeployment training requirements among DOD  components. In the absence of a comprehensive process, we identified  instances in which U.S. Central Command did not clearly identify and  approve training requirements and coordinate them with key stakeholders,  such as the military services and subordinate commands, to ensure that  requirements are synchronized among and within DOD components and  with departmentwide guidance. We also observed instances in which U.S.  Central Command did not obtain feedback to determine the extent to  which predeployment training approaches met battlefield commander  needs. For example:    U.S. Central Command did not formally approve U.S. Forces  Afghanistan\u2019s January 2010 language training guidance requiring  language training. For example, the command did not conduct front- end analyses of feasibility or cost of the training requirements or  release a message validating U.S. Forces Afghanistan\u2019s language  predeployment training requirements.", "U.S. Central Command, as the combatant commander responsible for  coordinating training requirements for the geographic area of  responsibility, had not coordinated U.S. Forces Afghanistan\u2019s October  2010 order mandating online language and culture training for all U.S.  forces and DOD civilians currently deployed and deploying to  Afghanistan with the Army and Marine Corps prior to its release. U.S.  Forces Afghanistan officials told us that coordination with the services  on the requirements would have provided better insight as to potential  issues associated with its implementation. During the course of our  review, U.S. Forces Afghanistan reissued the October 2010 order once  to clarify confusion over the training requirements and was considering  another revision to the order to further clarify its requirements.", "U.S. Central Command had not synchronized language and culture  predeployment training requirements with departmentwide guidance.  For example, in December 2010, the Office of the Secretary of Defense  released a directive type memorandum on counterinsurgency training  and reporting guidance that requires the services to ensure that at least  one leader per platoon that will have regular contact with the  population will have a measurable language capability in the language  of the region to which they will be assigned. According to senior  officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, this guidance is  based on their understanding of U.S. Forces Afghanistan\u2019s  requirements, a subordinate command of U.S. Central Command, and  is the authoritative department policy on training requirements for  ongoing operations and is considered mandatory training. However,  U.S. Central Command did not explicitly include the requirement  established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense within either of its  March 2011 orders on training requirements for standard and  nonstandard forces.", "U.S. Central Command had not coordinated with the Army and Marine  Corps to obtain feedback on the services\u2019 language and culture  predeployment training approaches in meeting operational needs prior  to issuing new training requirements. For example, until December  2010, neither U.S. Central Command nor U.S. Forces Afghanistan had  obtained feedback from the Marine Corps on language and culture  training approaches that were developed by the Marine Corps to  address service-specific requirements. We were told that informal  efforts exist among DOD components to receive feedback on service  training approaches, such as training forums and action officer-level  communication, but U.S. Forces Afghanistan training officials told us  that these informal processes had not provided them with full visibility  over the services\u2019 training programs.", "In its March 2011 order establishing theater predeployment training  requirements for standard forces, U.S. Central Command consolidated  predeployment training requirements that have been published in various  documents in a single source. Refinements to training requirements  occur over time due to changing operational conditions, and one aspect of  this new order calls for an annual review and validation of U.S. Central  Command\u2019s consolidated training requirements followed by the  publication of an order announcing updates. In addition, the order assigns  responsibilities within U.S. Central Command for approving new  requirements, describes how organizations can request modifications to  existing requirements, and identifies how decisions on training  requirements will be communicated within the command through official  messages. While this appears to be a positive step in identifying  predeployment training requirements, including those for language and  culture, the order does not provide details on the analysis that is required  to support these decisions, a coordination process with key stakeholders,  such as the military services and subordinate commands, to ensure that  requirements are synchronized among and within DOD components and  with departmentwide guidance and to solicit feedback on service training  approaches in meeting operational needs.

Further,  without a clearly defined planning process, the department does not have  the tools it needs to set strategic direction for language and culture  training efforts, fully align departmentwide efforts to develop plans and  budget requests that reflect its priorities, and measure progress in  implementing various initiatives. Regarding predeployment language and  culture training, over the last several years multiple DOD components  have issued requirements for deploying forces, resulting in the Army and  Marine Corps expending considerable time and resources adjusting  service training programs. U.S. Central Command has taken some steps to  consolidate training requirements, but the command has not yet  established a comprehensive, analytically based process for identifying  and synchronizing predeployment training requirements.

DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix II. DOD also  provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as  appropriate.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy to  assign responsibilities for training program performance and include in  subsequent updates of the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 respective language  and culture strategies training priorities and investments that are  necessary to achieve strategic goals and objectives and results-oriented  performance metrics to measure progress in achieving their strategic goals  and objectives. In its comments, DOD separately addressed the two  elements in our recommendation\u2014training priorities and investments, and  results-oriented performance metrics. With regard to identifying training  priorities and investments, DOD stated that linking strategy development  with training and resource prioritization would better identify the  resources that are necessary to address goals, objectives, and programs  outlined in the language, regional, and culture strategy. DOD noted that  this would allow senior leaders to obtain a better understanding of the  time and resources necessary to implement the strategy and may prompt  modifications early in the process when viewed against time and fiscal  realities. DOD also stated, however, that the department develops strategy  and capabilities separately from the resource allocation process to capture  the required operational capability and determine the gaps, independent of  the fiscal environment. It noted that capability requirements are then  prioritized and compete for resources. DOD stated that before definitive  measures are implemented to more closely integrate requirements  development and resource allocation at a much earlier stage, it is  necessary to assess potential negative consequences and then weigh costs  versus benefits. Our report did not address the timing of the requirements  development and resource allocation processes, but rather emphasized the  importance of a clearly defined planning process that produces outcomes  that clearly link strategy development with training prioritization and  resource allocation. As noted in our report, the Army and Marine Corps  had not yet fully defined the language and culture capabilities needs of  their general purpose forces; prioritized the investments required to  implement their respective language and culture strategies; or clearly  linked their funding requests with their respective strategies. We therefore  continue to believe that as the Army and Marine Corps update their  strategies, the services should fully identify the language and culture  capabilities and the training priorities and needed investments in order to  provide DOD and the Congress with a reasonable assurance that their  approaches and funding requests are building a capability that meets  service and DOD long-term needs.", "With regard to results-oriented performance metrics, DOD stated that  several efforts are being pursued to enhance and fully implement metrics  that accurately capture programmatic performance and utility, to include  initiatives to more closely link training and readiness standards with  operational readiness through the Defense Readiness Reporting System  and other reporting mechanisms. DOD noted that any effort to start  measuring and tracking individual performance with \u201chard\u201d metrics such  as cultural proficiency should be thoroughly reviewed before  implementation and that such metrics may not provide an accurate  assessment tied to operational effectiveness. Lastly, DOD stated that the  actual administrative and logistical costs associated with the effort may far  outweigh any benefits that are potentially gained. We agree that it is  important for the Army and Marine Corps to establish metrics that  accurately capture programmatic performance and utility in a manner that  provides an accurate assessment of operational effectiveness. As stated in  our report, the Army and Marine Corps have established limited metrics  focused on individual and unit-level assessments, but had not established  comprehensive metrics that would enable them to assess the contributions  that training programs are making collectively toward achieving their  overall strategic goals and objectives. We also noted that the Army and  Marine Corps are planning to make additional investments to build the  language and culture capabilities of their general purpose forces. We  recognize that there is a cost associated with the time and effort required  to establish metrics and implement efforts to measure progress against  any metrics. However, developing comprehensive metrics is a key element  needed to provide DOD and the Congress with the assurance that the  services\u2019 training approaches and funding requests are building a  capability that meets service and DOD long-term needs. Therefore, we  continue to believe the development of such metrics would better inform  the services\u2019 investment decisions and enhance their ability to maximize  available resources.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to  issue guidance to establish within the implementation plan for the  Department of Defense Strategic Plan of Language Skills, Regional  Expertise, and Cultural Capabilities (2011-2016) a clearly defined planning  process with mechanisms, such as procedures and milestones, by which it  can reach consensus with the military departments, coordinate and review  approval of updates to plans, synchronize the development of plans with  the budget process, monitor the implementation of initiatives, and report  progress, on a periodic basis, towards achieving established goals. DOD  stated that the DOD Implementation Plan for Language Skills, Regional  Expertise, and Cultural Capabilities for FY 2011-2016 will include a clearly  defined planning process for working with the military departments to  coordinate plans, synchronize plans with resources, and evaluate and  report performance as the department works toward its strategic goals.  DOD stated that it planned to complete the implementation plan by June  2011.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Commander of U.S. Central Command to establish a  comprehensive, analytically based process to (1) identify and approve  predeployment training requirements that includes a description of the  analysis to be conducted prior to approving the requirements and (2)  coordinate with key stakeholders, such as the military services and  subordinate commands to ensure that requirements are synchronized  among and within DOD components and with departmentwide guidance,  and solicit feedback on service training approaches in meeting operational  needs. In its comments, DOD separately addressed our recommendation  on conducting analysis as part of the requirements identification process  and coordinating with key stakeholders to ensure that requirements are  synchronized. DOD stated that U.S. Central Command agreed that such a  process was necessary at the time of our review and noted that U.S.  Central Command has established and instituted a process to coordinate  and synchronize requirements among the service components and  subordinate commands, to include cross directorate coordination within  U.S. Central Command headquarters, to ensure all training requirements  are meeting operational needs. Specifically, DOD stated that U.S. Central  Command utilized this process in the development of U.S. Central  Command Fragmentary Order 09-1700, USCENTCOM Theater Training  Requirements, dated March 28, 2011. DOD also stated that U.S. Central  Command assessed it is a service responsibility to determine the training  approach they utilize to meet training requirements for the U.S. Central  Command\u2019s area of responsibility. As stated in our report, we recognize  that DOD has taken positive steps in developing the fragmentary order, but  continue to believe that additional actions are needed to ensure that U.S.  Central Command has a comprehensive, analytically based process to  coordinate and synchronize predeployment training requirements. For  example, in its current form, U.S. Central Command Fragmentary Order  09-1700 order does not provide details on the analysis that is required to  support decisions on the identification of training requirements, despite  the fact that DOD\u2019s September 2010 Strategic Plan for the Next Generation  of Training for the Department of Defense calls for the establishment of a  robust, relevant requirements process that includes investing in front-end  analysis and supporting requirements identification activities. Moreover, in  developing its March 2011 order, U.S. Central Command did not fully  synchronize language and culture predeployment training requirements  with departmentwide guidance. Specifically, U.S. Central Command did  not explicitly include the language training requirement established by the  Office of the Secretary of Defense in December 2010 counterinsurgency  training and reporting guidance that requires the services to ensure that at  least one leader per platoon that will have regular contact with the  population will have a measurable language capability in the language of  the region to which they will be assigned.

To evaluate the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps had  developed language and culture strategies with key elements, such as  goals, funding priorities, and metrics to guide training approaches and  investments that were aligned with departmentwide planning efforts, we  focused on the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 general purpose forces.  Therefore, excluded from this review were training programs for language  and regional experts, such as foreign area officers, intelligence specialists,  special operations forces, and other service efforts to provide culture  experts to deployed forces, such as \u201chuman terrain teams.\u201d We examined  the Army Culture and Foreign Language Strategy and the Marine Corps  Language, Regional and Culture Strategy: 2011-2015 and training  documents to determine training priorities and metrics that have been  used to measure progress in meeting service and departmentwide  capability needs. We reviewed these documents in the context of our  prior work, Department of Defense (DOD) budget documents, and service  guidance to determine the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps  were developing strategies that identified goals and objectives, training  programs and priorities, resource requirements, and approaches for  measuring progress, including results-oriented performance metrics.We  also reviewed funding data for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 provided by  the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command and the Marine Corps\u2019 Center  for the Advanced Operational Culture Learning that are associated with  the implementation of the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019 respective language  and culture strategies.

We  examined Office of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. Central Command, U.S.  Forces Afghanistan, and Army and Marine Corps documents published  from 2008 to 2011 and identified specific language and culture training  requirements. To corroborate our understanding of the documents  provided, we conducted interviews with officials representing the Office  of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Forces  Afghanistan, and Army and Marine Corps force provider and training  commands to discuss the processes they use to identify language and  culture training requirements for ongoing operations in the U.S. Central  Command area of responsibility, including any analyses that were  conducted to identify the feasibility of implementing the training and  associated costs. We also discussed the processes used by DOD  components to synchronize battlefield commander operational needs with  training conducted by the services to prepare forces to conduct military  operations. We analyzed these processes to determine the level of  coordination among DOD components with respect to joint and service- specific predeployment training requirements for language and culture.
