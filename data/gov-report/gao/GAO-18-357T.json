In response to a statutory requirement, the U.S. Department of State (State) said it submitted to Congress a strategy that included working with the Organization of American States (OAS) member states toward ensuring that the OAS would not assess any single member state a contribution amounting to more than 50 percent of all OAS assessed contributions. At the OAS General Assembly in June 2017, OAS member states voted to draft a proposal to modify its system for determining member states' assessed contributions to potentially reduce the maximum assessed contribution to below 50 percent. The other three organizations use OAS's system for setting assessed contributions. Hence, any change in contributions at OAS should also be reflected at Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH).", "State, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provide voluntary contributions to OAS, PAHO, and IICA in the form of assistance agreements (e.g., grants and cooperative agreements). In December 2017, GAO reported that its review of 12 such agreements across the four agencies found that State and USDA did not include all key monitoring provisions in their agreements as called for by applicable guidance. State has since taken corrective action. GAO also found that all four U.S. agencies did not have full documentation of 18 of the 42 monitoring activities required by the 12 assistance agreements GAO reviewed. For example, USDA did not have full documentation, such as financial reports, of any of its 10 required monitoring activities, and USAID did not have full documentation of 2 of its 11 required activities. State and HHS said they initiated corrective action before our review. If an agency does not have full documentation of monitoring activities, it may lack information needed to make appropriate budgetary and programmatic decisions.", "GAO found that the strategic goals of the OAS, PAHO, IICA, and PAIGH are predominantly aligned with the strategic goals of State, USAID, HHS, and USDA.

These organizations include the Organization  of American States (OAS), the Pan American Health Organization  (PAHO), the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture  (IICA), and the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History  (PAIGH). The United States uses its membership in these organizations  to promote U.S. interests in the Western Hemisphere. According to the  Department of State (State), the OAS is the premier multilateral forum in  the Western Hemisphere for regional dispute resolution and promotion of  democratic governance.

To assess U.S. agencies\u2019  oversight of assistance agreements, we identified 60 active assistance  agreements that these agencies awarded to OAS, PAHO, and IICA  during calendar years 2014 through 2016 and selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 12 agreements, three each from HHS, State,  USAID, and USDA. We selected the three agreements from each agency  based on the lowest, median, and highest dollar value. We assessed  whether the agencies\u2019 agreements included key monitoring provisions  implementing applicable agency guidance. We identified key monitoring  provisions agencies are to include as part of their agreements as  provisions that ensure oversight of the use of funds by requiring  monitoring activities, such as financial and progress reports.
