Since then, important progress has been made. However, retirements and the potential loss of leadership and institutional knowledge, coupled with fiscal pressures, underscore the importance of a strategic and efficient approach to acquiring and retaining individuals with needed critical skills. As a result, strategic human capital management remains a high-risk area.", "This testimony is based on a large body of GAO work issued from January 2014 through February 2015; and ongoing work related to employee engagement. This testimony, among other things, focuses on key human capital areas where some actions have been taken but attention is still needed by OPM and federal agencies on issues such as: (1) the GS classification system; (2) mission-critical skills gaps; (3) performance management; and (4) employee engagement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Serious human capital shortfalls can erode the capacity of federal agencies and threaten their ability to cost-effectively carry out their missions.

Key areas where the federal government has taken some actions but additional attention is still needed include the following:", "General Schedule (GS) Classification System: In 2014, GAO identified eight key attributes of a modern, effective classification system, such as, flexibility, transparency, and simplicity. The GS system's design reflects some of these eight attributes, but when the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) implemented the system, the attributes of transparency, internal equity, simplicity, flexibility, and adaptability were reduced. This occurred, in part, because some attributes are at odds with others so fully achieving one comes at the expense of another. GAO recommended and OPM partially concurred with the need to examine ways to make the GS system consistent with the eight attributes of an effective classification system.", "Mission-Critical Skills Gaps: The challenges that agencies face were not fully captured by the Chief Human Capital Officers Council Working Group's efforts that identified skills gaps in six government-wide, mission-critical occupations. In 2015, GAO identified skills gaps in nearly two dozen occupations with significant program implementation impacts. As a result, GAO recommended OPM take a number of steps to address this issue. OPM concurred and in response has established an interagency working group, which is expected to identify a new set of government-wide skills gaps by June 2015.", "Improving Performance Management: OPM makes a range of tools and guidance available to help agencies address poor performance. In 2015, GAO concluded that improved supervision and better use of probationary periods are needed to address substandard employee performance. In response, OPM agreed to consult with stakeholders regarding the need for longer probationary periods for some complex positions. In 2015, GAO also found that OPM needed to do more to ensure meaningful distinctions are made in senior executive ratings and performance awards. OPM disagreed with the recommendation. GAO maintains that additional action should be considered to ensure equity in ratings and performance awards across departments.", "Strengthening Employee Engagement: GAO's ongoing work indicates that the recent government-wide decline in engagement, as measured by OPM's Employee Engagement Index, masks the fact that the majority of agencies either have sustained or increased their employee engagement levels. Government-wide, engagement has declined 4 percentage points from an estimated 67 percent in 2011 to an estimated 63 percent in 2014. However, this decline is primarily attributable to 13 agencies where employee engagement declined from 2013 to 2014. In contrast, 31 of 47 agencies have sustained and 3 agencies have increased their employee engagement levels from 2013 to 2014."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, GAO has made numerous recommendations to agencies and OPM to improve their strategic human capital management efforts.

As we have long reported, strategic human capital  management plays a critical role in maximizing the government\u2019s  performance and assuring its accountability to Congress and to the nation  as a whole. However, the federal government is facing workforce-related  challenges that could affect the ability of agencies to cost-effectively carry  out their missions. These challenges include a retirement wave that could  cause a loss of leadership and institutional knowledge at all levels. In the  current economic situation, projections of how many federal workers will  actually retire upon becoming eligible remain unclear. However, when  these workers do retire, the federal government needs to have the right  people in the right jobs at the right time to meet the challenges it faces.  Other challenges include filling mission-critical skills gaps, improving  performance management, and strengthening employee engagement  during difficult times.", "Strategic human capital management has been one of our high-risk areas  since 2001. Since then, Congress, the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM), and some individual agencies have taken a number of actions  toward addressing the government\u2019s human capital challenges. For  example, in 2002, Congress created the chief human capital officer  (CHCO) position in 24 agencies to advise and assist the heads of the  agencies with human capital efforts. The same law created the CHCO  Council to advise and coordinate the human capital activities of member  agencies. Congress has also provided agencies\u2014individually and across  the federal government\u2014with various authorities and flexibilities to  manage the federal workforce and make the federal government a more  attractive employer. Further, congressional hearings that have focused on  federal human capital management challenges have been important for  ensuring that OPM and agencies continue to make progress in acquiring,  developing, and retaining employees with the skills needed to carry out  the government\u2019s vital work. Continued congressional attention to  improving the government\u2019s human capital policies and procedures will be  essential to further progress in this area.", "While many actions to further progress have been taken in the last few  years, ample opportunities continue to exist for agencies to improve their  strategic human capital management, and for OPM to continue its  leadership in these areas. For example, we reported in February 2015  that strategic human capital management remains high risk because  more work is needed to address government-wide, mission-critical skills  gaps. A direct link between personnel management and organizational  performance can be seen in a number of our studies that identified  operational and other problems at various federal agencies. These  problems include wait times at Department of Veterans Affairs medical  facilities; management of oil and gas operations by the Department of the  Interior; information technology management at the Social Security  Administration; rail safety inspections by the Federal Railroad  Administration; and acquisition management at the Departments of  Defense and Homeland Security. All of these examples share a common  problem: a breakdown of one or more human capital activities, such as  robust workforce planning or performance management.", "To address these and similar challenges, federal agencies will need to  change their cultures and create the institutional capacity to become high- performing organizations. This includes recruiting and retaining  employees able to create, sustain, and thrive in organizations that are  flatter, results-oriented, and externally focused, and that collaborate with  other government entities as well as with the private and nonprofit sectors  to achieve desired outcomes. As federal agencies seek to improve their  operations within budget constraints and to compete for talent with the  private sector, federal agencies will need to focus attention on  management practices that both increase the level of employee  engagement, and also enable managers to make meaningful distinctions  in performance to reward top performers and deal with poor performers.", "My remarks today will focus on describing recent trends in federal civilian  employment and also on some of the key strategic human capital  management issues facing executive branch agencies and OPM. These  issues include: (1) improving management and oversight of the federal  classification system, (2) closing mission-critical skills gaps, (3)  developing strategies to help agencies meet their missions in an era of  highly constrained resources, (4) improving performance management,  and (5) strengthening employee engagement during challenging times.

The GS system, which is administered  by OPM and includes a standardized set of 420 occupations, grouped in  23 occupational families and 15 statutorily-defined grade levels,  influences other human capital practices such as training, since training  opportunities link position competencies with the employee\u2019s  performance. In 2013, the GS system covered about 80 percent of the  civilian white-collar workforce (about 1.6 million employees).", "The GS system was designed to uphold the key merit system principle of  equal pay for work of substantially equal value and other important goals.  However, some OPM reports and several public policy groups have  questioned the GS system\u2019s ability to meet agencies\u2019 needs for flexible  talent management tools that enable them to align employees with  mission requirements. For example, in 2002, OPM outlined the  advantages and disadvantages of the GS classification system and  concluded that agencies should be allowed to tailor their pay practices to  better recruit, manage, and retain employees to accomplish their  mission. In 2014, the Partnership for Public Service reported that by  treating all occupations equally and linking them to the current pay scales,  the GS system is unable to distinguish between meaningful differences in  complexity and skill across occupations. Also, as federal agencies have  taken on additional roles and responsibilities, their missions have become  increasingly complex, and their employees need to possess a range of  expertise and skills that may not be adequately captured by the GS  system.", "We reported in July 2014 on the attributes of a modern, effective  classification system and the extent to which the current GS system  balances those attributes. Our analysis of subject matter specialists\u2019s  comments, related literature, and interviews with OPM officials identified a  number of important characteristics for a modern, effective classification  system, which we consolidated in eight key attributes (see table 1).", "In 2014 we found that, in concept, the current GS classification system\u2019s  design incorporates several key attributes including internal and external  equity, transparency, simplicity, and rank in position. However, as OPM  implemented the system, the attributes of transparency, internal equity,  simplicity, flexibility, and adaptability were reduced. This occurred, in part,  because some attributes are at odds with one another. So, fully achieving  one attribute comes at the expense of another. Thus, OPM, working with  its stakeholders, is challenged to determine how best to optimize each  attribute.", "We also reported that the GS system\u2019s standardized set of 420  occupations incorporates several key attributes, but falls short in  implementation. For example, the occupational standard for an  information technology specialist clearly describes the routine duties,  tasks, and experience required for the position. This kind of information is  published for the 420 occupations so all agencies are using the same,  consistent standards when classifying positions\u2014embodying the  attributes of transparency and internal equity. However, in  implementation, having numerous, narrowly defined occupational  standards inhibits the system\u2019s ability to optimize these attributes.  Specifically, classifying occupations and developing position descriptions  in the GS system requires officials to maintain an understanding of the  individual position and the nuances between similar occupations. We  concluded that without this understanding, the transparency and internal  equity of the system may be inhibited as agency officials may not be  classifying positions consistently, comparable employees may not be  treated equitably, and the system may seem unpredictable.", "We believe that, going forward, these eight attributes of a more modern,  effective classification system can help provide criteria for policymakers  and other stakeholders to use in determining whether refinements to the  current GS system or wholesale reforms are needed. In our July 2014  report, we recommended that OPM, working through the Chief Human  Capital Officer (CHCO) Council and in conjunction with key stakeholders  such as the Office of Management and Budget, unions, and others,  examine ways to make the GS system\u2019s design and implementation more  consistent with the attributes of a modern, effective classification  system. OPM partially concurred with our recommendation to work with  key stakeholders to use prior studies and lessons learned to examine  ways to make the GS system more consistent with the attributes of a  modern, effective classification system. But it also noted several efforts to  assist agencies with classification issues, including its interagency  classification policy forum and partnering with agencies to address  challenges related to specific occupational areas. While these examples  of assisting agencies to better implement the GS system on a case-by- case basis are helpful, they do not fully address the fundamental  challenges facing the GS system, which we and others have said is not  meeting the needs of federal agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OPM Has Not Conducted Oversight of Agency Classification Programs", "paragraphs": ["In 2014, we also reported that OPM is responsible for establishing new\u2014 and revising existing\u2014occupational standards after consulting with  agencies. From 2003 to 2014, OPM revised almost 20 percent of the  occupational standards and established 14 new ones. However, there  was no published review or update of 124 occupations since 1990. OPM  officials said they first review occupations identified in presidential  memorandums as needing review; however, they do not systemically  track and prioritize the remaining occupational standards for review.  Therefore, we concluded that OPM had limited assurance that it is  updating the highest priority occupations.", "OPM is required by law to oversee agencies\u2019 implementation of the GS  system. However, OPM officials said OPM has not reviewed any  agency\u2019s classification program since the 1980s because OPM leadership  at the time concluded that the reviews were ineffective and time  consuming. As a result, we also concluded that OPM has limited  assurance that agencies are correctly classifying positions according to  standards.", "In 2014, we determined that, going forward, OPM could improve its  management and oversight of the GS system, and like all agencies, must  consider cost-effective ways to fulfill its responsibilities in an era of  constrained resources. Using a more strategic approach to track and  prioritize reviews of occupational standards\u2014that perhaps better reflects  evolving occupations\u2014could help OPM better meet agencies\u2019s needs and  the changing nature of government work. We therefore recommended  that OPM develop a strategy to systematically track and prioritize updates  to occupational standards. However, OPM did not concur with our  recommendation and noted that occupational standards are updated in  response to a systematic, prioritized process informed by working with  agencies and other stakeholders and analysis of occupational trends.  OPM officials were unable to provide us with the documentation of such  efforts. As we noted in our 2014 report, OPM had not published a review  or update of roughly 30 percent of the total number of occupations on the  GS system since 1990. Further, OPM officials could not provide the near-  or long-term prioritization of occupations scheduled for review. As a  result, we concluded that OPM cannot demonstrate whether it is keeping  pace with agencies\u2019 needs nor does it have reasonable assurance that it  is fulfilling its responsibilities to establish new or revise existing  occupational standards based on the highest priorities.

Additionally, agencies and OPM need to make better  use of workforce analytics which can be used to predict newly emerging  skills gaps. An important government-wide effort we identified in this  area was the CHCO Council\u2019s Working Group (Working Group). The  Working Group has identified skills gaps in six government-wide, mission- critical occupations: cybersecurity specialist, auditor, human resources  specialist, contract specialist, economist, and the science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. Although this effort  was an important step forward, our 2015 work identified skills gaps in  nearly two dozen occupations with significant programmatic impact. We  also determined that the Working Group did not develop a more  comprehensive list because of various methodological shortcomings.  Going forward, we concluded that OPM and the CHCO Council will need  to use lessons learned to inform a new round of work expected in this  year. Specifically, the Working Group\u2019s experience underscored the  importance of (1) using a robust, data-driven approach to identify  potential mission-critical occupations early in the process; (2) prioritizing  occupations using criteria that consider programmatic impact; and (3)  consulting with subject matter experts and other stakeholders prior to  identifying mission-critical occupations.", "Our January 2015 report also noted that, to make further progress on this  issue, the federal government needs to build a predictive capacity for  identifying emerging mission-critical skills gaps. Realizing this, OPM has  established an interagency working group known as the Federal Agency  Skills Team (FAST), which is composed of agency officials with workforce  planning and data analysis skills. OPM has tasked the group with  implementing a standard and repeatable methodology for identifying and  addressing government-wide skills gaps, as well as mission-critical  competencies, over a 4-year cycle. OPM officials said that, in its first year,  FAST intends to meet regularly until it identifies a new set of government- wide skills gaps. OPM officials expect this to occur by June 2015.", "Because we identified a number of shortcomings in the implementation of  FAST, our January 2015 report recommended that the Director of OPM,  in conjunction with the CHCO Council, take the following actions:", "Assist FAST in developing goals for closing skills gaps with targets  that are both clear and measurable.", "Work with FAST to design outcome-oriented performance metrics that  align with overall targets for closing skills gaps and link to the activities  for addressing skills gaps.

However, not all actions will be  implemented through FAST but instead will rely on subject matter experts  from across the federal workforce. In the same report, we recommended  that the Director of OPM work with agency CHCOs to bolster the ability of  agencies to assess workforce competencies by sharing competency  surveys, lessons learned, and other tools and resources. These actions  will help ensure that OPM builds the predictive capacity to identify  emerging skills gaps across the government\u2014including the ability to  collect and use reliable information on the competencies of the federal  workforce for government-wide workforce analysis. OPM also agreed with  this recommendation.", "Finally, in January 2015 we also reported on OPM\u2019s efforts to assist in  addressing skills gaps at the agency level. OPM created HRstat, a  process of holding regularly scheduled, data-driven review meetings led  by an agency\u2019s CHCO to review performance metrics for driving progress  on the agency\u2019s human capital management priorities and goals, such as  closing mission-critical skills gaps. OPM launched HRstat as a 3-year  pilot program in May 2012, with an initial group of eight agencies.  However, our work determined that OPM should take a greater leadership  role in helping agencies include a core set of metrics in their HRstat  reviews so that OPM and agency leaders can have a clear view of  progress made closing skills gaps. While it is important for agencies to  have ownership over their HRstat reviews, OPM should also maximize its  opportunity to use HRstat to gain greater visibility over the federal  workforce.

Given the critical role that supervisors play in  performance management, it is important for agencies to identify,  promote and continue to develop effective supervisors.", "Probationary periods for new employees provide supervisors with an  opportunity to evaluate an individual\u2019s performance to determine if an  appointment to the civil service should become final. However, CHCOs  we interviewed told us supervisors often do not use this time to make  decisions about an employee\u2019s performance because they may not know  that the probationary period is ending or they have not had time to  observe performance in all critical areas. We agree with OPM that  notifying supervisors that a probationary period is coming to an end is an  agency\u2019s responsibility. However, we maintain that more could be done to  educate agencies on the benefits of using automated notifications to  notify supervisors that an individual\u2019s probationary period is ending and  that the supervisor needs to make an affirmative decision or otherwise  take appropriate action. OPM also needs to determine whether  occupations exist in which\u2014because of the nature of work and  complexity\u2014the probationary period should extend beyond 1-year and, if  so, take appropriate actions which may include developing legislative  proposals for congressional consideration. OPM agreed to consult with  stakeholders to determine whether longer probationary periods are  needed for certain complex positions.", "In our February 2015 report, we noted that OPM provides guidance, tools,  and training to help agencies attain human capital management goals  that meet its strategic goal of enhancing the integrity of the federal  workforce. In addition to its regulations, OPM makes a range of different  tools and guidance available to help agencies address poor performance  through multiple formats, including through its website, webinars,  webcasts, in-person training, guidebooks, and through one-on-one  assistance and consultation with agencies, according to OPM officials.  We identified in our report promising practices that some agencies  employ to more effectively ensure that that they have a well-qualified  cadre of supervisors capable of effectively addressing poor performance.  The practices include: extending the employee\u2019s supervisory probationary period beyond 1  year to include at least one full employee appraisal cycle; providing temporary duty opportunities outside the agency or  rotational assignments to supervisory candidates prior to promotion,  where the candidate can develop and demonstrate supervisory  competencies; and using a dual career ladder structure as a way to advance employees  who may have particular technical skills or education but who are not  interested in or inclined to pursue a management or supervisory track.", "We recommended that OPM determine if these practices should be more  widely used government-wide. OPM partially concurred with our  recommendation, noting that agencies already have authority to take  these actions. We acknowledged OPM\u2019s point, but maintain that OPM  can still take a leadership role and encourage agencies to take these  steps. Also in our February 2015 report, we found that OPM, in  conjunction with the CHCO Council and other key stakeholders, needs to  assess the adequacy of leadership training that agencies provide to  supervisors to help ensure supervisors obtain the skills needed to  effectively conduct performance management responsibilities.

OPM stressed that a  major improvement of the system included dealing with the wide disparity  in distribution of ratings by agency through the provision of clear,  descriptive performance standards and rating score ranges that establish  mid-level ratings as the norm and top-level ratings as truly exceptional.", "In our January 2015 report, we found that more than 85 percent of career  Chief Financial Officers Act agency SES were rated in the top two of five  categories for fiscal years 2010 through 2013, and career SES received  approximately $42 million in awards for fiscal year 2013. In a closer  examination of five departments (Departments of Defense, Energy,  Health and Human Services, Justice, and Treasury) for fiscal year 2013,  we found that, similar to the government-wide results, these five  departments rated SES primarily in the top two categories. In addition,  four of five departments awarded the same or higher performance awards  to some SES with lower ratings.", "Effective performance management systems recognize that merit-based  pay increases should make meaningful distinctions in relative  performance. This principle is central to the SES performance  management system, where under the law, to be certified and thereby  able to access the higher levels of pay, the appraisal system must make  meaningful distinctions based on relative performance. OPM certification  guidelines state that the SES modal rating\u2014the rating level assigned  most frequently among the actual ratings\u2014should be below \u201coutstanding\u201d  and that multiple rating levels should be used. However, OPM\u2019s  guidelines also state that if an agency\u2019s modal rating level is  \u201coutstanding,\u201d the appraisal system can still be certified if accompanied  with a full, acceptable justification. Nonetheless, the continued  concentration of senior executives at the top two rating levels indicates  that meaningful distinctions in SES performance may not be being made  across government. OPM plans to convene a cross-agency working  group in 2015 to revisit the SES certification process.", "In our January 2015 report, we recommended that the Director of OPM  consider various refinements to better ensure the SES performance  appraisal system certification guidelines promote making meaningful  distinctions in performance without using a forced distribution.

Rather, they take pride in their work, are passionate about what  they do, and are committed to the organization, the mission, and their job.  They are also more likely to put forth extra effort to get the job done.", "Put another way, if a talented workforce is the engine of productivity and  mission accomplishment, then a workplace that fosters high levels of  employee engagement helps fuel that engine.

The decline is the result of several large  agencies bringing down the government-wide average. Our preliminary  work indicates that 13 of 47 agencies saw a statistically significant decline  in their EEIs from 2013 to 2014. While this is only 28 percent of agencies,  nearly 69 percent of federal employees are at one of those agencies,  including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Veterans  Affairs. Meanwhile, the majority of agencies sustained or improved  engagement.

There is room for improvement with all federal agencies.  Yet, the large number of agencies that sustained or increased their levels  of employee engagement during challenging times suggests that  agencies can influence employee engagement levels in the face of  difficult external circumstances. For example, the Federal Trade  Commission maintained a consistent estimate of 75 percent engagement  index score\u2014well above the government-wide average\u2014throughout the  period of general decline.", "In conclusion, strategic human capital management must be the  centerpiece of any serious effort to ensure federal agencies operate as  high-performing organizations. A high-quality federal workforce is  especially critical now given the complex and cross-cutting issues facing  the nation.
