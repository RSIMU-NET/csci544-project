DHS administers the program with support from other federal agencies including DOL. In recent years, demand for H-2B visas has exceeded the cap. To meet the needs of U.S. businesses, Congress authorized additional visas in fiscal years 2017-2019. GAO was asked to examine the effects of the annual cap on employers and U.S. workers.", "This report examines, among other objectives: (1) trends in the demand for H-2B visa workers, (2) selected employers' reports of the visa cap's influence on their performance and employment of U.S. workers, and (3) how federal agencies have sought to meet employers' H-2B hiring needs and protect U.S. workers. GAO analyzed nationwide data on H-2B visas and county labor market indicators. GAO interviewed 35 H-2B employers in four industries that are among the largest users of H-2B visas. The employers were in five counties selected for variation in factors including the share of H-2B workers in the workforce and the unemployment rate. GAO also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and documents and interviewed federal officials and stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Employer demand for H-2B visa workers has increased as the national unemployment rate has declined. H-2B visas are intended to help employers fill temporary, non-agricultural positions when no U.S. workers are available and are subject to an annual statutory cap of 66,000. From 2010 to 2018, the number of H-2B workers requested on employer applications increased from about 86,600 to 147,600. Regarding local economic conditions, GAO found that counties with H-2B employers generally had lower unemployment rates and higher weekly wages than those without H-2B employers.", "Most of the 35 H-2B employers GAO interviewed said that business planning was affected by uncertainty about whether they would be able to hire the number of H-2B visa workers they requested given the statutory cap. Employers who did not receive all H-2B visas requested under the statutory cap in 2018 were somewhat more likely than those who did to report declines in revenue (see figure) and purchases of goods and services. However, GAO found no clear pattern in changes to the number of U.S. workers hired by these employers. Employers interviewed by GAO varied in how they adjusted to having fewer H-2B workers. For example, two seafood employers reported shutting down operations in the absence of H-2B workers, and employers said that barriers to finding U.S. workers included remote location and seasonality of the work.", "Federal agencies have identified program changes that consider employers' hiring needs and protect U.S. workers, but gaps remain in implementation. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the Department of Labor (DOL), has identified options for changing the H-2B visa allocation process to address employers' uncertainty aboutreceiving visas. However, DHS and DOL have not assessed any of these options or determined which would not require Congressional action, and employers continue to struggle with uncertainty. To help ensure H-2B employers comply with U.S. worker recruitment and other requirements, DOL has audited employers' compliance with these requirements. However, in general, DOL randomly selected employers for these audits, rather than taking a risk-based approach using factors such as violation trends by industry. As a result, the agency may not be using its limited audit resources efficiently or effectively."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations. These include that DHS and DOL assess options to adjust the H-2B visa program and DOL take a risk-based approach to selecting H-2B employers for audits.

As part of the  H-2B visa application process, the Department of Labor (DOL) screens  employers\u2019 applications for temporary labor certification (TLC) to  determine whether there are sufficient U.S. workers who are qualified and  available to perform the temporary services or labor for which the  employer seeks to hire foreign workers, and whether hiring foreign  workers will adversely affect the wages and working conditions of  similarly employed U.S. workers.

In each of the last three fiscal years (2017, 2018,  and 2019), DHS has been authorized to make additional H-2B visas  available. Nonetheless, business groups and some members of  Congress have raised questions about whether employers whose visa  petitions are rejected due to the cap may suffer financial consequences.  Further, it is possible that demand for visas will continue to grow,  especially as the U.S. labor force is expected to grow at an annual rate of  0.5 percent over the next several years\u2014a lower rate than in previous  decades. Meanwhile, different perspectives have emerged concerning  the possible impact of the H-2B visa program on U.S. workers. For  example, one view is that each H-2B worker supports multiple jobs for  U.S. workers, potentially because employers use H-2Bs for hard-to-fill  jobs that are critical for business expansion. In contrast, another  perspective is that little evidence of widespread labor shortages in the  occupations that most commonly employ H-2B workers, and that  employers may be able to fill jobs with U.S. workers if they broaden their  search efforts or offer better wages.", "You asked us to examine the effects of the H-2B visa statutory cap on  employers and U.S. workers.

We  assessed the reliability of the data through review of documentation,  interviews, and electronic testing, and found the relevant data fields to be  sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes. To address our second  objective, we conducted case studies of four industries in specific  counties: construction in Maricopa County, Arizona; hospitality in  Mackinac County, Michigan (hotels), and Barnstable County,  Massachusetts (restaurants); landscaping in Dallas County, Texas; and  seafood processing in Dorchester County, Maryland. We selected  industries that were among those that applied, and were approved, for the  most H-2B visas in fiscal year 2018, and selected counties representing  variation in factors including the number of H-2B workers in the specific  industry, the proportion of H-2B workers to the county labor force, and  county unemployment rate. Across all case studies, we interviewed 35  H-2B employers who either did or did not receive visas in fiscal year  2018, who we identified with the help of industry groups; representatives  of 12 companies that supply the businesses of H-2B employers; and  officials in four state workforce agencies. The results of these interviews  are not generalizable to the overall populations of employers and state  agencies. We also distributed questionnaires to the 35 H-2B employers  and received responses from 30. To address our third objective, we  identified proposals for changing the H-2B program from interviews with  knowledgeable stakeholders and publications by these stakeholders. We  held two discussion groups and two interviews with 12 knowledgeable  stakeholders representing diverse perspectives to obtain their views on  the potential effects of each proposal we identified. To address our  fourth objective, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and other  documents related to DHS\u2019s and DOL\u2019s administration of the H-2B  program; reviewed agency administrative data that we determined were  sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes; and interviewed federal  officials.

Generally, U.S. employers may apply for H-2B  visas when they can establish that (1) their need for an H-2B worker\u2019s  labor is temporary, meaning a one-time occurrence, a seasonal need, a  peak load need, or an intermittent need; (2) qualified U.S. workers are  unavailable to perform the work; and (3) the employment of an H-2B  worker will not adversely affect the wages or working conditions of  similarly-employed U.S. workers. Generally, an H-2B worker\u2019s  authorized stay per the TLC will be no more than 10 months.

In fiscal years 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2016,  Congress amended the INA to include a provision that established a  returning worker exemption.

In each of the  three years, federal law authorized DHS after consultation with DOL to  provide additional H-2B visas beyond the standard cap if the needs of  U.S. businesses could not be met with U.S. workers, up to the maximum  number of H-2B returning workers in any prior year when the returning  worker exemption was in effect (about 65,000 in 2007, according to the  agencies). DHS made up to 15,000 additional visas available in fiscal  years 2017 and 2018 and up to 30,000 in 2019. In each year, DHS in  consultation with DOL determined the appropriate number of additional  visas by looking at demand for visas in prior years. Specifically, in 2017 it  determined that 15,000 visas would be sufficient to at least meet the  same level of demand as in fiscal year 2016. In 2018, DHS used the  same rationale to determine that up to 15,000 additional visas would  again be sufficient, based on experience with the additional visas in  2017. Most recently, in 2019, DHS in consultation with DOL raised the  number of additional visas to 30,000 in recognition partly of the higher  demand in 2018\u2014when employers filed petitions for about 29,000 visas  during the first five days of the filing period for additional visas.

Indeed, the outcome in 2018,  when DHS made 15,000 additional visas available but employers applied  for almost 30,000 visas, demonstrates the potential limitations of relying  solely on past demand as a predictor of future demand. Examples of  other types of data that may be relevant to gauging trends in employer  demand include unemployment rate, employment, and earnings, which  we have previously identified as potential indicators of labor market  shortages. Some stakeholders have also suggested that the number of  H-2B workers on approved TLC applications is a good measure of visa  demand. The agencies said in the 2018 and 2019 temporary rules making  additional visas available that they did not have enough time remaining in  those fiscal years to conduct a more formal analysis of the adverse  effects on U.S. workers that may result from a broader cap  increase.Assessing the advantages and disadvantages of considering  current economic trends in addition to past demand would help the agencies decide if such an approach would be a better way to estimate  employer need in any future years when Congress authorizes visas  beyond the H-2B standard cap.", "According to DHS and DOL, the agencies have also sought to balance  employers\u2019 hiring needs and the interests of U.S. workers by setting a  higher standard that employers must meet to qualify for additional H-2B  visas. To qualify for visas under the standard cap, employers must have  an approved TLC, demonstrating, among other things, that they have a  temporary need for labor and have taken steps to recruit workers in the  United States. From 2017 to 2019, employers applying for the additional  visas were also required to attest that without the visas, they were likely  to suffer irreparable harm, i.e., suffer a severe and permanent financial  loss.  According to the 2017 temporary rule announcing the availability  of additional H-2B visas above the statutory cap, DHS decided to focus  on businesses likely to suffer a severe and permanent financial loss, in  part, to be responsive to some stakeholders that U.S. workers could  potentially be adversely affected by a general cap increase applicable to  all potential employers.  To support their attestation of severe and  permanent financial loss, employers were required to retain  documentation, such as contracts, reservations, or orders that would  have to be cancelled absent the requested H-2B workers.

The agency also expressed  its view that Congress is better positioned to determine whether and how  many additional visas should be made available to meet the needs of  U.S. businesses.", "In fiscal years 2017 through 2020, DHS was authorized to increase the  number of H-2B visas beyond the statutory cap, after consulting with DOL  to determine that \u201cthe needs of American businesses  be  satisfied\u2026with United States workers...\u201d  In exercising this authority in  prior years, DHS stated that \u201che scope of the assessment called for by  the statute  is quite broad, and accordingly  delegates the Secretary of Homeland Security broad discretion to identify  the business needs he finds most relevant.\u201d  In light of DHS\u2019s broad  view of its authority, we continue to believe that it would be appropriate  for DHS, in consultation with DOL, to assess the advantages and  disadvantages of considering current economic trends in determining the  appropriate number of additional H-2B visas to provide. If they determine  that using such data would be warranted, the agencies would then be well  positioned to implement such an approach if DHS is granted such  authority in the future. Moreover, if\u2014as DHS stated in its response to our  recommendation\u2014the agency believes that Congress is best suited to  determine what increases in visa numbers may be needed to meet the  needs of U.S. businesses, consistent with protecting American workers, it  may wish to work with Congress to draft a legislative proposal reflecting  this view.", "DOL agreed with the three recommendations addressed to it. Regarding  our second recommendation to work with DHS to assess options for  changing the H-2B visa program, DOL said it is prepared to work with  DHS to consider options for changing the H-2B program and to provide  any technical assistance that Congress may need on this issue.  Regarding our fourth recommendation, DOL said it is prepared to draw on  its data on labor market and economic trends to provide technical  assistance to DHS on the determination of how many additional H-2B  visas to make available. Regarding our fifth recommendation, DOL noted  that while further development of a system for tracking industry and  occupational trends in H-2B employer violations is currently on hold due  to budgetary constraints, when this system is available it will provide the  capacity to take a risk-based approach to selecting employers for audits.", "We are sending copies of this report to applicable Congressional  committees, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Labor,  and other interested parties.

The CLAIMS3  data track all petitions for H-2B visas (as well as other visas). These data  include employer address and number of H-2B visas approved.

After identifying the counties with H-2B employers, we then combined this  with BLS data sets\u2014Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) and  Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)\u2014which we found  sufficiently reliable after reviewing technical documentation to get county- level data on unemployment rate, labor force, and average weekly wages  to make county-level comparisons. The LAUS is a federal-state  cooperative effort in which monthly estimates of total employment and  unemployment are prepared for counties and county-equivalents. From  this data set, we used the unemployment rate and the labor force  statistics by county. The QCEW program publishes a quarterly count of  employment and wages reported by employers. From this data set, we  used the average weekly wages data across counties for fiscal years  2015 through 2018. After we had combined the CLAIMS3 data with the  LAUS and QCEW data sets, we compared summary statistics on  unemployment rates and average weekly wages for counties with H-2B  employers to counties without H-2B employers. The average weekly  wages were inflation adjusted at the state level to constant 2018 dollars.", "To check whether our results of the comparison were being driven by a  few outlying counties, we performed several additional analyses. To see if  the results were being driven by counties that relied more heavily on H-2B  visas, we created quartiles using the number of H-2B petitions approved  within a county and also created quartiles using the percentage of H-2B  visas as a percent of the total labor force. Next, in order to determine if  the results were because of the population sizes of the counties, we spilt  the counties in quartiles based on the size of labor force to compare  counties with and without H-2B employers by similar sized counties by  population.

(See fig. 16).", "We selected these industries because they were among the heaviest  users of the H-2B program in fiscal year 2018. Using DOL data on fiscal  year 2018 TLCs, we determined the total number of H-2B workers  approved across all TLCs associated with each NAICS code, and then  identified the NAICS codes with the greatest number of approved  workers. The four selected industries were all among the ten leading  industries in terms of number of approved workers (see table 3).  Amusement, gambling, and recreation industries and support activities for  forestry were also among the top ten. However, representatives of these  industries told us that employers typically move from location to location  during their seasons, making it difficult to conduct a case study of  employers in a particular location.", "For each industry, we selected one or two counties in which to conduct  our case study. We selected these counties to achieve diversity in  several factors: the total number of H-2B workers approved for employers  in the county in fiscal year 2018; the number of H-2B workers approved  under TLCs associated with that particular industry in the county in fiscal  year 2018 (e.g., the number of H-2B landscaping or hospitality workers);  the proportion of all workers in the county who are H-2B workers in 2018;  the proportion of workers in that particular industry that are H-2B workers  in the county in 2018 (e.g., the proportion of all landscaping workers in  the county that are H-2B workers); county unemployment rate in January  2018; and geographic location (see table 4).", "As part of each case study, we interviewed H-2B employers who received  visas during fiscal year 2018, H-2B employers who did not receive visas  during fiscal year 2018, and businesses who supply goods or services to  H-2B employers. Across the case studies, we interviewed 15 H-2B  employers who received visas, 20 H-2B employers who did not receive  visas, and 12 supplier businesses. We conducted a mix of individual and  group interviews with employers, and generally used the same questions  for each category of employers across industries. For all of our case  studies, we worked with industry groups to recruit employers to  participate in our interviews. These industry groups reached out to local  employers to identify H-2B employers and in some cases also supplier  businesses who would be willing to speak with us. In a few cases, we  also identified supplier businesses for interviews through our case study  interviews with employers. In our interviews with employers, we asked  about topics including their efforts to recruit U.S. workers, their  experiences with the H-2B program in recent years, any impacts on their  businesses of being denied H-2B visas, actions taken to adapt to not  receiving visas, and any impacts on supplier businesses of being denied  H-2B visas. Besides interviewing employers, we also interviewed a state  workforce agency as part of each case study, asking questions about  topics including the agency\u2019s role in helping H-2B employers recruit U.S.  workers, the outcomes of H-2B employers\u2019 recruitment efforts, and any  challenges with such recruiting efforts.", "In addition, as part of our case studies, we asked the H-2B employers we  interviewed to complete a questionnaire. This questionnaire covered  topics including the employer\u2019s gross sales in fiscal years 2017 and 2018;  the employer\u2019s number of employees in fiscal years 2017 and 2018, both  U.S. and H-2B employees; the employer\u2019s purchases of goods and  services in fiscal years 2017 and 2018; and any challenges created by  not receiving H-2B visas in fiscal year 2018. We received responses from  30 employers, including from five seafood processing employers, 11  landscaping employers, four construction employers, and 10 hospitality  employers. Some respondents did not answer every question in the  questionnaire. We dropped one of the 30 questionnaire responses from  our analyses because the employer reported not receiving H-2B visas in  2017 which, if included, could distort our findings. In our analysis of  changes to revenues, supply purchases, and employment based on  questionnaire responses, we did not control for factors beyond the H-2B  visa cap that may have affected the results. So, any results reported from  the questionnaire may be due in part to these unobserved factors.  Additionally, we did not independently verify the information provided in  the questionnaire responses, which could lead to our analysis not  completely representing the full effect of the H-2B visa cap.

First, we reviewed our background interviews  with stakeholders for this engagement to craft a preliminary list of  potential individuals to contact. Then, we identified additional researchers  that have published works on the H-2B visa program. Afterward, we  conducted several searches on the Congressional Quarterly website to  collect a list of witnesses who testified before Congress on H-2B visa  issues. Finally, obtained an additional list of authors who published work  on the H-2B visa program and names of individuals that have testified  before Congress on issues related to the H-2B visa program.

The first way we measure usage of H-2B  employees is by the number of approved H-2B petitions within the county.  When we compare the top quartile of counties by number of approved H- 2B petitions to all counties without H-2B employers, we found that they  have about 0.5 percentage point lower unemployment rates and about  $187 higher average weekly wages.

The small difference in wages for counties with a high ratio of H-2B  workers to labor force, and the previous finding that counties with H-2B  employers in the bottom quartile by labor force have lower average  weekly wages, suggests that the difference in wages in our main finding  may be partially driven by the counties with larger labor forces.", "In our final extension of our analysis, we isolated four selected industries  to compare whether the counties with H-2B employers within the  specified industry have higher average weekly wages in that industry than  counties without.
