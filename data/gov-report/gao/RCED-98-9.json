Billions of dollars have been spent to construct these roads and highways, and preserving and maintaining them is estimated to cost billions of dollars more each year. In 1995, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) estimated that the average annual cost to maintain overall highway conditions and performance for this system through the year 2013 to be $44.8 billion.", "An American Association of State Highway Officials road test conducted in 1959-60 to obtain pavement performance data showed\u2014among other things\u2014that heavy trucks cause more highway pavement damage than other vehicular traffic. On the basis of this test, the Association developed an initial pavement design guide in 1961, and it has been updated periodically since then. DOT\u2019s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) neither adopts the guide nor requires its use by states. Rather, FHWA\u2014in its working relationship with states\u2014requires that sound engineering and management principles and practices be used in the pavement design process. According to FHWA, one indication of this is the states\u2019 use of guides and standards developed by a number of standard-setting industry organizations, including AASHTO.", "This report (1) describes the roles of FHWA and others in developing and updating the pavement design guide and (2) examines the use and potential of a computer analysis method known as the nonlinear 3 Dimensional-Finite Element Method (3D-FEM) for improving the design and analysis of highway pavement structures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FHWA is responsible for administering and overseeing various highway transportation programs, including the Federal-Aid Highway Program\u2014which provides financial assistance to the states for improving the efficiency of highway and traffic operations. FHWA relies on AASHTO to (1) provide technical guidance for the design, construction, and maintenance of highways and other transportation facilities; (2) publish manuals, guides, and specifications regarding design, safety, maintenance, and materials; and (3) conduct planning for highways, bridges, and other structures. Active membership in AASHTO is open to the state departments of transportation of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. DOT is an active, albeit nonvoting, member. FHWA supports AASHTO\u2019s manuals, guides, and specifications, which the states can use in designing and analyzing federally funded highway projects. In addition, states can use their own pavement design criteria and procedures for such projects, which generally mirror what is in AASHTO\u2019s pavement design guide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Updating the Pavement Design Guide", "paragraphs": ["Currently, highway pavement design criteria and procedures are documented in AASHTO\u2019s 1993 Guide For the Design of Pavement Structures. AASHTO\u2019s Joint Task Force on Pavements is responsible for the development and updating of the guide. The guide was first issued in 1961 and then updated in 1972, 1981, 1986, and 1993. Another update of the guide is forthcoming. The task force\u2019s efforts to update the guide are overseen by a National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) project panel, which functions under the Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 National Research Council.", "While constructing new highways was once the primary goal of state transportation departments, the major emphasis in pavement design in the 1990s has progressed to rehabilitating existing highways. According to NCHRP, the current guide does not reflect this shift in emphasis, and the updated guide is the expected product of an NCHRP/TRB contract with an engineering consulting firm that is expected to be awarded in the near future. Under the contract, the guide would be updated by 2002. In updating the guide, NCHRP intends to improve upon the outdated pavement design procedures contained in the current guide.", "The current design guide and its predecessors were largely based on design equations empirically derived from the observations AASHTO\u2019s predecessor made during road performance tests completed in 1959-60. Several transportation experts have criticized the empirical data thus derived as outdated and inadequate for today\u2019s highway system.  In addition, a March 1994 DOT Office of Inspector General report concluded that the design guide was outdated and that pavement design information it relied on could not be supported and validated with systematic comparisons to actual experience or research. In contrast to the current guide, which relied heavily on an empirical approach to derive its design equations, the NCHRP contract to update the guide by 2002 calls for the use of an approach that would more realistically characterize existing highway pavement usage and improve the reliability of designs.", "Under the first phase of the contract that ended in July 1997, Nichols Consulting Engineers developed a detailed work plan for completing the new pavement design guide. When the project manager resigned in June 1997, NCHRP decided to rebid the contract. The NCHRP program officer stated that he believes that the new guide will be completed as planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Existing Pavement Design and Analysis Method Has the Potential to Improve Highways and Is Being Used by Others", "paragraphs": ["An existing method called nonlinear 3D-FEM has the potential to significantly improve the design and analysis of highway pavement structures. A number of nonlinear 3D-FEM computer programs have been available since the 1970s that can be used for solving complex structural engineering problems, including designing safer, longer-lasting, more cost-effective highway pavement structures. Nonlinear 3D-FEM is considered by many experts to be superior to current design and analysis methods because values of stresses, strains, and pavement deflections can be calculated accurately from a variety of traffic loads\u2014static, impact, vibratory, and moving mixes of traffic loads, including multiaxle truck/trailer loads both within and outside legal weight limits. The nonlinear 3D-FEM analysis allows a level of detail that aids in selecting pavement materials as well as improving the accuracy of determinations of the thickness needed for new, reconstructed, and overlay pavements. This method can be used to analyze pavements for strengthening that may be required for expected traffic loads in the future and for computing the pavements\u2019 remaining structural and operational lives.", "Several highway departments and academic institutions have already used nonlinear 3D-FEM for various structural analysis applications. The Indiana, Mississippi, and Ohio departments of transportation, for example, have pioneered the use of nonlinear 3D-FEM in pavement design and analysis. Officials of these agencies told us that they are very satisfied with its application on various road systems.", "In 1995, the University of Mississippi used nonlinear 3D-FEM to analyze jointed concrete pavement for dynamic truck loads and thermal analysis.An official from the Mississippi State Department of Transportation told us that this method enabled the state to determine the conditions causing the rapid deterioration of its concrete pavement. Similarly, a senior scientist from a firm specializing in evaluating the integrity of engineering structures told us that, among other things, the finite element method\u2014combined with statistical theory (which factors in uncertainties in material properties)\u2014has been used to predict the expected life of a concrete runway at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina.", "Because it considers AASHTO\u2019s pavement design guide to be outdated, the School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University, also has been using nonlinear 3D-FEM to analyze various pavement problems. The university has used this method to analyze responses to moving multiaxle truck/trailer loads within and outside legal weight limits on both flexible and rigid pavements. Studies the university has conducted to verify the analyses have shown a strong correlation between field and predicted pavement responses (strains and deflections).", "More recently, Purdue University conducted a study\u2014including the use of field instrumentation, laboratory testing, field data collection, and subgrade and core sampling\u2014of three asphalt pavement sections with different subdrainage configurations on a portion of Interstate 469 in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. Nonlinear 3D-FEM was used to evaluate the subdrainage performance and the analysis of moisture flow through the pavement. The results of the study indicated a strong correlation between the predicted and field-measured outflows of water.", "The effects of high moisture conditions on pavement performance include rutting, cracking, and faulting\u2014leading to increased roughness, unsafe conditions, and a loss of serviceability. A pavement design manager with the Indiana Department of Transportation told us that the Purdue study, using nonlinear 3D-FEM, confirmed that the Department\u2019s previously used subdrainage design procedures resulted in a drainage outflow pipe that was too small\u2014thus limiting moisture outflow. Subdrainage layers with filter layers, a perforated pipe (subdrainage collector pipe), trench material, and an outlet pipe play a key role in reducing the extent and duration of high moisture conditions in pavement structures and their subgrade. The manager said that nonlinear 3D-FEM provided the (1) proper (increased) size of drainage outlet pipe and (2) best, most efficient filter material, which turned out to be less costly than the material previously being used. We were told that Indiana\u2019s Transportation Department is now in the process of adopting nonlinear 3D-FEM as its preferred method for designing subdrainage systems. An Indiana research section engineer also told us that he believes that nonlinear 3D-FEM could be used by all state highway departments to design subdrainage systems.", "Battelle Memorial Institute recently applied nonlinear 3D-FEM to predict pavement response to a broad range of vehicle loads on 4 miles of newly constructed highway pavement (2 miles southbound and 2 miles northbound) north of Columbus, Ohio. According to a Battelle project scientist and an academician from Ohio University, the results of the heavily instrumented highway test sections showed a strong correlation with the analytical results achieved from nonlinear 3D-FEM. They also told us that nonlinear 3D-FEM is the best computational method to address pavement problems. A chief engineer of the Ohio Transportation Department further told us that the state was pleased with Battelle\u2019s efforts to predict pavement response using the nonlinear method.", "According to an engineer-advisor with the DOT Inspector General\u2019s Office, AASHTO\u2019s pavement design guide has changed very little over the years. He was of the opinion that new design procedures are needed, incorporating nonlinear 3D-FEM, if FHWA and the states are going to be better able to ensure that highway pavement is constructed, reconstructed, or overlaid according to current FHWA policy that it be safe, durable, and cost-effective.", "We reviewed the scope of work of the contract NCHRP awarded in December 1996 to Nichols Consulting Engineers for the development of the new guide. The scope of the most recent contract work does not directly cite nonlinear 3D-FEM as a technique that can be used in the design and analysis of highway pavement. In discussions with Nichols\u2019 project manager and with an NCHRP official and in our review of the contractor\u2019s work plan for the guide, we did not find any specific reference that nonlinear 3D-FEM would be investigated for inclusion or exclusion in the 2002 update. Through interviews with FHWA, AASHTO, and NCHRP officials, we attempted to determine why the method was not specifically being considered. We did not receive any explanation. However, the program officer said that while the contractual documentation for this particular effort does not contain specific reference to nonlinear 3D-FEM as a pavement design and analysis method, the documentation does not exclude the use of such a method either."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The pavement design guide developed and updated by AASHTO over the years for designing and analyzing highway pavement structures is outdated. NCHRP has undertaken a 5-year effort to update the guide employing improved design approaches. Research on nonlinear 3D-FEM and documented successes in its application suggest that this method could be an important tool for accurately (1) designing and analyzing new highway pavement structures and (2) analyzing the response of deteriorated pavement structures for rehabilitation. We believe it should be considered in NCHRP\u2019s ongoing efforts to update AASHTO\u2019s current pavement design and analysis guide.
