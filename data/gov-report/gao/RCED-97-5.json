Fifteen of these reactors, known as RBMK reactors, are the type that exploded at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. In 1994, we reported on international assistance efforts, including those of the United States, to improve the safety of the Soviet-designed reactors.

As of February 1996, 22 donors, including the United States, had pledged or contributed more than $1.4 billion in assistance to this effort.", "The 60 operational Soviet-designed nuclear power reactors pose significant risks because of deficiencies in their design and operation. Of greatest concern are 26 of these reactors that western safety experts generally agree fall well below accepted international safety standards and cannot be economically upgraded. These include 15 reactors known as RBMKs and 11 reactors known as VVER 440 Model 230s. The RBMK reactors\u2014considered the least safe by western safety experts\u2014and VVER 440 Model 230 reactors are believed to present the greatest safety risk because of inherent design deficiencies, including the lack of a containment structure, inadequate fire protection systems, unreliable instrumentation and control systems, and deficient systems for cooling the reactor core in an emergency. Most of these reactors are located in countries that do not have independent or effective nuclear regulatory bodies to oversee plant safety. Figure 1 shows the type and location of the 60 Soviet-designed reactors operating in the Newly Independent States and in central and eastern Europe.", "Several federal agencies share responsibility for the U.S. nuclear safety assistance program. The Department of State provides overall policy guidance, with assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). DOE is responsible for implementing projects involving training, operational safety, and safety-related equipment. Three of DOE\u2019s national laboratories support the program. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory provides the primary management support, and along with the Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Argonne National Laboratory, manages specific safety projects.

Furthermore, Armenia recently restarted one of its VVER 440 Model 230 reactors. Department of State officials told us that progress has been made in getting closure agreements for some reactors in Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Ukraine, but these officials also recognize that it may be difficult for these countries to meet these agreements on a timely basis. For example, Bulgaria has agreed to a phased shutdown of its highest-risk reactors by 1998 as adequate replacement energy, such as hydroelectric power, becomes available. Department of State officials said the closure date will probably be delayed by 2 or 3 years because, among other things, the pace of economic reform in Bulgaria has been slow.", "In 1995, the G-7 nations (major industrialized nations) and Ukraine signed an agreement that includes Ukraine\u2019s commitment to close the Chornobyl nuclear power reactor by 2000. State Department and USAID officials said that successful implementation of the agreement hinges on Ukraine\u2019s progress in reforming the energy sector. Such progress is key to continuing the international financial assistance that may ease the impact of closure.", "DOE, national laboratory, and Department of State officials acknowledge that many of the highest-risk reactors may continue to operate for several more years. Many factors complicate U.S. and western nations\u2019 efforts to obtain early closure of the highest-risk reactors, including (1) a lack of consensus, particularly among Russian nuclear safety experts, about the safety of their reactors; (2) concerns about the social and economic well-being of workers who would be displaced if reactors were closed; (3) a commitment to expanding nuclear power, particularly in Russia, to meet future energy needs; and (4) the need to obtain financing to support the development of replacement energy.", "DOE\u2019s Director of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology said that Russia does not intend to close its highest-risk reactors for many years, and he believes that the United States should continue to provide assistance so that these reactors can operate as safely as possible until they are closed. Department of State and USAID officials also noted that it is sound policy to continue to reduce the risks of accidents at the highest-risk reactors.", "In keeping with this policy, DOE plans to increase technical assistance to RBMK plants, including Chornobyl. The Chornobyl initiative is part of a multinational effort to provide safety upgrades that can be completed quickly. DOE is planning to spend about $13.8 million at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, including upgrades for fire safety at one of the two operating reactors and instituting operational safety and training programs for both reactors.", "In total, DOE plans to spend about $33 million for safety parameter display systems for plants with RBMK reactors. This system provides information, which is displayed on a monitor, to operators about plant conditions that are important for safety. In addition, DOE plans to spend about $8.5 million on a project to transfer western maintenance practices, training methods, and technology to staff at RBMK reactors. DOE officials noted that the project will not extend the life of the RBMK reactors but will improve safety.", "Our review of the RBMK maintenance initiative indicates that the repair or replacement of any component that a plant relies on would support the plant\u2019s continued operations. While these efforts will not by themselves extend the lifetime of the plant, they will serve to keep the plant\u2019s components in service longer. In 1993, the Chairman of NRC at that time said that it is difficult to draw a fine line between short-term safety improvements and upgrades that could encourage a plant\u2019s operator to think in terms of long-term operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope of DOE\u2019s Program Has Expanded", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s program was initially viewed as short- to mid-term, totaling between $25 million and $40 million, with additional funding planned of about $100 million. However, DOE\u2019s portion of the program has grown because of the complexities and challenges involved in improving the safety of Soviet-designed plants. As of March 1996, DOE had initiated more than 150 projects in this program, and DOE\u2019s Director of the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science, and Technology told us that approximately $500 million would be required over the next 10 years to address the program\u2019s long-term safety and training needs. (According to Department of State and USAID officials, this estimate has not been agreed upon by other U.S. government agencies participating in the program.) In contrast, NRC views its regulatory assistance program, totaling about $28 million, as limited in terms of its size and scope.", "DOE and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory officials said that while it remains important to address short-term safety problems at the plant level, it is equally important to approach safety at a systemic level to help bring about sustainable improvements. As a result, the program has placed increased emphasis on transferring U.S. technology and encouraging the recipient countries to analyze and fix their own safety problems. According to DOE officials, the technology transfer aspect of the program is having a positive impact.", "DOE has developed a short- to mid-term plan that provides an overview of the program\u2019s objectives, performance measurements and ongoing projects. Although they plan to do so, DOE officials have not yet established a long-term plan linking the program\u2019s objectives to measurable goals or providing a date for meeting those goals. As a result, it is unclear how DOE will demonstrate when and how it has achieved the program\u2019s goals. It is also unclear, without such a plan, when the program will end. According to DOE\u2019s Deputy Associate Director for International Nuclear Safety, the 10-year approach is based on an intuitive view of the time needed to complete the program\u2019s overall objectives. DOE officials told us in September 1996 that the agency has begun to develop a plan that will link objectives to goals and set a date for achieving these goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Nuclear Safety Assistance Program Has Received $208 Million", "paragraphs": ["DOE and NRC have received $208 million for their programs in the Newly Independent States and countries of central and eastern Europe. USAID has provided about 80 percent of the total funds received through various interagency agreements with DOE and NRC. The remainder of the funds has come from DOE ($30 million) and the Department of Defense ($11 million). Beginning in fiscal year 1996, DOE began receiving direct appropriations for the program but is still obtaining some funds from USAID for special projects, such as Chornobyl. (App. I provides greater detail on DOE\u2019s and NRC\u2019s costs for the safety assistance program and fig. I.1 provides information about the Chornobyl project.)", "The U.S. nuclear safety program has focused on several types of assistance, including management and operational safety, engineering and technology (including fire safety and other plant-specific improvements), plant safety evaluations, and regulatory enhancements. Operational improvements can be implemented at all plants regardless of reactor type. Plant-specific measures are generally directed toward reactors such as the oldest RBMKs and VVER 440 Model 230s. As figure 2 shows, the greatest percentage of the funds\u201436 percent\u2014has or will be spent on management and operational safety, which includes training and safety procedures.", "As of March 31, 1996, DOE had obligated $119.2 million and had spent $78.3 million of the $180.1 million it had received. NRC had obligated $16.5 million and spent $11 million of the $27.9 million received. (See table I.1). Of the combined agencies\u2019 expenditures, $42.2 million was for nuclear safety equipment and other products. More than half of the $42.2 million was for training or training-related items, such as simulators. Less than one-third of this amount was for safety-related hardware, such as fire safety or other plant-specific equipment. (See fig. I.2). Other program-related expenditures were for labor, travel, overhead, and other costs. (See tables I.2 and I.3).", "DOE, NRC, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory officials recognize that their obligation and expenditure rates for their respective programs\u2014particularly in Russia and Ukraine\u2014have lagged over time. They stated, however, that several factors have contributed to the delays, including (1) concerns about nuclear liability in the United States that led to a change in DOE\u2019s program management and stalled many projects;(2) logistical problems with establishing assistance programs in Russia and Ukraine; (3) the need to develop working relationships with Russian and Ukrainian organizations, some of which have experienced significant turnover and/or attrition of key personnel; and (4) procurement delays in the United States.", "DOE, national laboratory, and NRC officials noted concerns about their programs\u2019 unobligated balances. As of March 31, 1996, DOE\u2019s unobligated balance was about $61 million and NRC\u2019s was about $11 million. DOE intended to obligate all currently unobligated funds by September 30, 1996. While NRC has obligated 88 percent of its funds for central and eastern Europe, its obligation rates for Russia and Ukraine are significantly lower. NRC expects to obligate its available funds, primarily for Russia and Ukraine, over the next few years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of 13 DOE and NRC Safety Projects in Russia and Ukraine", "paragraphs": ["Of the 13 safety projects we reviewed, 11 have been delayed in their implementation and one has been completed.

While some of these difficulties continue, several projects are moving forward. Despite the recent progress, it is too early to assess the impact of these projects on safety.", "Eleven of the 13 safety projects implemented by DOE and NRC have been delayed, and 3 are more than 2 years behind schedule. At the time of our review, one project, a study of nuclear energy options for Russia, had been completed. The study concluded that, among other things, it was in Russia\u2019s economic interest to upgrade some of its operating nuclear power reactors and to close and decommission some of its higher-risk reactors. (See app. II for a summary of the projects and the reasons for the delays).", "A number of factors have delayed the implementation of these projects, including (1) problems with customs, (2) foreign officials\u2019 imposition of unanticipated and/or burdensome requirements, and (3) the inability of Russia and Ukraine to provide adequate financial support for some projects. Despite these impediments, several projects are now progressing more quickly. (DOE\u2019s projects are discussed in detail in app. III, and NRC\u2019s are discussed in app. IV.)", "For the 13 projects we reviewed, DOE has been requested to pay at least $505,000 in unanticipated costs. These costs include $442,000 to replace or refurbish unusable simulator parts in Ukraine, $34,000 to store U.S. equipment in European warehouses pending the resolution of customs problems in Russia, $26,000 for airfare to enable Ukrainians working on a year-long simulator project in the United States to return to Ukraine or to have their spouses visit them in the United States, and $3,000 to the Ukrainian customs organization for fees to authorize the release of equipment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Customs Problems in Russia and Ukraine", "paragraphs": ["In 6 of the 13 safety projects we reviewed, Russian and/or Ukrainian customs officials did not release U.S. equipment to the nuclear power plants in a timely manner. Under the terms of agreements that the United States entered into with Russia and Ukraine, this equipment is to enter into these countries duty-free. Local customs officials in Russia and Ukraine have not consistently recognized the duty-free status of this equipment. Department of State and USAID officials told us that other U.S. assistance programs in the Newly Independent States have experienced similar problems. Customs problems have included the following:", "Russian customs officials impounded 100 fire suits and related fire safety equipment, valued at $110,000, until customs duties were paid. This equipment was destined for the Smolensk nuclear power plant. Since no duties were paid, customs officials turned the equipment over to a Russian court, which donated the equipment to a local fire company. Realizing it could not use the equipment, the fire company eventually sent the gear to the nuclear power plant, about 1 year after it had been shipped to Russia.", "A U.S. contractor placed emergency batteries and related equipment in a storage facility in the Netherlands for several months pending the resolution of customs problems in Russia. The shipper requested the reimbursement of about $11,300 for storage costs, but DOE had not paid these costs at the time of our review.", "Russian customs officials have been holding a sample high-temperature suit and related equipment, valued at about $26,000, for over 2 years. The equipment, which was examined by Smolensk nuclear power plant officials in May 1994, is no longer considered useful by DOE except for demonstration purposes. As a result, DOE has not pressed Russian authorities to release it. No customs duties or storage fees have been imposed.", "Fire-retardant material, valued at $23,650, was stored in Finland for several months pending the resolution of customs problems. The shipper has claimed about $23,000 in storage costs, and this claim is being reviewed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.", "The Department of State\u2019s Senior Coordinator for Nuclear Safety Assistance said that customs problems have been raised with senior-level U.S. and Russian officials. Customs difficulties have been assigned to the Science and Technology Committee of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission for resolution. The Vice President has repeatedly mentioned his concerns to Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, and both DOE and the Department of State have attempted to find a generic solution to the customs issue. However, pending such a resolution, case-by-case arrangements will still be required.", "Recently, DOE and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory officials have focused greater attention on resolving customs problems. In February 1996, DOE and Ukrainian authorities agreed to a standardized process under which nuclear safety-related equipment would be cleared duty-free by customs in Ukraine. Laboratory officials said that some equipment had recently been shipped successfully to Russian plants using the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to facilitate the process, although these officials do not consider this approach to be a long-term solution. Some U.S. industry officials also noted that customs problems have decreased in recent months.", "Because standardized customs procedures do not yet exist in either Russia or Ukraine, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory officials recognize that problems may continue to occur. These officials noted that their representative in Russia does, among other things, help resolve customs problems by working with Russian officials. Although the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has a representative in Ukraine, his responsibilities are narrowly defined, and he does not routinely monitor customs issues. A Laboratory official said that the Ukraine representative\u2019s position may be expanded to more closely resemble the responsibilities of the program\u2019s representative in Russia.", "In addition to customs problems, other factors have contributed to delays affecting 5 of the 13 projects we reviewed. For example, DOE\u2019s project to assist Russia in developing emergency operating instructions at a pilot nuclear power plant was delayed, in part, because the Russian organizations responsible for approving the instructions have been slow to act and have not given the project priority status. Although the instructions were drafted in 1992, a lengthy process of verification, validation, training, and regulatory approval delayed the implementation of a partial set of instructions until mid-1996. In another case, Russian authorities insisted that some U.S. fire safety equipment planned for shipment to the Smolensk plant had to be tested and certified in Russia. This equipment had already been approved for U.S. nuclear power plants. Testing of the equipment was delayed for several months because of disagreements over funding. During this period, Russian authorities refused to allow the U.S. contractor to visit the plant until the matter was resolved.", "A few U.S. contractors told us that DOE and the Department of State have not always been aggressive enough in helping resolve problems. In the cases of the emergency operating instructions and the fire safety equipment for the Smolensk plant, these contractors believed that DOE should have been more active in working with the appropriate Russian organizations to help resolve project delays sooner. One contractor noted that higher-level DOE officials needed to work more closely with key Russian officials to demonstrate the U.S. government\u2019s commitment to the projects\u2019 success. He noted that a key DOE nuclear safety official helped move the emergency operating instruction project forward after he had discussed the project with Russian officials from Rosenergoatom, the organization responsible for most nuclear power plants\u2019 operations in Russia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns With Cost-Sharing Arrangements", "paragraphs": ["In 3 of the 13 projects, Ukraine and Russia have been unable to adequately finance or support their share of the project. For example, a full-scope simulator for the Khmelnytskyy nuclear power plant in Ukraine, valued at $12.7 million, has been delayed partly by the plant officials\u2019 inability to fulfill their commitments. As part of the project, the plant had agreed to provide certain components to be integrated into the simulator. However, the parts the plant provided were corroded. DOE paid for the replacements. In addition, the plant-supplied control room panels did not match the panels needed for the simulator; DOE paid for their modification as well.", "The simulator project\u2014as well as other projects for which the United States has agreed to cover additional costs\u2014raises questions about the ability of host countries to meet commitments in other ongoing and planned cost-sharing projects for the safety program. For example, other simulator projects for Russia and Ukraine are being developed on a cost-sharing basis with DOE. The total estimated DOE contribution to these simulator projects is about $24 million; Ukraine\u2019s contribution is about $12 million; and Russia\u2019s contribution is about $7.5 million. DOE\u2019s simulator project manager said that some of the recipient countries\u2019 contributions will be \u201cin-kind\u201d contributions of labor, rather than financial outlays. However, he said that DOE recognizes that these projects are risky and that DOE may have some additional costs associated with them.", "In October 1994, a USAID Inspector General\u2019s report raised similar concerns about cost-sharing ventures. The report recommended that USAID, in coordination with DOE, ensure the development of procedures defining and documenting the role and use of U.S. government funding vis-a-vis host countries\u2019 contributions.

For example, DOE and Brookhaven officials told us that the cadre of trainers at the Balakovo training center in Ukraine has grown from less than 10 to about 70 since the project began and that the plant\u2019s management is committed to the training program. In another project, NRC has worked closely with Russia\u2019s nuclear regulatory body, Gosatomnadzor, to develop a legislative basis for nuclear regulation and legal enforcement. NRC and Gosatomnadzor officials view this initiative as a significant first step toward the creation of an independent nuclear regulatory body in Russia.
