DOD also created the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Defense (JTF-CND) to coordinate and direct the full range of activities within the Department associated with incident response. GAO identified the following six areas in which DOD faces challenges in improving its incident response capabilities: (1) coordinating resource planning and prioritization activities; (2) integrating critical data from intrusion detection systems, sensors, and other devices to better monitor cyber events and attacks; (3) establishing departmentwide process to periodically review systems and networks for security weaknesses; (4) increasing individual unit compliance with departmentwide vulnerability alerts; (5) improving DOD's system for coordinating component-level incident response actions; and (6) developing departmentwide performance measures to assess incident response capabilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) depends on interconnected information  systems and communications networks for critical combat and business  operations.

If successful, these attacks could result in the loss or corruption of  critical data, damage to information systems, or disruption of military  operations. To address such threats, DOD has established organizations,  known as computer incident response capabilities, at various locations  worldwide. These organizations engage in a range of activities associated  with preventing, detecting, and responding to computer incidents.", "At the request of the former Chairman of the Military Readiness  Subcommittee, we reviewed DOD\u2019s implementation of computer incident  response capabilities and identified challenges to improving these  capabilities. Our work focused on DOD organizations responsible for  central incident detection and response operations that support military  functions, including the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Defense  (JTF-CND), the DOD Computer Emergency Response Team (DOD CERT),  and the Global Network Operations and Security Center, managed by the  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).

Daily, DOD identifies and records thousands of \u201ccyber events,\u201d  some of which are determined to be attacks against systems and networks.  These attacks may be perpetrated by individuals inside or outside the  organization, including hackers, foreign-sponsored entities, employees,  former employees, and contractors or other service providers.", "Although historically DOD focused most of its security efforts on  protecting the confidentiality of classified and sensitive information, this  focus evolved as unclassified DOD systems and networks became  increasingly exposed to cyber threats and attacks because of their  connections with the public telecommunications infrastructure. After the  \u201cMorris Worm\u201d attack crippled about 10 percent of the computers  connected to the Internet in 1988, DOD acted\u2014through the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014to establish the CERT Coordination  Center at Carnegie Mellon University to address computer security threats.  In 1992, the Air Force established the first military CERT to help address  computer security threats and attacks internally. In 1994, a hacker from the  United Kingdom raised concerns by launching a series of attacks against  critical DOD research systems, demonstrating a need for better cyber  defenses. Following these events, the Navy and Army established CERTs in  1995 and 1996, respectively.", "During the 1990s, incident response organizations were also gradually  being established throughout other agencies of the federal government. In  1996, the Federal Computer Incident Response Capability (FedCIRC) was  established to assist federal civilian agencies in their incident handling  efforts. Like DOD, civilian agencies continue to evolve and mature in their  incident response capabilities.", "Even as greater attention has been paid to incident response, cyber threats  and attacks continue to affect the operations of DOD and other federal  systems and networks. Since 1998, a number of federal systems have been  subjected to a series of recurring, \u201cstealth-like\u201d attacks, code-named  Moonlight Maze, that federal incident response officials have attributed to  foreign entities and are still investigating. More recently, the \u201cILOVEYOU\u201d  virus attack affected electronic mail and other systems worldwide.", "According to DOD officials, thousands of potential cyber attacks are  launched against DOD systems and networks daily, though very few are  successful in accessing computer and information resources. In 1999 and  2000, the Air Force, Army, and Navy recorded a combined total of 600 and  715 cyber attacks respectively, during which intruders attacked DOD  systems and networks in a variety of ways.

Upon request, the Air Force, Army, Navy, and National Security Agency  conduct vulnerability assessments of DOD systems and networks using a  variety of automated computer security assessment tools. These tools  automatically check systems and networks for known security weaknesses  and generate reports summarizing results. During 2000, the Air Force,  Army, Navy, and National Security Agency completed over 150 assessments  that identified hundreds of vulnerabilities for commands to address. Upon  request, the services and the National Security Agency use groups of  technical experts to play the role of hackers and attempt to penetrate DOD  systems and networks by exploiting known security weaknesses in  commonly used systems and software. These efforts help prepare military  forces to defend against cyber attacks and are often conducted during  military training exercises. In addition, DOD established a Joint Web Risk  Assessment Cell (JWRAC), staffed by reservists, to continually review DOD  web sites to identify sensitive information. According to DOD officials,  during its first 6 months of operation, JWRAC reviewed about 10,000 Web  pages and identified hundreds of discrepancies for corrective action.", "Even with these preventive efforts, new types of security vulnerabilities are  being identified almost daily, and hackers are continually developing  automated tools to take advantage of them. To keep its systems and  networks current with the best available protection, such as up-to-date  software patches, DOD depends on DISA\u2019s Information Assurance  Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) process, which distributes alerts, bulletins, and  advisories on security vulnerabilities, as well as recommendations for  repairing security weaknesses, to the military services and Defense  agencies. Since the program began in 1998, 27 alerts on potentially severe  vulnerabilities and about 46 bulletins and advisories on lower risk cyber  threats and attacks have been distributed to the services and Defense  agencies for corrective action.

Even if an attacker is at first  unsuccessful in penetrating a particular system or network because it is  well protected, such a person can go on to attack other systems and  networks that may have vulnerabilities that are more easily exploited.

However, DOD has not yet identified departmentwide priorities or  funding requirements for incident response. Instead, each of the services  annually determines its own incident response priorities and funding  requirements; as a result, the resources committed to incident response  vary substantially. For example, Air Force officials estimated that they  would spend over $43 million for their Information Warfare Center and  Computer Emergency Response Team in fiscal year 2000, whereas Navy  officials estimated that they would spend less than $4 million on their  corresponding activities. Given widely varying resource commitments and  the lack of established departmentwide priorities, it is uncertain whether  systems and networks are being consistently and appropriately protected  from cyber attack across the department. According to DOD officials, it is  difficult to identify departmentwide priorities, because no agreement has  yet been reached on the core functions and characteristics of incident  response teams among the multiple services and Defense agencies that  currently field such teams.

Sufficient information is needed to establish what events  occurred and who or what caused them. As attacks become more  sophisticated, obtaining this information can become more and more  difficult, requiring more and better-integrated data. Attackers may go to  great lengths to disguise their attacks by spreading them over long periods  of time or going through many different network routes, so that it is harder  for intrusion detection systems to notice that attacks are occurring.  Because of the threat of these kinds of attacks, it is increasingly important  to collect intrusion data from as many systems and sensors as possible.", "Although it has begun to develop several tools for tracking different kinds  of incident data from across the department, DOD has only recently begun  to implement key systems for integrating useful data from various intrusion  detection systems and other heterogeneous systems, sensors, and devices  for analysis. JTF-CND has taken steps to integrate intrusion data by  sponsoring development of a Joint CERT Database to consolidate  information on documented cyber attacks that have been collected  individually by the services. According to DOD officials, the Joint CERT  Database first became operational in January 2001. Work is also under way  to develop a joint threat database as well as a database of law enforcement- related information. However, neither of these tools is yet operational.", "Integrating intrusion data from across the department is a significant  challenge because many different systems are in use that collect different  kinds of data. Each of the services has deployed different intrusion  detection systems to track anomalous network activity, and databases  designed to track different types of specific data elements have been  developed to synthesize raw data for analysis. Further, key information,  such as data on insider attacks, is not yet tracked departmentwide.", "To help overcome this difficulty, JTF-CND also launched a project to  establish common terminology for incident response to help standardize  reporting of cyber incidents and attacks throughout the department.  However, the task force has not yet been able to bridge significant  differences among the military services regarding how to classify and  report computer incidents. For example, the Air Force currently does not  report \u201cprobes\u201d to JTF-CND because it does not consider these events  harmful until its systems or networks are actually under attack. Internally,  the Air Force identifies thousands of probes of its systems and networks  daily and told us that reporting this information to JTF-CND would provide  little insight on cyber attacks. However, the Army and Navy do report  probes to JTF-CND. Experts believe data on probes can be used to assess  the likelihood of an attack in the future. This is because potential intruders  typically use a series of probes to gather technical information about  systems so that they can tailor an attack to exploit the vulnerabilities most  likely to be associated with those systems. Thus a series of probes against a  system or systems may indicate that a more concerted attack against the  same systems is likely in the near future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Assessments Are Not Prioritized Departmentwide", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD has had procedures in place since 1986 for the military  services to conduct vulnerability assessments of systems and networks and  collect information on security weaknesses, no process has been  developed, either at the department level or within the services, for  prioritizing the conduct of vulnerability assessments. Instead, vulnerability  assessments are generally conducted only when requested by component  commanders or service-level audit agencies. Service officials agreed that  there was no departmentwide process to identify which systems or  networks faced the greatest risks and therefore should be assigned the  highest priority for vulnerability assessments.", "Neither is there a mechanism to follow up on the results of these  assessments to verify that security weaknesses have been corrected.  Generally, the assessment teams do not verify that corrective action has  been completed as recommended. The problem is compounded by the fact  that, in some cases, component officials are not responsible for all the  systems and network connections identified as having security  vulnerabilities. No procedures are in place to ensure that the systems  outside their responsibility are fixed.", "Furthermore, the information about vulnerabilities collected during these  assessments is provided only to the affected components and not shared  among the military services and Defense agencies.

The  INFOCON system defines five levels of threat and establishes procedures  for protecting systems and networks at each level. These procedures were  modeled after security requirements for bases, commands, and posts that  require coordinated and heightened security when attacks are imminent or  under way. The INFOCON system focuses on network-based protective  measures and outlines countermeasures to unauthorized access, data  browsing, and other suspicious activity, such as scanning and probing.", "Although the INFOCON system is a useful approach to standardizing  incident response throughout DOD, the established measures provide only  general guidance about the kinds of incident response activities that might  be appropriate at each INFOCON level. Most decisions about what  countermeasures to apply and how to apply them are left in the hands of  systems administrators and other officials at individual DOD facilities.  Lacking detailed guidance, the decision to apply countermeasures can be  difficult for these officials in part because the countermeasures themselves  may affect system performance. Inexperienced personnel may overreact  and implement drastic countermeasures, resulting in self-inflicted  problems, such as degraded system performance or communication  disruptions.

Individual  commands independently chose a variety of different levels and responses.  For example, some commands made few changes to their daily operational  procedures, while others cut off all electronic mail communications and  thus became isolated from outside contact regarding the status of the  attack.

Acting to  address these challenges would help DOD better protect its systems and  networks from cyber threats and attacks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence and  the U.S. Space Command to work through DIAP and JTF-CND to  finalize a departmentwide incident response plan, including objectives,  goals, priorities, and the resources needed to achieve those objectives;  expedite the development and enhancement of a complete set of  systems for integrating and analyzing useful data from intrusion  detection systems and other systems used to monitor computer security  weaknesses, including tracking data on insider attacks;  standardize terminology for computer incidents to facilitate the  integration of incident data across the department;  establish a systematic, departmentwide process for prioritizing and  conducting vulnerability assessments of high-risk systems and networks  and capabilities needed to support mission-critical operations;  evaluate and monitor results from vulnerability reviews to ensure that  recommended repairs have been made and have been applied to all  similar systems throughout DOD;  establish procedures to ensure consistent and complete reporting on the  status of repairs required in IAVAs across the department;  link IAVA compliance reporting requirements to mission-critical systems  and operations to increase awareness of the value of complying with  technical bulletins and advisories distributed as part of the IAVA  process;  refine INFOCON procedures to clarify the kinds of actions that need to  be taken at each INFOCON level, especially with regard to priority  systems, such as mission-critical systems; and  establish a performance-based management process for incident  response activities to ensure that departmentwide goals as well as  combat requirements are achieved, including establishing goals for  (1) reducing the prevalence of known security vulnerabilities in systems  and networks that support mission-critical operations and (2) timeliness  in responding to known types of cyber attacks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, which are reprinted in  appendix I, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,  Communications, and Intelligence stated that the department concurred  with our draft report.
