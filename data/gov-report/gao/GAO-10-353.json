GAO was asked to review SBA's internal control procedures for determining 8(a) eligibility. Specifically, we (1) evaluated the procedures and processes that SBA has implemented to ensure that only eligible firms participate in the 8(a) program, and (2) assessed the extent to which SBA uses external mechanisms such as complaint information in helping to ensure that only eligible firms participate. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed SBA guidance and prior reports, interviewed SBA officials, and conducted site visits and file reviews of 123 randomly sampled 8(a) firms covering the most recent 2 years of annual reviews at five SBA locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["SBA relies primarily on its annual review of 8(a) firms to ensure their continued eligibility in the program, but inconsistencies and weaknesses in annual review procedures limit program oversight. GAO's review of a random sample of 8(a) firms identified an estimated 55 percent in which SBA staff failed to complete required annual review procedures intended to assess fundamental eligibility criteria, such as being economically disadvantaged. Multiple factors appear to have contributed to the inconsistencies identified, including the lack of specific criteria in SBA's current regulations and procedures that relate to some eligibility requirements such as determining whether firms exceed program thresholds for industry size averages, personal compensation, and personal asset limits. As a result, firms that may have outgrown the program continued to receive 8(a) program benefits. For example, GAO estimated that 17 percent of the firms we reviewed had exceeded one or more eligibility criteria for 2 consecutive years, but were recommended by SBA for retention. SBA has taken steps to clarify some, but not all, of these rules in recent proposed rule changes. SBA is required by statute to perform annual reviews on 100 percent of 8(a) firms but staff spent significant amounts of time trying to obtain annual review documents from firms--especially firms that did not have 8(a) contracts--which affected the timeliness of reviews. GAO identified a significant number of instances in which firms failed to submit annual review documents as required but still were recommended for retention. The Business Development Specialists' (BDS) dual role of advocacy for and monitoring of the firms may have contributed in part to the retention of ineligible firms. SBA has been addressing some data integrity and compatibility issues by enhancing its primary electronic system for annual review information. Finally, SBA did not maintain an accurate inventory of 8(a) Mentor-Prot?g? Program participant data, which limited the agency's ability to monitor these firms. SBA's program offices did not maintain comprehensive data on or have a system in place to track complaints on the eligibility of firms participating in the 8(a) program. District staff were not aware of the types and frequency of complaints across the agency. As a result, SBA staff lacked information that could be used with other information to help identify issues relating to program integrity and help improve the effectiveness of SBA oversight. Although complaint data are not a primary mechanism to ensure program eligibility, continuous monitoring is a key component in detecting and deterring fraud."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2008, the federal government awarded $93.3 billion in  contracts to small businesses. The Small Business Administration (SBA)  plays an important role in ensuring that small businesses gain access to  federal contracting opportunities. Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act is  intended to help small businesses owned by socially and economically  disadvantaged individuals compete in the economy by providing business  development activities, such as counseling and technical assistance, and  providing access to federal contracting opportunities. The 8(a) program  does not guarantee that participating firms will obtain federal contracts,  but the firms are eligible for competitive (for which only 8(a) firms can  compete) and sole-source (for which awards are made without  competition) federal contracts when certain requirements are met. As of  fiscal year 2008, approximately 9,460 firms were in the program.", "However, we and others have identified oversight weaknesses in SBA  controls that are intended to help ensure that only eligible small  businesses gain access to federal contracting opportunities. For example,  in congressional hearings on SBA\u2019s Historically Underserved Business  Zone (HUBZone) Program that you held on July 17, 2008, we highlighted  fraud and eligibility control weaknesses in the program that allowed the  participation of fictitious and ineligible firms. In a November 2008 report  on the 8(a) program, we noted that SBA faced several challenges in its  overall administration of the 8(a) program, including competing demands  on a limited number of staff. For example, the amount of time staff spent  on statutorily mandated annual reviews of all 8(a) firms diminished the  amount of time they could devote to business development activities. Our  recommendations to SBA included assessing the workloads of business  development specialists (BDS) to ensure they could carry out their  responsibilities and improving processes to terminate firms. SBA agreed  with these recommendations in its written comments on the report.", "You asked us to review SBA\u2019s internal control procedures for determining  8(a) eligibility, including mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 arrangements (which provide  technical and management assistance as well as assistance in performing  federal contracts as a prime contractor through joint-venture  arrangements). Specifically, we (1) evaluated the procedures and  processes that SBA has implemented to ensure that only eligible firms  remain in the 8(a) program, and (2) assessed the extent to which SBA uses  external mechanisms, such as complaints by other 8(a) firms, to help  ensure that only eligible firms participate.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed applicable statutes and the  legislative history of the 8(a) program, SBA\u2019s regulations and guidance for  administering the program, our previous reports, and studies of the  program conducted by SBA, the SBA Inspector General, and external  organizations. To assess SBA\u2019s compliance with its eligibility review  procedures, we visited 5 of the 68 SBA districts and reviewed files of 123  randomly sampled 8(a) firms and an additional 13 8(a) firms that had  mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements. For each firm, we reviewed the most recent  2 years of annual reviews for the period 2007-2009, and any existing  mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 agreements, related documents, and correspondence. We  developed a data collection instrument to collect key annual review  information from each file, including SBA documentation and evidence  supporting eligibility criteria such as financial disadvantage. We selected  SBA districts based on the size of their 8(a) portfolios of firms with  contracts and for geographic diversity. These 5 districts represented 29  percent (or 672) of all active fiscal year 2008 8(a) firms with contracts and  37 percent (or about $2 billion) of contracting obligation dollars. The  results of the interviews and sample results cannot be generalized to all 68  district offices; however, the results of our file review sample can be  generalized to all files managed by the 5 district offices we included in our  review. We also interviewed SBA officials in the Office of Business  Development, Division of Program Certification and Eligibility, and district  staff to discuss their procedures for determining initial and continuing  eligibility, oversight efforts, technical assistance offered, and mechanisms  to help identify ineligible firms in the program. Appendix I discusses our  scope and methodology in further detail.", "We conducted our work in Boston, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; San  Antonio, Texas; San Francisco, California; and Washington, D.C., between  May 2009 and March 2010 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

Table 1  summarizes the key requirements.", "Participation in the 8(a) program lasts 9 years, and once it is completed, a  firm and the individual cannot reapply. The 9-year program tenure is  divided into two stages\u2014a developmental stage covering years 1 through  4, and a transitional stage covering years 5 through 9. During the  transitional years, firms are required to meet certain activity targets for  non-8(a) contracts to ensure they do not develop an unreasonable reliance  on the program. Additionally, firms in the 8(a) program are eligible to  receive sole-source and competitively awarded set-aside federal  contracts.", "As part of the 8(a) program, SBA developed the Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program,  in which experienced firms mentor 8(a) firms to enhance the capabilities  of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, provide various forms of business developmental  assistance, and improve the prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s ability to successfully compete for  contracts. To qualify initially as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, an 8(a) firm must meet one of  three conditions: (1) be in the developmental stage of the 8(a) program, or  (2) never have received an 8(a) contract, or (3) be of a size that is less than  half the size standard corresponding to its primary standard industry code.  The mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 enter into a written agreement that sets forth the  prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s needs and details the assistance the mentor commits to provide  to address those needs. SBA must review and approve the initial  agreement and annually evaluate specific mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 requirements.", "SBA\u2019s 8(a) program is delivered collaboratively by two departments of  SBA. The Office of Business Development (OBD) is responsible for policy  formation and the certifications of 8(a) applications, approval of mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 applications, as well as the approval of existing 8(a) firms that are  exiting the program (early graduations, approval of changes of ownership,  approval of voluntary withdrawals, approval of terminations, and  suspensions).

SBA may also graduate firms that have  successfully completed the program by substantially achieving the targets,  objectives, and goals in their business plans prior to the expiration of their  program terms, and demonstrated their ability to compete in the  marketplace without assistance from the program, or where one or more  of the disadvantaged owners no longer are economically disadvantaged (a  process known as early graduation). Criteria used to determine continuing  eligibility and associated conditions such as economic disadvantage  include factors such as personal assets, income, and net worth, while  criteria used to determine if a firm successfully met targets and objectives  include exceeding industry averages for economic success and owners  making excessive withdrawals of company funds or other assets.", "We selected a random sample of files from each of the five district offices  we visited to determine if district offices\u2019 practices for monitoring 8(a)  firms were consistent with requirements in regulations, policies, and  procedures. Specifically, we estimated that for the five district offices,  SBA failed to complete one or more annual required review procedures 55  percent of the time. Our estimates were based on a statistical sample of  123 annual review files from a population of 672 files. Of the 123 files  sampled, we identified 67 instances where SBA failed to complete one or  more annual review procedures related to eligibility determinations (a 55  percent rate). We tested seven specific annual review requirements  relating to continuing eligibility: (1) notifying 8(a) firms that they had  exceeded industry averages for economic success, (2) reviewing or  graduating 8(a) firms or providing an explanation for retention if they had  exceeded industry averages for 2 consecutive years, (3) reviewing net  worth or graduating firms in which individuals exceeded the net worth  threshold of $750,000, (4) performing eligibility reviews when required for  such cases as a change in the firm\u2019s ownership, (5) completing the  required annual reviews, (6) obtaining required supervisory reviews (and  signatures), and (7) imposing remedial actions or obtaining waivers for  firms not meeting business activity targets. Table 2 shows information on  the extent to which SBA did not complete these annual review  requirements.", "Taking action when a firm exceeded industry averages for economic  success by  notifying firms that exceeded four of seven industry averages for 1  year  graduating or explaining retention of firms that exceeded four of seven  industry averages for 2 consecutive years  Reviewing net worth or graduating firms in which individuals exceeded  adjusted net worth limitations   Performing required eligibility reviews because of a change in the firms\u2019  ownership  Imposing remedial actions or obtaining waivers for firms not meeting  business activity targets    Exceeding industry averages: Officials from two of the five district offices  told us that while the guidance requires notifying 8(a) firms when they  have exceeded industry averages for economic success, in practice the  districts have been using discretion in notifying the firm after the first year  in which this condition occurs. SBA procedures identify exceeding  industry averages as a criterion for considering that the firm has met its  goals and therefore may no longer be economically disadvantaged. The  notification is intended to make participants aware that they may be  subject to early graduation proceedings if they exceed industry averages  for 2 consecutive years. SBA procedures state that if the firm exceeds  industry averages for 2 consecutive years, the participant no longer can be  considered economically disadvantaged unless the BDS provides evidence  that early graduation is not warranted because of compelling reasons.  Officials from these district offices explained that they did not follow  these procedures, even though they were required, because they did not  think that exceeding industry averages always indicated that participants  no longer were economically disadvantaged. The level of staff knowledge  about calculations for industry averages and the way in which staff  entered the calculations into information systems also may have  contributed to failures to meet this requirement. One district office told us  it was not clear how the ratios were calculated. We also found errors in  the calculations of industry averages at another district office. As we  discuss in more detail later in the report, the industry ratio calculations  require the BDS to manually enter data into a template that will then  calculate the ratio of the firm\u2019s performance against that of industry. As  shown in table 2, we estimate that staff failed to complete this requirement  in about 26 percent of the cases in which a notification letter was required,  and in about 4 percent of cases in which industry averages were exceeded  for 2 consecutive years.", "Reviewing net worth or graduating firms in which individuals exceeded  adjusted net worth limitations: One of the clearest indicators of  economic disadvantage that SBA uses is the net worth requirement. The  regulations specifically state that for continued eligibility after admission  into the program, adjusted net worth must be less than $750,000. Our file  review shows that SBA retained an estimated 7 percent of the firms we  sampled, in which there was no evidence that staff reviewed the firms\u2019 net  worth, or retained firms in the program despite their exceeding the net  worth limits. Similarly, in our companion report investigating the  potential for 8(a) program fraud and abuse, we identified cases in which  SBA\u2019s files clearly indicated that the firms were not eligible for the 8(a)  program, yet SBA staff failed to terminate or graduate the firms from the  program. Later in this report we discuss different factors that may have  contributed to the retention of firms that clearly appeared to be no longer  eligible, including the BDSs\u2019 dual role of advocacy for and monitoring of  the firms and workload constraints.", "Completing eligibility reviews: We estimated that about 4 percent of our  file sample contained no evidence that SBA staff had performed a separate  required eligibility review. Eligibility reviews are required in cases in  which the BDS has reason to question a participant\u2019s eligibility, including a  change in the firm\u2019s ownership (the factor we used for our analysis).  Eligibility reviews are critical because they could uncover program  participants that no longer met control and ownership eligibility  requirements. Representatives from one district office we visited  explained that these reviews were a low priority compared with other  responsibilities, such as completing annual reviews and initial  certifications.", "Completing annual reviews: Although SBA is statutorily required to  perform annual reviews of 100 percent of 8(a) firms, we estimated that in  about 2 percent of our sample, the files contained no evidence that SBA  had performed the annual reviews. For example, in two cases, a district  office had no record on file that annual reviews had been performed, and  in three other cases it had bundled 2 years of reviews because of a change  in the internal deadline for completing annual reviews (it skipped an  annual review). Our sample of 123 files included only firms that received  contracts. As a result, SBA could be unaware that a potentially ineligible  firm had received contracts because it had not performed an annual  review.", "We also identified a few instances in which SBA failed to follow  procedural requirements related to the annual reviews, including not  consistently documenting supervisory reviews in one district and failing to  take remedial actions for firms not meeting their business activity targets.", "Documenting supervisory reviews: One district office did not always have  the required supervisory signatures on the BDSs\u2019 annual review  recommendations. Of the 64 files that we sampled in that district, 20  lacked evidence of supervisory review signatures. That is, it appeared that  only a BDS recommended a firm\u2019s retention or dismissal from the  program. Overall, we estimated that SBA did not meet this requirement for  about 23 percent of the files in the five district offices. The  noncompliance rate in this district may be attributable to the large size of  its 8(a) portfolio\u2014about 20 percent of all active fiscal year 2008 8(a) firms.  According to district officials, the office also had competing priorities,  such as the need to review applications for the Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program.  Nevertheless, SBA officials were not properly monitoring their staff in  these cases. Without the quality controls intended by the supervisory  reviews, SBA has limited assurances that the annual reviews are fulfilling  their intended purpose.", "Imposing remedial actions or obtaining waivers for firms not meeting  business activity targets: In about 10 percent of the files we reviewed,  district offices did not submit required documentation of remedial actions  or a waiver when a firm in the transitional phase of the program did not  meet its business activity targets. The remedial action is intended as an  incentive for firms to obtain non-8(a) contracts so that they will be  prepared to compete in the marketplace without the assistance of the 8(a)  program upon graduation. Firms are required to achieve their targets or  otherwise are not eligible to receive 8(a) sole-source contracts. By not  notifying firms and setting up a remedial plan when required, the BDSs\u2019  actions did not appear to be consistent with a key business development  activity intended to help firms develop and exit from the program.  Furthermore, SBA could be providing opportunities for potentially  ineligible firms to receive sole-source contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although SBA Has Proposed Changes to Its Regulations to Improve Eligibility Determinations, It Still Lacks Specific Guidance for Some Criteria", "paragraphs": ["Our file review results and interviews with district office officials  identified numerous instances in which staff did not consistently apply  objective standards relating to eligibility determinations. SBA lacks  specific criteria in its current regulations and procedures that relate to  some of the eligibility requirements such as determining whether a firm  should be graduated from the program when it exceeds size standards,  industry averages (such as total assets, net sales, working capital, or  pretax profit), limits for personal compensation and assets, and excessive  withdrawals. Furthermore, SBA guidance directs staff to rely on Office of  Hearings and Appeals (OHA) decisions to use as thresholds for eligibility  criteria, such as total assets and total compensation, in order to make  eligibility determinations. However, as we noted in our related  investigation, agency staff did not follow case law consistently.", "More specifically, we estimate that 17 percent of the firms had exceeded  one or more eligibility criteria for 2 consecutive years, indicating that the  firms may have been outgrowing the program, but were recommended by  SBA for retention. Although each criterion in and of itself may not be a  determinant for early graduation based on the current regulations, each is  an important factor in determining if these firms continue to meet  eligibility requirements and if they should remain in the program. SBA  considers the totality of circumstances to determine whether a firm has  met its goals and objectives and should be recommended for early  graduation.", "In two cases in one district office, firms had exceeded both average  compensation limits and the limits for excessive withdrawals for 2  consecutive years, and still were recommended for retention. The District  Director and staff at the district office agreed that the two cases were red  flags and that the firms should have been recommended for early  graduation or termination.", "In another example, at a different district office, one firm that, over its 8- year tenure in the 8(a) program. had exceeded (1) industry averages for 5  years (in 2 of these years, the firm could have been considered for early  graduation because it exceeded industry averages for 2 consecutive years),  (2) compensation limits by having an average salary of more than $200,000  for 2 years, (3) the size standard for its primary North American Industry  Classification System code, (4) and made excessive withdrawals in 1 year,  but in each year was recommended for retention. This firm had more than  $16 million in contracts by its sixth year in the program.", "We also found inconsistencies in the use of third-party sources to verify  firm-reported data. For instance, two districts told us they reviewed third- party sources such as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax transcripts,  debarments, and bank information such as withdrawals more routinely as  part of their annual review, while two other districts told us they had not  performed any third-party verification. At least in part, these  inconsistencies can be attributed to lack of specific guidance or criteria  regarding the need for third-party verification. Overall, the regulations  state that SBA may terminate a firm on the basis of discovering false  information, but contain few specific requirements to consult third-party  sources for continuing eligibility. For example, participants must submit  the IRS 4506-T transcript request form as part of the annual review  requirements, which allows SBA to request tax return information.  Additionally, the regulations suggest that staff should consult the federal  list of debarred and suspended firms, since such firms are ineligible for  admission to the 8(a) program. However, we found little evidence of  regulatory requirements to obtain other third-party verifications. As noted  in our report on the potential for 8(a) program fraud and abuse, validating  data against other government or third-party sources is a fraud preventive  control meant to keep ineligible firms from entering the program.   However, we found that SBA relied heavily on self-reported information  from the firms during the initial certification and annual reviews, with  limited data validation performed after the firms had entered the program.  Additionally, in that report we make a recommendation to assess the  feasibility of using additional third-party data sources and site visits, based  on random or risk-based criteria, to allow more independent verification  of firm-reported data.", "SBA recently proposed changes to its Small Business Size and 8(a)  Business Development Regulations to address technical issues as well as  make more substantive changes resulting from its experience in  implementing the current regulations. The agency last updated most of  these regulations in 1998. According to a senior SBA official, these  changes are intended to help SBA administer the program more  effectively. The proposed rules would introduce more detailed guidance  and allow for less staff judgment, particularly for the standards that  appeared to be associated with the inconsistencies in the annual review  procedures in our review of 8(a) case files. For example, the proposed  regulations define more specific thresholds for considering an individual\u2019s  personal assets and compensation, and whether a firm has exceeded size  standards. However, the proposed regulations do not introduce more  specific requirements relating to exceeding industry averages, and would  increase staff flexibility to make judgments relating to excessive  withdrawals. Furthermore, the proposed rule changes do not address  under what circumstances or to what extent staff should verify firm- reported information with third-party sources. According to SBA, the  proposed rules attempt to address areas where the current regulations  needed more clarity to ensure consistency with SBA policy as well as  areas where the current regulations may unreasonably restrict  participants. For example, the proposed rule changes allow for flexibility  in judgment regarding excessive withdrawals because SBA believes that it  is important that SBA look at the totality of the circumstances in  determining whether to include a specific amount as a withdrawal in an  effort to prevent some firms from circumventing excessive withdrawal  limitations. However, the lack of specific criteria in the current regulations  and procedures reduces assurances that the BDSs are making consistent  and objective determinations about 8(a) firms\u2019 continued eligibility in the  program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Not Assessed BDS Workload, a Significant Portion of Which Is Devoted to Annual Reviews, a Fact That Limits Other 8(a) Activities", "paragraphs": ["BDSs devote significant time and resources to complying with the  statutory requirement to perform annual reviews on 100 percent of 8(a)  firms, a fact that affects the time and resources they can devote to other  8(a) activities.

The BDS also has  an advocacy role\u2014maintaining an ongoing responsibility to assist the  participant in developing the business to the fullest extent possible. This  includes striving to increase both the dollar value and the percentage of  8(a) contracts through communication of procurement activities, training,  and counseling. SBA guidance requires the BDS to be the primary provider  in helping firms develop business plans, seek loans, and receive  counseling on finances, marketing, and management practices.", "Officials in all five of the district offices we visited indicated that they met  the 100 percent annual review goal for fiscal year 2008 but stated it was a  time- and resource-intensive process. For example, district staff estimated  that the annual review process consumed from about 40 to 70 percent of  their time. BDSs in the district offices told us their individual portfolios  ranged from about 30 to 140 firms, depending on their experience level.  Three districts noted that BDS turnover resulted in newer staff initially  taking more time to process reviews and having smaller portfolios while  they were learning their job. One of the districts told us that all available  staff in the district office, including staff not assigned to the 8(a) program,  had to assist in completing and processing annual reviews in order to meet  the review goal. District office staff also told us that they spent a  significant amount of time and resources following up with 8(a) firms to  have them submit required documentation such as tax and business  financial information, which also slowed the review process. District  offices indicated that firms that did not have contracts were especially  prone to submitting documents late because annual reviews were not a  priority for them. These delays, in turn, reduced the amount of time that  the BDSs had to spend on firms that exhibited a high risk of  misrepresentation or noncompliance with 8(a) eligibility requirements\u2014 monitoring necessary for effective program oversight.", "Furthermore, in our November 2008 report we noted that demands of the  annual review process and resource constraints affected SBA\u2019s ability to  conduct other program activities. For this report, some districts noted  that the annual review goal affected their ability to perform site visits;  follow up on issues that warranted more attention, such as red flags  identified in the prior year\u2019s annual review; and conduct other core  business development activities. For instance, the frequency of site visits  varied in the five offices we visited. One district office told us that staff  were able to conduct site visits for all firms, but another district conducted  site visits for about half of its firms, and the remaining districts performed  site visits on a limited basis, citing circumstances such as a firm  transferring into the district or confirming that a firm was operating at a  bona fide place of business. Another district stated that staff do not have  time to follow up on red flags such as concerns identified in prior annual  reviews because of the emphasis on meeting the annual review goal.  Another district also told us that meeting the 100 percent annual review  goal has limited the district\u2019s ability to get out and educate agencies and  firms. This included providing outreach and awareness training. Finally,  another district told us the annual reviews have affected its ability to  provide developmental assistance and services to address the 8(a) firm\u2019s  needs. The officials also stated that it was hard to develop working  relationships with the firms because of the amount of work reports,  projects, and other duties assigned.", "Although BDSs have been challenged to perform all their responsibilities,  SBA has not yet assessed their workload to ensure they could carry out  their responsibilities, as we recommended in our 2008 report.

For example, according to its 2006  Performance and Accountability Report, a main contributing factor in the  agency\u2019s inability to complete annual reviews of all 8(a) firms was a lack  of staff resources in the district offices.

District office officials indicated that  information discrepancies existed between the two systems and required  dual data entry of some firm information. SBA officials stated they were  reconciling the information in E-8(a) and BDMIS to address discrepancies.

For example, one district told us that learning  the BDMIS system was challenging initially for some 8(a) participants and  depended on participants\u2019 skills and abilities to enter information into the  system. Another district noted that a calculator that assesses a firm\u2019s  performance in its respective industry was a positive addition to the  BDMIS system, allowing the BDS to move through reviews more quickly  and efficiently. But the BDS still had to enter firm financial data manually  into the calculator, a fact that could increase the likelihood for data entry  errors. (The industry ratio calculations require the BDS to manually enter  data into a template that calculates the ratio between the firm\u2019s  performance and that of industry.) For example, at one district we visited,  we observed BDS staff manually entering industry performance ratios.  District staff also told us that BDMIS\u2019s functionality has been limited  because the system did not allow staff to access complete firm  information, such as contract and historical information, and develop  reports. Some district offices also told us that the BDSs\u2019 overall workload  has not improved and that BDSs spend a significant amount of their time  following up with 8(a) firms to submit relevant annual review documents.  Despite these challenges, district staff with whom we spoke said BDMIS  has been helping to achieve better organization and tracking and  anticipated that when fully operational, it could save time and increase  transparency.", "SBA officials also told us that they have been planning to upgrade BDMIS,  which currently is operating in its first version.

District staff told us they rely on the 8(a) firm and federal agencies to  provide contract information that is used in the annual review to  determine a firm\u2019s ratio of 8(a) and non-8(a) contracts. As the firm  matures, the goal for 8(a) firms is to increase the amount of non-8(a)  contract work and decrease reliance on 8(a) contracts.

However, our file review at five district offices found  inconsistencies in the annual review policies and procedures followed by  SBA staff related to program eligibility. This suggests a need for greater  monitoring by SBA and potentially a need for more guidance and training  to ensure greater consistency in the performance of required annual  review procedures.", "Furthermore, the lack of specific criteria in the current regulations related  to eligibility determinants such as size standards and industry averages  and the dual roles of the BDSs\u2014providing oversight and being an advocate  for the firm\u2014may have contributed to the variation in annual review  practices we observed. By clarifying guidance, further detailing or  expanding procedures, and emphasizing the importance of quality  controls, SBA could help eliminate ambiguities, improve the quality of  reviews, and provide clearer criteria against which to judge eligibility and  ensure that only intended recipients benefit from program participation.", "Workload constraints of BDS staff may have been a contributing factor to  the inconsistencies and deficiencies identified in our review of annual  review files in the five districts that we visited. While the annual review  process is central to ensuring program integrity, SBA\u2019s statutory  requirement to conduct annual reviews of 100 percent of 8(a) firms also is  time- and resource-intensive. The workload demands associated with the  annual review process likely have affected the quality of these reviews as  well as detracted from the time staff have been able to devote to other  core 8(a) program responsibilities, ranging from technical assistance to  mentoring. As we previously recommended and continue to believe, an  assessment of the BDS workload could help ensure the BDSs can carry  out their responsibilities and determine what mechanisms can be used to  prioritize or redistribute their workload. Such an assessment also would  be helpful in assessing the multiple roles and responsibilities of BDS staff,  including ways to mitigate the conflicting roles of business development,  and ensuring that only eligible firms are allowed to participate in the  program. In a fiscally challenged environment and with workload  constraints as a constant, it is important that the agency review staff and  resource allocations and identify process efficiencies wherever possible.", "Changes that SBA recently made to termination procedures, coupled with  the increase in terminations overall, may help to alleviate workload  constraints for district office staff. As we noted in our November 2008  report, the inefficient termination process consumed scarce SBA  resources and may have affected business development activities. District  staff could take advantage of the revised, more efficient termination  process to minimize time spent waiting for documents from firms and free  up time for business development and other activities.

We developed a data  collection instrument (DCI) to collect key annual review data from each  file. The DCI was pretested in 2 district offices and modified based on  these tests. We also analyzed mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 data to identify prot\u00e9g\u00e9  firms that may have multiple mentors, which are against regulation, and  mentor firms that may have multiple prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, which is allowable only  when specially authorized by SBA.

A total of 672 firms  met our study criteria and are shown in table 4.", "We randomly selected the indicated number of cases within each regional  office. We treated this as a stratified random sample and weighted the  sample cases accordingly for our analysis. Our estimates are statistically  representative for all files maintained in these 5 SBA regional offices.", "Because we treated our file review as a stratified random sample, we  assumed our sample was only one of a large number that could have been  drawn. Because each sample could have provided different estimates, we  expressed our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s  results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would  contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could  have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the  confidence intervals based on the file review includes the true values in  the sample population. The 95 percent confidence intervals for each of the  estimates are summarized in table 5.", "We performed appropriate data reliability procedures for our sample  testing at the 5 district offices and analysis of inappropriate mentor-  prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationships. We compared SBA data with data from other  sources such as FPDS-NG and the Central Contractor Registry, performed  electronic testing, reviewed related documentation and internal controls,  and performed interviews with knowledgeable agency officials. We  determined that the data were sufficient to perform our sample testing and  project our results to the 5 district offices in our population of 8(a) firms.  We also determined through these methods that data relating to mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 participants were sufficient to report on descriptive statistics of  mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms with contracts. The discrepancies we found in the  general list of mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 participants are documented within the  report.", "To assess the extent that external mechanisms exist, such as complaints  by other 8(a) firms, to help ensure that only eligible firms participate, we  interviewed agency and SBA Office of Inspector General officials, and we  reviewed SBA OIG complaint data. We also interviewed officials in SBA\u2019s  Office of Business Development, Division of Program Certification and  Eligibility, and district office staff to discuss their procedures for  determining initial and continuing eligibility, oversight efforts, technical  assistance offered, and mechanisms to help identify ineligible firms in the  program.", "We conducted our work in Boston, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; San  Antonio, Texas; San Francisco, California; and Washington, D.C., between  May 2009 and March 2010 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Harry Medina (Assistant Director),  Carl Barden, Tania Calhoun, Janet Fong, Cindy Gilbert, Julia Kennon, Amy  Moran Lowe, Barbara Roesmann, Verginie Tarpinian, and William Woods  made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
