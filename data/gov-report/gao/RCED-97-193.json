Proponents of incentives maintain that they are a cost-effective way to promote economic development and that incentives have become a necessity because of the economic competitiveness that exists between regions and states. Proponents believe that business incentives have a positive effect on business-location decisions. On the other hand, opponents contend that relocating businesses from one area or state to another is a zero-sum game that, in the aggregate, creates little, if any, economic benefit. Opponents also contend that the dollars spent to provide incentives would be better used if applied to other services believed to be more important in economic development, such as improvements to the infrastructure and investments in human resources and education.", "Concern also exists that federal programs are being used and, in some cases, misused to provide incentives for luring businesses into relocating from one area to another.

The extent to which these incentives are paid by the federal government or by state and local governments is difficult to ascertain. Local economic development organizations may receive money from state programs that commingle state and federal dollars. Even if the ultimate source of the funding for business incentives is from state or local governments, federal expenditures may influence the level of incentives offered by state and local governments. If federal funds are used for an activity that the state or community would have undertaken anyway, money is freed up for states or communities to use for such activities as the provision of business relocation incentives.", "The use of state and local incentives expanded during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. However, the growth has slowed in the 1990s. The National Association of State Development Agencies stated that in 1994, over 500 different incentive programs were in use by states. A 1997 report by the Council of State Governments shows that over 40 states now offer tax and financial programs to create, retain, or lure jobs. But 32 states plan to hold the line or cut spending over the next 5 years. These states cited many reasons for not expanding their incentives, including a feeling that (1) current levels were sufficient, hence, little marginal impact could be expected from expanding the programs and (2) there was little payoff from bidding wars between states to lure businesses. Also, some states report a change in emphasis from attracting new firms to retaining existing ones.", "Many studies have examined the relationship between state and/or local business incentives and changes in economic activity. Most early studies found that incentives had little or no effect on an area\u2019s economic development. For instance, studies done in 1979 and 1983 found that state business incentives had little influence on the stimulation of new business, measured either by the number of firms or by the firm\u2019s size. Wage rates, energy costs, and the availability of skilled labor were all found to be more important influences on the creation and expansion of business firms.", "Later work has refined this conclusion. Incentives may produce an impact in some industries, such as manufacturing. A 1991 study found that manufacturing and capital-intensive industries are more affected by tax considerations than are other businesses. Also, state and local business policy may have stronger influences on where firms locate within a region. The selection of a region for an investment may be driven by economic criteria, such as the availability of labor and transportation and proximity to markets, while the selection of a particular site within a region may be influenced by the availability of incentives. A 1983 study, for instance, found that property taxes were an important disincentive to firms relocating within the Detroit metropolitan area. The magnitude of these impacts and the set of industries for which they might occur is still the subject of debate in academic publications.", "Surveys of businesses, such as the Fortune Market Research Survey, also find that relocation incentives are not the most important factors in plant location decisions. The Fortune Market Research Survey ranks financing inducements 15th in importance, far behind such factors as worker productivity, efficient transportation, and the state or local government\u2019s attitude toward businesses. Both academic researchers and government officials who administer economic development programs cite several factors that may limit the effectiveness of business incentives. The value of the incentives offered is often small in relation to the differences between locations in the costs incurred by firms, such as labor and transportation costs. Incentives may represent a zero-sum gain, in which the value of one state\u2019s incentives is offset by the incentives offered by competing states. Finally, incentives offered to new businesses to locate in an area may give them a competitive edge over existing businesses, thus causing a shift in economic activity from established firms to new firms but causing little change in a region\u2019s overall economic activity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided Agriculture, Commerce, HHS, HUD, Labor, Transportation, and EPA with a draft of this report for review and comment.
