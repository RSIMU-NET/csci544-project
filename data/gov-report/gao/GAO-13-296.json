Threats to critical infrastructure are not limited to natural disasters, as demonstrated by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Originally developed by DHS in 2006, and consistent with the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, the NCIPP identifies and prioritizes nationally significant critical infrastructure each year. However, Members of Congress and some state officials have raised questions about changes DHS has made to its approach for creating the list and the impact of these changes.", "GAO was asked to review DHS management of the program. GAO assessed the extent to which DHS has (1) changed its criteria for developing the list, identified the impact, if any, of these changes, and validated its approach, (2) worked with states and SSAs to develop the list, and (3) reported to Congress on the NCIPP. GAO, among other things, reviewed laws, DHS policies and procedures; analyzed the lists from 2007 through 2012; and interviewed DHS, SSA, and state homeland security officials selected based on their involvement with the program and geographic diversity. The interviews are not generalizable but provide insights."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has made several changes to its criteria for including assets on the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) list of the nation's highest-priority infrastructure, but has not identified the impact of these changes or validated its approach. In 2009, DHS changed the criteria to make the list entirely consequence based--that is, based on the effect of an event on public health and safety, and economic, psychological, and government mission impacts. Subsequent changes introduced specialized criteria for some sectors and assets. For example, infrastructure that has received a specific, credible threat, but otherwise does not meet NCIPP criteria, may be included on the list. DHS's changes to the NCIPP criteria have changed the composition of the NCIPP list, which has had an impact on users of the list, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency. However, DHS has not reviewed the impact of changes on users nor validated its approach to developing the list. While the change to an entirely consequence-based list created a common approach to identify infrastructure and align the program with applicable laws and the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, recent criteria changes to accommodate certain sectors and assets represent a departure from this common approach, which could hinder DHS's ability to compare infrastructure across sectors. Program officials noted they would like to validate the NCIPP, but they have not yet submitted a proposal to DHS management. An independent peer review--a best practice in risk management--would better position DHS to reasonably assure that the NCIPP list identifies the nation's highest-priority infrastructure.", "To develop the list, DHS has consulted with both states and sector specific agencies (SSA)--federal agencies responsible for protection and resiliency efforts among individual critical infrastructure sectors, such as energy, transportation, and dams. Since changing the NCIPP criteria in 2009, DHS has taken proactive steps to help states nominate assets to the list. These steps include providing on-site assistance, minimizing changes to the criteria, conducting outreach to encourage participation in an NCIPP working group (which includes SSAs), and providing explanations of why nominated assets do not make the list. DHS recognizes that states, in particular, face challenges--such as resource and budgetary constraints--associated with nominating assets, and has taken actions to address these challenges and reduce the burden on states.", "GAO could not verify that DHS is meeting statutory requirements to report annually to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives on the NCIPP list. DHS officials prepared documents that generally contained information consistent with statutory reporting requirements, but they were uncertain whether they had been delivered to the committees because they do not have records to verify they were delivered. An approach to verify the delivery of the required reports, such as documenting or recording the transactions, would better position DHS to ensure that it is in compliance with its statutory reporting requirements and that it provides the committees with the information needed to perform oversight of the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS commission an external peer review and develop an approach to verify that the annual reports are provided to the requisite committees of Congress.

Damage  included flooding in the nation\u2019s financial center that affected major  transportation systems and caused widespread and prolonged power  outages. The damage and resulting chaos disrupted government and  business functions alike, producing cascading effects far beyond the  location of these events. Threats against critical infrastructure are not  limited to natural disasters, as demonstrated by the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001, and the 2005 suicide bombings in London, where  terrorists disrupted the city\u2019s transportation system, which resulted in a  breakdown of its mobile telecommunication infrastructure.

The NIPP sets forth a risk management framework  and details the roles and responsibilities of DHS and other federal, state,  regional, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners implementing  the NIPP, and emphasizes the importance of collaboration and partnering   For example, the NIPP outlines the  with and among the various partners.roles and responsibilities of sector-specific agencies (SSA)\u2014the various  federal departments and agencies that are responsible for critical  infrastructure protection and resiliency activities\u2014in 18 sectors, such as  the chemical, dams, energy, and transportation sectors.the SSAs and their sectors.", "Consistent with the NIPP, provisions of the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11  Commission Act) amended title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002  by requiring the Secretary of DHS to establish and maintain a national  database of systems and assets determined to be vital and the loss,  interruption, incapacity, or destruction of which would have a negative or  debilitating effect on the economic security, public health, or safety of the  United States, any state, or any local government, as otherwise  determined appropriate for inclusion by the Secretary. 9/11 Commission Act required the Secretary of DHS to establish and  maintain a single prioritized list of systems and assets included in the  national database that the Secretary determines would, if destroyed or  disrupted, cause national or regional catastrophic effects. The 9/11  Commission Act also required that DHS report annually to the Committee  on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the  Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives on,  among other things, any significant challenges in compiling the database  or list and, if appropriate, the extent to which the database or list has  been used to allocate federal funds to prevent, reduce, mitigate, or  respond to acts of terrorism.", "See 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 124l(a)(1).", "Originally developed in 2006, the National Critical Infrastructure  Prioritization Program (NCIPP) uses a tiered approach to identify  nationally significant critical infrastructure each year based on the  consequences associated with the disruption or destruction of those  critical infrastructure.

According to the NIPP, the list identifies nationally significant critical  infrastructure that DHS can use to enhance decision making, including  implementing Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  homeland security grant programs and federal incident management  planning and response efforts.", "In recent years, Members of Congress and some state officials have  raised questions as to whether and why DHS has changed its approach  for assigning assets to the list, with some assets either dropping off the  list or being assigned to a new risk level. In addition, they have raised  questions about the effect changes to the program may have had on  states and SSAs that work with DHS to develop the list, as well as those  that use the list. Given the importance of the NCIPP list to various  aspects of DHS\u2019s critical infrastructure protection and resiliency efforts,  you asked that we examine DHS\u2019s management of the program.  Specifically, we assessed the extent to which DHS has  changed its criteria for developing the NCIPP list; identified the  impact, if any, of these changes; and validated its approach; worked with states and SSAs to develop the NCIPP list; and  reported to Congress on the NCIPP.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed applicable laws, regulations,  and directives as well as Office of Infrastructure Protection policies and  procedures for developing and managing the NCIPP list, and assessed  the impact of changes on how the list is used. We also obtained and  assessed Office of Infrastructure Protection data on the program by  identifying and analyzing the distribution of high-priority assets included  on the finalized NCIPP lists by sector and state from fiscal years 2007  through 2012. We used our analysis to select 8 of 18 sectors\u2014the  banking and finance, defense industrial base, chemical, energy,  transportation systems, agriculture and food, government facilities, and  dams sectors. We selected these sectors to obtain a mix of sectors that  experienced the largest and smallest percentage change in the  distribution of assets on the NCIPP list between fiscal years 2009 and  2011 because of program changes that DHS made during this period.  The information from our analysis of these sectors is not generalizable to  the universe of all sectors. However, it provides valuable insights into  yearly changes in the distribution of assets on the NCIPP list among a  diverse group of sectors. We then compared the results of our analysis  with various criteria, including the NIPP; DHS guidelines shared with state  and federal partners on the processes and methodologies used to identify  assets to be included on the NCIPP list; and Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. We interviewed IASD officials in  Washington, D.C., responsible for administering the NCIPP program. We  also conducted a sensitivity analysis with the FEMA Urban Area Security  Initiative (UASI) grant risk formula\u2014which uses NCIPP data, among other  information\u2014to determine how, if at all, the changes to the list could  affect allocations for this grant. We discussed the sources of the data and  quality assurance procedures with Office of Infrastructure Protection and  FEMA officials and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to  provide a general overview of the program; we reported on data  limitations in prior work and have noted them in this report, where  applicable.", "To address our second objective, we interviewed 10 SSA officials in  Washington, D.C., representing the 8 selected sectors to determine  whether DHS worked with these SSAs to develop the list, and if so, the  extent to which consultations occurred. Specifically, DHS was the SSA for  4 of the sectors\u2014the chemical, dams, government facilities, and  transportation systems sectors. The Departments of Energy, Defense,  and the Treasury were the SSAs for 3 sectors\u2014the energy, defense  industrial base, and banking and finance sectors, respectively. Two  SSAs, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug  Administration, share responsibility for the agriculture and food sector. In  addition, we contacted officials representing homeland security offices in  15 states to obtain their views on DHS efforts to work with them to  develop the NCIPP list. We selected these states because they contained  a range in the number of assets on the NCIPP list. We also selected the  15 states based on their distribution in each of the 9 Protective Security  Advisor (PSA) regions\u2014the Office of Infrastructure Protection\u2019s field office  designations for managing its PSA program\u2014and selected at least 1  state in each of the 9 regions.

The criteria for level 1 assets  focused on consequences\u2014the effects of an adverse event. The criteria  for level 2 assets focused generally on capacity\u2014the number of people  that use an asset or output generated by an asset, such as the number of  people that occupy a commercial office building, the daily ridership of a  mass transit system, or the number of people served by a water utility.  DHS officials told us that the level 1 consequence-based criteria and  thresholds were initially established at the beginning of the program at the  discretion of the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, who  sought to identify infrastructure that the destruction of which could be  expected to cause impacts similar to those caused by the attacks of   In contrast, the initial level 2  September 11 and Hurricane Katrina.criteria were generally capacity based in order to identify the most critical  assets within each of the 18 sectors. However, the capacity-based criteria  often differed by sector, making it difficult to compare criticality across  sectors and therefore identify the highest-priority critical infrastructure on  a national level.", "In 2009, DHS changed the level 2 criteria to make the NCIPP list entirely  consequence based, a change that brought its approach more into line  with statutory requirements and, consistent with the NIPP risk  management framework, allowed for comparison across sectors.

As figure 1 shows, the level 1 thresholds are higher than level 2  thresholds and therefore represent the most nationally critical assets.", "According to officials and agency documents, DHS changed the level 2  criteria to be consequence based for several reasons. First, NCIPP  program officials stated that they changed the criteria to align the list with  statutory requirements. Specifically, DHS interpreted the statute\u2019s  requirement that it identify assets that \u201cwould, if destroyed or disrupted,  cause national or regional catastrophic effects,\u201d as a call for  consequence-based criteria.of assets prioritized using capacity-based criteria demonstrated that the  initial level 2 criteria were not sufficient to fully identify assets capable of  causing catastrophic events. Second, program officials stated that they  changed the criteria to allow for comparisons across sectors, which is  consistent with the NIPP. The NIPP states that using a common approach  with consistent assumptions and metrics increases the ability to make  comparisons across sectors, different geographic regions, or different  types of events. Third, DHS also changed the criteria to improve the utility  of the list. According to the NCIPP guidance, prior to 2009, assets  designated as level 2 on the list experienced instability\u2014assets being  added and removed from year to year\u2014which frustrated efforts to use the  list for risk management planning and engagement, while assets  designated as level 1 on the list\u2014which had always been consequence  based\u2014remained relatively stable year to year.", "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease of cloven-hoofed  animals such as cattle, swine, and sheep. Infected animals develop a fever and blisters on  their tongue and lips, and between their hooves. Many animals recover from a FMD  infection, but the disease leaves them debilitated and causes losses in meat and milk  production. FMD does not have human health implications. According to the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, a 2001 outbreak of FMD in the United Kingdom resulted in the  slaughter of millions of animals and economic losses conservatively estimated at $14.7  billion.

Under the Catastrophic Economic Impacts  Project, infrastructure that meets only the level 1 consequence threshold  for economic impact, but no other criteria, is added to the list as a level 2  asset. DHS officials explained that the project was added to account for  instances when economic impact may be the primary impact. For  example, the officials noted that a collapse of the U.S. financial system  would likely not cause a large number of prompt fatalities or evacuations,  but would cause catastrophic national impacts nonetheless. Meanwhile,  the Threats to Infrastructure Initiative allows infrastructure that has  received a specific, credible threat from a malicious actor, but otherwise  would not meet NCIPP list criteria, to be added to the list as a level 2  asset. Unlike the other NCIPP criteria, the Threats to Infrastructure  Initiative focuses on the threat to infrastructure rather than the  consequences that may result from a specific event, which could  complicate comparisons across assets and sectors. DHS officials told us  that infrastructure with specific and credible threats were always included  on the NCIPP list, but were historically added based on information from  the intelligence community. The addition of the initiative allowed states  to nominate critical infrastructure under the same scenario based on state  and local intelligence information, such as that collected by fusion  centers. According to DHS officials, they adjudicate Threats to  Infrastructure Initiative nominations by determining whether the threat to  an asset is specific and credible. As of fiscal year 2012, approximately  60 assets and systems have been added to the NCIPP list as a result of  these new criteria.", "In 2009, DHS also changed the format of the NCIPP list by expanding the  type of infrastructure that could be nominated to the list to include clusters  and systems of critical infrastructure in an effort to characterize the  relationship among some infrastructure, such as dependencies and  interdependencies, which was consistent with the statute and NIPP.  According to the NCIPP guidance, clusters or systems of critical  infrastructure are made up of two or more associated or interconnected  assets or nodes that can be disrupted through a single event, resulting in  regional or national consequences that meet the NCIPP criteria  thresholds. An asset is a single facility with a fixed location that functions  as a single entity (although it can contain multiple buildings or structures)  and meets the NCIPP criteria by itself. A node is a single facility, similar to  an asset, that does not meet the NCIPP criteria individually but does meet  the criteria when grouped with other nodes or assets in a cluster or  system. Figure 2 provides an illustration of an asset, a node, a cluster,  and a system.", "Because nodes do not meet the NCIPP criteria on their own, they are not  included on the NCIPP list, but are identified on a separate list that is  associated with the NCIPP list. For example, a group of nodes or assets  making up a cluster would be listed on the NCIPP list under the name of  the cluster, such as the ABC Cluster, but one would have to consult the  associated list of nodes to identify the specific facilities that make up the  listed cluster. The concept of clusters and systems is consistent with the  statute and NIPP risk management framework. The law states that the  prioritized list of critical infrastructure shall contain both systems and  assets included in the national asset database, and the NIPP states that  to the extent possible, risk assessments should assess the dependencies  and interdependencies associated with each identified asset, system, or  network.

In May 2012, we  reported that PSCD was unable to track the extent to which it conducted  security surveys and vulnerability assessments on NCIPP level 1 and  level 2 assets because of (1) inconsistencies between the databases  used to identify the high-priority assets and to identify surveys and  assessments completed, and (2) the change in the format and  organization of the NCIPP list that converted some assets previously  listed as level 1 or level 2 into a cluster or system.fiscal year 2012 NCIPP list, DHS has begun to assign unique numerical  identifiers to each NCIPP asset, cluster, and system, which officials told  us has helped DHS track how many security surveys and vulnerability  assessments it conducts on high-priority assets. The officials also told us  that they anticipate fewer challenges associated with the list since the   Beginning with the  number of assets, clusters, and systems on the NCIPP list has remained  relatively stable from fiscal years 2011 to 2012. However, as discussed  earlier, the number of nodes associated with the NCIPP list has increased  substantially, growing from more than 2,500 in fiscal year 2011 to almost  4,000 in fiscal year 2012, which could further challenge PSA\u2019s ability to  conduct outreach and prioritize site visits to critical infrastructure for its  protection programs.", "PSCD officials in Washington, D.C. further told us that they do not have  criteria establishing how PSAs should assess an NCIPP cluster or system  that may contain many different nodes. The number of nodes in an  NCIPP cluster or system can vary from two to several dozen and may be  geographically dispersed. For example, one PSA told us that nodes in the  same cluster may not have the same owner and could be part of a  multistate system. Another PSA said that because several nodes in a  system may not be the same (i.e., different types of facilities, different  facility owners, or located in different areas), he generally conducts an  assessment of each node in order to consider an assessment of a system  complete. He explained that the facilities would have to be identical in  order to conduct a single assessment for separate nodes, which he noted  is rarely the case. Because it is difficult to prioritize which nodes within  clusters or systems may be the most important for conducting  assessments, the increase in the number of nodes associated with the  NCIPP list could have the effect of complicating PSA efforts to conduct  outreach to and assessments on the nation\u2019s highest-priority  infrastructure. PSCD officials told us they view this as a challenge, but  they do not characterize it as a significant challenge. Further, they stated  that while the treatment of nodes within NCIPP clusters or systems has  not been specifically addressed in current program policies or guidance,  they do not believe that this challenge has affected their ability to  effectively prioritize facilities to receive security surveys and  assessments. In January 2013, a PSCD official told us that PSCD is  considering new guidance that would clarify how PSAs should approach  nodes when conducting outreach or prioritizing visits for voluntary  protection programs.", "DHS does not have a process for identifying the impact of changes to the  list on its users and has not reviewed the impact of these changes on  users. However, program officials told us that they work closely with the  primary users of the list to understand how the data are used. According  to officials, they recognize that changes to the NCIPP list may have an  impact on users of the list, but they consider these impacts to be minor.  For example, one program official told us that the changes in the number  of level 1 and level 2 assets rarely have a significant effect on the amount  of grant funding allocated to states or cities, because of the additional  inputs considered in the FEMA risk formula that determine the grant  allocations. However, as previously demonstrated through our analysis,  even small changes to the NCIPP list counts can have an impact on UASI  grant allocations when accounting for all of the additional inputs  considered in FEMA\u2019s risk formula. The officials also recognized that  changes from the fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2011 NCIPP lists, which  significantly reduced the number of assets on the list, required PSCD to  reset its performance metrics for conducting its voluntary security survey  and assessment programs. However, officials told us that the assets on  the NCIPP list have remained relatively stable since fiscal year 2011;  therefore, the officials believe that changes to the list would have a minor  impact on PSAs\u2019 outreach activities. While our analysis shows that the  number of assets on the NCIPP list remained fairly constant from fiscal  year 2011 to 2012, it also shows that the number of nodes on the  associated nodes list continued to grow and almost doubled during this  time. As discussed, the increase in nodes may complicate PSA efforts to  conduct outreach to and assessments on the nation\u2019s highest-priority  infrastructure. Additionally, the officials told us that, internally, changes to  the NCIPP list do not have an impact on DHS\u2019s ability to identify and  prioritize critical infrastructure during an incident because the list is just  one of many information sources they consult when developing an event- specific infrastructure of concern list to guide incident response efforts.", "While the change to an entirely consequence-based list created a  common approach to identify infrastructure and align the program with the  statute and NIPP, recent and planned criteria changes to accommodate  certain sectors and assets represent a departure from this common  approach, which could hinder DHS\u2019s ability to compare infrastructure  across sectors. For example, the agriculture and food sector has criteria  that are different from those of all other sectors. Furthermore, DHS has  not validated its approach to developing the list to ensure that it  accurately reflects the nation\u2019s highest-priority critical infrastructure.", "The NIPP calls for risk assessments\u2014such as NCIPP efforts\u2014to be  complete, reproducible, documented, and defensible to produce results  that can contribute to cross-sector risk comparisons for supporting  investment, planning, and resource prioritization decisions. Table 1  provides a description of these core criteria for risk assessments.", "DHS could not provide documentation explaining how the threshold levels  were established, such as the methodology for developing the NCIPP  criteria or the analysis used to support the criteria, because, according to  agency officials, the agency undertook an information technology change  in the spring of 2012 that resulted in the loss of agency e-mails and  program documentation. Nevertheless, as previously noted, officials told  us the criteria and thresholds were established at the discretion of the  Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection. Program officials noted  that they review the list on an annual basis but that the list has not been  independently verified and validated by an external peer review. These  officials believe a peer review would enable DHS to determine whether its  efforts to develop the NCIPP list are based on analytically sound  methodology and whether it has appropriate procedures in place to  ensure that the NCIPP list is defensible and reproducible.", "We have previously reported that peer reviews are a best practice in risk  management and that independent expert review panels can provide  objective reviews of complex issues. An independent peer review to  validate the NCIPP criteria and list development process would better  position DHS to reasonably assure that, consistent with the NIPP risk  management framework, federal and state partners that use the NCIPP  list have sound information when making risk management and resource  allocation decisions. According to the NIPP, having sound information for  making those decisions is critical for focusing attention on those  protection and resiliency activities that bring the greatest return on  investment.", "In August 2012, NCIPP program officials told us they would like to  establish a peer review to validate the program because officials believe  the list has stabilized and now consider the program to be in a  \u201cmaintenance phase.\u201d In December 2012, the program director told us  that IASD drafted and submitted a proposal to the Assistant Secretary for  Infrastructure Protection in November 2012 that proposed different  approaches for reviewing the NCIPP, including a peer review of the  criteria used to decide which assets and systems should be placed on the  list and the process for doing so. At that time, DHS officials said that they  could not provide a copy of the draft proposal because it had not been  approved by management. As of January 2013, IASD told us that the  proposal had not been submitted to the Assistant Secretary for  Infrastructure Protection as originally discussed, that it was unclear when  the proposal would be submitted, and that it remained uncertain whether  a peer review would be approved.", "The National Research Council of the National Academies has also  recommended that DHS improve its risk analyses for infrastructure  protection by validating the models and submitting them to external peer  review. According to the council, periodic reviews and evaluations of  risk model outputs are important for transparency with respect to decision  makers. These reviews should involve specialists in modeling and in the  problems that are being addressed and should address the structure of  the model, the types and certainty of the data, and how the model is  intended to be used. Peer reviews can also identify areas for  improvement. As we have previously reported, independent peer reviews  cannot ensure the success of a model, but they can increase the  probability of success by improving the technical quality of projects and  the credibility of the decision-making process. Thus, an independent  peer review would better position DHS to provide reasonable assurance  that the NCIPP criteria and list development process is reproducible and  defensible given the recent and planned changes, and that critical  infrastructure protection efforts are being prioritized on the nation\u2019s  highest-priority infrastructure as intended by the NIPP risk management  framework."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Taken Actions to Improve Its Consultation with States and SSAs to Address Challenges Developing the NCIPP List", "paragraphs": ["DHS has taken various actions to work with states and SSAs, consistent  with statutory requirements and the NIPP, to identify and prioritize critical  infrastructure.

In 2009, DHS\u2019s  outreach to states and SSAs consisted of issuing a memorandum to  obtain input on the proposed change to consequence-based criteria.  Since 2009, DHS has taken various actions to address state nomination  challenges and to reduce the burden on states. For example, in 2009,  DHS revised its list development process to be more transparent and  provided states with additional resources and tools for developing their  NCIPP nominations. Specifically, once states submit their NCIPP  nominations, DHS is to make preliminary adjudication determinations  based upon the NCIPP criteria, then provide its preliminary adjudication  results (whether a nomination was accepted or not) and why the decision  was made. Next, DHS is to allow states an opportunity to request  reconsideration of the nomination for which they could provide additional  documentation clarifying the eligibility of the infrastructure. Figure 5  shows the revised NCIPP list development process, including the  nomination, adjudication, and reconsideration phases.", "In addition to revising the adjudication process, DHS took several actions  intended to improve the nomination process in recent years. First,  according to DHS\u2019s 2011 data call guidance, DHS provided on-site  assistance from subject matter experts to assist states with identifying  infrastructure and disseminated a lessons learned document providing  examples of successful nominations to help states improve justifications  for nominations. Second, DHS has taken action to be more proactive in  engaging states and SSAs in ongoing dialogue on proposed criteria  changes and improving the NCIPP process and resulting list. For  example, in 2010, DHS hosted the Food and Agriculture Criticality  Working Group established through the Food and Agriculture Sector  Government Coordinating Council\u2014consisting of over 100 participants  (including DHS, states, and SSAs)\u2014to discuss the aforementioned  modification of the criteria to make it more applicable to the agriculture  and food sector. As discussed earlier, DHS and its state and SSA  partners are currently reevaluating the agriculture and food sector-specific  criteria, and the SSAs held a meeting in December 2012 to discuss  updating and adding additional criteria. In addition, in July 2011, DHS  established a working group composed of state and SSA officials to solicit  feedback on the nomination process and recommend actions to improve  the quality of the NCIPP list in preparation for the 2013 data call. DHS  officials told us that much of the feedback received from states and SSAs  centered on DHS improving communication and guidance throughout the  data call\u2014for example, updating the guidance with additional information  on criteria. DHS also planned long-term studies, such as requesting input  from partners on modifying criteria thresholds. DHS officials told us that  they conducted extensive outreach to states and SSAs to encourage  participation in the NCIPP working group including extending the  submission deadlines multiple times, funding an on-site meeting with the  partners, and hosting webinars and conference calls.

However, officials representing three sectors said that  they believe it is moderately difficult or very difficult to nominate assets to  the list because of various factors. For example, one SSA official told us  that the diversity and complexity of the sector\u2019s assets makes it difficult to  determine which assets meet the NCIPP criteria. Also, one SSA official  stated that the online tool that the SSA uses to nominate assets to the  NCIPP list requires detailed information, such as latitude and longitude  coordinates, that may not be available for assets with unique  characteristics.", "By contrast, most state officials we contacted reported that it is difficult to  nominate assets to the NCIPP list using the consequence-based criteria,  and two officials said that they are considering whether to continue to  participate in the NCIPP process. Homeland security officials  representing 13 of the 15 states told us that they believe that the  nomination process is moderately difficult or very difficult, while officials  representing 2 states told us that they believe the nomination process is  neither easy nor difficult. For the 13 states where officials told us that they  believe the nomination process is moderately difficult or very difficult,  officials representing 5 states told us that not having the capability and  resources to develop scenarios to support consequence-based criteria  (such as conducting economic analysis) are the major factors contributing  to the time-consuming and difficult process of submitting nominations  when the criteria changed.

First, DHS is conducting a more limited annual data call wherein all  assets identified on the previous list are generally carried forward onto the  subsequent list and states are asked to provide nominations of (1) critical  infrastructure not accepted during the previous data call or (2) critical  infrastructure not previously nominated but that partners believe merits  consideration. In fiscal year 2013, 13 state or territorial partners  participated in the data call. DHS officials question whether, given current  budget constraints facing state and federal partners, there is a need to  conduct an annual data call.

In addition, one state official observed that, in a resource-constrained  environment, states can no longer afford to conduct the NCIPP data call  because it diverts resources from critical infrastructure protection  partnership and coordination activities that could increase state and  regional resilience, such as states maintaining their own list of high- priority critical infrastructure. In response, according to DHS officials, DHS  is working to minimize major changes to the consequence-based NCIPP  criteria, and thus, does not anticipate making any major changes to the  NCIPP criteria that would cause a burden on state resources. Finally,  DHS officials also told us that they have begun to take additional actions  to enhance state participation, including developing and organizing a  webinar with PSAs and state officials as they execute the data call.

The SSA officials we interviewed represented the 8 sectors selected  during our analysis for the first objective. Specifically, DHS was the SSA  for 4 of the sectors\u2014the chemical, dams, government facilities, and  transportation systems sectors. The Departments of Energy, Defense,  and the Treasury were the SSAs for 3 sectors\u2014the energy, defense  industrial base, and banking and finance sectors, respectively. Two  SSAs, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug  Administration, share responsibility for the agriculture and food sector.  The state homeland security officials we interviewed represented 15  states\u2014California, Georgia, Illinois, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Maine,  Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Virginia,  Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. We selected these states  because they contained a range in the number of assets on the NCIPP   The  list and represented at least 1 state from each of 9 PSA regions.sector and state interviews are not generalizable to the universe of  infrastructure sectors and states contributing to the NCIPP list. However,  our selection combined with DHS policy guidance, further informed us  about DHS efforts to manage the NCIPP program across a spectrum of  states and partners nationwide. Finally, we interviewed IASD officials to  discuss actions DHS had taken to consult with state and federal partners  (as identified in program guidelines and based on our interviews with  states and SSAs), and compared their responses with applicable criteria  in the NIPP, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  and relevant statutory provisions.", "With regard to our third objective\u2014determine the extent to which DHS  reported to the requisite committees of Congress on the NCIPP\u2014we  reviewed the statutory requirement that DHS report annually to the  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and  the House Committee on Homeland Security on the national asset  database and prioritized critical infrastructure list. We also spoke to staff  members representing both committees to determine if the committees  received the statutorily required reports. Last, we interviewed DHS  officials to discuss efforts to provide these reports to the committees and  obtained and reviewed documents on the national asset database and  prioritized critical infrastructure list that were intended to meet statutory  reporting requirements to determine if these efforts were consistent with  relevant statutory provisions and Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2012 to March 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, John F.
