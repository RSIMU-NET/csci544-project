For example, GPRAMA requires agencies to describe in their strategic and performance planning how they are working with other agencies to achieve their goals. HHS and USDA vary in the amount of detail they provide on their crosscutting food safety efforts. In addition, they do not include several relevant crosscutting efforts, such as the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, which tracks whether foodborne bacteria are resistant to the antibiotics used to treat and prevent illness.", "Fully addressing crosscutting efforts in individual strategic and performance planning documents is an important first step toward providing a comprehensive picture of federal food safety performance. However, individual agencies' documents do not provide an integrated perspective on federal food safety performance. In 2011, GAO recommended that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the federal agencies having food safety responsibilities, develop a government-wide performance plan for food safety. OMB has not acted on that recommendation. Without such a plan, Congress, program managers, and other decision makers are hampered in their ability to identify agencies and programs addressing similar missions and to set priorities, allocate resources, and restructure federal efforts, as needed, to achieve long-term goals. In addition, without such a plan, federal food safety efforts are not clear and transparent to the public. GAO continues to believe that a government-wide performance plan for food safety is necessary.", "HHS's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) have mechanisms in place to facilitate interagency coordination on food safety that focus on specific issues, but none provides for broad-based, centralized collaboration. For example, FDA and FSIS are collaborating with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration to improve estimates of foodborne illness sources. However, this and other mechanisms do not allow FDA, FSIS, and other agencies to look across their individual programs and determine how they all contribute to federal food safety goals. Nearly all the experts GAO interviewed agreed that a centralized collaborative mechanism on food safety is important to foster effective interagency collaboration and could enhance food safety oversight. The Food Safety Working Group (FSWG) served as a centralized mechanism for broad-based food safety collaboration and resulted in a number of accomplishments, including improved coordination. However, the FSWG is no longer meeting. A prior centralized mechanism for broad-based collaboration on food safety also was not sustained. Without a centralized collaborative mechanism on food safety, there is no forum for agencies to reach agreement on a set of broad-based food safety goals and objectives. Experts suggested that a centralized collaborative mechanism on food safety--like the FSWG--could provide sustained leadership across agencies over time if it were formalized in statute. Without such formalization, centralized collaborative mechanisms on food safety may continue to be short-lived."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS and USDA build upon their efforts to implement GPRAMA requirements to fully address crosscutting food safety efforts.

Nevertheless,  foodborne illness is still a common, costly, yet largely preventable, public  health problem. CDC data indicate that each year, as a result of  foodborne disease, roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people) get  sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die. Two independent studies  published in 2012 estimated the cost of foodborne illness in the United  States. According to a September 2013 bulletin from the U.S. Department  of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Economic Research Service, the study that used  the more conservative approach estimated the cost to be $14.1 billion per  year. Three major trends also create food safety challenges. First, a  substantial and increasing portion of the U.S. food supply is imported.  Second, consumers are eating more raw and minimally processed foods.  Third, segments of the population that are particularly susceptible to  foodborne illnesses, such as older adults and immune-compromised  individuals, are growing.", "The safety and quality of the U.S. food supply is governed by a highly  complex system stemming from at least 30 laws related to food safety  that are collectively administered by 15 federal agencies. The agencies  with primary food safety oversight responsibility are USDA\u2019s Food Safety  and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FSIS is  responsible for the safety of meat, poultry, and processed egg products.FDA is responsible for virtually all other food. programs and policies, the existing food safety system evolved on a  piecemeal basis, typically in response to particular health threats or  economic crises.", "Catfish Inspection  FDA has traditionally overseen the safety of  all seafood, including catfish, but as a result of  2008 Farm Bill provisions amending the  Federal Meat Inspection Act, regulatory  responsibility for catfish inspection will fall to  FSIS once it issues final regulations for a  mandatory catfish examination and inspection  program. We suggested that Congress  consider repealing these provisions of the  2008 Farm Bill. However, the 2014 Farm Bill  instead modified these provisions to require  the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) with  the Commissioner of FDA that would ensure  that inspection of catfish conducted by FSIS  and FDA are not duplicative. We maintain that  such an MOU does not address the  fundamental problem, which is that FSIS\u2019s  catfish program, if implemented, would result  in duplication of activities and an inefficient  use of taxpayer funds. Duplication would  result if facilities that process both catfish and  other seafood were inspected by both FSIS  and FDA.", "For more than a decade, we have reported on the fragmented nature of  federal food safety oversight. In January 2007, we added the federal  oversight of food safety to our list of high-risk areas because of risks to  the economy and to public health and safety. We found that a challenge  for the twenty-first century was to find a way for federal agencies with  food safety responsibilities to integrate the myriad food safety programs  and strategically manage their portfolios to promote the safety and  integrity of the nation\u2019s food supply. We stated that Congress and the  executive branch \u201ccan and should create the environment needed to look  across the activities of individual programs within specific agencies and  toward the goals that the federal government is trying to achieve.\u201d To that  end, in January 2007, we recommended that a mechanism be put in  place to facilitate interagency coordination on food safety regulations and  programs.

For example, FDA is generally responsible for  ensuring that eggs in their shells\u2014referred to  as shell eggs\u2014including eggs at farms such  as those where the outbreak occurred, are  safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. FSIS,  on the other hand, is responsible for the  safety of eggs processed into egg products. In  addition, USDA\u2019s Agricultural Marketing  Service sets quality and grade standards for  shell eggs, such as Grade A, but does not test  the eggs for bacteria such as Salmonella.  Further, while USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant  Health Inspection Service manages the  program that helps ensure laying hens are  free from Salmonella at birth, FDA oversees  the safety of the feed they eat.", "In January 2007, we also suggested that Congress and the executive  branch work together to develop a government-wide performance plan for  food safety.

Another distinguishing feature is that the plan should be  organized in terms of broad goals and objectives rather than in a  sequential, agency-by-agency format. Presenting information in an  agency-by-agency manner is appropriate to emphasize agency  accountability but tends to inadequately reflect the relative contributions  of various agencies and strategies to the overarching goals and  objectives, and it reduces opportunities to compare and assess  interactions.", "FDA and FSIS officials told us they recognize that a government-wide  performance plan for food safety could be beneficial in providing clarity  and transparency to the public regarding federal food safety efforts. They  also said, however, that developing such a plan would be difficult,  because statutes mandate that the agencies oversee different food  products, often with different associated health risks, and using different  approaches. The way one agency approaches its mandate may not be  appropriate for another agency, they said, so a government-wide  performance plan may be unrealistic. We acknowledge that there are  challenges associated with the different statutory authorities and  jurisdictions of the agencies with food safety responsibilities. However, if  each agency is focused on a different aspect of food safety oversight,  there is a risk that no entity will take the necessary broader view toward  ensuring the safety of the overall food supply. For example, a major trend  creating food safety challenges is the substantial and increasing portion  of the U.S. food supply that is imported. HHS and USDA both conduct  work focused on ensuring the safety of imported food and could  articulate, in a government-wide performance plan, a common goal and  mutually reinforcing strategies to do so, in addition to common  performance measures, as appropriate, to track the nation\u2019s overall  progress. Our prior reports have identified other areas of food safety that  cut across different agencies\u2014such as recall communication, seafood  safety, seafood fraud, inspection of food production facilities, oversight of  genetically engineered crops, and defense of food and agriculture against  terrorist attacks and natural disasters\u2014which could form the basis of  common goals and objectives articulated in a government-wide  performance plan. We have found that when agencies do not have a  compelling rationale, such as legislation, directives, or their perceptions of  the benefits from collaboration, it is difficult to overcome differences in  missions and priorities and to define and articulate a common outcome  that is consistent with their respective agency missions.

However, several experts acknowledged that enactment of a  statute to formalize a collaborative mechanism would present the most  challenges in terms of time and effort. Some experts said that an  interagency agreement could work as a means to set up the mechanism  and would likely be the easiest and most immediate option. However,  most of the experts also told us that interagency agreements can be weak  and may not provide the most sustainable or effective way to formalize  such a group. Some other experts said a presidential directive would be  the best way to formalize the mechanism because it would bring high- level visibility to such a group. On the other hand, most experts  expressed concern that, if established by a presidential directive, the  mechanism may not survive a change in administrations. We have found  that lack of continuity is a frequent issue with collaborative mechanisms  that are tied to the Executive Office of the President, particularly when  administrations change.", "Have participating agencies clarified roles  and responsibilities?  participants been included?

Have they  developed ways to continually update and  monitor these agreements?", "Nearly all of the experts agreed that a centralized mechanism should be  held accountable for its results and suggested several options for  achieving accountability. For example, most said the mechanism could  establish goals that member agencies would be publicly accountable for  meeting. Several experts also said the mechanism should periodically  report to Congress and the public; for example, one expert said that  would provide accountability. Some others said holding public meetings  would be helpful to get stakeholders\u2019 views and to provide information to  the public on the mechanism\u2019s activities. We have also found that  outcomes and accountability are key features of any collaborative  mechanism.", "Nearly all of the experts we interviewed emphasized the importance of  regular meetings. Most told us that it would be important to have  meetings quarterly. As one expert explained, such a frequency would  help to establish momentum for the mechanism. Some suggested it could  be helpful to hold more frequent meetings initially, to get the mechanism  off the ground. Some experts who were members of the FSWG told us  that the FSWG met more frequently early on and less frequently over  time. Several experts also suggested the possibility of a two-tier structure,  with high-level officials meeting less frequently and another group of  subject matter experts and additional staff meeting more frequently. Our  prior work has highlighted the importance of in-person meetings to build  relationships and trust.", "The experts expressed a range of views on the membership composition  of a centralized collaborative mechanism on food safety. Several experts  agreed that nongovernmental stakeholders, including consumer groups  and industry associations, should be included in some way, for example,  by getting stakeholder input during public meetings or through an  advisory committee. However, most of the experts said stakeholders  should not be official members of the mechanism because having only  government officials as members would allow for more candid  discussions and facilitate decision making. Half of the experts thought it  would be important to include White House officials, such as those from  OMB, in the mechanism\u2019s membership; the other half either disagreed or  had no opinion on whether White House officials should be included.  Some experts said White House involvement could help to elevate food  safety issues and raise visibility of the group. Several others, however,  told us that White House officials could potentially politicize the process.  Nearly all of the experts told us that a new centralized mechanism should  be led by a designated chair or an executive director; most of the experts  also agreed the mechanism should have dedicated staff. Having staff or a  designated chair could help to institutionalize the group, but some experts  also pointed out that any independent staffing of the group would likely  require funding. One expert suggested that the White House appoint a  chair for up to 5 years to help to ensure the sustainability of the  mechanism.

According to the FSWG\u2019s December 2011 Progress  Report, the FSWG was a central coordinating mechanism for the federal  government\u2019s food safety activities. The report said its mission was to  strengthen federal efforts and develop short-term and long-term  strategies to improve food safety. The Secretaries of HHS and USDA  jointly cochaired the working group, which included several other partner  agencies. In addition, the White House Domestic Policy Council  convened the group. However, FDA and FSIS officials told us that the  FSWG is no longer meeting because, they believe, it served its purpose  of improving interagency coordination. The last item posted under \u201crecent  actions\u201d on the FSWG\u2019s website is its December 2011 Progress Report.  FDA officials said they thought the FSWG\u2019s last meeting was in April  2011, but they could not provide an exact date.", "OMB staff and FDA and FSIS officials told us that the FSWG provided  numerous benefits to the federal food safety system. For example, they  told us that the FSWG was instrumental in helping to achieve legislative  reform of food safety laws through enactment of FSMA. In addition, they  told us that the FSWG helped to establish strong working relationships  between agency officials, which continue to this day and which foster  effective formal and informal collaboration. Moreover, they said that the  FSWG provided the operational direction for work that has been done by  the agencies subsequently. For example, FDA officials told us that the  FSWG led to the creation of IFSAC as a means of strengthening  collaboration across FDA, FSIS, and CDC in estimating the sources of  foodborne illness. According to FDA officials, prior to IFSAC the agencies  used different estimation approaches, with little coordination or  information sharing, which made it difficult to obtain accurate estimates.  FSIS officials told us that, through IFSAC, the agencies are now  developing attribution estimates and methods to be used jointly in setting  performance standards and developing risk assessments, economic  analyses, and policies, among other things. In addition, according to a  notice published by FSIS in the Federal Register, FSIS developed new  performance standards for two pathogens\u2014Salmonella and  Campylobacter\u2014in response to the work of the FSWG. In March 2011,  we found that through the FSWG federal agencies took steps designed to  increase collaboration in areas that cross regulatory jurisdictions\u2014in  particular, improving produce safety, reducing Salmonella contamination,  and developing food safety performance measures.Salmonella, for example, FSIS officials told us that staff from FSIS and  FDA communicated on a regular basis to coordinate efforts to develop  their respective agencies\u2019 priority goals on Salmonella reduction, as they  are closely intertwined.", "As shown in figure 3, when it was functioning, the FSWG also held public  meetings, issued a report on \u201ckey findings\u201d identifying its core principles  and a number of goals and actions it was taking, or planning to take, to  improve food safety, and released progress reports documenting its  accomplishments.", "According to senior FDA and FSIS officials and OMB staff, the FSWG is  no longer needed, given the existence of other collaborative mechanisms,  both formal and informal. However, as already noted, the existing  mechanisms are focused on specific issues and do not allow for  centralized, broad-based collaboration across federal food safety  regulations and programs. For example, none provides a forum for food  safety agencies to reach agreement on a set of broad-based food safety  goals and objectives. Moreover, we have previously found that informal  coordination mechanisms that rely on relationships between individual  officials can end once the officials leave government or move to a  different position. Agency officials also said there is little time for high- level officials to meet in a group like the FSWG, given competing  demands. However, some former FSWG members told us the FSWG met  infrequently\u2014once every 3 to 6 months on average.", "Some agency officials acknowledged the value of having a centralized  collaborative mechanism for food safety. For example, a senior FSIS  official told us that reconvening the FSWG would be beneficial because it  could help to ensure program transparency and produce results. A senior  FDA official also told us that there would be value to a having a group like  the FSWG in place, because it could help to foster relationships.", "An FDA official estimated that the FSWG has not met for at least 3 years;  an OMB staff member confirmed that the group no longer meets and that  there are no plans to meet in the future. However, the OMB staff member  told us the FSWG could be reconvened if there was a need to do so, but  there is not currently a need for the group. FSIS officials told us there is  currently no centralized collaborative mechanism to discuss food safety  issues. Agencies still refer to the FSWG in current documents as if it is an  active entity. For example, HHS states in its current strategic plan that it  works with multiple partners to ensure the safety of food, including the  FSWG. In addition, HHS\u2019s current performance plan links to FDA\u2019s plan  for addressing our high-risk designation for food safety, which cites  improving interagency coordination through the FSWG as one of five key  steps to address our high-risk designation. Moreover, the FSWG website  is still active, but no new activities have been recorded since December  2011.", "In 2011, we reported that the creation of the FSWG was a positive step  because it made food safety a national priority, demonstrated strong  commitment and top leadership support (one of five criteria that must be  met for GAO to remove a high-risk designation), and was designed to  foster interagency collaboration on the crosscutting issue of food safety.  However, we also expressed concern at the time about the group\u2019s future,  given the history of the short-lived President\u2019s Council on Food Safety,  which was created in 1998. It served as a coordinating mechanism  encompassing all aspects of federal food safety programs, but it was  disbanded in 2001 after a change in administrations. We recommended in  2001 that the President\u2019s Council on Food Safety be reconvened, but that  did not happen. Instead, 8 years later, the FSWG was convened, but it  stopped meeting after an estimated 2 years. Our prior reports have also  identified other cases where leadership of an interagency collaborative  mechanism changed, and the mechanism either disappeared or became  less useful. In 2012, we found that transitions and inconsistent leadership  can weaken the effectiveness of any collaborative mechanism; in that  report, we said that lack of continuity is a frequent issue with presidential  advisers or mechanisms that are tied to the Executive Office of the  President, particularly when administrations change. In addition, all of the  experts on food safety we interviewed agreed that a collaborative  mechanism on food safety should be formalized to help ensure sustained  leadership over time. Without formalizing a centralized collaborative  mechanism for food safety, such as in statute, they may continue to be  short-lived."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HHS and USDA have both taken steps to implement GPRAMA\u2019s  crosscutting requirements for their food safety efforts. However, the  agencies do not fully address crosscutting food safety efforts in their  strategic and performance planning documents. GPRAMA requires  agencies to describe how they are working with other agencies to achieve  their goals and objectives, among other things, but the agencies vary in  the amount of detail they provide on such efforts. In addition, they do not  include several relevant crosscutting efforts in either agency\u2019s strategic  and performance planning documents. Fully addressing crosscutting food  safety efforts in individual strategic and performance planning documents  is an important first step toward providing a comprehensive picture of  federal food safety performance. Nevertheless, the agency-by-agency  focus of individual documents alone does not provide an integrated  perspective on federal food safety performance. In March 2011, we  recommended that OMB, in consultation with the federal agencies having  food safety responsibilities, develop a government-wide performance plan  for food safety. OMB has not taken action in almost 4 years to develop  such a plan. GPRAMA further highlights the need for crosscutting  strategic and performance planning for issues that involve multiple federal  agencies and could provide the initial steps toward a government-wide  performance plan for food safety. Without such a plan, Congress,  program managers, and other decision makers are hampered in their  ability to identify agencies and programs addressing similar missions and  to set priorities, allocate resources, and restructure federal efforts, as  needed, to achieve long-term goals. In addition, without such a plan,  federal food safety efforts are not clear and transparent to the public. As  we have previously recommended, a government-wide performance plan  should include results-oriented goals and performance measures and a  discussion of strategies and resources.", "In addition, although a number of collaborative mechanisms on food  safety involving FDA and FSIS exist, they are focused on specific issues  and do not provide for broad-based, centralized collaboration. All of the  experts on food safety we interviewed agreed that a centralized  mechanism for broad-based collaboration could enhance the sharing of  knowledge and strategy and the use of best practices among federal  agencies responsible for food safety. We previously recommended that a  centralized mechanism should be in place to facilitate interagency  coordination across food safety regulations and programs. The FSWG,  created by the Administration in March 2009, served as a centralized  mechanism for broad-based collaboration on food safety, but the group is  no longer meeting. The President\u2019s Council on Food Safety, a previous  centralized mechanism for broad-based collaboration, was also short- lived. Challenges associated with the fragmented federal food safety  system are long-standing, and centralized mechanisms for broad-based  collaboration have not been sustained. Experts on food safety suggested  that a centralized collaborative mechanism on food safety\u2014like the  FSWG\u2014could provide sustained leadership across food safety agencies  over time if it were formalized in statute.
