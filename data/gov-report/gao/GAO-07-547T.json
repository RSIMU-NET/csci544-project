We are especially appreciative of Congressional efforts to help us avoid a furlough of our staff during fiscal year 2007. Had we not received additional funds this year and not taken other cost minimization actions, GAO would have likely been forced to furlough most staff for up to 5 days without pay. At the same time, due to funding shortfalls, we were not able to make pay adjustments retroactive to January 7, 2007. It is through the efforts of our dedicated and capable staff that we were able to provide the Congress with the professional, objective, fact-based, nonpartisan, non-ideological, fair, and balanced information it needs to meet the full range of its constitutional responsibilities. We are extremely pleased and proud to say that we helped the federal government achieve a total of $51 billion in financial benefits in fiscal year 2006--a record high that represents a return on investment of $105 for every dollar the Congress invested in us. As a result of our work, we also documented 1,342 nonfinancial benefits that helped to improve service to the public, change laws, and transform government operations. The funding we received in fiscal year 2006 allowed us to conduct work that addressed many difficult issues confronting the nation, including U.S. border security, Iraq and Hurricane Katrina activities, the tax gap and tax reform, and issues affecting the health and pay of military service members. Our client-focused performance measures indicate that the Congress valued and was very pleased with our work overall."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There is a need for fundamental and dramatic reform to address what the government does, how it does business, and who will do the government's business. Our support to the Congress will likely prove even more critical because of the pressures created by our nation's current and projected budget deficit and growing long-term fiscal imbalance. Also, as we face current and projected supply and demand imbalance issues and a growing workload over the coming years across a wide spectrum of issues, GAO will be unable to respond to congressional demands without a significant investment in our future. We have exhausted the results that we can achieve based on prior investments. Our ability to continue to produce record results and assist the Congress in discharging its Constitutional responsibilities relating to authorization, appropriations, oversight, and other matters will be adversely impacted unless we take action now. Therefore, our fiscal year 2008 budget request is designed to restore GAO's funding to more reasonable operating levels. Specifically, we are requesting fiscal year 2008 budget authority of $530 million, an 8.5 percent increase over our fiscal year 2007 funding level. The additional funds provided in fiscal year 2007 have helped reduce our requested increase for fiscal year 2008 from 9.4 percent to 8.5 percent. This funding level also represents a reduction below the request we submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in January as a result of targeted adjustments to our planned fiscal year 2008 hiring plan. Our fiscal year 2008 budget request will allow us to achieve our performance goals to support the Congress as outlined in our strategic plan1 and rebuild our workforce capacity to allow us to better respond to supply and demand imbalances in responding to congressional requests. This funding will also help us address our caseload for bid protest filings, which have increased by more than 10 percent from fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Our workload for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 suggests a continuation of this upward trend in bid protest fillings. We will be seeking Congressional commitment and support to provide the funding needed to increase GAO's staffing level to 3,750 over the next 6 years in order to address critical needs including supply and demand imbalances, high-risk areas, 21st Century Challenges questions, technology assessments, and other areas in need of fundamental reform. In addition, as we get closer to when GAO may be able to render our opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the U. S. government and the Department of Defense's financial and related systems, we will need to increase our workforce capacity. We will be providing the Congress additional information on the basis for and nature of this target later this year. Importantly, as noted last year, we also plan to request legislation that will assist GAO in performing its mission work, and enhance our human capital policies, including addressing certain compensation and benefits issues of interest to our employees. We plan to submit our proposal to our Senate and House authorization and oversight committees in the near future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to appear before the subcommittee today in support of the  fiscal year 2008 budget request for the U.S. Government Accountability  Office (GAO).

Although the additional funding provided  by the subcommittee allows us to avoid a furlough of our staff, we must  implement a number of actions to cancel, reduce, or defer costs in order to  manage within fiscal year 2007 funding constraints. In fact, our fiscal year  2007 budget for most programs and line items retains funding levels at or  near fiscal year 2006 funding levels\u2014requiring that we absorb inflationary  increases, which in turn reduce our purchasing power, erode progress  toward our strategic goals, and ultimately affect our client service and  employee support. For example, in our travel account\u2014a critical element  in our ability to conduct firsthand evaluation of federal funding and  program activities\u2014we expect transportation costs and per diem rates to  rise (as they do annually). Also, our ability to hire staff to replace  departing staff, address key succession planning challenges and skill gaps,  and maintain a skilled workforce will be adversely affected. While we  must hold some critical employee benefits at last year\u2019s funding level, such  as transit benefits and student loan repayments, our pool of employees  eligible to retire has increased since last year. Also, some other agencies  may be offering increased benefits that will be attractive to our employees  and potential recruits. In addition, we have reduced or deferred needed  targeted investments and initiatives geared to further increasing  productivity and effectiveness, achieving cost savings, and addressing  identified management challenges.", "Unfortunately, we expect that these actions will adversely affect our  ability to respond to congressional requests, making it even more difficult  to address supply and demand imbalances in areas such as health care,  disaster assistance, homeland security, the global \u201cwar on terrorism,\u201d  energy and natural resources, and forensic auditing. Our diminished  capacity will likely, in turn, ultimately result in reduced annual financial  benefits, findings, and recommendations to the Congress and the nation  and necessitate reductions in our    ability to provide timely and responsive information to support  testimonies on the Congress\u2019s legislative and oversight agenda;    products containing recommendations for improvements in government    analyses of executive branch agencies budget justifications to support    support on reauthorization activities for pending programs, such as the  farm bill, Head Start, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and the No  Child Left Behind Act; and    oversight of legislative branch programs, including the Capitol Visitor  Center.", "In an effort to identify areas for potential improvement and help ensure  accountability, we plan to contract with a public accounting firm in fiscal  year 2008 to conduct a peer review of our financial audit practice and have  an international team of auditors conduct an external peer review of our  performance audit practices. GAO has received clean opinions on its  previous external peer reviews. Consistent with generally accepted  governmental auditing standards, external peer reviews are conducted on  a 3-year cycle and serve to validate that the Congress and the American  people can rely on our work and products.", "In recent years, GAO has worked cooperatively with the appropriation  committees to submit modest budget requests. During this period, and for  a variety of reasons, GAO has gone from the largest legislative branch  agency to the third largest in terms of total budgetary resources. Adjusting  for inflation, GAO\u2019s budget authority has declined by 3 percent in constant  fiscal year 2006 dollars since fiscal year 2003, as shown in figure 1. These  modest budget results do not adequately recognize the return on  investment that GAO has been able to generate. In fact, these increases  have hampered our progress in rebuilding from the downsizing (40 percent  reduction in staffing levels) and mandated funding reductions that  occurred in the 1990s. Although GAO\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget request  represents a 7 percent increase in constant dollar terms over our fiscal  year 2007 operating plan, it is one of the smallest increases requested in  the legislative branch.", "Shortly after I was appointed Comptroller General in November 1998, I  determined that the agency should undertake a major transformation  effort. As a result, GAO has become more results-oriented, partnerial, and  client focused. With your support, we have made strategic investments;  realigned the organization; streamlined our business processes;  modernized our performance classification, compensation, and reward  systems; enhanced our ability to attract, retain and reward top talent;  enhanced the technology and infrastructure supporting our staff and  systems; and made other key investments. These transformational efforts  have allowed GAO to model best practices, lead by example, and provide  significant support to Congressional hearings, while achieving record  results and very high client satisfaction ratings without significant  increases in funding.", "We have taken a number of steps to deal with funding shortfalls in the past  few years; however, we cannot continue to employ the same approaches.  Our staff has become increasingly stretched and we are experiencing  backlogs in several areas of critical importance to the Congress (e.g.,  health care, homeland security, energy and natural resources). In addition,  we have deferred key initiatives and technology upgrades (e.g.,  engagement and administrative process upgrades) for several years and it  would not be prudent to continue to do so. These actions are having an  adverse effect on employee morale, our ability to produce results, and the  return on investment that we can generate.", "There is a need for fundamental and dramatic reform to address what the  government does, how it does business, and who will do the government\u2019s  business.

This assessment was based on our ongoing work and the 67 Iraq- related reports and testimonies we have provided to the Congress since  May 2003. Our work spans the security, political, economic, and  reconstruction prongs of the U.S. national strategy in Iraq. The broad,  crosscutting nature of this work helps minimize the possibility of overlap  and duplication by any individual inspector general. Our work has focused  on the U.S. strategy and costs of operating in Iraq, training and equipping  the Iraqi security forces, governance and reconstruction issues, the  readiness of U.S. military forces, and achieving desired acquisition  outcomes. Our current work draws on our past work and regular site visits  to Iraq and the surrounding region, such as Jordan and Kuwait. We plan to  establish a presence in Iraq beginning later this fiscal year to provide  additional oversight of issues deemed important to the Congress; subject  to approval by the U.S. Department of State and adequate funding.

Our work during the year helped the Congress  and the public judge how well the federal government performed its  functions and consider alternative approaches for improving operations  and laws when performance was less than adequate. For example, teams  supporting all three of our external strategic goals performed work related  to every facet of the Hurricane Katrina and Rita disasters\u2014preparedness,  response, recovery, long-term recovery, and mitigation. We developed a  coordinated and integrated approach to ensure that the Congress\u2019s need  for factual information about disaster preparedness, response, recovery,  and reconstruction activities along the Gulf Coast was met. We examined  how federal funds were used during and after the disaster and identified  the disaster rescue, relief, and rebuilding processes that worked well and  not so well throughout the effort. To do this, staff drawn from across the  agency spent time in the hardest hit areas of Louisiana, Mississippi,  Alabama, and Texas, collecting information from government officials at  the federal, state, and local levels as well as from private organizations  assisting with this emergency management effort. We briefed  congressional staff on our preliminary observations early in fiscal year  2006 and subsequently issued over 30 reports and testimonies on  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by fiscal year end, focusing on, among other  issues, minimizing fraud, waste, and abuse in disaster assistance and  rebuilding the New Orleans hospital care system.", "The following tables provide summary information on GAO\u2019s fiscal year  2006 performance and the results achieved in support of the Congress and  the American people.

We are working with the  cognizant entities and the appropriate authorization and oversight  committees to discuss the potential impact of legislative relief for these  issues. Another provision would modernize the authority of the  Comptroller General to administer oaths in performance of the work of  the office. To keep the Congress apprized of difficulties we have  interviewing agency personnel and obtaining agency views on matters  related to ongoing mission work, we will suggest new reporting  requirements.

Additionally, under our revised and contemporary  merit pay system, certain portions of an employee\u2019s merit increase, below  applicable market-based pay caps, are not permanent. Since this may  impact an employee\u2019s high three for retirement purposes, another key  provision of the bill would enable these nonpermanent payments to be  included in the retirement calculation for all GAO employees, except  senior executives and senior level personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "paragraphs": ["In summary, I believe that you will find our budget request reasonable,  responsible, and well-justified given the important role that GAO plays and  the unparalleled return on investment that GAO generates.

We are proud of our record  performance and the positive impact we have been able to effect in  government over the past year and believe an investment in GAO will  continue to yield substantial returns for the Congress and the American  people. Our nation will continue to face significant challenges in the years  ahead.
