Today, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service administer about seventy percent of the 657 million acres that remain in federal ownership. These agencies continue to transfer and sell federal land, but under more limited circumstances. For example, a community might want to develop a public park, a nonprofit group might want land for a shooting range, or a homeowner might want to obtain clear property title after mistakenly building part of his house on federal land. During fiscal years 1991 through 2000, BLM alone was authorized by law to transfer land. BLM transferred about 79,000 acres during this period under four key statutes and received about $3 million. BLM and the Forest Service are both authorized by law to sell land and are directed by law to receive at least fair market value when they do so; BLM has broader authority and has sold much more land, about 56, 000 acres, and received about $74 million. In contrast, the Forest Service sold only about 2,000 acres, all noncompetitively, and received about $5 million. When BLM and Forest Service sold land, they both generally received at least the appraised value. BLM generally offered land for competitive sale when agency personnel believed there was more than one potential buyer for the parcel; in these sales, the agency used appraised values as starting bids--that is, as minimum sale prices--and received prices that were, on average, about eighteen percent higher than appraised values. When BLM or the Forest Service sold land noncompetitively, they generally set the sale price at the appraised value. Some of the parcels the agencies sold noncompetitively might have been more appropriately offered for competitive sale, and in some of the noncompetitive sales, the appraised value underestimated the fair market value because it was not based on the land's current or planned use."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1781, the federal government has transferred or sold about 1.1 billion acres to nonfederal entities\u2014such as state and local governments, businesses, nonprofit groups, and individual citizens\u2014under various initiatives that promoted general economic development, developed transportation systems, supported public schools, and encouraged settlement of the western frontier.

According to the standards, fair market value is defined as the amount for which a property would be sold\u2014for cash or its equivalent\u2014 by a willing and knowledgeable seller with no obligation to sell, to a willing and knowledgeable buyer with no obligation to buy. The standards require an appraiser to first identify the property\u2019s \u201chighest and best use,\u201d which is defined as the use that is physically possible, legally permissible, financially feasible, and maximally profitable for the owner. The appraiser must estimate the property\u2019s value using at least one of three approaches: (1) the sales comparison approach, which compares the property with other properties that have been sold; (2) the income approach, which applies a capitalization rate to the property\u2019s potential net income; or (3) the cost approach, which adds the estimated value of the land to the current cost of replacing any improvements (such as buildings). The sales comparison approach is generally considered to be the most reliable when sufficient market data are available; it considers various factors\u2014such as the location, size and other physical characteristics, and uses of the properties\u2014to estimate the extent of comparability between the property being appraised and the comparable properties. On the basis of the prices of the properties that are judged to be the most comparable, the appraiser then estimates the fair market value of the property being appraised.", "Federal appraisal standards generally address appraisal procedures and documentation rather than outcomes. The standards explicitly allow for the application of professional judgment in estimating a property\u2019s fair market value: \u201cThe appraiser should not hesitate to acknowledge that appraising is not an exact science and that reasonable men may differ somewhat in arriving at an estimate of the fair market value.\u201d Before either agency uses an appraised value, an agency appraiser must review the appraisal report, assure it complies with federal appraisal standards, and approve it for agency use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM Transferred 79,000 Acres Under Four Key Statutes", "paragraphs": ["Four key statutes authorize BLM to transfer land.

Among other requirements, applicants must hold a legal right to the water they plan to use for irrigation and prove that they have expended at least $3 per acre in reclamation, irrigation, and cultivation. According to BLM, identifying federal land that could be acquired under this statute is now difficult for several reasons, including the following: most of the arid western land that is suitable for agricultural development is now privately owned, the amount of water available for irrigation is now limited, and the costs of developing irrigation projects are now high\u2014roughly $250,000 for a 320-acre parcel.

Prices for this land are set in the act or by the agency at less than fair market value, depending on the type of entity applying and the purpose for which the land will be used, as shown in table 1.", "Before BLM transfers land to an applicant under R&PPA, the agency is authorized and generally prefers to enter first into a multi-year lease with the applicant. Such leases help the agency to assure that applicants develop their proposed projects as planned and in a timely manner.", "When BLM transfers land under R&PPA, the agency restricts the deed to require that the parcel continue to be used for the stated purpose and not be transferred to another owner without BLM\u2019s consent. If these deed restrictions are violated, BLM generally requires that the owner take corrective action\u2014such as returning the parcel to its stated purpose\u2014or transfer the parcel back to BLM. In cases when the owner wants to continue to use the parcel in a way that violates the deed restrictions, BLM often agrees to take back the parcel and then sell it to the former owner for its current appraised value. To assure that the deed restrictions are met, BLM\u2019s policy is that field offices should visually inspect each transferred parcel at least once every 5 years. For example:   BLM field office staff inspected a 160-acre parcel in Idaho that had been transferred to a nonprofit group to develop and use as a trap-shooting and rifle range. In their inspection, staff found an occupied trailer, an abandoned car, miscellaneous garbage, and weeds growing in the area that was to be cleared\u2014all in violation of the deed restriction. BLM staff subsequently directed the group to take specific actions to correct the violations.", "Field office representatives told us that limited staff resources and higher work priorities preclude them from inspecting all transferred parcels every 5 years. BLM\u2019s automated public lands database shows that field office staff visited only about 40 percent of the 277 parcels with restricted deeds that were transferred in the period from fiscal years 1991 through 2000; monitoring visits were done (or scheduled) at intervals longer than 5 years for some parcels but were not done (or scheduled) at all for other parcels. To address this problem, BLM offices have adopted alternative approaches: for example, one field office hired a summer intern to inspect transferred parcels; another requested additional funds to hire contractors to do these inspections; yet another used a volunteer. However, BLM has not assessed the feasibility of other less costly approaches, such as requiring owners of transferred parcels to document their compliance with deed restrictions by submitting periodic reports and/or photographs of their land; field office staff could review these documents and inspect parcels as needed\u2014for example, if the documents were not submitted on time or appeared to show noncompliance.", "Under R&PPA, BLM transferred about 42,000 acres during fiscal years 1991 through 2000 and received a total of about $2.6 million: about 22,000 acres were transferred to state or local governments for historic monument or recreation purposes (at no cost); about 17,000 acres to state or local governments for other government-controlled purposes that serve the general public (for the greater of $10 per acre or $50 total); and the remaining approximate 3,000 acres to state or local governments or nonprofit organizations for other public purposes (for a percentage of the appraised value).

The amount received from R&PPA transfers ranged from about $9,000 in fiscal year 1993 to almost $1.6 million in fiscal year 1999. The significant increase in that year was due primarily to transfers of three parcels in Las Vegas, Nevada, to churches, at 50 percent of their appraised values\u2014one parcel yielded over $250,000 and two parcels yielded more than $500,000 each."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Color-of-Title Acts", "paragraphs": ["BLM is also authorized to transfer land under the Color-of-Title Act and several other laws that the agency collectively refers to as the Color-of- Title acts. Most of the land is transferred under Class I claims made under the Color-of-Title Act. Class I claims are those made by applicants who have valid reasons to believe that they already owned the land. Applicants must identify the land (limited to 160 acres per applicant), show that they (or their ancestors or the prior owners) held title to the land for more than 20 years without knowing it was in fact federally owned, and placed valuable improvements on the land or cultivated it. By law, the price of the land is based on the appraised value\u2014net of the value of improvements or development\u2014that is discounted to reflect an applicant\u2019s equities; if this calculation results in a price below $1.25 per acre, the minimum price is set at $1.25 per acre. The Color-of-Title Act does not define \u201cequities.\u201d However, under BLM\u2019s policy, determining an applicant\u2019s equities may include considering factors such as the longevity of the applicant\u2019s claim, whether the applicant paid fair market value for the land, the origin of the errors that initiated the chain of title, and whether taxes on the land have been paid.", "BLM has no guidance on how to quantify these factors or use them to set prices. In the absence of such guidance, field offices have developed inconsistent practices that, ironically, can lead to inequities in the prices paid by applicants. Such inconsistencies were noted by the Interior Board of Land Appeals in a 1984 decision that criticized the department for failing to provide or require a specific approach for estimating applicants\u2019 equities. The Board found that a BLM field office had erroneously used the date of the application\u2014rather than the earlier date that the applicant became aware the land was federally owned\u2014to determine the longevity of the claim. The Board pointed out that using the later application date had the effect of increasing the equities for applicants who defer filing their claims, while punishing applicants who took immediate steps to resolve their claims. Despite this decision, the same field office made the same error when resolving a claim in 1999; field office representatives told us that they were unaware of the Board\u2019s decision on this issue.", "BLM did not always use appraised value as a basis for determining the price of land to be transferred under the Color-of-Title authority, generally because field office representatives thought that the appraisals would have cost more than the land was worth. In addition, BLM did not consistently apply the Color-of-Title eligibility requirements. For example:   BLM transferred 26 acres in Nebraska to a power company, using the parcel\u2019s value as assessed by the county for tax purposes, which was $164 per acre, rather than obtaining an appraisal. The field office representative who decided to use the assessed value told us that he did not know that the company had stated in its application that it had paid about $1,000 per acre for the land in 1977. After deducting the applicant\u2019s equities from the assessed value, BLM determined that the minimum price would apply.", "BLM transferred 2.2 acres that abutted the backsides of 15 residential and other lots near Ruby Ridge, Idaho, for the minimum price rather than obtaining an appraisal. BLM transferred 1.4 of the 2.2 acres to individuals who were ineligible: three landowners had recently bought second parcels and were aware of the unclear titles, and four individuals had stated in their applications that their parcels had no valuable improvements.

For example:   A nonprofit organization applied to buy 40 vacant acres in Colorado to use as a church camp. The parcel did not have public access, because it was surrounded by land owned by the nonprofit organization. However, the appraisal reported that similarly inaccessible parcels had recently been sold and these new owners had subsequently acquired access rights. Furthermore, the parcel was located in a recreational area\u2014near a ski resort, a national park, and other tourist attractions\u2014where property values were rapidly rising. Although BLM sold the parcel noncompetitively for its appraised value of $126,000, the agency planned to offer it to the public had this sale not been completed\u2014an indication that the parcel might have been more appropriately offered for competitive sale.", "BLM had allowed a 1\u00bc-mile recreational railroad associated with a tourist attraction in Arizona to be partially built on public land; however, the field office later determined that it had improperly done so. To resolve the situation, BLM sold the developer 40 acres\u2014land under the track plus land extending out to the adjacent landowners\u2019 surrounding properties and the highway. In appraising the 40-acre parcel at an average of $3,700 per acre, the appraiser determined the acres fronting the highway to be more valuable because they could be commercially developed. At a minimum, these frontage acres might have been more appropriately offered for competitive sale.", "Under the Small Tracts Act, the Forest Service\u2019s regulations allow mineral survey fractions and road rights-of-way to be sold competitively unless an adjacent landowner has applied to buy them. Of the 27 parcels that the Forest Service sold under the Small Tracts Act in calendar year 1999, 10 were mineral survey fractions or road rights-of-way; 7 of these parcels might have been more appropriately offered for sale competitively if not for the exception to competitive sales in this regulation. These parcels (in whole or in part) had no continuing current authorized use or improvements, and other potential buyers\u2014such as other adjacent landowners\u2014may have been interested in them. For example:   A private landowner in Montana discovered that he had mistakenly built his residence\u2014a house and garage\u2014on the forest. Although this was an encroachment situation, the Forest Service treated it as a mineral survey fraction because the encroached area was a small part of an 8-acre mineral survey fraction. The landowner applied to buy all 8 acres or any reasonable portion of the parcel. Other private parties also owned land adjacent to the 8-acre parcel and might have been potential buyers for the unoccupied portion. Instead of selling the applicant only the encroached area, and selling the remaining land competitively, the Forest Service sold all 8 acres to the applicant for the appraised value of $8,600."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM and Forest Service Usually Received Prices Equal to Appraised Values in Direct Sales", "paragraphs": ["When BLM and the Forest Service sold land directly (noncompetitively) to applicants\u2014usually the current user of the land or the adjacent landowner who planned to use it for a specific purpose\u2014the agencies generally used the appraised value as the sale price. In several of these sales, the appraisal underestimated the parcel\u2019s fair market value because it did not reflect the buyer\u2019s current or planned use of the land.", "BLM sold several parcels directly to buyers for the development of various enterprises, including a landfill, a prison facility, and a sod and tree farm. The appraisals for some of these parcels did not consider the planned use in determining the parcel\u2019s highest and best use (defined as the use that is physically possible, legally permissible, financially feasible, and maximally profitable) but instead determined the highest and best use to be something else. When the planned use of a parcel is reasonably probable, it should be considered in determining the property\u2019s highest and best use, according to federal appraisal standards. In these appraisals, the buyer\u2019s current use of the parcel or adjacent land diminished the value of the parcel for other uses and reduced the appraised value. In effect, the parcel was appraised as though it could be bought by someone other than the applicant\u2014although BLM had already determined that no other potential buyers existed\u2014and would be used for a purpose other than the current or planned use. For example:   BLM had for years leased to a city in Arizona the rights to mine sand and gravel on an 80-acre parcel, next to the city\u2019s landfill. After the city depleted the sand and gravel deposit\u2014excavating about 70 acres to a depth of 35 to 45 feet\u2014it applied to buy the parcel to expand its landfill. Despite this plan, the appraiser determined that the parcel\u2019s highest and best use was for recreation (e.g., a skateboard park) or light industrial purposes (e.g., a construction yard) on the unexcavated acres. The appraiser determined that the 70-acre pit contributed no value for these purposes and appraised the remaining land at $7,500 per acre; the 80-acre parcel sold for its appraised value of $75,000.", "A city in New Mexico applied to buy a 120-acre parcel to develop as a sod and tree farm, which the city planned to irrigate with reclaimed water from its adjacent sewage treatment plant. Despite this plan, the appraiser determined that the parcel\u2019s highest and best use was for cattle grazing, finding that a bad odor from the city\u2019s sewage treatment plant diminished its value for any other use. The review appraiser noted the absence of fencing and demand for such a small piece of grazing land and also noted that the city\u2019s planned use should have been addressed in the appraisal. The reviewer found that the appraisal was not entirely complete by federal appraisal standards and included additional data in his review; with the additional data, he determined that the appraisal could be followed to a reasonable conclusion of value, which was $50 per acre. The parcel sold for its appraised value of $6,000.", "Both BLM and the Forest Service sold several parcels directly to adjacent homeowners who had mistakenly built part of their residences on federal land. The appraisals for some of these parcels did not consider the actual size of the adjacent residential lot to which the parcel would be added but instead assumed a larger lot size. The Forest Service has a policy to make such an assumption in appraising land to be sold under the encroachment provision of the Small Tracts Act, assuming the average size of the parcels used as comparable sales. BLM has no such policy but sometimes made similar assumptions. This assumption tends to reduce the per-acre appraised value: if other factors are equal, larger parcels tend to have lower per-acre values than smaller parcels. For example:   BLM sold 0.3 acres in Oregon to an adjacent homeowner who had mistakenly built a well and pumphouse on public land. In 1998, the appraiser assumed the parcel was part of the homeowner\u2019s 8-acre lot and valued the land at $12,000 per acre (or $4,000 for the parcel). After the homeowner told BLM that he could not afford to pay this price, in 1999 BLM again appraised the parcel. This time, the appraiser assumed the parcel was part of a larger (40-acre) parcel and told us he did so to establish a lower appraised value. The second appraisal valued the land at $3,000 per acre (or $1,000 for the parcel)\u201475 percent less than the 1998 appraised value.", "The Forest Service sold 0.4 acres in New Mexico to an adjacent homeowner who had mistakenly built part of her residence on the forest. The appraiser assumed the parcel was part of a 130-acre parcel rather than the homeowner\u2019s 66-acre lot. The per-acre sale prices of the comparable properties ranged from $3,100 per acre (for the smallest 20-acre parcel) to $1,050 per acre (for the largest 270-acre parcel). The appraiser valued the hypothetical 130-acre parcel within this range, at $2,000 per acre, and appraised the 0.4-acre parcel at $720."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM Sometimes Received Prices Lower Than Appraised Values in Direct Sales", "paragraphs": ["In three direct sales that were completed in calendar year 1999 under FLPMA, BLM accepted prices that were below appraised values. Two of these sales were made to resolve trespasses that posed difficult management situations, such as when a trespasser\u2019s continued use of federal land was likely to become very costly for the agency to otherwise address. While these decisions may have been cost-effective in the long run, FLPMA and its implementing regulations direct BLM to receive at least fair market value\u2014as estimated by appraised value\u2014when it sells land. BLM representatives told us that the field offices probably \u201cstretched\u201d their authority in resolving these trespasses but needed some flexibility to address such situations. They further said that the agency could receive authority to sell a parcel at less than fair market value by obtaining special legislation that applies only to the specific case. For example:   Several years ago an individual occupied mining claims and a millsite on public land in the California desert and had also moved onto adjacent public land without authority. BLM disputed the legitimacy of his occupancy but was unsuccessful in ending the trespass. To resolve the situation, BLM sold him 40 acres\u2014the acres he had occupied plus land that extended out to the adjacent landowners\u2019 surrounding properties\u2014 which had been appraised at $60,000.

BLM received complaints regarding the county\u2019s operation of the cemetery and found that bodies had been buried on 3 adjacent acres of public land without authority and that the county was unwilling to take corrective action. To resolve the situation, BLM agreed to take back the parcel and to sell the county 56 acres: the original 35 acres, the 3 trespassed acres, and another 18 adjacent acres for expansion. The appraiser determined that the 38 acres (with bodies) contributed no value and assessed the 18 acres to be worth $17,000. The county told BLM that it was unwilling to pay $17,000 and offered to take the 38 acres that had no value. In response, BLM noted that all land has some value and instead charged the county a \u201cminimum transaction value\u201d of $2,000 for the 38 acres."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["When BLM and the Forest Service sell land, they generally seek fair market value, as estimated by an appraisal. When BLM sells land competitively, the agency has the opportunity to test the reliability of such estimates in the open market, capture additional buyers\u2019 motivations if present in that market, and enhance federal revenues by receiving higher prices. As a result, BLM has received about $6 million above the appraised values during the past decade. In contrast, when BLM or the Forest Service sells land directly (noncompetitively), they must rely on appraised values to set sale prices; the agencies have no process to test the reliability of appraised values or to seek higher prices if those values are understated. Of 38 direct sales we examined, about half might have been more appropriately offered for competitive sale because there might have been potential buyers other than the applicants, such as adjacent landowners. Furthermore, the appraised value of parcels that are sold directly may underestimate their fair market value\u2014for example, the land\u2019s current or planned use may have diminished its value to other entities while increasing its value to the applicant\u2014and a higher price may be warranted if the agencies are to receive fair market value in noncompetitive sales. In our view, federal revenues could be enhanced if both agencies used competitive sales more frequently and sought higher prices in their direct sales.", "BLM faces additional challenges in selling and transferring land. FLPMA requires that BLM receive at least fair market value when it sells land, but the agency has sold land for less than its appraised value\u2014which estimates fair market value\u2014in response to specific circumstances despite having no authority to do so. BLM transferred the most land under the authority of R&PPA\u201442,000 acres\u2014but did not inspect most of these parcels to assure that deed restrictions were met, due to limited resources and higher priorities; the agency has not fully evaluated less costly means of inspecting these parcels.

As agreed with the requester\u2019s office, we excluded transfers authorized to various states under the terms of their statehood, transfers and sales authorized to resolve Native and Indian land claims, and sales of mineral rights (if they were sold separately from land rights). Based on the preponderance of the remaining reported transfers and sales, we then identified the key statutes; we discussed our selection of these statutes with officials in the agencies\u2019 Washington Offices. To describe the transactions made under these key statutes, we obtained and analyzed data on the acres and dollar values of land transferred and sold annually during fiscal years 1991 through 2000.", "To identify the requirements for transferring and selling land under these key statutes, we reviewed the laws and the associated regulations, policies, and procedures that were established by the agencies.

We also reviewed the extent to which BLM complied with its policy to inspect parcels that had been transferred under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act every 5 years. Using BLM\u2019s public lands database, we determined whether, as of January 2000, inspections for those parcels that had been transferred under this authority during fiscal years 1991 through 2000 had been (1) scheduled and completed as scheduled, (2) scheduled but not completed as scheduled, or (3) not scheduled.", "To assess whether the agencies received the appraised value when they sold land, we reviewed federal appraisal standards and examined all 61 appraisals that were completed for parcels that were sold in calendar year 1999: 44 for land sold by BLM under FLPMA, and 17 for land sold by the Forest Service.
