The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have both issued policy guidance on how and when to protect sensitive information. DOE marks documents with this information as Official Use Only (OUO) while DOD uses the designation For Official Use Only (FOUO). GAO was asked to (1) identify and assess the policies, procedures, and criteria DOE and DOD employ to manage OUO and FOUO information; and (2) determine the extent to which DOE's and DOD's training and oversight programs assure that information is identified, marked, and protected according to established criteria."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As GAO reported earlier this month, both DOE and DOD base their programs on the premise that information designated as OUO or FOUO must (1) have the potential to cause foreseeable harm to governmental, commercial, or private interests if disseminated to the public or persons who do not need the information to perform their jobs; and (2) fall under at least one of eight Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemptions. While DOE and DOD have policies in place to manage their OUO or FOUO programs, our analysis of these policies showed a lack of clarity in key areas that could allow inconsistencies and errors to occur. For example, it is unclear which DOD office is responsible for the FOUO program, and whether personnel designating a document as FOUO should note the FOIA exemption used as the basis for the designation on the document. Also, both DOE's and DOD's policies are unclear regarding at what point a document should be marked as OUO or FOUO and what would be an inappropriate use of the OUO or FOUO designation. For example, OUO or FOUO designations should not be used to conceal agency mismanagement. In our view, this lack of clarity exists in both DOE and DOD because the agencies have put greater emphasis on managing classified information, which is more sensitive than OUO or FOUO. In addition, while both DOE and DOD offer training on their OUO and FOUO policies, neither DOE nor DOD has an agencywide requirement that employees be trained before they designate documents as OUO or FOUO. Moreover, neither agency conducts oversight to assure that information is appropriately identified and marked as OUO or FOUO. DOE and DOD officials told us that limited resources, and in the case of DOE, the newness of the program, have contributed to the lack of training requirements and oversight. Nonetheless, the lack of training requirements and oversight of the OUO and FOUO programs leaves DOE and DOD officials unable to assure that OUO and FOUO documents are marked and handled in a manner consistent with agency policies and may result in inconsistencies and errors in the application of the programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss our work on how the  Departments of Energy (DOE) and Defense (DOD) use the designations  Official Use Only (OUO) and For Official Use Only (FOUO), respectively,  to manage information that is unclassified but sensitive. My testimony  today is based on our report issued earlier this month entitled Managing  Sensitive Information: Departments of Energy and Defense Policies and  Oversight Could Be Improved (GAO-06-369). This report (1) identified and  assessed the policies, procedures, and criteria that DOE and DOD employ  to manage OUO and FOUO information; and (2) determined the extent to  which DOE\u2019s and DOD\u2019s training and oversight programs assure that  information is identified and marked according to established criteria.", "In summary, both DOE and DOD base their programs on the premise that  information designated as OUO or FOUO must (1) have the potential to  cause foreseeable harm to governmental, commercial, or private interests  if disseminated to the public or persons who do not need the information  to perform their jobs; and (2) fall under at least one of eight Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA) exemptions. (See the appendix for a list and  description of the exemptions of FOIA.) Both agencies have policies in  place to implement their programs. However, our analysis of these policies  showed a lack of clarity in key areas that could allow inconsistencies and  errors to occur. Specifically:  It is unclear which DOD office is responsible for the FOUO program, and  whether personnel designating a document as FOUO should note the FOIA  exemption used as the basis for the designation on the document.", "Both DOE\u2019s and DOD\u2019s policies are unclear regarding at what point a  document should be marked as OUO or FOUO and what would be an  inappropriate use of the OUO or FOUO designation. For example, OUO or  FOUO designations should not be used to conceal agency  mismanagement.", "In addition, while both DOE and DOD offer training on their OUO and  FOUO policies, neither DOE nor DOD has an agencywide requirement that  employees be trained before they designate documents as OUO or FOUO.  Moreover, neither agency conducts oversight to assure that information is  appropriately identified and marked as OUO or FOUO. This lack of  training requirements and oversight leaves DOE and DOD officials unable  to assure that OUO and FOUO documents are marked and handled in a  manner consistent with agency policies and may result in inconsistencies  and errors in the application of the programs.", "We recommended that both agencies clarify their policies and guidance to  identify at what point a document should be marked as OUO or FOUO and  to define inappropriate uses of these designations. We also recommended  that DOD clarify its policies as to which office is responsible for the FOUO  program and that it require personnel designating a document as FOUO  also to note the FOIA exemption they used to determine that the  information should be restricted. With regard to training and management  oversight, we recommended that both DOE and DOD require personnel to  be trained before they can designate information as OUO or FOUO, and  that they develop a system to conduct periodic oversight of OUO or FOUO  designations to assure that their policies are being followed.", "In commenting on our draft report, DOE and DOD agreed with most of our  recommendations, but DOD disagreed that personnel designating a  document as FOUO should also mark the document with the FOIA  exemption used to determine that the information should be restricted.  DOD expressed concern that an individual may apply an incorrect or  inappropriate FOIA exemption and thus cause other documents that are  created from the original to also carry the incorrect FOIA exemption or  that the incorrect designation could cause problems if a denial is litigated.  However, we believe that citing the applicable FOIA exemptions when  marking a document will cause the employee to consider the exemptions  and make a thoughtful determination that the information fits within the  framework of the FOUO designation. Also, when the public requests  documents, before DOD releases or denies release of the documents, FOIA  experts review them, at which time an incorrect initial designation should  be corrected. Our recommendation was intended to better assure  appropriate consideration of the FOIA exemptions at the beginning of the  process and we continue to believe that this recommendation has merit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE and DOD Lack Clear OUO and FOUO Guidance in Key Aspects", "paragraphs": ["Both DOE and DOD have established offices, designated staff, and  promulgated policies to provide a framework for the OUO and FOUO  programs. However, their policies lack sufficient clarity in important  areas, which could result in inconsistencies and errors. DOE policy clearly  identifies the office responsible for the OUO program and establishes a  mechanism to mark the FOIA exemption used as the basis for the OUO  designation on a document. However, our analysis of DOD\u2019s FOUO  policies shows that it is unclear which DOD office is responsible for the  FOUO program, and whether personnel designating a document as FOUO  should note the FOIA exemption used as the basis for the designation on  the document. Also, both DOE\u2019s and DOD\u2019s policies are unclear regarding  at what point a document should be marked as OUO or FOUO, and what  would be an inappropriate use of the OUO or FOUO designation. In our  view, this lack of clarity exists in both DOE and DOD because the agencies  have put greater emphasis on managing classified information, which is  more sensitive than OUO or FOUO information.", "DOE\u2019s Office of Security issued an order, a manual, and a guide in April  2003 to detail the requirements and responsibilities for DOE\u2019s OUO  program and to provide instructions for identifying, marking, and  protecting OUO information. DOE\u2019s order established the OUO program  and laid out, in general terms, how sensitive information should be  identified and marked, and who is responsible for doing so. The guide and  the manual supplement the order. The guide provides more detailed  information on the applicable FOIA exemptions to help staff decide  whether exemption(s) may apply, which exemption(s) may apply, or both.  The manual provides specific instructions for managing OUO information,  such as mandatory procedures and processes for properly identifying and  marking this information. For example, the employee marking a document  is required to place on the front page of the document an OUO stamp that  has a space for the employee to identify which FOIA exemption is believed  to apply; the employee\u2019s name and organization; the date; and, if  applicable, any guidance the employee may have used in making this  determination. According to one senior DOE official, requiring the  employee to cite a reason why a document is designated as OUO is one of  the purposes of the stamp, and one means by which DOE\u2019s Office of  Classification encourages practices consistent with the order, guide, and  manual throughout DOE. Figure 1 shows the DOE OUO stamp.", "With regard to DOD, its regulations are unclear regarding which DOD  office controls the FOUO program. Although responsibility for the FOUO  program shifted from the Director for Administration and Management to  the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control,  Communications, and Intelligence (now the Under Secretary of Defense,  Intelligence) in October 1998, this shift is not reflected in current  regulations. Guidance for DOD\u2019s FOUO program continues to be included  in regulations issued by both offices. As a result, which DOD office has  primary responsibility for the FOUO program is unclear. According to a  DOD official, on occasion this lack of clarity causes personnel who have  FOUO questions to contact the wrong office. A DOD official said that the  department began coordination of a revised Information Security  regulation covering the FOUO program at the end of January 2006. The  new regulation will reflect the change in responsibilities and place greater  emphasis on the management of the FOUO program.", "DOD currently has two regulations, issued by each of the offices described  above, containing similar guidance that addresses how unclassified but  sensitive information should be identified, marked, handled, and stored.  Once information in a document has been identified as for official use  only, it is to be marked FOUO. However, unlike DOE, DOD has no  departmentwide requirement to indicate which FOIA exemption may  apply to the information, except when it has been determined to be  releasable to a federal governmental entity outside of DOD. We found,  however, that one of the Army\u2019s subordinate commands does train its  personnel to put an exemption on any documents that are marked as  FOUO, but does not have this step as a requirement in any policy. In our  view, if DOD were to require employees to take the extra step of marking  the exemption that may be the reason for the FOUO designation at the  time of document creation, it would help assure that the employee  marking the document had at least considered the exemptions and made a  thoughtful determination that the information fit within the framework of  the FOUO designation. Including the FOIA exemption on the document at  the time it is marked would also facilitate better agency oversight of the  FOUO program, since it would provide any reviewer/inspector with an  indication of the basis for the marking.", "In addition, both DOE\u2019s and DOD\u2019s policies are unclear as to the point at  which the OUO or FOUO designation should actually be affixed to a  document. If a document might contain information that is OUO or FOUO  but it is not so marked when it is first created, the risk that the document  could be mishandled increases. DOE policy is vague about the appropriate  time to apply a marking. DOE officials in the Office of Classification stated  that their policy does not provide specific guidance about at what point to  mark a document because such decisions are highly situational. Instead,  according to these officials, the DOE policy relies on the \u201cgood judgment\u201d  of DOE personnel in deciding the appropriate time to mark a document.  Similarly, DOD\u2019s current Information Security regulation addressing the  FOUO program does not identify at what point a document should be  marked. In contrast, DOD\u2019s September 1998 FOIA regulation, in a chapter  on FOUO, states that \u201cthe marking of records at the time of their creation  provides notice of FOUO content and facilitates review when a record is  requested under the FOIA.\u201d In our view, a policy can provide flexibility to  address highly situational circumstances and also provide specific  guidance and examples of how to properly exercise this flexibility.", "In addition, we found that both DOE\u2019s and DOD\u2019s OUO and FOUO  programs lack clear language identifying examples of inappropriate usage  of OUO or FOUO markings. Without such language, DOE and DOD cannot  be confident that their personnel will not use these markings to conceal  mismanagement, inefficiencies, or administrative errors, or to prevent  embarrassment to themselves or their agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Neither DOE nor DOD Requires Training or Conducts Oversight", "paragraphs": ["While both DOE and DOD offer training to staff on managing OUO and  FOUO information, neither agency requires any training of its employees  before they are allowed to identify and mark information as OUO or  FOUO, although some staff will eventually take OUO or FOUO training as  part of other mandatory training. In addition, neither agency has  implemented an oversight program to determine the extent to which  employees are complying with established policies and procedures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OUO and FOUO Training Is Generally Not Required", "paragraphs": ["While many DOE units offer training on DOE\u2019s OUO policy, DOE does not  have a departmentwide policy that requires OUO training before an  employee is allowed to designate a document as OUO. As a result, some  DOE employees may be identifying and marking documents for restriction  from dissemination to the public or persons who do not need to know the  information to perform their jobs, and yet may not be fully informed as to  when it is appropriate to do so. At DOE, the level of training that  employees receive is not systematic and varies considerably by unit, with  some requiring OUO training at some point as a component of other  periodic employee training, and others having no requirements at all.", "DOD similarly has no departmentwide training requirements before staff  are authorized to identify, mark, and protect information as FOUO. The  department relies on the individual services and field activities within  DOD to determine the extent of training that employees receive. When  training is provided, it is usually included as part of a unit\u2019s overall  security training, which is required for many but not all employees. There  is no requirement to track which employees received FOUO training, nor  is there a requirement for periodic refresher training. Some DOD  components, however, do provide FOUO training for employees as part of  their security awareness training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight of OUO and FOUO Programs Is Lacking", "paragraphs": ["Neither DOE nor DOD knows the level of compliance with OUO and  FOUO program policies and procedures because neither agency conducts  any oversight to determine whether the OUO and FOUO programs are  being managed well. According to a senior manager in DOE\u2019s Office of  Classification, the agency does not review OUO documents to assess  whether they are properly identified and marked. This condition appears  to contradict the DOE policy requiring the agency\u2019s senior officials to  assure that the OUO programs, policies, and procedures are effectively  implemented. Similarly, DOD does not routinely conduct oversight of its  FOUO program to assure that it is properly managed.", "Without oversight, neither DOE nor DOD can assure that staff are  complying with agency policies. We are aware of at least one recent case  in which DOE\u2019s OUO policies were not followed. In 2005, several stories  appeared in the news about revised estimates of the cost and length of the  cleanup of high-level radioactive waste at DOE\u2019s Hanford Site in  southeastern Washington. This information was controversial because this  multibillion-dollar project has a history of delays and cost overruns, and  DOE was restricting a key document containing recently revised cost and  time estimates from being released to the public. This document, which  was produced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for DOE, was marked  Business Sensitive by DOE. However, according to a senior official in the  DOE Office of Classification, Business Sensitive is not a recognized  marking in DOE. Therefore, there is no DOE policy or guidance on how to  handle or protect documents marked with this designation. This official  said that if information in this document needed to be restricted from  release to the public, then the document should have been stamped OUO  and the appropriate FOIA exemption should have been marked on the  document.", "In closing, the lack of clear policies, effective training, and oversight in  DOE\u2019s and DOD\u2019s OUO and FOUO programs could result in both over- and  underprotection of unclassified yet sensitive government documents.  Having clear policies and procedures in place can mitigate the risk of  program mismanagement and can help DOE and DOD management assure  that OUO or FOUO information is appropriately marked and handled. DOE  and DOD have no systemic procedures in place to assure that staff are  adequately trained before designating documents OUO or FOUO, nor do  they have any means of knowing the extent to which established policies  and procedures for making these designations are being complied with.  These issues are important because they affect DOE\u2019s and DOD\u2019s ability to  assure that the OUO and FOUO programs are identifying, marking, and  safeguarding documents that truly need to be protected in order to prevent  potential damage to governmental, commercial, or private interests.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes GAO\u2019s prepared statement.
