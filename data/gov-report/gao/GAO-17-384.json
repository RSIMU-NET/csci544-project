To do so, GAO analyzed documentation and interviewed officials about VA's approach to IT management processes related to strategic planning, investment management, and enterprise architecture, and compared VA's processes to leading practices.

However, the IT strategic plans do not include performance measures and targets for their defined objectives, VA's department-level IT investment board has been inactive and its investment selection guidance lacks criteria, and the department has not fully identified metrics aligned to core business functions to inform investment decisions.

Specifically, according to administration officials, the VHA  Business Function Framework is the architectural model that describes  the core business functions that are necessary to the mission of  delivering health care services and supporting the needs of veterans,  health care providers, and resource partners. This framework defines a  total of 262 core business functions as part of the VHA business  architecture.

VHA  officials noted that every IT need and system is intended to be mapped to  one or more of the defined business functions.", "VHA has also taken steps toward measuring and reporting the extent to  which mission value is actually realized.

The group was created in August 2004 to  address disconnects among the consult package, the scheduling  package, and the electronic wait list. In addition, the office continues to  track a request made in 2007 for the development of a scheduling  application to address deficiencies including wait times, resource  management, and user satisfaction in order to improve coordination of  patient care. This significant long-standing request remains open after a  decade without plans for when and how an IT solution will be developed  to address this business need.", "Community Care.

Approximately  30 percent of these requests were entered into the NSR database more  than 5 years ago but were still considered relevant to the community care  program. For example, the office tracked a request from 2006, related to  the IT solution for flagging emergency care claims. This request had been  unaddressed for more than 10 years and the absence of such a system  resulted in labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes.

VA spends a  significant amount of money on sustaining existing systems, which  department officials said has limited the funds available for enhancing or  modernizing those systems or acquiring new systems to address VHA\u2019s  unmet needs. Furthermore, according to department officials, VHA is  challenged because the administration has more business needs than  available resources and funding.", "Additionally, weaknesses in IT strategic planning, investment  management, and enterprise architecture processes previously discussed  in this report have contributed to a lack of understanding of the extent to  which VHA\u2019s business functions require additional IT system support to  meet the needs and strategic goals of the administration.

Weaknesses in key processes leave VA  unable to gauge the extent to which it is providing information systems  that meet VHA\u2019s needs. Specifically, the department has not assigned  targets or established metrics for measuring performance toward  achieving its strategic planning objectives. In addition, VA\u2019s department- level IT investment management activities have lacked implementation of  governance boards, application of selection criteria, and documentation of  investment decisions. Also, VHA has only aligned metrics with about one  quarter of the core business functions identified in its enterprise  architecture.

This comparison focused on the specific aspects of the  processes that are intended to ensure that IT investments meet the  business needs of the VHA organization.

We reviewed the department\u2019s assertions in these plans for how IT  strategic goals align to the goals of the VA Strategic Plan.
