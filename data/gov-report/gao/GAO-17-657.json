However, the military services' approaches do not include measurable objectives or performance measures that have several important attributes, such as linkage to mission, a baseline, and measurable targets, that GAO has found are key to successfully measuring a program's performance. Military band officials cited the difficulty and resources required to quantify how the bands are addressing their missions, but the military services are taking steps to improve how they track information on band events to measure the bands' effectiveness.

From fiscal year 2012 to 2014, the Air Force closed three active- duty and six Air National Guard regional and field bands to address  budget reductions or to offset increases for other mission needs,  according to band program officials. During the fiscal year 2015 budget- development process, the Air Force Bands Division submitted four  options for reducing the number and size of bands that took into  consideration, among other things, the reduced support to major  commands and the number of outreach opportunities missed to connect  with industry leaders and the public in the areas that would no longer  have band support. However, the Air Force did not implement any of  these options. Air Force manpower officials noted that, when the Air  Force has proposed past reductions, the commanders and community  leaders strongly advocated for maintaining bands assigned to their  command and local areas because of the bands\u2019 effect on troop morale  and community relations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Military Services Have Tracked and Used Information on Band Events but They Have Not Developed Objectives and Measures to Assess How Bands Are Addressing Their Missions", "paragraphs": ["The military services have tracked and used information on band events;  however, the services have not developed objectives and measures to  assess how their bands are addressing the bands\u2019 missions, such as  inspiring patriotism, enhancing the morale of troops, and promoting U.S.  interests abroad."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Military Services Have Tracked Information on Band Events, and Bands Reported Using This Information to Plan and Improve Future Events", "paragraphs": ["All four military services have tracked information, such as the number  and type of band events, and military bands reported using this  information to aid their planning for any improvements at future events.  The type of tracked information varies, but all services at a minimum track  the number and types of events the bands have performed, as well as the  number of audience members at these events and broadcast audience  counts. In addition, the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force track the  number of event requests their bands are not able to fulfill. Military bands  generally enter this information into a database or regularly report the  information to the services\u2019 band program offices. We found that the  number of audience members varies widely depending on the type of  event. For example, according to Air Force data, one of the U.S. Air Force  Band\u2019s musical groups performed at the Super Bowl in 2016 in front of an  estimated 71,000 ticketholders, while another musical group performed at  a service member\u2019s promotion ceremony that had an estimated 75 people  in attendance. Table 8 shows the reported number of events performed  by the military bands, the number of event requests that were declined,  and the estimated number of audience members at events in fiscal year  2016, according to data collected by the military services.", "Each military service categorizes the types of events performed by its  bands differently. The Army, Navy, and Air Force track several specific  categories for the types of events their bands perform. For example, the  Army tracks, among other categories, the number of funerals performed,  which accounted for 35 percent of the events Army bands performed in  fiscal year 2016 according to Army data. The Marine Corps categorizes  the types of events its regional and field bands perform more broadly as  either \u201cMilitary\u201d or \u201cCivilian,\u201d and reported that 79 percent and 21 percent  of the events performed by these bands in fiscal year 2016 were \u201cMilitary\u201d  and \u201cCivilian,\u201d respectively.", "Military bands perform at a variety of events, such as military ceremonies,  community events or parades, and funerals for service members.  According to band commanders we met with, their bands prioritize  performing at military ceremonies or events where service members are  in attendance. In addition, the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of  Defense for Public Affairs issues an annual outreach planning document  that articulates, for the upcoming fiscal year, (1) the military services\u2019  priorities for community-relations activities, (2) key resources available for  use, (3) summary details about known and anticipated activities, and (4)  certain cost information for the identified activities.", "The responses to our questionnaire showed how individual bands track  and use information to plan future events. According to their responses,  101 of 125 bands (or 81 percent) responded that they track social-media  analytics, such as frequency of mentions on Facebook. In addition, we  found that bands use their band websites, Facebook, Twitter, and  YouTube to expand the reach of their events. For example, in November  2016, the U.S. Army Field Band posted a YouTube video of the band\u2019s  performance of the \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic\u201d that had about 1.6  million views as of June 2017. The U.S. Air Force Band also posted a  YouTube video in December 2015 of an event at Union Station in  Washington, D.C., that had about 4 million views as of June 2017. The  military bands that responded to our questionnaire identified the following  examples of how they used tracked information to make changes to their  performances:", "An Army band reported changing the timing of summer concerts from  Sundays to Saturdays to meet its audiences\u2019 preference.", "An Air Force band determined that audience members wanted an  overall entertainment product with performances using lighting,  staging, and other elements\u2014rather than just music.", "An Army band stationed in a foreign country determined that  audiences wanted mostly small-group performances, local pop music,  and other music that caters to both U.S. and local national audiences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Services Have Not Developed Objectives and Performance Measures to Assess How Their Bands Are Addressing the Bands\u2019 Missions", "paragraphs": ["While the military services have tracked information on the events their  bands performed, they have not developed objectives and performance  measures to assess how their bands are addressing the bands\u2019 missions,  such as inspiring patriotism, enhancing the morale of troops, and  promoting U.S. interests abroad. Table 9 shows the missions for the  military bands, according to military-service guidance. In May 2017,  officials from the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for  Public Affairs stated that DOD is revising its guidance for community- relations policy implementation to incorporate an overarching mission for  military bands.", "Band program officials cited several examples of how they can determine  that their bands are addressing their missions.", "Indicators of demand\u2014Band program officials noted that the  audience counts and number of declined event requests as cited  above indicate the demand for their events and that the demand  exceeds supply. Air National Guard band program officials stated that  in addition to the counts of performances cited above, Air National  Guard bands survey audiences during summer tours to understand  how their bands are received by the general public. For example,  based on responses to these surveys in 2016, program officials  reported that 1,135 (or 98 percent) of 1,154 survey respondents  stated that they had a better understanding of the federal and state  missions of the Air National Guard after attending the bands\u2019  performances.", "Examples of effectiveness\u2014Military service band program officials  cited examples where bands were used to address specific  challenges or objectives in their local area of operations. Air Force  band program officials provided an example where recruiters at a  base had difficulty recruiting diverse service members, so in March  2016 an Air Force band performed recruiting concerts at local  schools; the result was the band reached 7,000 students, and  recruiters reported an increase in queries after these events.", "Support from senior leadership\u2014Officials from all of the military- service band programs stated that senior leadership has supported  the bands\u2019 missions, citing how bands aid in outreach to troops,  communities, or international audiences. For example, Navy and Air  Force band program officials stated that senior leadership has noted  how performances by bands can be an initial step towards improving  relationships with foreign nations. The Commanding Officer of the  U.S. Navy Band provided an example where the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff hosted a delegation from a foreign nation that had  tense relations with the United States at the time. According to the  Commanding Officer, the U.S. Navy Band\u2019s chorus provided after- dinner entertainment, and as part of the performance, sang one of the  foreign nation\u2019s folk songs in the native language, which was  videotaped, posted on YouTube, and had over 1.1 million views.", "While these examples provide important context about the bands\u2019 reach  and impact, the approaches do not include measurable objectives nor  exhibit several of the important attributes performance measures should  include. GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  states that management should define objectives in specific and  measurable terms so they are understood at all levels of the entity and  that performance towards achieving those objectives can be assessed.  In addition, the standards state that management should establish  activities to monitor performance measures. GAO has developed several  important attributes that performance measures should include if they are  to be effective in monitoring progress and determining how well programs  are achieving their mission, such as performance measures being clear,  objective, and measurable, and having baseline and trend data to identify,  monitor, and report changes in performance and to help ensure that  performance is viewed in context. Table 10 identifies each attribute and  its corresponding definition.", "However, we found that the services have not developed objectives and  performance measures that include several of the important attributes for  successful performance measures to assess how their bands are  addressing the bands\u2019 missions. Specifically, the services\u2019 approaches do  not exhibit the linkage attribute in that there is not clear alignment  between the information and how it affects the bands\u2019 ability to achieve  their missions. GAO\u2019s key attributes state that linkages between an  organization\u2019s mission and measures are most effective when they are  clearly communicated and create a line of sight so that everyone  understands how their work contributes to the organization\u2019s efforts. Also,  the military services have not established a baseline for the information,  so they are not able to assess the program\u2019s performance and progress  over time. Identifying and reporting deviations from the baseline as a  program proceeds provides valuable information for oversight by  identifying areas of program risk and their causes to decision makers.  Lastly, the services\u2019 approaches are not using the GAO attribute of  measurable targets to facilitate future assessments of whether overall  objectives were achieved.", "Officials from all of the military-service band program offices stated that  they have not quantified whether their bands are addressing their  missions because the bands\u2019 missions, such as inspiring patriotism,  enhancing the morale of troops, and promoting U.S. interests abroad, are  not quantitatively measurable. While we believe that inspiring patriotism  and enhancing the morale of troops could be quantitatively measured  through techniques such as surveys and focus groups, band program  officials stated, and we recognize, that they have limited resources to  conduct these types of activities. We also acknowledge that evaluating  how the bands are addressing their missions is difficult. However, using  the information the military services already track, such as the number of  events performed or the number of audience members in attendance, the  services could, for example, develop a baseline assessment for current  performance, set measurable targets, and monitor trends over time to  assess progress.", "DOD and the services are taking steps to improve how they track  information on events to measure the effectiveness of military bands. In  September 2016, the Chief of Army Music established an Army Music  Analytics Team to define and gather data points to regularly collect  information from Army bands to report quantifiable effects on event  performance, audience engagement, and messaging. In June 2017, an  Army band program official stated that the team has expanded its scope  to collaborate with academia and industry to obtain insights and identify  metrics that can be used to demonstrate the effectiveness of Army bands.  Also, in response to our review, officials from the Office of the Assistant to  the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs stated that they met with  service band program officials and band commanders to establish  standard metrics to collect on events performed by bands.
