This framework describes leading practices in four components: organizational culture, assessment of inherent program risks, design of tailored antifraud controls, and evaluation of outcomes. As provided in the framework, for example, the Bank has identified a dedicated entity within the Bank to lead fraud risk management. GAO also found that Bank managers and staff generally hold positive views of the Bank's antifraud culture. However, GAO also found that management and staff hold differing views on key aspects of that culture. These differing views include how active the Bank should be in addressing fraud. For example, Bank managers told GAO the Bank's current approach has been appropriate for dealing with fraud. However, about one-third of Bank staff responding to a GAO employee survey said the Bank should be \u201cmuch more active\u201d or \u201csomewhat more active\u201d in preventing, detecting, and addressing fraud. These and other divergent views indicate an opportunity to better ensure the Bank sets an antifraud tone that permeates the organizational culture, as provided in the Fraud Risk Framework.", "GAO found the Bank has taken some steps to assess fraud risk. For example, the Bank's practice has generally been to assess particular fraud risks and lessons learned following specific instances of fraud encountered, according to Bank managers. However, the Bank has not conducted a comprehensive fraud risk assessment, as provided in the framework. The Bank has also been compiling a \u201cregister\u201d of risks identified across the organization, including fraud. This register, however, does not include some known methods of fraud, such as submission of fraudulent documentation, thus indicating it is incomplete. Without planning and conducting regular fraud risk assessments as called for in the framework, the Bank is vulnerable to failing to identify fraud risks that can damage its reputation or harm its ability to support U.S. jobs through greater exports. As provided in the framework, managers should determine where fraud can occur and the types of internal and external fraud the program faces, including an assessment of the likelihood and impact of fraud risks inherent to the program.", "At the conclusion of GAO's review, Bank managers said they will fully adopt the GAO framework. They said they plan to complete a fraud risk assessment by December 2018, and to determine the Bank's fraud risk profile\u2014that is, document key findings and conclusions from the assessment\u2014by February 2019. Work to adopt other framework components will begin afterward, the managers said. However, they did not provide details of how their efforts will be in accord with leading practices of the framework. As a result, GAO makes framework-specific recommendations in order to enumerate relevant issues and to present clear benchmarks for assessing Bank progress.

For 100 days or fewer, the rate has increased from 90 percent to 99  percent over the same period.", "Bank managers told us they seek to strike the right balance between the  competing objectives and believe they have done so. For example,  according to the CRC division, the Bank chooses to perform some of its  fraud-detection and mitigation activities after application approval\u2014such  as through reviews of transactions selected on both a random and risk- based basis\u2014in order to not unduly delay processing applications. Under  Bank practices, document review can be abbreviated, and, after  underwriting approval, lenders may accept certain transaction  documentation, such as invoices or shipping documents, at face value  unless something appears suspicious, managers told us.

But otherwise, the  Bank limits the extent of its application investigation, according to the  Bank\u2019s OGC. In particular, as the Bank\u2019s OGC told us, the Bank is  required by law to make medium-term offerings a \u201csimple product.\u201d  There is pressure both legally and commercially to process transactions  quickly, because, otherwise, an exporter could lose its business  opportunity, the Bank\u2019s OGC told us. In many of these transactions, both  the exporter and buyer are small, the OGC also said, so it is more difficult  to get information. As a result, according to the OGC, the Bank relies  more on self-reporting by transaction parties. For these reasons, the  Bank\u2019s OGC told us, for both short- and medium-term products, there are  not as many \u201cinherent checks and balances\u201d in the process. We note that  based on previous GAO work, self-reporting can present an opportunity  for fraud.", "However, our survey results suggest that significant portions of Bank staff  question whether the Bank is striking the right balance in providing  sufficient time for preapproval review of transactions. Specifically, Bank  staff raised concerns about the amount of time dedicated to the key task  of preapproval review of applications. For each of the Bank\u2019s three major  product maturity categories, we asked whether the application process  provides enough time for Bank staff to conduct thorough due diligence on  potential fraud risks.

We asked employees to  describe the extent to which each of six offices or groups\u2014OGC, the  OIG, the Office of Risk Management, Bank senior management, all bank  staff and managers collectively, or others\u2014are responsible for overseeing  fraud risk management activities at the Bank. The OIG received the  highest response, with 73 percent saying it has \u201ca great deal of  responsibility.\u201d Bank managers told us this result is to be expected,  because staff associate issues of fraud with the OIG. However, these  survey results suggest confusion\u2014lack of a shared view, from the  standpoint of antifraud culture\u2014around the OIG\u2019s role, which includes  investigating suspected fraud, rather than overseeing the Bank\u2019s fraud  risk management activities. The OIG acknowledged to us that its role  does not include responsibility for overseeing fraud risk management  activities at the Bank.", "Asked about our findings overall, Bank managers told us they view our  survey results as positive because the results indicate employees have a  strong awareness of fraud and the risk it presents to the Bank. For  example, regarding the results about the role of the OIG, they noted that  staff are actively encouraged to report suspected fraud through  channels\u2014first to OGC, for subsequent referral to the OIG. Thus,  employees would understand the OIG as being responsive to fraud, and  Bank managers believe this likely accounts for the survey result.", "Nevertheless, they said, our survey results provide an opportunity for  more detailed training, to better communicate with staff. In particular, the  Bank managers told us such training would focus on the Bank\u2019s approach  to fraud, plus the Bank\u2019s organizational structure for addressing fraud.

Ongoing monitoring and periodic evaluations provide  assurances to managers that they are effectively preventing, detecting,  and responding to potential fraud. Further, according to the framework,  effective monitoring and evaluation focuses on measuring outcomes and  progress toward achieving objectives.", "Because the Bank has not completed a comprehensive fraud risk  assessment, or designed antifraud controls based on such an  assessment, it is not in a position to fulfill this final component. Even at  that, however, we found the Bank does not generally evaluate the  effectiveness or efficiency of its current fraud risk management practices.  For example, OGC and CRC managers\u2014who form the dedicated entity  for managing fraud risks (as described earlier in component one)\u2014both  told us they are unaware of any procedure to periodically assess the  effectiveness of the Bank\u2019s fraud risk management policies. In addition,  the Bank currently has no formal method for tracking fraud activity,  according to a Bank manager. Thus, the Bank is not in a position to  explicitly judge the effectiveness of antifraud controls. Further, as  described earlier, Bank managers told us the fraud indicators they do  track are not precise or numerical measures and that, instead, OGC is  aware of fraud activity through a general sense of daily business.", "Following our inquiries, Bank managers told us they plan to revise their  approach to monitoring, evaluating, and adapting their fraud risk  management practices. They said they now plan to evaluate the  effectiveness of those practices, following adoption of the second and  third components of GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework, and with the intent to  adapt controls as indicated necessary, in accordance with the  framework\u2019s fourth component. Timing will depend on implementation of  the underlying fraud risk assessment, Bank managers told us. The Bank  cannot be assured that its antifraud controls are optimal until it has  fulfilled component four of GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework in the  comprehensive fashion envisioned, following previous full implementation  of components two and three. In particular, it cannot be assured that  current practices are adequate, based on inherent program risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Proactively and strategically managing fraud risks can aid the Bank\u2019s  mission of supporting American jobs by facilitating U.S. exports, by  reducing not only the risk of financial loss to the government, but also the  risk of serious reputational harm to the Bank. The Bank has taken some  steps to address fraud that are among leading practices identified in  GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework. But overall, the Bank has approached  fraud risk management on a fragmented, reactive basis, and its antifraud  activities have not been marshalled into the kind of comprehensive,  strategic fraud risk management regime envisioned by GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk  Framework and its leading practices.", "Chiefly, this is because the Bank has not anchored its fraud risk  management policies in a comprehensive fraud risk assessment and  corresponding risk profile, tailored to its operations, and then  implemented controls designed to address the specific fraud risks  identified in the assessment. Some fraud risk facing the Bank is already  known, such as fabricated documentation. But as the Bank  acknowledges, in addition to fraud risk inherent in its complex lines of  business, it also faces significant risk from new or unfamiliar deal  structures it may employ, and in new and unfamiliar technologies and  industries it may service, where it has limited experience. Regular,  comprehensive fraud risk assessments will address not only known types  of fraud, but also seek to identify where fraud can occur and the types of  fraud the program faces, including likelihood and impact.", "Accordingly, until the Bank begins conducting thorough, systematic  assessments of its fraud risks, and compiles a risk profile prioritizing such  risks, it cannot be assured that it satisfactorily understands its  vulnerabilities to fraud and any gaps in its capabilities for addressing  them. Following on from that, without developing and implementing an  antifraud strategy that builds on the findings of the comprehensive risk  assessments and risk profile, the Bank cannot be assured that its  antifraud control activities are optimally designed for, and targeted to, the  actual fraud risks its faces\u2014meaning that it could be failing to address  significant risks or targeting the wrong ones. Finally, without establishing  outcome-oriented metrics and then regularly reviewing progress toward  meeting these goals, the Bank cannot be assured that its antifraud control  activities are working as intended.", "As we concluded our review, the Bank, encouragingly, said it would adopt  the more proactive approach described by GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework.  Thus, the Bank now needs to follow through on its stated intent to change  its practices, and accomplish the tasks, described to us by Bank  managers, as intended and in a timely fashion. This is true not only for  current operations, but also prospectively, for the large transaction  backlog the Bank faces, which Bank managers will process if or when the  Bank\u2019s quorum issue is resolved, and which could stress Bank fraud  controls.", "The Bank\u2019s identification of a dedicated entity to lead fraud risk  management activities can be an important step in the right direction if  that move now becomes the start of a sustained commitment. By fully  adopting the elements of the framework, the Bank can strengthen its  antifraud culture, better understand fraud risks facing its products and  programs, and reshape how it monitors and evaluates the outcomes of its  fraud risk management activities. In doing so, it will be better positioned to  protect taxpayers and its multi-billion-dollar portfolio, while still meeting its  mission to support American jobs and exports.", "Even though Bank managers have already told us they plan to implement  the framework, they did not provide us documentation describing in detail  how they will ensure their fraud risk assessment and fraud risk profile are  consistent with leading practices of the framework\u2014such as by ensuring  the risk assessment considers all inherent fraud risks and the risk profile  reflects risk tolerances that are specific and measurable. Thus, we  include the following framework-specific recommendations in order to  comprehensively enumerate relevant issues we identified, as well as to  present clear benchmarks of accountability for assessing Bank progress.  This complete listing is important in light of the Bank\u2019s recent embrace of  the framework; changes in the Bank\u2019s executive leadership and  vacancies on the Bank Board; and expected congressional consideration  of the Bank\u2019s reauthorization in 2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following seven recommendations to the Bank:  The acting Bank president and Board chairman should ensure that the  Bank evaluates and implements methods to further promote and sustain  an antifraud tone that permeates the Bank\u2019s organizational culture, as  described in GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework. This should include  consideration of requiring training on fraud risks relevant to Bank  programs, for new employees and all employees on an ongoing basis,  with the training to include identifying roles and responsibilities in fraud  risk management activities across the Bank. (Recommendation 1)", "As the agency begins efforts to plan and conduct regular fraud risk  assessments and to determine a fraud risk profile, the acting Bank  president and Board chairman should ensure that the Bank\u2019s risk  assessments and profile address not only known methods of fraud,  including those that are absent from its current risk register, but other  inherent fraud risks as well. (Recommendation 2)", "As the agency begins efforts to plan and conduct regular fraud risk  assessments and to determine a fraud risk profile, the acting Bank  president and Board chairman should ensure that the risk profile includes  risk tolerances that are specific and measurable. (Recommendation 3)", "The acting Bank president and Board chairman should ensure that the  Bank develops and implements an antifraud strategy with specific control  activities, based upon the results of fraud risk assessments and a  corresponding fraud risk profile, as provided in GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk  Framework. (Recommendation 4)", "The acting Bank president and Board chairman should ensure that the  Bank identifies, and then implements, the best options for sharing more  fraud-related information\u2014including details of fraud case referrals and  outcomes\u2014among Bank staff, to help build fraud awareness, as  described in GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework. (Recommendation 5)", "The acting Bank president and Board chairman should lead efforts to  collaborate with the Bank\u2019s OIG to identify a feasible, cost-effective  means to systematically track outcomes of fraud referrals from the Bank  to the OIG, including creating a means to link the OIG\u2019s proven cases of  fraud to the specific Bank transactions from which the OIG actions arose.  If any such means are found to be feasible and cost-effective, the acting  Bank president and Board chairman should direct appropriate staff to  implement them, with such information to be used for purposes consistent  with GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework, such as data analytics.  (Recommendation 6)", "The acting Bank president and Board chairman should ensure that the  Bank monitors and evaluates outcomes of fraud risk management  activities, using a risk-based approach and outcome-oriented metrics, and  that it subsequently adapts antifraud activities or implements new ones,  as determined to be appropriate and consistent with GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk  Framework.

In  written comments, summarized below and reproduced in appendix III, the  Bank agreed with our recommendations. The bank also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In its written comments, the Bank said it will take several steps to  implement our recommendations to improve its fraud risk management  activities. For example, the Bank stated it would continue to evaluate and  implement methods to promote and sustain an antifraud tone that  permeates the Bank\u2019s organizational culture. In assessing fraud risks, the  Bank stated it will include not only known risks, but also other inherent  risks not yet known to have led to fraud. Following a fraud risk  assessment as provided in GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework, the Bank  stated that it will develop antifraud controls based on that assessment,  subject to cost-benefit analysis. The Bank also stated that it will monitor  and evaluate outcomes of its fraud risk management activities, and adapt  existing controls or implement new controls as indicated, subject to cost- benefit analysis. The Bank further stated it will identify and implement  ways to share more fraud-related information.", "In its written comments, the Bank also raised four concerns about our  work.", "First, the Bank stated that it keeps substantial reserves for losses, which  protect against taxpayer costs. We clarified our report to indicate that  Bank officials told us they maintain reserves to protect against taxpayer  costs. We did not evaluate the extent to which these reserves protect  against taxpayer costs because doing so was outside the scope of our  review.", "Second, the Bank stated our employee survey does not directly support  some of the conclusions that we draw from responses received, and that  only 24 percent of respondents were in the Export Finance area, which  handles underwriting of Bank transactions. We note that the leading  practices of the Fraud Risk Framework call for involving all levels of the  agency in setting an antifraud tone that permeates the organizational  culture. We also note that the Office of the Export Finance is not the only  division involved in fraud control activities. For example, during our  review, Bank managers told us that employees in the Credit Review and  Compliance division, the Office of the General Counsel, and the Office of  the Chief Financial Officer, among other offices, are also involved in fraud  control activities. Thus, we believe it is appropriate that survey responses  from those who work in these and other offices are included in our survey  results. As noted in our report, Bank managers, in interviews, and staff, in  our employee survey, generally expressed positive views of the Bank\u2019s  antifraud culture, but they hold different views on key aspects of that  culture. We believe that our survey results support these findings, as well  as related conclusions and recommendation (Recommendation 1), with  which the Bank agreed.", "Third, the Bank stated that it has been very effective in preventing,  detecting, and prosecuting fraud in Bank transactions. Our review  evaluated the extent to which the Bank has adopted leading practices for  managing fraud risks, as described in the Fraud Risk Framework. We did  not evaluate the operational effectiveness of specific Bank control  activities for preventing, detecting, and prosecuting fraud because doing  so was beyond the scope of our review.", "Fourth, the Bank stated that our report and the employee survey did not  clearly and consistently distinguish between fraud and fraud risk, which  may lead to confusion in both the survey responses and the analysis in  the report. However, we define the terms \u201cactual fraud\u201d and \u201cfraud risk\u201d in  our employee survey, which appears in appendix II. Further, as described  in greater detail in appendix I, we pretested and modified the survey to  ensure questions were understood by respondents and that we used  correct terminology. This process allowed us to determine whether survey  questions and answer choices were clear and appropriate. Thus, we  believe the survey results support our findings.
