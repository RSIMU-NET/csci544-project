FDA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), administers these programs.", "The 21st Century Cures Act included a provision for GAO to study the PRV programs. GAO examined the number of PRVs awarded and redeemed and the drugs for which they were awarded or redeemed, and what is known about the extent to which the PRVs provide incentives for developing drugs to meet unmet needs. GAO analyzed FDA data on awarded and redeemed PRVs for fiscal years 2009 through 2019 and other publicly available information on their transfers and sales. GAO conducted a literature review of peer-reviewed articles published from January 2009 through May 2019 that examined the PRV programs and interviewed FDA officials. GAO also interviewed seven stakeholder groups, seven academic researchers, and seven drug sponsors selected based on factors such as familiarity with PRV programs or drug development.", "HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) awards priority review vouchers (PRV) to drug sponsors that develop drugs for tropical diseases or rare pediatric diseases or to use as medical countermeasures.

The potential for additional revenue from either marketing a drug about 4 months sooner or from selling the PRV could provide an incentive for drug sponsors to develop drugs for these diseases or conditions. From fiscal year 2009, when the first PRV was awarded, through fiscal year 2019, FDA awarded 31 PRVs, mostly for drugs to treat rare pediatric diseases. Of the 31 PRVs awarded by FDA,17 were sold to another drug sponsor for prices ranging from about $67 million to $350 million, according to available data. As of September 30, 2019, available data show that drug sponsors had redeemed 16 of the 31 PRVs to obtain a shorter FDA review time for drugs to treat conditions and diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), type 2 diabetes, and different forms of arthritis. These drug applications may not otherwise qualify for priority review.", "GAO found few studies that examined the PRV programs, and those that did found the programs had little or no effect on drug development. However, all seven drug sponsors GAO spoke with stated that PRVs were a factor in drug development decisions\u2014six sponsors said they were one of a number of factors, while one sponsor said they were pivotal in its development of a drug.

Drug sponsors\u2014facing a lengthy and expensive drug development  process\u2014may be reluctant to develop treatments for these diseases or  conditions given the small markets or potentially limited profitability for  them. Other challenges can make drug development for tropical  diseases, rare pediatric diseases, and medical countermeasures more  difficult than for other drugs. Specifically, tropical diseases often affect  people living in low-income areas outside of the United States, making it  difficult for drug sponsors to recover drug development costs; rare  pediatric diseases affect a limited number of children, making it difficult to  identify and recruit sufficient numbers of patients to include in studies;  and medical countermeasures treat high-priority threats that affect health  security, making it difficult to test the drugs because exposing study  volunteers to such threats would be an unethical and unacceptable risk.", "To encourage the development of drugs to treat tropical diseases, treat  rare pediatric diseases, and use as medical countermeasures, Congress  established three priority review voucher (PRV) programs under which  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) awards a PRV to a drug sponsor  upon approval of that sponsor\u2019s drug in one of these three areas. A drug  sponsor can later redeem the PRV when submitting a future drug  application to treat any disease or condition, or sell or transfer it to  another drug sponsor. When redeemed, a PRV entitles a drug sponsor to  priority review by FDA\u2014which has a goal of a 6-month review, rather than  the 10-month goal for a standard review.

Publicly available information included PRV  sales (including sales prices), transfers, purchases, and redemptions  reported by drug sponsors in documents such as press releases and  Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

A drug may also  receive priority review if the drug sponsor  redeems a priority review voucher, among  other things. FDA\u2019s goal is to complete the  review of a priority application within 6  months.  Drugs that do not receive priority review  receive standard review. FDA\u2019s goal is to  complete the review of a standard application  within 10 months.", "FDA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), is responsible for overseeing the safety and efficacy of drugs and  biological products, such as vaccines, sold in the United States. Before a  drug sponsor can market a new drug, it generally must submit evidence  of the drug\u2019s safety and effectiveness to FDA in a new drug application or  biologics license application. While FDA reviews most drug applications  using its standard review process, FDA\u2019s priority review designation is  intended to reduce the review time needed to bring a drug to market for  certain drugs that treat serious conditions. A drug application typically  receives a priority review designation if the drug would provide a  significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the prevention,  diagnosis, or treatment of a serious condition when compared to available  drugs, among other things (see sidebar). FDA reviews all applications to  determine if they qualify for priority review.", "FDA is also responsible for the implementation of the three PRV  programs, which are intended to encourage development of drugs for  tropical diseases, rare pediatric diseases, and medical  countermeasures. Qualifying diseases and conditions for the tropical  disease PRV program and criteria for the rare pediatric disease PRV  program are set forth in statute\u2014though the list of eligible tropical  diseases can be updated by order of the Secretary of HHS. For the  medical countermeasure PRV program, HHS publishes a list of high- priority threats that qualify for a PRV, including those that the Department  of Homeland Security determines to pose a material threat sufficient to  affect national security. (See table 1 for the types of drugs eligible for a  PRV.)", "In order to be awarded a PRV, drug applications must meet additional  criteria. For example, for all three PRV programs, the drug application  must be eligible for priority review and a drug may be disqualified if its  active ingredient has been previously approved by FDA in another drug  application. If a drug application meets the eligibility criteria for one of  the PRV programs, the drug sponsor can include a request for a PRV in  its application, including supporting documentation demonstrating how  the application meets the PRV eligibility criteria. Once FDA receives a  sponsor\u2019s drug application and PRV request, it reviews the information  and considers whether the drug should be approved. If FDA approves the  drug application, it includes its decision regarding whether to award a  PRV in its approval letter.", "Once FDA awards a PRV to a drug sponsor, the sponsor can redeem the  PRV with the submission of a future drug application for a drug intended  to treat any disease or condition, shortening FDA\u2019s targeted review time  from the 10-month standard review to 6 months, even if the drug in that  future application would not qualify for priority review on its own merits.  The drug sponsor also has the option of selling or transferring the PRV to  another drug sponsor, which may then choose to use it or similarly sell or  transfer it. PRVs may be transferred any number of times before they  are used. When the drug sponsor possessing the PRV ultimately  decides to redeem it, the sponsor must notify FDA at least 90 days in  advance of submitting its drug application that is using the PRV. Figure 1  provides a general overview of the PRV programs.", "The drug sponsor redeeming a PRV must also pay a PRV user fee (about  $2.5 million in fiscal year 2019), in addition to other user fees required for  all drug applications. Because drug applications submitted to FDA with  a PRV would not otherwise qualify for priority review, PRV user fees are  intended to cover FDA\u2019s additional costs incurred when reviewing new  drug applications with a PRV. When a drug sponsor notifies FDA of its  intent to redeem a PRV, its notification serves as a legally binding  commitment to pay the PRV user fee.", "Of the three PRV programs, two\u2014the rare pediatric disease and the  medical countermeasure PRV programs\u2014are set to expire in the coming  years, unless they are reauthorized by Congress.

The medical countermeasure  PRV program will expire on October 1, 2023.

According to FDA, all PRVs were  awarded for drugs that met unmet medical needs. The 31 PRVs were  awarded to 26 different drug sponsors; three sponsors were awarded two  PRVs each and one sponsor was awarded three PRVs. FDA awarded the  31 PRVs for drugs that treat 27 different diseases. For five diseases\u2014 malaria, tuberculosis, smallpox, spinal muscular atrophy, and Duchenne  muscular dystrophy\u2014FDA awarded PRVs to two different drugs for their  treatment, and FDA awarded one PRV for a drug that prevents two  different diseases. (See appendix I for more information about the drugs  for which FDA awarded PRVs.)", "The first PRV was awarded in fiscal year 2009, 2 years after the start of  the tropical disease PRV program, and none were awarded in fiscal years  2010 through 2012. The first rare pediatric disease PRV was awarded in  fiscal year 2014\u2014about 2 years after that PRV program was authorized\u2014 and, beginning in fiscal year 2015, the majority of PRVs awarded were for  rare pediatric diseases. In fiscal year 2018, FDA awarded eight PRVs,  including the first medical countermeasure PRV, the most awarded in a  single fiscal year (see fig. 3).", "Of the 31 PRVs that FDA awarded to drug sponsors, available data  indicate 17 PRVs were subsequently sold to another drug sponsor,  providing revenue to the sponsor selling the PRV. For 14 of these 17  PRVs, we were able to determine a sales price, which ranged from $67.5  million for a PRV sold in fiscal year 2014 to $350 million for a PRV sold in  fiscal year 2015. However, the available sales prices of the PRVs sold  since February 2017 have varied less than those sold previously, ranging  from $80 to $130 million (see fig. 4). Because drug sponsors are only  required to notify FDA of sales of rare pediatric disease PRVs at the time  the sale occurs, additional transfers or sales of PRVs may have  occurred.", "The drug sponsors, stakeholders, and researchers we interviewed noted  that several factors could influence whether a drug sponsor keeps a PRV  for future use, sells the PRV to another drug sponsor, or purchases a  PRV to use on a drug that would not otherwise qualify for priority review.  The PRV programs allow PRVs to be transferred multiple times, and  according to stakeholders and drug sponsors we spoke with, the revenue  gained from such sales may be a motivating factor for drug sponsors to  sell them. For example, three stakeholders we interviewed said they  believe drug sponsors consider the drugs in their development pipeline  when deciding to keep, sell, or purchase a PRV, and one stated that drug  sponsors need to determine if they would benefit more from using the  PRV or the money they could make from selling it. One researcher  commented that price variation for PRVs can affect how a drug sponsor  perceives the incentive and that low prices for PRVs may signify the need  for additional incentives for drug development. However, two drug  sponsors told us that they would continue to pursue PRVs as long as they  were available and useful for a particular drug in their pipeline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More than Half of the PRVs Awarded Have Been Redeemed for Drugs Treating a Variety of Conditions", "paragraphs": ["As of September 30, 2019, drug sponsors redeemed 16 of the 31 PRVs\u2014 that is, they submitted the PRV to obtain priority review for a drug  application for a drug that would not otherwise qualify for a priority  review.

Since 2017, drug sponsors have redeemed between three and six  PRVs each year (see fig. 5).", "The 16 PRVs were redeemed by 10 different drug sponsors. Twelve of  the 16 redeemed PRVs were purchased and redeemed by a drug  sponsor different from the original PRV awardee.

For example, three of the  drug sponsors told us they might choose to redeem a PRV to help a drug  reach the market faster than a competitor\u2019s drug, and two drug sponsors  told us they may hold a PRV to use to obtain priority review for a  particular drug that is in development. Another drug sponsor told us it  considers the likelihood of a drug receiving approval from FDA when  deciding when to use a PRV (since the PRV only affects the time frames  for FDA\u2019s review and does not guarantee approval), and if a drug in its  pipeline could receive priority review from FDA on its own merit.", "Almost half of the awarded PRVs had not been redeemed as of the end  of fiscal year 2019, which may affect FDA\u2019s ability to forecast resources  needed in the future. In 2016, we reported that FDA told us that the rare  pediatric disease PRV program placed a substantial strain on its  workload, explaining that performing a priority review on a drug that would  otherwise merit a standard review requires the agency to conduct  significant work in a compressed time frame. Between fiscal years 2011  and 2018, PRV redemptions have accounted for less than 1 percent of  FDA\u2019s reviews in any given year, according to FDA. While FDA receives  90 days\u2019 notice of a PRV redemption, the notice period may not be  enough time to ensure the appropriate staff are available to review a drug  application that the agency does not consider to be a public health  priority, according to FDA. However, one researcher noted that this  uncertainty exists for all drug applications, as FDA cannot know in a given  year how many drug applications will be submitted in any particular  therapeutic area or how many of these applications will qualify for priority  review. Furthermore, two drug sponsors, one researcher, and one  stakeholder we spoke with noted that FDA collects additional user fees  for PRV redemptions specifically to support the priority review for a drug  that would not normally qualify for one. Since fiscal year 2011, FDA has  collected almost $44 million in PRV user fees for the 16 redeemed  PRVs.", "FDA does not track the resources it uses specifically for the PRV  programs, so the agency cannot determine if the PRV user fees paid  when PRVs are redeemed cover the associated costs. According to FDA,  the agency cannot anticipate the therapeutic area for which a PRV will be  redeemed, so PRV user fees may not ameliorate the effect of PRV  redemptions on the review divisions or provide for rapid hiring of  additional review staff with relevant experience and technical expertise.  FDA officials told us that each new PRV program\u2014and changes made to  existing PRV programs\u2014requires additional resources to implement. The  agency reports that the services of over 11 offices within FDA are  required to work on some aspect of the PRV programs, which may at  times require FDA to shift resources from its public health priorities.  According to FDA, the PRV programs also expend and divert agency  resources to draft and revise PRV-related guidance; update webpages;  research, draft, and publish notices and orders to add or decline to add  diseases to the list of eligible tropical diseases; respond to inquiries from  sponsors, potential sponsors, investors, attorneys, and other interested  individuals; and respond to requests for a rare pediatric disease  designation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Few Studies That Examined PRV Programs Found Little or No Effect on Drug Development; Improvements and Alternatives Were Suggested", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Few Studies Examining PRV Programs Found Little or No Effect on Drug Development and Views of the Programs Are Mixed", "paragraphs": ["Our literature review found three studies\u2014one for each of the PRV  programs\u2014that examined and drew conclusions about how PRV  programs affect drug development; of these, one study found evidence of  an effect of a PRV program on drug development. Specifically, it found  that drugs to treat rare pediatric diseases, which could be eligible for a  rare pediatric disease PRV, were more likely to advance from phase I to  phase II clinical trials when compared to rare adult disease drugs. The  studies examining the other two PRV programs did not find an effect on  drug development.", "Rare pediatric disease PRV program. A 2019 study found that the  rare pediatric disease PRV program was not associated with an  increase in the number or rate of new pediatric disease drugs that  started or completed clinical trials. However, the study found that,  after the creation of the rare pediatric disease PRV program, drugs  the study authors determined could be eligible for a rare pediatric  disease PRV were more likely to advance from phase I to phase II  clinical trials compared to rare adult disease drugs, which are not  eligible for a PRV under this program. Additionally, the study found  the time it took for drugs to progress to the next stage of development  was shorter among drugs eligible for a rare pediatric disease PRV  compared to drugs for rare adult diseases, across all three phases of  clinical development.", "Tropical diseases PRV program. A 2017 study found that this PRV  program was not associated with an increase in tropical disease drugs  starting clinical testing. The study found the proportion of tropical  disease drugs among all drugs in development decreased slightly  after the PRV program was created. Study authors suggested the  relatively small number of approved tropical disease products in the  last decade indicates the PRV program did not serve as a stimulus for  completing late-stage drug development.", "Medical countermeasure PRV program. A 2018 study reported that  25 of 26 medical countermeasures undergoing clinical trials received  direct or indirect public support, such as funding from the Department  of Defense. Authors stated that, given the extent to which  development of medical countermeasures already occurs via direct or  indirect federal funding, alternatives other than the PRV program  could better stimulate development of medical countermeasures.", "While the few studies of the PRV program found little to no effect on drug  development, the seven drug sponsors we contacted told us the PRV  programs were an incentive\u2014that is, a factor in their decisionmaking\u2014for  drug development.

All seven drug sponsors told us the PRV programs  were a factor in drug development decisions\u2014six sponsors said it was  one of a number of factors, and one sponsor said it was pivotal in its  development of a drug. For example, three drug sponsors told us  PRVs were important to help fund drug development and one of these  drug sponsors told us the PRV program supported its decision to  move a drug already under development to market. Four drug  sponsors told us PRV programs may be a more significant incentive  for small drug sponsors, with one small, nonprofit drug sponsor noting  that it entirely relied on the profits from the sale of its PRV to ensure  its drug would become available to those who need it. Additional  factors drug sponsors reported considering included whether the  sponsor has a drug in their development pipeline that could  particularly benefit from a PRV, and whether its drug development  program has public financial support, such as direct federal funding.", "Researchers. The seven researchers reported mixed views of the  PRV programs as an incentive for drug development, and their  perceptions of the three programs varied. For example, when asked  to describe the incentive for drug development provided by the  tropical disease PRV program, two researchers described it as \u201cnot  significant,\u201d and two researchers described it as \u201csomewhat  significant.\u201d However, one of these researchers told us the tropical  disease PRV program encouraged drug development, particularly for  diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria for which a drug is  potentially more commercially viable. Regarding the rare pediatric  disease PRV program, three researchers told us they have heard  anecdotally that the program is an incentive to develop or continue  development of rare pediatric disease drugs. In contrast, one  researcher told us many drug sponsors have received a rare pediatric  disease PRV for drugs they would have produced anyway, and  another told us he did not believe the rare pediatric disease PRV  provided an adequate incentive for adding new drugs into a drug  sponsor\u2019s pipeline. Finally, four researchers told us it was too early to  evaluate the medical countermeasure PRV program as an incentive.", "Stakeholders. The seven stakeholders also reported mixed views on  the PRV programs as an incentive for drug development. For  example, one stakeholder told us that drug sponsors have entered  particular drug development areas because of the PRV programs, and  the PRV program has been pivotal to the financial planning of small  drug sponsors working in the medical countermeasures and rare  pediatric disease spaces. In contrast, two other stakeholders told us  the PRV programs are an incentive to obtain FDA approval for a drug  that has already been developed and marketed outside of the United  States but are not an incentive for developing new drugs. One of  these stakeholders and an additional stakeholder also noted that  PRVs are often a source of additional revenue to drug sponsors that  would have developed their PRV drug anyway and did not need the  PRV to finance drug development.", "The number of PRVs awarded by FDA could influence the effectiveness  of the PRV programs as incentives, according to several drug sponsors,  researchers, and stakeholders we contacted. Specifically, some indicated  that the potential revenue from the sale of a PRV could decline if more  PRVs are awarded, and there is an increased supply of PRVs available  for sale. Specific comments included the following:", "One drug sponsor told us that, while the number of PRVs on the  market was a concern, they have remained valuable. Another drug  sponsor told us it was not concerned with the relative value of PRVs,  because it did not plan to sell its remaining PRVs and would purchase  more in the future if PRVs would benefit drugs in its pipeline.", "One researcher told us lower prices for PRVs merited concern,  because the PRV alone might not be sufficient to motivate drug  development. The researcher indicated that a drug would also need  either sufficient sales or additional government incentives.", "Two stakeholders told us the sales prices of PRVs (and potential  revenue from selling them) might be more of a concern for small drug  sponsors than large drug sponsors, as these stakeholders told us  small drug sponsors are more likely to sell their PRV instead of using  it for another drug in their portfolio.", "Drug sponsors, researchers, and stakeholders we contacted also  reported mixed views on whether the rare pediatric disease and medical  countermeasure PRV programs\u2014set to expire by 2022 and 2023, respectively\u2014should be reauthorized. While FDA officials reported that,  as of April 2019, the agency does not have a position on the  reauthorization of these two PRV programs, drug sponsors generally  indicated support for their reauthorizations, with some noting that PRV  program expirations may negatively affect overall drug development and  the willingness of drug sponsors to work in these areas. The researchers  we contacted offered mixed opinions on reauthorization. For example,  one recommended reauthorizing both PRV programs, but indicated that  his opinion could change if a better incentive was developed. In contrast,  another researcher supported the expiration of these two programs,  noting that their expiration could ultimately raise the potential revenue  from the sale of an available PRV and could also make the tropical  disease PRV program, which does not require reauthorization, more  popular to encourage drug development.

One of these stakeholders noted that a weakness of the  PRV program is that drug sponsors awarded a PRV have no  obligation to make the approved drug available at an affordable price.  It suggested that requiring an access plan may result in drugs for  which a PRV was awarded being more available and accessible to the  populations that need them.
