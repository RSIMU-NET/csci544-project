Each year, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) and related agencies carry out enforcement activities for several thousand complaints of housing discrimination. The timeliness and effectiveness of the enforcement process have been continuing concerns. GAO describes the stages and practices of the fair housing enforcement process, looks at recent trends, and identifies factors that may influence the length and thoroughness of the process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The current fair housing enforcement process provides a framework for addressing housing discrimination complaints. Both FHEO and Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies located around the country take inquiries about potential incidences of discrimination and conduct investigations to determine whether discrimination did in fact occur. The practices used during intake and investigation differ among FHEO and the FHAP agencies, as the state and local agencies have some discretion in determining which practices work best for them. As a result, some agencies have developed procedures that they said improved the quality of intake and made investigations easier. For example, some FHAP agencies use experienced investigators during the intake process to help clients develop formal complaints. To date, FHEO has not looked at such practices to determine if they should be disseminated for potential use at other locales. Further, individuals alleging discrimination in housing sometimes face a lengthy wait to have their complaints investigated and decided. Although the law sets a benchmark of 100 days to complete investigations into complaints of discrimination, FHEO and the FHAP agencies often do not meet that deadline. The typical time to complete an investigation in 1996 through 2003 was more than 200 days, with some investigations taking much longer. However, a lack of data makes it impossible to assess the full length and outcomes of fair housing enforcement activities. For example, because FHAP agencies are not required to report intake data to FHEO, complete information is not available on the number of initial contacts individuals alleging discrimination make with FHAP agencies. A lack of data on the ultimate outcomes of some investigations conducted by both FHEO and FHAP agencies may also prevent FHEO from fully measuring the time that complaints face before cases are ultimately decided. Human capital management challenges, such as ensuring adequate numbers of trained staff, further affect FHEO's ability to carry out its mission in a timely manner."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) of the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has been  responsible for addressing nearly 57,000 complaints of housing  discrimination filed in the last 8 years. The Fair Housing Act (the Act)\u2014 Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended\u2014prohibits housing  discrimination against minorities, persons with handicaps, and other  protected groups. The Act, which is administered by FHEO and 100 Fair  Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies, establishes a 100-day  benchmark for investigating fair housing complaints. In recent years,  neither FHEO nor the FHAP agencies have routinely met this benchmark.  For example, 1,611, or 39 percent, of open fair housing discrimination  investigations were over 100 days old and thus considered \u201caged\u201d as of  September 2003.", "You asked us to review several aspects of the fair housing enforcement  program. Specifically, we agreed with your offices to (1) describe the steps  involved in the fair housing enforcement process; (2) determine the  practices selected FHEO and FHAP agencies use to carry out the  enforcement process and identify practices with the potential to expedite  or improve it; (3) determine the trends, if any, that are discernable in HUD  data on the numbers, characteristics, and outcomes of fair housing  investigations; (4) determine the median time needed to complete each  stage of the enforcement process; and (5) identify factors that may  influence the length and thoroughness of the enforcement process.", "To describe the fair housing enforcement process, we reviewed the  legislation, regulations, and other guidance describing each stage of the  process and interviewed FHEO officials responsible for policymaking. To  determine the practices used at selected locations and their potential for  expediting or otherwise improving the process, we visited FHEO offices  and FHAP agencies in different regions and conducted structured  interviews with key officials in each location. To identify trends in FHEO  data on the numbers, characteristics, outcomes, and length of fair housing  investigations, we obtained and analyzed data from FHEO\u2019s automated  case-tracking system for an 8-year period (1996 to 2003). We also used  these data to determine the median time needed to complete fair housing  investigations. We assessed the reliability of data from this system by  reviewing documents and interviewing managers to determine the  reasonableness of system controls and by conducting reasonableness tests  of system data. To identify the factors that could influence the length and  thoroughness of the Title VIII enforcement process, we interviewed FHEO  and FHAP agency officials responsible for management, intake,  investigation, and legal matters at selected field locations and used a  questionnaire to survey all of FHEO\u2019s 10 regional directors.

This report focuses on enforcement of fair  housing rights under the Act, which is one of the federal government\u2019s  central tools for fighting discrimination in housing. The Act (as amended)  prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin,  sex, handicap, and familial status. The Act applies to certain issues,  including discrimination in the sale, rental, or advertising or financing of  housing, the provision of brokerage services; and other activities related to  residential real estate transactions. The Act covers all \u201cdwellings,\u201d which  are defined generally as buildings designed to be used in whole or part for a  residence, as well as vacant land offered for sale and lease for constructing  or locating a building, with some exceptions.", "The enforcement process granted to HUD and others under the Act has  been expanded since the law\u2019s enactment in 1968. The original Act gave no  enforcement powers to HUD\u2014other than the ability to investigate and  conciliate complaints\u2014and gave limited enforcement powers to private  persons and the Attorney General. Under the 1968 Act, private persons who  believed they had been discriminated against in housing could enforce the  Act by filing a complaint with HUD, and HUD could investigate and  conciliate those complaints. The 1968 Act had no mechanism for HUD to  adjudicate complaints, so HUD had no options for further enforcement if  conciliation efforts failed. The 1968 Act also authorized aggrieved persons  to bring a civil action within 180 days of the date of the alleged  discrimination. The relief that courts could provide in such cases included  only injunctive relief, actual damages, punitive damages up to $1,000, and,  where the plaintiff was not able to pay his or her own attorneys\u2019 fees, those  fees. Under the 1968 Act, the Attorney General could initiate a civil suit  under some circumstances\u2014for example, when there was reasonable  cause to believe that a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of resistance had emerged to  the provisions of the Act. The Attorney General could also bring a suit if a  group of persons had been denied a right granted by the Act that raised an  issue considered to be of general public importance. However, damage  awards were not available in actions brought in these types of cases.", "The 1988 amendments to the Act provided HUD, private persons, and the  Attorney General with more tools and remedies for enforcement. Currently,  under the Act as amended, there is an adjudication mechanism, so HUD\u2019s  enforcement efforts need not end if conciliation efforts do not succeed.  Additionally, aggrieved parties can elect not to utilize the administrative  enforcement process and can file civil actions in federal court within 2  years of the alleged discrimination; and the Act provides for actual and  punitive damages without limitation and for injunctive relief and attorneys\u2019  fees. As under the original 1968 Act, presently the Attorney General can  bring a civil action in pattern or practice cases or cases of public  importance. The 1988 amendments allow the Attorney General to  commence civil actions in cases of breached conciliation agreements or  discriminatory housing practices referred by HUD and to enforce  subpoenas. In cases commenced by the Attorney General, courts can  award civil penalties up to $100,000 for the second violation, in addition to  compensatory monetary damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. The 1988 Act also  created a deadline of 100 days for HUD\u2019s investigation and reasonable  cause determination.", "FHEO directs HUD\u2019s enforcement efforts, although some state and local  FHAP agencies handle most enforcement efforts for their states and  localities. FHEO refers complaints alleging violations of state and local fair  housing laws that are administered by a certified FHAP to that agency. A  certified agency that has entered into a memorandum of understanding  with FHEO is eligible to participate in the Fair Housing Assistance  program. Under this program, FHAP agencies receive funding for fair  housing activities and must conform to reporting and record maintenance  requirements, agree to on-site technical assistance, and agree to implement  policies and procedures provided to the agencies by FHEO. FHEO has staff  in each of HUD\u2019s 10 regional offices, called \u201chubs,\u201d through which it  conducts its enforcement efforts. FHEO staff has responsibility for the  intake, investigation, and resolution of some of these complaints.  Aggrieved persons may also go directly to FHAP agencies, which then  perform the intake process. However, FHEO must ultimately approve the  filing of all complaints involving alleged violations of the Act. If an  aggrieved party contacts a FHEO office regarding discrimination that  allegedly occurred in a state or locality that has a FHEO-certified  \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d state or local agency (that is, a FHAP agency),  FHEO will complete the intake process and refer the complaint to that  agency for enforcement.", "Under the Act and HUD\u2019s implementing regulations, FHEO can certify an  agency if (1) the rights and remedies available under the state or local laws  are substantially equivalent to those available under the Act, and (2) the  operation of the agency demonstrates that it meets performance standards  for timely and thorough fair housing complaint investigations, conciliation,  and enforcement. The local law must require the agency to meet the 100- day investigation benchmark contained in the Act. Although the FHAP  agency enforcement process must be substantially similar to the HUD  process, it need not be exactly the same. That is, FHAP agencies review  incoming complaints to determine if they allege a violation of their state or  local fair housing laws, the Act, or both; investigate complaints to  determine if fair housing laws have been violated; and provide for the final  adjudication of complaints, but each of the 100 FHAP agencies can take  different actions to accomplish these tasks. These certified state and local  agencies could be civil rights agencies like the Michigan Department of  Civil Rights.", "FHEO field offices monitor the FHAP agencies, review cases FHAP  agencies investigate to determine if the agencies are eligible for payment  under FHAP, and provide technical assistance. FHEO field offices also have  responsibility for other functions, such as assessing compliance with fair  housing regulations for entities receiving federal funds, providing  community education and outreach efforts for fair housing issues, and  managing grants under the Fair Housing Initiatives Program, which funds  public and private entities combating discriminatory housing practices.", "FHEO tracks fair housing enforcement efforts through its Title Eight  Automated Paperless Office Tracking System (TEAPOTS) database. FHEO  enforcement personnel input information at major stages of the  enforcement process, such as when a complaint is filed at FHEO, when an  investigation of a complaint begins, and when a case is resolved. FHEO  managers use TEAPOTS to track the progress of fair housing cases and  enforcement efforts. All FHAPs have access to TEAPOTS and are required  to report their performance information (such as timeliness milestones for  initiated and completed investigations) into TEAPOTS or other data and  information systems technology agreed to by HUD. TEAPOTS captures  numerous aspects of enforcement efforts both nationally and by hub,  including the numbers and lengths of enforcement actions; characteristics  of complaints, such as basis of discrimination (race, religion, etc.) and  subject matter of discrimination (sale, rental, etc.); and type of resolution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Fair Housing Enforcement Process Provides the Framework for Handling Complaints", "paragraphs": ["The fair housing enforcement process consists of three stages: (1) intake,  during which FHEO or FHAP agencies receive inquiries from individuals  with housing discrimination concerns and determine whether those  concerns involve a potential violation of the Act; (2) investigation, during  which FHEO or FHAP agency investigators collect evidence to determine if  reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice  has occurred or is about to occur; and (3) adjudication, during which an  independent fact finder determines whether the person charged with  discrimination (the respondent) did in fact violate the Act. The  independent fact-finding may occur before an administrative law judge  (ALJ) or, if one of the parties chooses, a federal court or state court for  complaints filed with HUD and FHAP agencies, respectively.

FHAP agencies also receive  inquiries and work with complainants to determine whether a potential  violation of the Act, state or local law, or both has occurred. According to  FHEO headquarters staff, the process usually starts when an individual  contacts a FHEO hub by telephone, fax, or mail; in person; or over the  Internet. Intake analysts refer numerous contacts they receive that are not  related to fair housing to appropriate outside organizations. Intake analysts  record contacts dealing with fair housing as \u201cinquiries\u201d in TEAPOTS. The  analysts interview complainants and may do other research\u2014for example,  property searches and searches of newspaper or corporate records\u2014to see  if enough information exists to support filing a formal complaint. This  initial process is known as \u201cperfecting\u201d a complaint, although it does not  always result in a complaint. In order for a complaint to be perfected, it  must:   contain the required four elements of a Title VIII complaint: the name  and address of the aggrieved party (the person who was allegedly  injured by a discriminatory housing practice), the name and address of  the respondent, a description and address of the dwelling involved, and  a concise statement of the facts leading to the allegation; and   satisfy the Act\u2019s jurisdictional requirements that the complainant has  standing to file the complaint; that the respondent, dwelling, subject  matter of discrimination (e.g., refusal to rent or refusal to sell), and the  basis (e.g., race, color, familial status) for alleging discrimination are  covered by the Act; and that the complaint has been filed within a year  of the last occurrence of the discriminatory practice.", "Hub directors decide whether these conditions are met. If so, the inquiry  becomes a perfected complaint; otherwise, it is dismissed. Intake analysts  record key information about perfected complaints in TEAPOTS, have  complainants sign the official complaints, and send letters of notice about  the complaint and the enforcement process to both complainants and  respondents. The complaint file is then usually delivered to the  investigator.", "According to FHEO headquarters staff, the intake stage for a complaint  that will be investigated by FHEO\u2014rather than a FHAP agency\u2014is usually  considered complete when the complaint file is delivered to a FHEO  investigator. For such complaints, FHEO\u2019s Title VIII Intake, Investigation,  and Conciliation Handbook (Handbook) establishes a timeliness  benchmark of no more than 20 days for the intake stage. However, FHEO  also performs intake for inquiries that, because of their characteristics, are  ultimately referred to a FHAP agency for investigation. For example, if a  person alleges a discriminatory practice that is within the jurisdiction of a  FHAP agency, FHEO intake analysts complete the intake stage, file the  complaint, and refer the case to the FHAP agency. For such complaints,  the Handbook establishes a timeliness benchmark of no more than 5 days  for the intake stage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investigation: FHEO Collects Evidence to Determine If Reasonable Cause Exists to Believe a Discriminatory Housing Practice Has Occurred or Is about to Occur", "paragraphs": ["During the investigation stage, FHEO investigators collect evidence to  determine whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory  housing practice has occurred or is about to occur. Similarly, FHAP  agencies may collect evidence to determine if a local or state fair housing  law has been violated. The Handbook provides guidance for investigators  during this process, although the Handbook notes that investigations will  vary (see table 1).", "According to agency guidance, once an investigator completes an  investigation, the appropriate hub director reviews the results and makes a  determination of whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a  discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur. With the  concurrence of the relevant HUD\u2019s regional counsel, the hub director  issues a determination of reasonable cause and directs the regional counsel  to issue a \u201ccharge\u201d on behalf of the aggrieved person. The charge is a short  written statement of the facts that led FHEO to the reasonable cause  determination. If the hub director decides that no reasonable cause exists  to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred; then, upon  concurrence of the regional counsel, the hub director dismisses the  complaint. In a March 6, 2003, memorandum, HUD\u2019s Office of General  Counsel (OGC) in headquarters requested that regional counsels send  OGC\u2019s Office of Fair Housing the final draft of any charge that they propose  to file and that they not file charges until they have received a response  from OGC\u2019s Office of Fair Housing.", "At any stage before the investigation is complete, the enforcement process  can end by either conciliation or administrative closure. FHEO\u2019s  Handbook states that conciliation is the process by which FHEO \u201cassists  the complainant and respondent in achieving a just and mutually  acceptable resolution of the disputed issues in a Title VIII complaint.\u201d The  Act requires that HUD try to conciliate all complaints to the extent feasible,  starting at the time the complaint is filed and continuing until the final  charge is issued or the case is dismissed. The Handbook and federal  regulations implementing the Act allow an individual to act as investigator  and conciliator on the same case, but the regulations state that generally  investigators will not conciliate their own cases. Instead, other  investigators not investigating a complaint conciliate such complaints.  Conciliation agreements are to seek to protect the public interest in  furthering fair housing through various provisions, such as requiring the  respondent to provide FHEO with periodic reports. FHEO may also close  complaints administratively for several reasons\u2014for example, if the  complainant withdraws the complaint.", "The regulations implementing the Act require FHEO and the FHAP  agencies to complete an investigation, conciliate a case, or otherwise close  a complaint within 100 days of the filing date unless doing so is  \u201cimpracticable.\u201d An investigation is considered complete, and the 100-day  deadline ends, when a hub director makes a cause or no-cause  determination in which the regional counsel concurs.

Several FHAP agencies we visited had no  dedicated intake analysts. At these agencies, current investigators simply  shared the intake of complaints. Some FHEO officials told us that using  investigators for intake improved the thoroughness of intake and  decreased the overall length of the enforcement process. Some officials  said that investigators have a better understanding of the information  needed for jurisdiction and investigations, and they thus focus their intake  efforts on getting that information.", "Second, one FHAP agency we visited had instituted a team approach to  enforcement. The agency had changed its entire enforcement process in  1997 to incorporate this approach, using several teams consisting of \u201ccivil  rights representatives\u201d (as opposed to intake analysts and investigators)  and a \u201ccoach attorney.\u201d Teams handled the enforcement process starting  with the initial contact and finishing up with the reasonable cause  recommendation. Teams rotated through the intake function for 1 week  each month, investigating all cases that originated in intake that week.  Although this FHAP agency made other changes simultaneously with the  change to the team approach, FHAP agency officials said that the team  approach had helped its backlog of cases drop significantly and improved  the quality of its enforcement process. It is not possible to isolate the team  approach\u2019s impact on the FHAP agency\u2019s fair housing effort, and the  complaint numbers provided by the agency included other civil rights  enforcement work, such as enforcement of equal employment opportunity  laws. However, FHAP agency officials told us that, after the team approach  had been fully implemented, the average complaint processing time fell  from 476 days to 335 days.", "In addition to personnel practices, we found that one FHAP agency was  using a software system to improve the intake procedure. In addition to  using TEAPOTS, this particular FHAP agency, in conjunction with a  software company, had developed Contact Management System (CMS)  software that had significant extra capabilities. The CMS generated a series  of initial intake questions for the FHAP agency\u2019s civil rights representative  to ask during intake and then constructed follow-up questions based on the  answers to the previous questions. These follow-up questions reflected the  elements that would be necessary to prove discrimination in a given case.  At the end of its approximately 2-hour intake process, the FHAP agency  tried to have either a perfected complaint or a reason that the contact did  not warrant a perfected complaint. A FHAP agency official told us that the  CMS software had helped decrease the length and improve the  thoroughness of its enforcement process. Again, it is not possible to isolate  the impact of the CMS software, but after the software was installed,  average complaint processing times for the FHAP agency\u2019s fair housing and  other civil rights work decreased from 335 days to 252 days."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Investigations, Including the Degree of Attorney Involvement and Conciliation Methods, May Improve the Enforcement Process", "paragraphs": ["We observed numerous variations in investigative practices among the  FHEO and FHAP agencies we visited.

The most  important of these, the Resource Estimation and Allocation Process  (REAP), a series of department studies conducted from 2000 through 2002,  to assess HUD\u2019s staffing requirements, recommended a total FTE ceiling  for FHEO of 640.

Therefore, HUD was  forced both to reprogram more than $25 million to cover the costs of the  newly hired excess staff and to submit to Congress a corrective action plan  consistent with REAP. HUD\u2019s Strategic Placement Plan, issued in January  2004, would reduce FHEO\u2019s excess staff to the mandated level of 640 FTEs  by the end of fiscal year 2004 through voluntary and, if necessary,  involuntary reassignments. However, as of February 2004, FHEO remained  at 727 FTEs, and FHEO officials told us they did not know how they would  meet the mandated level on schedule. The officials also expressed concern  that they would lose many of their best staff through the voluntary  reassignment plan.", "Officials expressed concern not only with the insufficient number of staff  but also the lack of staff at key positions. Some HUD managers said that  due to unfilled supervisor positions in their regions, existing supervisors  were not able to review materials as carefully as they could have with those  positions filled. For example, one center director told us that investigators  did not get supervisory input on initial investigative plans due to a vacant  supervisory post. This center director said that the gap in supervision  decreased the thoroughness and sometimes increased the length of  investigations, as existing supervisors were unable to complete work in a  timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Skills and Experience", "paragraphs": ["Some hub directors and other officials we spoke with cited concerns about  the noncompetitive reassignment of staff into FHEO. They noted that the  level of staff skills could influence the length and thoroughness of the  enforcement process and that the reassignment process had a generally  negative impact on FHEO\u2019s overall skill levels. According to these officials,  while many of the reassigned staff had worked at HUD for years, their skills  were often not transferable to FHEO activities, which require specific  analytical, investigative, and writing skills. Some directors cited the skills  issue as a greater problem for FHEO than the actual numbers of personnel.  FHEO\u2019s own internal review also cites concerns about reassigned  employees\u2019 qualifications, skills, and work products and about the amount  of time and supervision these employees require. FHEO documentation  shows that 106 staff were reassigned to the program under various HUD  realignments from 1998 to 2002. Figure 14 shows the numbers of staff in  the three hubs we visited by their years of experience with FHEO and  reassignment status. Although FHEO has brought many new staff on board  recently through competitive hiring, many staff in the hubs we reviewed  came to the organization via noncompetitive reassignment.", "Although figure 14 shows that more than half of the FHEO staff currently  located in the three sites we visited had fewer than 10 years of experience  with FHEO, many have a significant number of years of federal service.  Figure 15 shows a snapshot of the same FHEO employees in the three sites  we visited by their years of federal service. The figure demonstrates that  half of the FHEO employees in the three sites we visited have 20 or more  years of federal service, and 14 percent have 30 or more years of federal  service.", "Retirement eligibility was an issue not only for the three sites we visited,  but also for FHEO as a whole. Officials expressed concern about the loss of  skilled and experienced staff to retirement, and personnel data provided by  the HUD human resources staff show that 40 percent of FHEO employees  overall were eligible for either early or immediate retirement in February  2004 (see fig. 16). Moreover, as we have noted previously, officials that we  spoke with also expressed concern that current plans to eliminate a  significant number of FHEO staff by voluntary reassignment could cause  skilled workers to leave FHEO and seek opportunities elsewhere.", "Providing effective training is another human capital challenge that FHEO  faces. Half of the directors told us that the quality and effectiveness of  training helped reduce the length of the fair housing enforcement process,  and six said that it improved thoroughness. For example, some directors  said that training serves to expedite investigations as staff gain more  technical skills. Other directors said that training improves thoroughness  because staff can recognize issues of discrimination and decide what  evidence is needed to support complaints.", "We heard concerns from FHEO staff, an ALJ, and others outside of HUD  about the quality or availability of training for FHEO employees. Most staff  we spoke with reported that they had received initial formal training for  their positions, though not always in a timely fashion. A list of courses  supplied by the HUD Training Academy, which provides the majority of  formal training for FHEO, showed that the basic course in investigation  had been offered annually in all but 1 of the last 5 years. However,  depending on the hiring date, a new staff member might have to wait 1 year  or more to attend the basic course. Potentially compounding this problem,  hub directors told us that although training was available in fiscal year  2003, lack of travel funds sometimes prevented them from sending staff to  training out of the area. Finally, budget data show that although FHEO had  initial approval from the HUD Training Academy to spend $416,000 for  training in fiscal year 2003, the HUD Training Academy reduced FHEO\u2019s  training funds to $200,000 as part of the department\u2019s overall efforts to  reduce expenditures to cover the cost of excess staff hiring.", "FHEO recognized the need for additional training by establishing the HUD  Fair Housing Training Academy, which is slated to open in the summer of  2004. FHEO officials told us that they hope to standardize what the agency  believes are uneven fair housing processes and practices implemented  around the nation by FHEO and its FHAP agency partners, create a more  professional group, and possibly reduce turnover rates at FHAP agencies  by certifying attendees. Initially, however, the academy will serve staff from  only FHAP agencies, not FHEO employees. Officials explained that FHAP  agency funds would cover the costs of this initial training.", "FHEO\u2019s human capital challenges are symptomatic of those facing HUD as  a whole. FHEO, like the department and other federal agencies, is  experiencing significant challenges in deploying the right skills in the right  places at the right time, is facing a growing number of employees who are  eligible for retirement, and is finding it difficult to fill certain mission- critical jobs\u2014a situation that could significantly drain its institutional  knowledge.", "We have observed that federal agencies need effective strategic workforce  planning to identify and focus on the long-term human capital issues that  most affect their ability to attain mission results. We identified five key  principles that strategic workforce planning should address, which include  (1) involving top management, employees, and other stakeholders in  developing, communicating, and implementing the strategic workforce  plan; (2) determining the critical skills and competencies that will be  needed to achieve current and future programmatic results; (3) developing  strategies that are tailored to address gaps in number, deployment, and  alignment of human capital approaches for enabling and sustaining the  contributions of all critical skills and competencies; (4) building the  capability needed to address administrative, educational, and other  requirements important to support workforce strategies; and (5)  monitoring and evaluating the agency\u2019s progress toward its human capital  goals and the contribution that human capital results have made toward  achieving programmatic goals. In developing strategies to address  workforce gaps, we reported that agencies should, among other things,  consider hiring, training, staff development, succession planning,  performance management, use of flexibilities, and other human capital  strategies and tools that can be implemented with resources that can  reasonably be expected to be available.", "We have reported in the past that HUD had not done the strategic  workforce planning necessary to address its human capital challenges.  Like HUD, FHEO does not have a comprehensive strategic workforce plan  to help it meet key human capital challenges. REAP, which estimates the  staff needed to handle HUD\u2019s workload in each of its offices, does not  include the extensive analysis involved in a comprehensive assessment.  However, since we last reported, HUD contracted a technical adviser to  conduct a comprehensive workforce analysis. Such an assessment would  cover current workforce skills, anticipated skill needs, current and future  skill gaps, and needed training and development that will be used to  develop a comprehensive 5-year departmental workforce plan.  Additionally, HUD plans to rollout over the next 3 years a customized  human resources and training information system known as the HUD  Integrated Human Resources and Training System (HIHRTS). HUD  documentation says that the system will replace several legacy systems;  will integrate all human resource information into one platform, making  information available to managers for strategic planning and employee  development; and helping ensure that HUD employees are used effectively."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Travel Funds Can Affect How Thoroughly Cases Are Investigated", "paragraphs": ["Officials from headquarters and the sites we visited also told us that  inconsistencies in the amount and availability of travel funds impaired the  length and thoroughness of the fair housing enforcement process. As  mentioned previously, in May 2003, Congress approved the reprogramming  of funds within HUD to cover the cost of excess staff hiring, including a  $7.7 million reduction in travel funds. FHEO officials told us that following  this reprogramming, they had no travel funds for up to 6 months,  preventing investigators from making timely visits to the sites of  complaints. Budget data show that FHEO has experienced larger decreases  in travel funds than HUD as a whole. From fiscal year 2002 to 2003, HUD\u2019s  allotment for travel decreased by 12 percent. FHEO\u2019s travel allotment,  however, decreased by 17 percent over the same period. Directors reported  that interruptions in travel funds in fiscal year 2003 had impeded efforts to  plan and manage investigations. Directors also told us that uncertainties  regarding the department\u2019s ultimate annual appropriations amount had  forced headquarters to limit travel funds at the beginning of fiscal years and  prevented them from establishing a firm annual travel budget. Without this  budget, directors said, they could not plan for the travel that would have  helped reduce the length of investigations.", "Directors reported using several methods to stretch their travel funds,  including curtailing and delaying travel, limiting the time investigators  could spend in the field, catching up on needed travel when funds became  available at the end of the fiscal year, reducing travel for FHEO\u2019s other  responsibilities outside of fair housing enforcement, and asking  investigators from offices closer to the site of the complaint to assist with  the investigation. Some investigators told us that they had used their own  vehicles or funds for site visits and conducted desk investigations. At the  same time, budget data show that hub directors\u2019 routine meetings  consumed an increasing share of FHEO\u2019s travel budget from fiscal year  2001 to 2003. Director\u2019s meetings utilized 13 percent of FHEO\u2019s travel  expenditures of approximately $900,000 in fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Goals May Affect the Length of Investigations", "paragraphs": ["Hub directors we visited told us that while FHEO\u2019s national performance  goals have helped reduce the number of aged cases, these goals have had a  negligible impact on the thoroughness of the fair housing enforcement  process and could create competing demands for staff time. Performance  reports show that the percentage of aged fair housing complaints for HUD  nationwide has declined steadily since fiscal year 2000, exceeding the  national goals in fiscal year 2001 through 2003. For example, in fiscal year  2003, the national goal was a 25 percent maximum for aged cases and  FHEO achieved 23 percent. However, there are no national goals that  directly relate to the thoroughness of investigations or the fair housing  enforcement process. Regardless, some directors told us that although they  strive to meet performance goals, they are more motivated by the statute\u2019s  100-day benchmark and the need to provide good customer service.", "Directors also cited a tension between the need to meet the 100-day  benchmark and the simultaneous need to conduct a thorough investigation  and said that at times one goal cannot be achieved without some cost to the  other. One director stated that while mindful of the 100-day benchmark, she  would not close a case to meet the time limit unless she felt that the  investigation had been thorough. Directors told us that the existence of  overall performance goals for FHEO could exacerbate the problem of  competing demands. For example, annual goals routinely set achievement  targets in FHEO\u2019s area of responsibility outside of Title VIII enforcement,  including program compliance review, monitoring FHIP and FHAP  agencies grantees, increasing the number of substantially equivalent  agencies, and providing training on accessibility and handicap rights. The  time and resources needed to meet these targets could increase the  challenges involved in meeting Title VIII commitments in a timely and  thorough manner."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The fair housing enforcement process provides a framework for  considering complaints of housing discrimination. However, persons who  have experienced alleged discrimination in housing can sometimes face a  lengthy wait before their complaint is resolved. Because flexibility is built  into the process, enforcement practitioners have devised a variety of  practices for processing inquiries and complaints, some of which could  improve the timeliness and thoroughness of investigations. Our limited  look at enforcement operations at FHAP agencies and FHEO centers  within 3 of FHEO\u2019s 10 regions revealed practices that could potentially  expedite cases if they were adopted elsewhere. Further, many FHEO hub  directors told us they believed that every stage of the fair housing  enforcement process could be improved. However, practitioners may be  unaware of such practices because FHEO has not taken steps to identify  those practices that hold the promise of improving the fair housing  enforcement process.", "Because of data limitations\u2014specifically, data that are of questionable  reliability, missing, or not currently collected\u2014FHEO does not know how  much time individuals face from the day they make an inquiry to the day  they learn the outcome of their cases, particularly when FHAP agencies  handle the investigation. Without comprehensive, reliable data on the dates  when individuals make inquiries, FHEO cannot judge how long  complainants must wait before a FHAP agency undertakes an  investigation. Similarly, without comprehensive, consistent, and reliable  data concerning the dates that complaints are finally decided, HUD cannot  determine how long the intended beneficiaries of the Act typically wait for  a decision. Data that provide a comprehensive view of the enforcement  process from start to finish for both FHEO and FHAP agencies could help  HUD target problem areas and improve management of the enforcement  process. TEAPOTS provides a platform that FHEO and FHAP agencies may  use for recording these key enforcement data.", "FHEO\u2019s human capital challenges serve to exacerbate the challenge of  improving enforcement practices. Human capital management issues at  both HUD and FHEO are an immediate concern. FHEO\u2019s planned reduction  in staff and other human capital factors may affect its ability to enforce fair  housing laws. To meet such challenges, HUD managers will need to  continue their efforts to analyze workforce needs and to develop a  workforce planning process that makes the best use of the department\u2019s  most important resource\u2014the people that it employs now and in the  future. A comprehensive strategic workforce planning process that builds  on the five principles that we have observed at other federal agencies will  help FHEO and other departmental programs identify and focus their  investments on the long-term human capital issues that most affect the  agency\u2019s ability to achieve its mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve the management and oversight of the fair housing enforcement  process, we recommend that the HUD Secretary direct the Assistant  Secretary of FHEO to take the following 4 actions:  establish a way to identify and share information on effective practices  among its regional fair housing offices and FHAP agencies;  ensure that the automated case-tracking system includes complete,  reliable data on key dates in the intake stage of the fair housing  enforcement process for FHAP agencies;   ensure that the automated case-tracking system includes complete,  reliable data on key dates in the adjudication stage of the fair housing  enforcement process for both FHEO and FHAP agencies;  ensure that the automated case-tracking system includes complete,  reliable data on the outcomes of the adjudication stage of the fair  housing enforcement process for FHEO and FHAP agencies; and  ensure that hubs enter cause dates into the automated case-tracking  system in a consistent manner.", "Further, we recommend that the Secretary take the following action:  In developing HUD\u2019s 5-year Departmental Workforce Plan, follow the  five key principles discussed in this report.
