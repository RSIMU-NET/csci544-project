This program provides lower-income pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children up to age 5 with supplemental foods, nutrition counseling, and access to health care services. The food benefits are typically provided in the form of a voucher that can be used to obtain approved foods at authorized retail outlets (food stores and pharmacies), commonly referred to as vendors. Food costs accounted for about $2.7 billion, or about 74 percent, of the WIC program\u2019s total costs in fiscal year 1996. In administering WIC, the states are allowed some flexibility in the policies and procedures they use. Since WIC is a discretionary program that serves as many individuals as the available funding permits, any actions the states can take to reduce the program\u2019s costs will allow them to serve more eligible people.", "This report is the second in a series of reports responding to your December 20, 1996, request for information on certain aspects of WIC. In this report, we (1) describe and assess the practices that the states use to contain costs by controlling the foods approved for use in the WIC program and by more closely selecting and regulating participating vendors and (2) examine practices that the states use to ensure that WIC applicants\u2019 incomes meet the program\u2019s eligibility requirements. As a part of our review, we surveyed the WIC directors in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and analyzed the information provided by the 48 who responded."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Established in 1972, WIC is designed to improve the health and nutritional well-being of participants by providing nutritious supplemental foods, nutrition education, and referrals to health care services. The program is available in each state, the District of Columbia, 33 Indian tribal organizations, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam. FCS administers the program in cooperation with state and local health departments and related agencies.", "The supplemental foods that WIC provides include milk, cheese, fruit and vegetable juices, iron-fortified adult and infant cereals, dried beans or peas, peanut butter, eggs, and infant formula. Special infant formulas are also available to meet unusual dietary or health-related conditions. Each state designates the types and amounts of foods that local WIC agencies can prescribe to meet each participant\u2019s nutritional needs. The WIC food benefit (referred to as a food package) can be provided through local WIC health clinics or home delivery. More commonly, participants receive their food benefits in the form of a check or a voucher that is used to purchase the specific foods at authorized retail vendors. These vendors have been selected by the state to participate in the program for a period of time.", "FCS requires the states to operate a rebate program for infant formula. By negotiating rebates with infant formula manufacturers for each can of formula purchased through WIC, the states greatly reduce their average per person food costs so that more people can be served. In fiscal year 1996, infant formula rebates to all states totaled about $1.2 billion.", "Federal WIC appropriations totaled $3.47 billion in fiscal year 1995 and $3.73 billion annually in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. The program is primarily funded by federal appropriations; some states supplement the federal grant with their own funds. In fiscal years 1995 and 1996, the average monthly WIC participation nationwide was about 6.9 million and 7.2 million, respectively, and in fiscal year 1997, the average monthly participation was about 7.4 million through February 1997.", "Grants to the states are divided into food grants and nutrition services and administration grants. Food grants cover the costs of supplemental foods and are allocated to the states through a formula that is based on the number of individuals in each state who are eligible for WIC benefits because of their income. The nutrition services and administration grants are allocated to the states through a formula that is based on factors such as the state\u2019s number of projected program participants and WIC salary costs. Nutrition services and administration grants cover costs for program administration, start-up, monitoring, auditing, the development of and accountability for food delivery systems, nutrition education, breast-feeding promotion and support, outreach, certification, and developing and printing food vouchers.", "State WIC agencies establish program eligibility criteria that are based on federal guidelines. To qualify for the program, WIC applicants must show evidence of nutritional risk that is medically verified by a health professional. In addition, participants may not have incomes that exceed 185 percent of the poverty guidelines that are established annually by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In 1997, for example, the annual WIC income limit for a family of four is $29,693 in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Federal regulations allow the states to individually determine their income documentation requirements for applicants seeking to participate in WIC. The states are also required by federal regulations to automatically certify as income eligible those individuals who document their participation in the Food Stamp Program, Medicaid, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. Approximately two-thirds of all WIC participants were enrolled in one or more of these programs in fiscal year 1994, the last year for which complete data were available at the time of our review. In addition, WIC participants are required by federal regulations to reside in the jurisdiction of the state where they receive benefits, and the states are required to check the identification of all participants when they seek certification for program participation and when they receive their vouchers. Although the applicants who meet the program\u2019s health and nutrition, income, and residency requirements may be certified as eligible to participate in WIC, the number of participants that are actually served each year primarily depends on the total amount of funds available to the states. According to FCS\u2019 estimates, about 75 percent of the eligible women, infants, and children actually participated in WIC during fiscal year 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Control Food Costs and Manage Vendors Have Reduced Costs, but the Program\u2019s Structure May Discourage Wider Use", "paragraphs": ["States\u2019 initiatives to control food costs by limiting the types and package sizes of WIC foods and by more carefully selecting and regulating vendors have reduced the program\u2019s costs by millions of dollars.

However, the National Association of WIC Directors and some WIC directors we spoke with are concerned that, among other things, the program\u2019s regulations can constrain a state\u2019s ability to effectively use the additional funds that become available as a result of cost containment initiatives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States\u2019 Efforts to Hold Down Food Costs Have Been Successful", "paragraphs": ["Two practices that some states are using to contain food costs are reported by state WIC directors to be saving millions of dollars.

Table 1 shows the states that were receiving rebates during fiscal year 1996 from the expanded use of rebates through individual or multistate contracts.", "The cost savings resulting from these infant cereal and juice rebates are relatively small in comparison with the savings resulting from infant formula rebates. As shown by the figures in table 1, the rebates for infant cereal and juices represented about 1 percent of the total rebates received in these nine states in fiscal year 1996. The $6.2 million in infant cereal and juice rebates reduced total food costs in these states by about six-tenths of a percent in fiscal year 1996.", "Eleven states\u2014Alaska, California, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and West Virginia\u2014reported that their agencies were considering, or were in the process of, expanding their use of rebates to foods other than infant formula. In May 1997, Delaware joined the District of Columbia, Maryland, and West Virginia in a multistate rebate contract for infant cereal and juices. California was the first state to expand its rebate program to include adult juices, adding this option in March 1997. California currently spends about $65 million annually on adult juice purchases. California\u2019s WIC director told us that the state expects to collect about $12 million in annual rebates on the adult juices, thereby allowing approximately 30,000 additional persons to participate in the program each month.", "According to FCS officials, there is the potential to reduce WIC costs further through the expanded use of rebates. They said that FCS has encouraged the states to examine and aggressively pursue rebates to stretch food dollars to serve a maximum number of eligible participants. In May 1997, FCS sent its regional directors a memorandum outlining a strategy to \u201cmanage, contain, and control\u201d food costs using rebates on products such as special infant formula and other WIC foods in addition to infant formula. The officials told us that if federal funding for WIC remains constant or declines, more states may consider expanding the use of rebate contracts to provide funds for their WIC programs. FCS officials also told us that some states\u2019 WIC agencies may not be expanding the use of rebates because other cost containment practices have proven effective in reducing food costs. For example, the states that have elected to use only store brand foods may be incurring lower costs than the states that receive rebates on national brand products.", "While these rebates reduce costs, the procurement process requires additional administrative effort by the states. The California WIC director and FCS officials told us that the process of entering into and monitoring rebate contracts can be complicated and time-consuming. In addition, FCS officials told us that bid protests filed by the manufacturers that are not awarded contracts impose additional administrative burdens on the states. The administrative burden associated with procuring and monitoring rebate contracts can be exacerbated if a state contracts with more than one manufacturer for rebates. For example, when California expanded its rebate program to include adult juices, the state requested bids on rebate contracts from juice companies for frozen and ready-to-drink apple, grape, orange, and pineapple juices that were available in all parts of the state and had to negotiate five separate contracts.", "The states also need to use additional resources to manage the rebate contracts. FCS officials told us that disagreements between the states and manufacturers occur over the rebate billings that the manufacturers are obligated to pay the states. They said that the states must therefore develop billing systems that track the amount of the manufacturers\u2019 products selected by WIC clients using their vouchers. For example, the California WIC director told us that before the state implemented its adult juice rebate contracts, the state agency had to develop a system for determining the amount and quantity of each type of juice selected by WIC participants and a system for rebate billing that was acceptable to the juice manufacturers.", "FCS officials told us that the states could become increasingly dependent on the funds provided by their rebate contracts. Historically, the annual funds received by the states from their infant formula rebate contracts have continued to increase, but this source of funding may not always be reliable. If manufacturers begin offering lower rebates, the states could have insufficient funds to provide program benefits to their current level of WIC participants. According to FCS officials, such a decrease in rebate funds would be similar to an increase in food prices because of inflation, something which the program has experienced before. In such instances, the states would need to make adjustments to the foods they offer to contain the escalating costs and/or remove people from the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limits on Food Selection", "paragraphs": ["According to FCS officials, the prices of the food items provided by WIC can vary dramatically, depending, for example, on the brand of the item or how it is packaged. Individually wrapped sliced cheese can cost substantially more than the same cheese in block form, and a national brand of juice could cost substantially more than a vendor\u2019s own brand. All state WIC directors responding to our survey reported that their agencies imposed limits on one or more of the WIC food items. The states may specify certain brands; limit certain types of foods, such as sliced cheese; restrict container sizes; and require the selection of only the lowest-cost brands. Figure 1 shows the number of WIC directors who reported that their states use various types of limits for one or more food items.", "As the figure indicates, some types of restrictions are more widely used than others. Forty-seven of the 48 WIC directors reported that their states\u2019 participants are allowed to choose only certain container or package sizes of one or more food items. For example, 27 of the 48 directors who responded to our questionnaire reported that their states limit the container or package size of infant juice. In addition, 8 states limit allowable types of infant juice, and 18 do not offer infant juice. Some states have also extended limits to non-infant foods.", "For example, Texas participants can select only cheese that is not packaged as individually wrapped slices or shredded, and milk must be in 1-gallon or half-gallon sizes and must be the least expensive brand. In Pennsylvania, dry beans or peas must be in 1-pound packages, ready-to-drink juices must be in 46-ounce cans, and the price of a dozen eggs must not exceed $1.75.", "While all states have one or more food selection restrictions, 17 of the 48 WIC directors responding to our questionnaire reported that their states are considering the use of additional food selection limits to contain or reduce costs in the WIC program.", "Most of the 48 WIC directors reported that placing selection limits on WIC foods has at least moderately decreased their food costs. Twelve of these directors reported that selection limits have greatly or very greatly reduced their WIC food costs. Figure 2 shows the range of food cost reductions that the directors reported from implementing these restrictions.", "Texas, for example, which reported that the restrictions had a very great impact, uses a combination of food selection limits, including a least-cost brand policy. The policy requires participants to buy the cheapest brand of milk, evaporated milk, and cheese available in the store\u2014usually the store\u2019s own brand. Texas also requires participants to buy the lowest-cost 46-ounce fluid or 12-ounce frozen fruit juices from an approved list of types (orange, grapefruit, orange/grapefruit, purple grape, pineapple, orange/pineapple, and apple) and/or specific brands. According to Texas WIC officials, the least-cost brand policy has had a \u201ctremendous\u201d impact on lowering the dollar amount that the state pays for WIC food products. For example, in fiscal year 1989 (the first full fiscal year that the policy was in effect), the cost of milk was reduced by about $3 million. In fiscal year 1996, Texas had a lower than average food cost per person among the 50 states and the District of Columbia even before rebates were factored in. (See app. I.)", "FCS headquarters officials told us that the selection by state agencies of the foods available to participants is one of the states\u2019 most powerful cost containment tools. FCS encourages the states to approve WIC foods that are low in price. However, the officials said that while cost efficiencies are important, the states must maintain the nutritional integrity of the program\u2019s food package. The practice of limiting food items can have a negative impact if participants do not select the food products or do not eat them. For example, Texas WIC officials told us that they discontinued the least-cost brand requirement for peanut butter when they discovered that participants were not selecting the product.", "In addition, FCS officials said that the restrictions may make food selections more confusing for participants and burdensome for vendors. For example, Texas WIC officials told us that participants and cashiers often have difficulty determining which products have the lowest price. A 1995 study of participants\u2019 selections of lowest-cost WIC foods performed by a Texas WIC food chain found that 95 percent of the participants were selecting one or more nonapproved food items that had to be exchanged for the correct item. In response, the food chain, among other things, upgraded the quality, location, and clarity of WIC labels and signs in all of its stores, adding color displays and descriptions of approved WIC items. The Texas WIC agency has also published and displayed a color brochure of approved items that has helped participants to select the approved foods. According to an official of the supermarket chain, these actions have reduced exchanges of food items between 19 and 50 percent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States\u2019 Control Food Costs by Managing Vendors", "paragraphs": ["Separately or in conjunction with measures to contain food costs, some state agencies have placed restrictions on vendors to hold down costs.", "Some states are also selecting alternatives to vendor distribution for certain food products."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Restrictions on Vendors", "paragraphs": ["Thirty-nine of the 48 states responding to our questionnaire reported that they use special selection requirements or limits to contain the number of authorized vendors. Twenty-nine WIC directors reported that they considered it extremely or very important to contain the number of vendors in order to control the program\u2019s costs, and 9 reported that it is moderately important. Of the 39 states, 34 reported using competitive food costs as one of their criteria for selecting vendors. In addition, 27 states have established price limits that vendors cannot exceed for allowable foods, and 5 states require vendors to bid competitively for vendor slots.", "The food prices of WIC vendors in Texas must not exceed by more than 8 percent the average prices charged by vendors doing a comparable dollar volume in the same area. Once selected, vendors must maintain competitive prices. According to Texas WIC officials, the state does not limit the number of vendors that can participate in the WIC program. However, Texas\u2019 selection criteria for approving vendors exclude many stores from the program. By approving only stores with competitive prices, Texas officials said that they save WIC food dollars by paying competitive prices for WIC products.", "Similarly, Delaware\u2019s Project SAVE (Selecting Authorized Vendors Efficiently) requires vendors to bid competitively for all authorized WIC food items. Vendors that meet the minimum qualification requirements and bid the lowest prices are selected to fill the available retail outlet slots. Delaware selects vendors every 2 years.", "Delaware\u2019s WIC director said that while SAVE maintains the clients\u2019 access to vendors, administrative savings have been achieved by training and monitoring vendors, and the number of potentially high-risk vendors has declined. The director noted that SAVE enables the state to control unexpected price increases because the prices are locked in for 2 years through agreements with vendors, thereby allowing grant funds to be more effectively and efficiently managed. Between fiscal years 1991 and 1996, the director estimated, the agreements saved the program about $1.8 million in food costs.", "Eighteen WIC directors reported that their states use ratios of participants to vendors to restrict the number of vendors allowed to participate in the program. By limiting the number of vendors, the states can more frequently monitor stores and conduct compliance investigations, according to FCS and state WIC officials. For example, Delaware uses a ratio of 200 participants per store to determine the total number of vendors that can participate in the program in each WIC service area.", "Of the 39 states reporting that they contain the number of vendors, 31 states reported that as a result, their programs\u2019 costs have decreased somewhat or greatly. Figure 3 presents the WIC directors\u2019 estimates of the cost reductions resulting from limits on vendors and selection policies.", "The WIC directors in 7 of the 39 states (Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Wisconsin) that currently contain the number of vendors allowed to participate in the program reported that they are planning to introduce additional initiatives, such as requiring competitive food pricing by currently authorized vendors, to contain the program\u2019s costs. In addition, the directors in two other states (Connecticut and North Carolina) also reported that they plan to select vendors on the basis of competitive pricing.", "FCS headquarters officials told us that limiting the number of vendors and selecting vendors with competitive prices are important aspects of containing WIC costs. However, they told us that the retail community does not favor limits on the number of approved vendors. Instead, vendors have pressured state WIC agencies and FCS officials to allow all vendors that qualify to participate. According to the FCS officials, the amount that the WIC program spends for food would be substantially higher if stores with higher prices were authorized for the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Direct Distribution of Special Infant Formula", "paragraphs": ["Upon a physician\u2019s instructions, WIC infants with special dietary needs or medical conditions may receive special infant formula. While only a small percentage of the WIC infants nationwide require these formulas, the monthly retail costs for them can be high\u2014ranging in one state we surveyed from $540 to $900 for each infant. Twenty-one states avoid paying retail prices by purchasing the special formula at much lower wholesale prices and distributing it to participants.", "Opportunities exist to substantially lower the cost of special infant formula. Cost savings may be achieved if the states purchase special infant formula at wholesale instead of retail prices. Additional savings may also be possible if these states are able to reduce or eliminate the cost of authorizing and monitoring the retail vendors and pharmacies that distribute only special infant formula to WIC participants.", "Pennsylvania, for example, turned to direct purchasing to make special infant formula more available and to avoid the high cost of vendor-provided formulas. It established a central distribution warehouse for special formulas in August 1996 to serve the less than 1 percent of WIC infants in the state\u2014about 400\u2014who needed special formulas in fiscal year 1996. Pennsylvania purchases the special formulas directly from the manufacturers at wholesale prices, usually for between $300 to $500 for a 1-month supply. The warehouse ships the special formulas, at the participant\u2019s option, either directly to the participant or to the WIC clinic. According to the state WIC director, in many instances, the WIC warehouse delivers the formula faster than pharmacies do. The program is expected to save about $100,000 annually. In addition, by relying on its warehouse, the state can remove over 200 pharmacies from the program, resulting in significant and measurable administrative cost savings, according to the WIC director.", "Appendix II provides information on the states\u2019 use of cost containment practices that affect the program\u2019s costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "WIC Funding Structure May Discourage the Adoption of Cost Containment Practices", "paragraphs": ["According to the National Association of WIC Directors and some WIC directors we spoke with, the program\u2019s funding structure can constrain a state\u2019s ability to make effective use of the additional funds that become available as a result of cost containment initiatives. FCS policy requires that during the grant year, any savings from cost containment accrue to the food portion of the WIC grant, thereby allowing the states to provide food benefits to additional WIC applicants. None of the cost containment savings are automatically available to the states for support services, such as staffing, clinic facilities, voucher issuance sites, outreach, and other activities that are needed to increase participation in the program. As a result, the states may not be able to serve more eligible persons or they may have to carry a substantial portion of the program\u2019s support costs until the federal nutrition services and administration grant is adjusted for the increased participation level\u2014a process that can take up to 2 years\u2014according to the National Association of WIC Directors.", "FCS officials pointed out that provisions in the federal regulations allow the states where participation increases to use a limited amount of their food grant funds for program support activities. However, some states may be reluctant to use the option. For example, according to a Texas WIC official, states may not want to redirect food funds to support services because doing so may be perceived as taking food away from babies.", "Although California implemented cost containment initiatives during the current and past year, the WIC director told us that the state received less funding for support services this year compared with last year. As a result, she said California has a large, multimillion-dollar imbalance between food money and program support funds that is likely to get worse. She told us that the California program has been hampered by the lack of adequate support funds to sustain its caseload. Some WIC directors told us that such shortfalls in funding for support services may discourage state agencies from expanding the use of cost containment initiatives.", "FCS officials stated that while the WIC funding process does not immediately adjust the amount of funds for support services to reflect cost containment savings, such adjustments are generally made in the following year\u2019s funding allocation.

Given such obstacles, and the states\u2019 concern with how the program allocates the additional funds made available through cost containment initiatives, some states may be discouraged from adopting or expanding the use of cost containment practices.", "As they seek to expand cost containment practices, FCS and the states can benefit from the experiences of those states that have implemented such practices effectively. Expanding cost containment depends, in part, on reducing or eliminating the obstacles that can discourage the states from initiating such practices. The expansion of these practices can have a substantial impact on the WIC program because for every 1-percent reduction in food costs that may result from these initiatives, the federal food expenditure of about $2.7 billion could be reduced by about $27 million annually. Cost savings could be used to provide benefits to additional participants, improve the quality of WIC services, and/or reduce the cost of the program to the federal government.", "The states that base income-eligibility decisions on WIC applicants\u2019 declarations of income without documentation may be allowing applicants who are not eligible to participate in the WIC program.
