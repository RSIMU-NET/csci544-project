At the same time, WMATA\u2019s ridership is at an all-time high and WMATA managers expect the number of passengers to double over the next 25 years. As agreed with your offices, this report addresses the following questions: (1) What challenges does WMATA face in operating and maintaining its Metrorail system? (2) What efforts has WMATA made to establish and monitor safety and security within its transit system? (3) To what extent does WMATA follow established best practices in planning, selecting, and budgeting for its capital investments?", "In addressing the first two questions on operations and maintenance and safety and security, we performed a broad review of a myriad of issues facing WMATA by interviewing knowledgeable officials throughout WMATA and other organizations that affect the agency and by reviewing pertinent documentation. In addressing the third question on capital investment, we compared WMATA\u2019s practices with those of leading public and private organizations that GAO studied in 1998, assessing the extent to which WMATA (1) integrates its organizational goals into the capital decision-making process through structured strategic planning and needs determination processes, (2) uses an investment approach to evaluate and select capital assets, and (3) maintains budgetary control over its capital investments. (See app. IV for more detailed information about our scope and methodology). This letter summarizes our findings; more detailed responses to each of these questions are presented in appendixes I through III."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["WMATA was created in 1967 by an interstate compact that resulted from the enactment of identical legislation by Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, with the concurrence of the U.S. Congress. Since then, WMATA has been responsible for planning, financing, constructing, and operating a comprehensive mass transit system for the Washington metropolitan area. WMATA began building its Metrorail system in 1969, acquired four regional bus systems in 1973, and began operating the first phase of Metrorail operations in 1976. In January 2001, WMATA completed the originally planned 103-mile Metrorail system that now includes 83 rail stations on 5 rail lines.", "WMATA operates in a complex environment, with many organizations influencing its decision-making and funding and providing oversight. WMATA is governed by a Board of Directors, which sets policies and oversees all of WMATA\u2019s activities, including budgeting, operations, development and expansion, safety, procurement, and other activities. In addition, a number of local, regional, and federal external organizations affect WMATA\u2019s decision-making, including: (1) state and local governments, which subject WMATA to a range of laws and requirements; (2) the Tri-State Oversight Committee, which oversees WMATA\u2019s safety activities and conducts safety reviews; (3) the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB) of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, which develops the short- and long-range plans that guide WMATA\u2019s capital investments; (4) the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), which provides oversight of WMATA in many areas; and (5) the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates accidents on transit systems as well as other transportation modes.", "WMATA estimates that its combined rail and bus ridership will total 324.8 million passenger trips in fiscal year 2001, making it the second largest heavy rail rapid transit system and the sixth largest bus system in the United States, according to WMATA officials. WMATA\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2002 budget totals nearly $1.9 billion. Of the total amount, about 56 percent, or $1.06 billion, is for capital improvements; 42 percent, or $796.6 million, is for operations and maintenance activities; and the remaining 2 percent, or $37 million, is for debt service and other projects.", "WMATA\u2019s funding comes from a variety of federal, state, and local sources. Unlike most other major urban transit systems, WMATA does not have dedicated sources of revenues, such as local sales tax revenues, that are automatically directed to the transit authority. WMATA receives grants from the federal government and annual contributions by each of the local jurisdictions that WMATA serves, including the District of Columbia and the respective local jurisdictions in Maryland and Virginia. For example, in its fiscal year 2002 proposed operating budget totaling $796.6 million (for rail, bus, and paratransit services), WMATA projects that approximately 55 percent of its revenues will come from passenger fares and other internally generated revenues, and 45 percent will come from the local jurisdictions served by WMATA. With regard to its capital program for infrastructure renewal, WMATA projects that about 47 percent of its proposed 2002 budget will come from federal government grants, 38 percent from federally guaranteed financing, and 15 percent from the local jurisdictions and other sources. WMATA has also received funding directly through the congressional appropriations process over the past 30 years\u2014 totaling about $6.9 billion\u2014for construction of the originally planned subway system. WMATA did not have to compete against other transit agencies for this funding, which ended in fiscal year 1999.", "Metrorail\u2019s expenses and revenues represent the largest portion of WMATA\u2019s operating budget. For example, in fiscal year 2000\u2014the latest year for which final actual figures are available\u2014Metrorail\u2019s operating expenses accounted for 56 percent, or $392.1 million, of WMATA\u2019s overall operating costs of $704.8 million. At the same time, Metrorail\u2019s passenger fares and other revenues accounted for about 76 percent, or $292.5 million, of WMATA\u2019s overall internally generated revenues of $384.9 million. As a measure of financial performance, Metrorail\u2019s cost recovery ratio (revenues divided by expenses) represents one of the highest of any rail transit system in the nation, according to FTA. For example, during fiscal years 1996 through 2000, Metrorail recovered, on average, 73 cents for every dollar that WMATA spent to operate and maintain the rail system.", "With regard to capital investment issues, GAO issued a report in December 1998 that identified capital decision-making principles and practices used by outstanding state and local governments and private sector organizations. In order to evaluate the extent to which WMATA followed best practices in planning, selecting, and budgeting for its capital investments, we compared WMATA\u2019s practices with those of leading public and private organizations that we studied in 1998. Accordingly, in this report, we assess the extent to which WMATA (1) integrates its organizational goals into the capital decision-making process through structured strategic planning and needs determination processes, (2) uses an investment approach to evaluate and select capital assets, and (3) maintains budgetary control over its capital investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WMATA Is Addressing Significant Metrorail Operations and Maintenance Challenges", "paragraphs": ["One of the key operating challenges facing Metrorail has been the increasing problems caused by the advancing age of its existing infrastructure. Metrorail has experienced vehicle, escalator, elevator, and other system equipment and infrastructure problems over the past several years. These problems have resulted in, among other things, an increasing number of train delays. For example, the number of train delays due to system problems increased from 865 in fiscal year 1996 to 1,417 in fiscal year 2000, or by about 64 percent. WMATA attributes these problems primarily to its aging rail equipment and infrastructure. Forty-five percent of Metrorail\u2019s 103-mile system is from 17 to 25 years old, and another 33 percent is from 9 to 16 years old. Similarly, 39 percent of Metrorail\u2019s 762- car fleet has been operating since 1976; another 48 percent went into service during the 1980s. WMATA has estimated that the expected useful life of a rail car is 40 years if a major renovation is performed at the mid- point of the car\u2019s life cycle.", "WMATA is addressing Metrorail\u2019s equipment and infrastructure problems through a number of projects in its capital-funded Infrastructure Renewal Program (IRP), described in detail later in this letter. One key IRP project\u2014the Emergency Rail Rehabilitation Program\u2014is focused on improving Metrorail\u2019s service reliability problems. Through this program, now in its second year, WMATA has made significant progress in implementing many rail system improvement projects. For example, by August 2000, WMATA had completed almost all of the program\u2019s accelerated car maintenance projects on such critical components as brakes and doors on over 600 rail cars. In addition, WMATA\u2019s statistics show that for the period covering July 2000 through January 2001, the number of passenger offloads had decreased by 15 percent, compared with the same period in the previous year. In particular, WMATA officials noted that offloads during the spring \u201cCherry Blossom Season\u201d in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area, decreased, on average, from 9 per weekday in 1999 to 4.8 per weekday in 2001. Furthermore, by June 2000, work was under way to maintain and rehabilitate 170 station escalators. IRP includes other key projects, such as the rail car rehabilitation project, which will enhance the reliability of 364 cars that were built in the 1980s. These cars will be overhauled and rehabilitated under a 5-year contract awarded in December 2000. WMATA expects to take delivery of the first rehabilitated cars in August 2002.", "Metrorail also faces another significant operating challenge brought about by ever-increasing ridership. Metrorail is now operating at near capacity during peak demand periods, causing some uncomfortably crowded trains. WMATA\u2019s recent studies on crowding found that demand has reached and, in some cases, exceeded scheduled capacity\u2014an average of 140 passengers per car\u2014during the peak morning and afternoon hours. For example, of the more than 200 peak morning trips that WMATA observed over a recent 6-month period, on average, 15 percent were considered \u201cuncomfortably crowded\u201d (125 to 149 passengers per car), and 8 percent had \u201ccrush loads\u201d (150 or more passengers per car). Metrorail\u2019s overcrowded conditions are primarily the result of the substantial growth in ridership it has experienced over the last several years, an insufficient number of rail cars to operate more and longer trains on a regular basis, and system and other constraints on expanding rush-hour trains from six cars to eight cars\u2014the maximum size that station platforms can accommodate.", "WMATA has several actions under way to ease Metrorail\u2019s overcrowded conditions. Most notably, the agency ordered 192 new rail cars that it had expected to begin deploying in the summer of 2001. We note, however, that WMATA suffered a setback in June 2001 when it took action to delay delivery of these cars until the rail car contractor corrects technical problems. As of late June 2001, WMATA officials told us that they expect to begin phasing the first new cars into service by the fall of 2001. Over the next year or so, WMATA plans to deploy the majority of these cars where and when the heaviest ridership is occurring, allowing for adjustments to train sizes. For example, on some lines, the train size will change from four cars to six cars. WMATA is also examining Metrorail\u2019s core capacity needs to determine, among other things, what improvements in capacity\u2014cars and power, for example\u2014will be required to operate eight-car trains on a regular basis during peak demand periods. WMATA expects to complete this study in the fall of 2001.", "Finally, Metrorail\u2019s maintenance and repair shop capacity could be challenged as early as the fall of 2001 with the delivery of the first group of new rail cars. Depending on the number of cars that can be repaired outside of the shops, WMATA could need up to 126 repair shop spaces, or 12 more than the 114 spaces that would be available for scheduled maintenance and unscheduled repairs at that time. Furthermore, Metrorail\u2019s repair shop capacity may be exhausted and could become even more of a problem after the fall of 2002, when delivery of the remaining new cars is expected to be completed. In addition, WMATA plans to acquire a total of at least 94 additional rail cars to accommodate new revenue service on the Largo extension to the Blue Line in Maryland (which is currently under construction); increased demand on the Orange Line in Virginia due to service expansion; and service growth on other existing rail lines, thus adding to the maintenance and repair shop capacity problem.", "Although WMATA officials believe that the agency\u2019s current shop capacity may not be favorable for the expeditious turnaround of vehicles requiring maintenance and repair, they pointed out that they are taking steps to ease the capacity problem. For example, in the near term, WMATA has four \u201cblow down pits\u201d\u2014spaces in its largest shops used to clean the underside of a car prior to its scheduled maintenance\u2014that can also be used for maintenance and repair. In addition, WMATA plans to open a new facility in 2002 that will expand its current shop capacity to accommodate 126 rail cars. At the same time, however, WMATA recognizes that it currently does not have the capacity to maintain and repair the additional cars for the Largo extension. WMATA is taking two actions to address this problem. First, WMATA is surveying its existing shops to determine whether their capacity can be expanded. The agency expects to complete the survey in the fall of 2001, possibly beginning expansion efforts as early as 2002. Second, WMATA plans to build a new repair shop in the Dulles Corridor.", "However, this facility would not be available until about 2010, when construction of the Dulles Corridor extension is to be completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WMATA Has Established Safety and Security Programs", "paragraphs": ["WMATA has established programs to address safety and security risks that affect its rail and bus systems. WMATA\u2019s safety program has evolved since the mid-1990s, when a series of rail accidents and incidents led to several independent reviews that cited the need for program improvements. For example, in 1997, FTA reported the results of a safety review it performed of WMATA\u2019s rail activities in response to several serious accidents and incidents that occurred in 1996. The review concluded that WMATA had not adequately maintained a planned approach to safety program tasks or dedicated appropriate financial and personnel resources to accomplish these tasks. In addition, FTA found that WMATA\u2019s safety efforts had been weakened by frequent changes in the organizational reporting level of its safety department and a deemphasis of safety awareness in public and corporate communications. The review also found that WMATA\u2019s safety department had been moved from place to place in the organization, making its work difficult, its priorities uncertain, and its status marginal.", "Under a newly formed state safety oversight program, the leadership of a new General Manager, and a new bus transit safety program, WMATA has responded to these criticisms by upgrading and enhancing its safety activities. For example, the current General Manager made safety a priority by reviewing the transit authority\u2019s safety function and revising its system safety program plan, which contains detailed protocols for identifying and assessing hazards. WMATA\u2019s safety plan also includes requirements for identifying, evaluating, and minimizing safety risks throughout all elements of the WMATA rail and bus systems. The plan also identifies management and technical safety and fire protection activities to be performed during all phases of bus and rail operations. In addition, WMATA\u2019s current General Manager delegated specific safety responsibilities to the transit agency\u2019s Chief Safety Officer who reports directly to the General Manager and is now responsible for (1) managing system safety, occupational safety and health, accident and incident investigation, and fire protection; (2) overseeing construction safety and environmental protection; and (3) monitoring the system safety program plan. By elevating its internal safety organization and increasing its emphasis on safety activities, WMATA has given safety a higher degree of attention and priority.", "More recently, following a serious tunnel fire in 2000, WMATA created a safety task force to review its operations control center\u2019s handling of the incident. In addition, WMATA\u2019s General Manager asked the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) to conduct a comprehensive peer review of the transit agency\u2019s emergency procedures for handling tunnel fires. APTA\u2019s findings and recommendations, in several ways, confirmed the findings identified in WMATA\u2019s internal investigation. For instance, both investigations supported the need for efforts to formalize and strengthen training for operations control center personnel and ensure that emergency procedures are addressed in the training and certification of operations staff. The two reviews made 32 recommendations concerning, among other things, communications policy and training. At the time of our review, WMATA had taken actions to implement 30 of the 32 recommendations, including providing training to its staff on communicating more effectively with fire authorities and opening a fire training center for WMATA employees and local firefighters. WMATA is in the process of addressing the other two recommendations.", "Despite a recent rise in the number of rail and bus safety incidents, which WMATA attributes to the large increase in rail and bus ridership and the recent hiring of many new bus drivers, APTA and FTA now believe that WMATA has a \u201cvery good\u201d safety program as evidenced by the low injury rates on both its rail and bus systems. For example, WMATA has experienced low injury rates in its rail stations over the last 5 years\u2014on average, only .37 injuries per 1 million passenger miles. Very few of these injuries were serious or fatal. However, the absolute number of rail station injuries increased from 366 in fiscal year 1999 to 474 in fiscal year 2000, and the rail station injury rate increased from 0.34 to 0.43 for the same 2 years. WMATA documents also show that about 50 percent of all rail injuries occurred on escalators. According to WMATA\u2019s Chief Safety Officer, the root cause of the majority of these incidents is mainly human factors, not equipment failure, employee performance, or unsafe conditions. In fiscal years 1999 and 2000, for example, WMATA\u2019s records show that no escalator incidents were caused by electrical or mechanical failure or unsafe conditions. WMATA is promoting escalator safety by conducting public awareness campaigns and adding safety devices.", "Similar to his initiatives affecting WMATA\u2019s safety program and plan, WMATA\u2019s General Manager has delegated authority to WMATA\u2019s Chief of Police to plan, direct, coordinate, implement, and evaluate all police and security activities for the transit agency. WMATA\u2019s Chief of Police heads the Metro Transit Police Department, which has an authorized strength of 320 sworn and 103 civilian personnel. The Department has jurisdiction and arrest powers on WMATA property throughout the 1,500 square mile transit zone that includes Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.", "WMATA\u2019s Metro Transit Police Department addresses security through its system security program plan, participates in external security reviews, and collects and evaluates crime statistics. To emphasize the importance of system security, the Department established a set of comprehensive security activities in its system security program plan. The plan is designed to maximize the level of security experienced by passengers, employees, and other individuals who come into contact with the transit system; to minimize the cost associated with the intrusion of vandals and others into the system; and to make the transit system more proactive in preventing and mitigating security problems.", "WMATA has also participated in FTA\u2019s voluntary transit security audit program, and FTA officials have concluded that WMATA\u2019s overall security program demonstrates a high level of attention to passenger and employee security. WMATA statistics indicate that serious crimes such as homicide and rape occur rarely on the transit system. During the period from 1996 through 2000, no rapes occurred, and there were two murders in the system. Most of the crimes committed in the transit system are far less serious, such as disorderly conduct and trespassing. More of the crimes are committed in the system\u2019s parking lots than on the rail and bus system, and more crimes are committed on the rail system than on the buses. Some crimes, such as motor vehicle theft and robbery, increased somewhat from 1999 to 2000. To address those increases and the problem of crime in its parking lots, WMATA has increased undercover patrols of parking lots and rail stations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WMATA Is Addressing its Major Capital Requirements but Could Benefit From a More Formal Capital Planning Process", "paragraphs": ["WMATA operates in a complex environment that makes capital decision- making difficult. For example, unlike most other major urban transit systems, WMATA does not have a dedicated revenue source to fund its capital programs, thus subjecting the agency to the appropriations processes of the federal, state, and local governments that fund its programs. In addition, WMATA\u2019s General Manager and staff must achieve consensus and obtain final approvals for the agency\u2019s capital projects from many organizations and government levels, including its own Board of Directors; numerous local and state jurisdictions within the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia that the transit agency serves; the TPB of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments; the Federal Transit Administration; and the U.S. Congress, which has provided WMATA with funding over the years to build its Metrorail system. In spite of these challenges, WMATA has incorporated some of the best capital investment practices followed by leading public and private sector organizations. We believe that WMATA could benefit by building on those practices by formalizing some aspects of its capital decision-making process and expanding its strategic and capital planning efforts.", "WMATA created a Capital Improvement Program in November 2000 to consolidate its ongoing and planned capital improvement activities. This program has three elements to address all aspects of the agency\u2019s capital investments, including (1) an Infrastructure Renewal Program (IRP) for system rehabilitation and replacements, (2) a System Expansion Program (SEP), and (3) a System Access and Capacity Program (SAP). First, IRP is designed to rehabilitate or replace WMATA\u2019s existing assets, including rail cars, buses, maintenance facilities, tracks, and other structures and systems. IRP is estimated to cost $9.8 billion over the next 25 years. Secondly, SEP is designed to expand fixed guideway services, selectively add stations and entrances to the existing Metrorail system, and improve bus service levels and expand service areas. WMATA has not yet estimated the total costs associated with its planned SEP projects. Third, SAP\u2014 which is estimated to cost about $2.5 billion over the next 25 years\u2014was established to improve access to and the capacity of the transit system by providing additional rail cars and buses, parking facilities, and support activities to accommodate ridership growth. It also includes the study to determine the modifications needed to Metrorail\u2019s core capacity to sustain current and future ridership volumes. WMATA expects to complete this study in the fall of 2001.", "In our December 1998 report, GAO identified capital decision-making principles and practices used by outstanding state and local governments and private sector organizations.

This enables managers to identify the resources needed to satisfy the organization\u2019s program requirements on the basis of the program\u2019s goals and objectives. To do this, an organization must have identified its mission and goals through a strategic planning process. To assist with identifying any gap between an organization\u2019s resource needs and its existing capital capabilities, leading organizations maintain systems that capture and report information on existing assets and facilities. This information is frequently updated and accessible to decisionmakers when needed. Leading organizations also consider a full range of possible ways to achieve the organization\u2019s goals and objectives, including examining both capital and noncapital alternatives.", "WMATA has articulated an overall organizational mission statement and a goal of doubling ridership by the year 2025 and is beginning to develop a business planning process. It has not, however, fully developed a strategic planning process that defines multiyear goals and objectives and clearly links its project outcomes\u2014including capital projects\u2014to achieving those goals and objectives. In particular, WMATA has not developed a formal strategic plan that defines multiyear goals and objectives for the agency, nor does it have annual performance plans that explain the specific ways in which WMATA will attempt to achieve those goals and objectives.", "WMATA has completed a comprehensive assessment of its infrastructure renewal requirements, and it is in the process of assessing its system capacity requirements.

An investment approach builds on an organization\u2019s assessment of where it should invest its resources for the greatest benefit over the long term. Establishing a decision-making framework that encourages the appropriate levels of management review and approval is a critical factor in making sound capital investment decisions. These decisions are supported by the proper financial, technical, and risk analyses. Leading organizations not only establish a framework for reviewing and approving capital decisions, they also have defined processes for ranking and selecting projects. Furthermore, they also develop long-term capital plans that are based on the long-range vision for the organization embodied in its strategic plan.", "WMATA has incorporated several elements of an investment approach to evaluating and selecting capital improvement projects, but the agency could benefit from a more formal, disciplined decision-making framework. With regard to its program for infrastructure renewal, WMATA officials told us that all appropriate managers were involved in deciding which projects should be selected after a comprehensive needs assessment was performed in March 1999. WMATA also performed a one-time ranking of those projects on the basis of preestablished criteria, including asset function, condition, and other factors. However, WMATA has not established a formal executive-level review group within the agency for making decisions on capital projects, nor does it have formal procedures or a standard decision package for considering the relative merits of its capital projects each year. Also, WMATA officials told us that they play a relatively small role in proposing, evaluating, and selecting system expansion projects. They said that the decisions on such projects are generally driven by the state and local jurisdictions sponsoring the projects. WMATA has contacted state and local transportation executives from Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia to explore ways to increase WMATA\u2019s involvement in conducting alternatives analyses for system expansion projects, thereby increasing its influence on those decisions.", "Furthermore, although WMATA has performed a comprehensive assessment of infrastructure renewal requirements and has taken a first step in outlining system expansion needs, it has not developed a comprehensive long-term capital plan that defines and justifies its internal capital asset decisions for all of the capital projects falling within WMATA\u2019s Capital Improvement Program. Such a plan would allow WMATA to define its strategy and justification for selecting each capital project and would provide baseline information on each project\u2019s life-cycle costs and schedules, performance requirements, benefits, and risks. A more formal long-term capital planning process allows an organization to establish priorities and assist with developing current and future budgets. A well-thought-out review and approval framework can also mean that capital investment decisions are made more efficiently and are supported by better information.

This practice permits decisionmakers to compare the long-term costs of spending alternatives and to better understand the budgetary and programmatic impact of decisions. Most of those organizations make a commitment to the full cost of a project up front and have developed alternative methods for maintaining budgetary control while allowing flexibility in funding. One strategy they use is to budget for and provide advance funding sufficient to complete a useful segment of a project. A useful segment is defined as a component that (1) provides information that allows an agency to fully plan a capital project before proceeding to full acquisition or (2) results in a useful asset for which the benefits exceed the costs even if no further funding is appropriated. Another strategy used by some leading organizations is to use innovative financing techniques that provide new sources of funding or new methods of financial return.", "WMATA uses many of the funding strategies followed by leading organizations. For example, to comply with requirements imposed by FTA and its predecessor agencies, WMATA completed its Metrorail system by negotiating for funding in useful or \u201coperable\u201d segments. Furthermore, the agency has used a wide variety of innovative capital financing techniques to fund its Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and operations activities and to leverage its capital assets to generate additional income. However, WMATA faces a number of uncertainties in obtaining the funding it believes it needs to meet its capital requirements, and the agency has not developed plans that describe how it would address large anticipated funding shortfalls in its programs for infrastructure renewal and system capacity. For example, WMATA has not developed alternate scenarios of how such funding shortfalls would be absorbed by the various asset categories under the Infrastructure Renewal Program or by the projects identified under the System Access and Capacity Program. The funding shortfalls are anticipated to total $3.7 billion over the next 25 years and represent an average annual shortfall of about $150 million for both programs. Furthermore, the budget shortfall could significantly increase when WMATA completes its ongoing assessment of Metrorail\u2019s core capacity in the fall of 2001."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our review showed that WMATA has identified the operational and safety challenges it faces and has established sound policies, programs, and practices to meet those challenges. We note that in the operations and maintenance area, WMATA is in some ways a \u201cvictim\u201d of its own success in that its challenges have largely resulted from ever-increasing passenger ridership demands, along with the inevitable aging of its equipment and infrastructure. In the safety and security area, WMATA has established programs to identify, evaluate, and minimize risks throughout its bus and rail systems; and it has upgraded its safety organization in recent years to improve its internal management and oversight of safety problems. WMATA has low incident rates of injury and serious crime on both its rail and bus systems. As a result, WMATA is viewed by outside organizations, such as FTA and APTA, as having very good safety and security programs.", "To address its long-term capital needs, WMATA has established a Capital Improvement Program that incorporates some of the best capital investment practices followed by leading public and private sector organizations. However, we believe that WMATA could benefit by building on those practices by formalizing some aspects of its capital decision- making process and by expanding its strategic and capital planning efforts. For example, by developing a multiyear strategic plan and annual performance plans, WMATA could more clearly define its vision, direction, strategies, and priorities\u2014not only for capital planning and decision- making, but for all aspects of its activities. Also, WMATA could benefit from establishing a consolidated capital plan that would allow the agency and its external stakeholders to weigh and balance the need to maintain its existing capital assets against the demand for new assets. A more active role for WMATA in capital planning would provide better information for federal, state, and local decisionmakers that fund WMATA\u2019s projects and would increase WMATA\u2019s influence with them.", "Similarly, a more formal internal review and approval process for making capital decisions within WMATA\u2014including formal procedures and standard decision packages for considering the relative merits of various capital projects each year\u2014would help WMATA establish priorities, develop budgets, and facilitate periodic reviews of all ongoing and proposed projects. It would also provide greater assurance of continuity within the organization if key managers move to other positions or leave the agency. In addition, WMATA could provide valuable analysis and insights through a more active role in identifying and evaluating alternatives for system expansion projects. Leading organizations consider such alternatives analysis to be a critical factor in making sound capital investment decisions. Because the state and local jurisdictions take the lead in identifying and deciding on expansion projects, WMATA often does not become involved in crucial early decisions about the most appropriate and efficient ways to expand the system. WMATA is exploring ways to increase its involvement in conducting alternatives analyses for system expansion projects, thereby increasing its influence on those decisions. We support WMATA\u2019s efforts in this area.", "Finally, WMATA has not fully planned how it will address large anticipated funding shortfalls in its programs for infrastructure renewal and system access and capacity. WMATA officials expressed concerns that developing such plans could undermine their efforts to obtain what they believe is the required funding amount for the two capital programs.

At the same time, the number of passenger offloads increased by about 55 percent\u2014from 783 in fiscal year 1996 to 1,212 in fiscal year 2000.", "WMATA attributes these problems primarily to its aging rail equipment and infrastructure. Forty-five percent of Metrorail\u2019s 103-mile system is from 17 to 25 years old. Another 33 percent is from 9 to 16 years old. Only 22 percent is relatively new\u2014constructed within the past 8 years. Similarly, 39 percent of Metrorail\u2019s 762 rail car fleet has been operating since 1976. Another 48 percent went into service during the 1980s, and only 13 percent is relatively new\u2014placed into service in the mid-1990s. Further, an assessment of the condition of Metrorail\u2019s equipment and infrastructure performed in 1998 found that certain assets, such as stations and tunnels, were in a \u201cdegraded\u201d condition, suffering from, among other things, deferred maintenance and postponement of rehabilitation due to funding constraints. The general effect of deferring maintenance is a lowering of overall system quality; an increase in the cost of regular and corrective maintenance; and an increase in the cost of rehabilitation work, when it is finally performed.", "WMATA is addressing Metrorail\u2019s equipment and infrastructure problems through a number of projects in its Infrastructure Renewal Program (IRP). One key project being carried out under IRP is the Emergency Rail Rehabilitation Program, which is focused on reducing the serious service reliability problems\u2014including problems with rail car equipment, train \u201cwayside relays,\u201d and customer communications\u2014highlighted in the spring of 1999. Now in its second year, this program has a number of goals, including reducing train delays and passenger offloads by 50 percent. To achieve these goals, the program provides for, among other things, accelerated maintenance projects to correct performance problems on the fleet\u2019s oldest rail cars, with all work scheduled to be completed by November 2003. The program also provides for additional maintenance efforts on station escalators and improvements in critical facilities and communication equipment, including additional fare gates and upgraded passenger announcement systems.", "WMATA has made significant progress in carrying out many of the emergency program\u2019s rail system improvement projects. For example, by August 2000, WMATA had completed almost 8 of 12 car maintenance projects on such critical components as brakes and doors on 662 rail cars. Furthermore, WMATA\u2019s statistics show that for the period covering July 2000 through January 2001, the number of passenger offloads had decreased by 15 percent, compared with the same period in the previous year. In particular, WMATA officials noted that offloads during the spring \u201cCherry Blossom Season\u201d in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area decreased, on average, from 9 per weekday in 1999 to 4.8 per weekday in 2001. Other examples of WMATA\u2019s progress under the emergency program include the award of a contract for maintenance and rehabilitation of 170 station escalators; installation of rail system scanners at all station kiosks for status monitoring by station managers, allowing them to respond to passenger inquiries with real-time information on incidents and delays; installation of electronic display signs on station platforms, showing train arrivals and service delays; and installation of 44 additional fare gates.", "In addition to the emergency rehabilitation program, IRP includes other key projects that address Metrorail\u2019s aging equipment and infrastructure problems. One of these\u2014the rail car rehabilitation project\u2014will enhance the reliability of 364 cars that were built in the 1980s. These cars will be overhauled and rehabilitated under a contract awarded in December 2000. The work, according to WMATA, will greatly reduce the cars\u2019 energy consumption and maintenance costs and improve their overall reliability.

Metrorail is now operating at near capacity during peak demand periods, causing some uncomfortably crowded trains. WMATA has several actions under way to ease Metrorail\u2019s overcrowded conditions, including adding new rail cars to the system, which will allow Metrorail to increase the size of some trains.", "Metrorail\u2019s current passenger load standards allow for an average of 140 passengers per car on all trains and 155 passengers per car on any single train during peak demand periods. The current Metrorail fleet is composed of two types of cars. One type\u2014the Rohr car\u2014has a full-load capacity of 175, including 80 seated and 95 standing passengers. The other model\u2014the Breda car\u2014can also accommodate 175 passengers, but it has 12 fewer seats. For planning purposes, WMATA considers scheduled capacity\u2014number of trains, cars per train, and intervals between trains\u2014 to be meeting ridership demands if the number of passengers in a car during the peak half-hour is, on average, 140 or fewer. An average greater than 140 indicates that demand is exceeding capacity. Demand is also considered exceeding capacity when an individual trip exceeds an average of 155 passengers per car consistently throughout a month.", "For the purpose of assessing rail service levels during peak demand periods, WMATA defines passenger loads and comfort levels as follows: (1) up to 99 passengers per car as \u201cseated with some standing,\u201d (2) 100 to 124 passengers as \u201ccrowded but comfortable,\u201d (3) 125 to 149 passengers as \u201ccrowded and uncomfortable,\u201d and (4) 150 or more passengers as \u201ccrush load.\u201d In measuring Metrorail\u2019s performance over the 6-month period ending in January 2001, WMATA observed 233 trips during the peak morning hour (7:45 to 8:45); an average of 15 percent of the train cars were uncomfortably crowded, and about 8 percent had crush loads. At the same time, WMATA found that of the 225 trips observed during the peak afternoon hour (5:00 to 6:00), an average of 15 percent of the train cars were uncomfortably crowded, and about 5 percent had crush loads.", "Metrorail\u2019s overcrowded conditions are primarily the result of three separate but related factors. First, WMATA\u2019s records show that Metrorail ridership has grown by about 10 percent over the past 4 years\u2014from about 148 million passengers in fiscal year 1997 to 163.3 million in fiscal year 2000. According to WMATA, during fiscal year 2000, on average, 558,000 weekday trips were taken on Metrorail, with several months experiencing daily average trips in the 580,000 to 590,000 range. The number of Metrorail trips that occur in the peak periods has grown at an even greater rate. Morning peak period ridership has increased 16 percent from fiscal year 1997 to fiscal year 2000. During the morning and afternoon peak periods, almost 200,000 people, on average, used the Metrorail system in 2000.", "The second factor contributing to overcrowding is Metrorail\u2019s lack of a sufficient number of rail cars to operate more and longer trains on a regular basis, without creating service and reliability problems. For example, in order to meet higher-than-expected ridership demands on the Green Line\u2019s new Branch Avenue extension, WMATA had to reduce by 6 the number of cars required for its strategic \u201cgap trains\u201d  and by 26 the number of cars in its operating spares inventory. Like gap trains, the operating spares also contribute to service reliability. By reducing the number of operating spares and gap trains, WMATA was able to increase the number and size of the trains operating on the Green Line without reducing service on its other four lines. However, in reducing the number of operating spares and gap trains, WMATA recognizes that it also increased the potential for service disruptions due to mechanical problems.", "Finally, if Metrorail had a sufficient number of vehicles to expand its rush- hour trains from six cars to eight cars, the trains would have more room to accommodate passengers, with the result that the most crowded trains would become more comfortable. Although the Metrorail system was originally designed to accommodate eight-car trains, until recently, WMATA had been uncertain about whether longer trains could stop safely inside stations and whether the system had enough electricity to power longer trains on a regular basis. For example, all Metrorail cars are 75 feet long, and all station platforms measure 600 feet in length. This means that an eight-car train must stop precisely at the end of the platform for passengers to exit and enter the cars safely.", "To address concerns about whether the rail system can operate and accommodate longer trains on a regular basis, Metrorail began testing eight-car trains on each of its lines in December 2000. The results of these tests, presented to the Operations Committee of the Board of Directors in March 2001, indicate that eight-car trains could be operated in limited service only if additional vehicles\u2014besides those currently on order\u2014are purchased and improvements are made to the power system and automatic train control equipment. Further use of eight-car trains would require an even greater investment in these and other elements of the system, such as maintenance and storage capacity. WMATA is examining Metrorail\u2019s core capacity needs to determine, among other things, what improvements in capacity\u2014cars and power, for example\u2014will be required to operate eight-car trains on a regular basis during peak demand periods.WMATA expects to complete this study in the fall of 2001.", "WMATA has other actions under way to ease Metrorail\u2019s overcrowded conditions. Most notably, the agency has ordered 192 new rail cars that it had planned to phase into service over the 12-month period beginning in the summer of 2001. However, WMATA suffered a setback in June 2001 when it took action to delay delivery of these cars until the rail car manufacturer corrects technical problems. As of late June 2001, WMATA officials told us that they now expect to begin phasing the first new cars into service by the fall of 2001.", "The majority of the new cars will be placed into service where the heaviest ridership is occurring and will allow WMATA to adjust train sizes. For example, on some lines, the train size will change from four cars to six cars. WMATA does not anticipate that the additional cars will have a large effect on passenger comfort levels, especially if ridership continues to grow; however, it believes the new cars will reduce the percentage of trips with crush loads. According to WMATA, the new cars were intended to address a 1-percent per year growth in ridership, but Metrorail has been averaging more than that. WMATA has also established goals for improving Metrorail\u2019s passenger load standards and therefore passenger comfort levels. Although no time limit has been established for achieving these goals, they include reducing the primary load standard from 140 to 105 passengers per car on all trains\u2014a 25-percent reduction\u2014and reducing the secondary load standard from 155 to 115 passengers per car on any single train\u2014a 26-percent reduction\u2014during peak demand periods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delivery of 192 New Rail Cars Could Stretch Metrorail\u2019s Maintenance and Repair Shop Capacity to the Limit", "paragraphs": ["WMATA\u2019s maintenance and repair shop capacity could be stretched to near maximum levels as early as the fall of 2001 with the expected delivery of the first group of the 192 new rail cars. Furthermore, Metrorail\u2019s repair shop capacity may be exhausted when delivery of the remaining rail cars is completed by the fall of 2002. WMATA is determining whether and how its current shop capacity could be expanded.", "WMATA\u2019s ability to regularly maintain and repair its rail fleet directly affects the reliability and quality of Metrorail service. Currently, WMATA has 6 facilities with a total capacity to maintain and repair 118 cars daily. These facilities are located throughout the Metrorail system. The oldest and largest shop, opened in 1974, is 1 of 2 facilities able to service more than 20 cars each and perform heavy repairs and overhauls in addition to scheduled maintenance and unscheduled repairs. Of the remaining 4 facilities, 3 have the capacity to service 20 cars each; 1 facility has only 8 repair spaces. WMATA plans to open a new facility in 2002 that will expand its current capacity to accommodate 126 cars. As of March 2001, Metrorail\u2019s total available fleet consisted of 762 cars.", "Given that WMATA has shop spaces for 118 cars and that some cars can be repaired outside of the shop, repair shop capacity in fiscal year 2000 was sufficient, for planning purposes, to support Metrorail\u2019s maintenance and repair requirements. According to WMATA, the number of shop spaces required for maintenance and repairs equals the number of cars needed for revenue service, plus the number of spare cars (20 percent of the available fleet) needed for fleet management, multiplied by a factor of 15 percent (the typical number of cars held out of revenue service daily for maintenance and repairs). WMATA also considers the fact that about 15 percent of \u201crunning repairs\u201d\u2014repairs to address problems that occur while vehicles are in service\u2014can be performed safely outside of the repair shop. WMATA typically holds about 112 rail cars out of service daily for maintenance and repair.", "However, WMATA officials told us that they expect to receive about 80 of the 192 new rail cars by the end of the fall of 2001, which will increase the available fleet size to 842 cars. Of the 80 new cars, 32 are required for service on the Green Line\u2019s Branch Avenue extension. The remainder will be placed into revenue service where required. Thus, by the end of the fall of  2001, WMATA could need 126 repair shop spaces\u201415 percent of the 842-car fleet\u2014or 8 more than capacity. Depending on the number of cars that can be repaired outside of the repair shop, shop capacity could be inadequate to meet requirements at that time.  Further, because the new cars will require acceptance testing before they are placed into service, WMATA will have to relinquish four shop spaces to the manufacturer. Testing, which could require at least 5 days for each car, will be done at one of the larger facilities, where four shop spaces have been dedicated to the car manufacturer.", "As the balance of the new cars are delivered\u201410 cars per month over 11 months following the initial delivery in the fall of 2001\u2014repair shop capacity could become even more of a problem by the fall of 2002. At that time, WMATA will have 126 shop spaces and the number of cars required for revenue service will have increased to 914 (762 existing cars, plus 192 new cars, less the 40 cars scheduled for rehabilitation). Consequently, WMATA could need 136 repair shop spaces\u201415 percent of the 914-car fleet\u2014or 10 more than capacity. Furthermore, WMATA plans to order a total of at least 94 additional vehicles to accommodate new revenue service on the Largo extension to the Blue Line in Maryland (which is currently under construction), increased demand on the Orange Line in Virginia due to service expansion, and service growth on other existing rail lines. WMATA plans to begin the process for procuring these cars in summer 2001 in order to meet projected passenger demands on the Largo extension by early 2005.", "Although WMATA officials believe that the agency\u2019s current shop capacity may not be favorable for the expeditious turnaround of vehicles requiring maintenance and repair, they pointed out that they are taking steps to ease the capacity problem. For example, in the near term, WMATA has four \u201cblow down pits\u201d\u2014spaces in its largest repair shops used to clean the underside of a car prior to its scheduled maintenance\u2014that can also be used for maintenance and repair. At the same time, however, WMATA recognizes that it has no capacity to maintain and repair the 94 additional cars. According to WMATA\u2019s 1999 rail fleet management plan, the number of cars requiring scheduled maintenance and unscheduled repairs is expected to rise over the next 5 years. This increase in maintenance and repairs will occur because (1) the newer Breda cars will be nearing their midlife; (2) the renovation of the Rohr cars will be 10 years old and the cars will be nearing the end of their service life; and (3) a total of 286 new rail cars will have been added to the fleet, increasing the fleet size by about 37 percent.", "WMATA is taking two actions to address the maintenance and repair shop capacity problem. First, WMATA is surveying its existing shops to determine whether their capacity can be expanded. The agency expects to complete the survey in the fall of 2001, possibly beginning expansion efforts as early as 2002. The most likely shop to be expanded first is the smallest one, where the number of shop spaces would be increased from 8 to 20. Second, WMATA plans to build a new repair shop within the Dulles Corridor in Virginia.

By comparing its resource needs information with data on its current asset capabilities, WMATA was able to identify the gaps between what it needed to maintain its current infrastructure in good repair and what resources it had available to address infrastructure needs.", "To improve system access and capacity, WMATA is in the process of identifying current and needed capabilities to determine any performance gaps between them. WMATA is currently assessing the Metrorail system\u2019s core capacity to determine any modifications needed to accommodate current ridership and increased passenger demand generated from future subway expansions. The core capacity assessment is scheduled to be completed by the fall of 2001. WMATA also developed its April 1999 Transit Service Expansion Plan, which identified overall planned expansion efforts given WMATA\u2019s goal of doubling ridership over the next 25 years. The plan states that some of the proposed projects fall into a time frame of 10 to 25 years, and others fall beyond a 25-year horizon.", "Although the expansion plan outlines a transit vision for the Washington region and represents a positive first step in outlining expansion needs, it does not meet most of the requirements for a comprehensive needs assessment. For example, the plan identifies three overall goals for the role of public transit in the Washington metropolitan area and contains objectives, or elements, to implement these goals. However, the objectives do not always describe specific, quantifiable results or contain time-based statements of what the organization expects to accomplish. Also, the plan does not explain how the agency assessed needs to arrive at the specific proposed projects in the plan, and it does not outline the purpose and scope of each proposed project. Furthermore, it does not examine external factors that might affect the agency\u2019s ability to carry out the plan\u2014such as the transit agency\u2019s lack of dedicated funding and the uncertainty caused by its dependence on annual funding decisions by numerous state, local, and federal government sources\u2014nor does it specify how and when the plan will be updated. Finally, with regard to considering the expectation of customer groups, a representative of the Transportation Planning Board of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments told us that WMATA did not fully coordinate the plan with that group before it was published.", "Although WMATA has not performed a comprehensive needs assessment for system expansion, it does consider regional transportation needs, costs, and benefits before deciding to support proposed expansion projects. For example, WMATA has established a \u201cProject Development Program\u201d to develop conceptual designs for some of the proposed projects contained in the Transit Service Expansion Plan. The goal of this program is to develop initial planning and engineering information for proposed projects that can lead to a more detailed alternatives analysis. Under this program, WMATA is considering alternative ways of providing transit services within specific corridors; developing \u201corder of magnitude\u201d costs and preliminary ridership estimates; and evaluating potential land use, economic development, and other issues related to specific proposed projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WMATA Has a Limited Role in Analyzing and Evaluating Alternatives for System Expansion", "paragraphs": ["Leading organizations consider a wide range of alternatives to satisfy their needs, including noncapital alternatives, before choosing to purchase or construct a capital asset or facility. When it is determined that capital is needed, managers also consider repair and renovation of existing assets. For its system expansion program, WMATA has a limited role in identifying and evaluating alternatives before deciding to support specific expansion projects. This limited role stems from WMATA\u2019s relationship to other organizations, including (1) the Transportation Planning Board (TPB) of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and (2) the state and local jurisdictions served by WMATA. WMATA is beginning to explore\u2014with transportation officials in Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia\u2014ways to increase its involvement in identifying and evaluating alternatives before the state and local jurisdictions select expansion projects for detailed planning, development, and implementation. We support WMATA\u2019s efforts in this area and believe that the agency could provide valuable analysis and insights through a more active role in the decision-making process for capital expansion projects.", "With regard to assessing regional transportation needs and alternatives, TPB plays the key role in determining the overall transportation needs of the Washington region and identifying and evaluating alternatives (including noncapital alternatives) to meet those needs. As the regional forum for transportation planning, TPB prepares plans and programs that the federal government must approve before federal aid transportation funds can flow to the Washington region. TPB develops long- and short- range plans that include alternative transportation modes and methods in the region, including highway projects, WMATA\u2019s bus and rail services, bus services provided by local jurisdictions in the region, ridesharing and telecommuting incentives, bike and pedestrian paths, and pricing strategies to manage transportation demands. WMATA\u2019s General Manager is a member of TPB and provides input on proposed transit projects for infrastructure renewal, system expansion, and system access and capacity for TPB\u2019s approval and inclusion in its long- and short-range plans.", "TPB has also prepared a draft planning document\u2014required by FTA and the Federal Highway Administration\u2014which includes projects for identifying and evaluating transportation requirements and alternatives in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, including transit-related projects. The document contains projects to (1) survey workers about their travel patterns and employer-sponsored commuting programs, (2) measure traffic volumes in local jurisdictions, and (3) examine the potential for new and innovative bus services in the Washington metropolitan area.", "With regard to identifying and evaluating transit expansion alternatives within specific parts of the metropolitan area known as \u201ccorridors,\u201d the state and local jurisdictions served by WMATA have the lead role in performing alternatives analyses and proposing projects for detailed planning and federal funding, as required by FTA. According to WMATA officials, the agency\u2019s decisions about which system expansion projects to support are driven by the state and local jurisdictions that sponsor the project and secure a major segment of the proposed project\u2019s funding. For example, the decision to support the project extending Metrorail\u2019s Blue Line to Largo was largely made by the representatives of Maryland\u2019s Department of Transportation, which sponsored the project, and by the members of WMATA\u2019s Board of Directors who represent Maryland jurisdictions.", "WMATA has had a limited role in identifying and analyzing the corridor- level alternatives required by FTA. After the state and local jurisdictions select a specific expansion project to pursue, they take the lead in preparing the corridor-level alternatives analysis, with limited technical input, if necessary, from WMATA. These analyses range from a \u201cbaseline alternative\u201d that may involve little or no investment to making significant capital investments in constructing or expanding a transit system. FTA requires that the alternatives analysis provide information on the benefits, costs, and impacts of alternative strategies, ultimately leading to the selection of a locally preferred alternative to the community\u2019s mobility needs. The alternatives analysis is considered complete when a locally preferred alternative is selected by local and regional decisionmakers and adopted by the metropolitan planning organization\u2014in this case, TPB in its financially constrained long-range plan.", "In addition to SEP, we also reviewed the extent to which WMATA considers alternatives on its two other capital improvement programs\u2014 IRP and SAP. With regard to IRP, there are limited opportunities for the agency to consider alternative approaches to meeting requirements, given that this program addresses the WMATA assets that are needed to maintain current transit service levels. Nonetheless, WMATA did consider alternatives for IRP in some cases. For example, WMATA has evaluated the relative costs of extending the useful life of its rail cars, buses, and escalators by performing extensive mid-life overhauls versus purchasing new vehicles or equipment at the end of the shorter expected service life. As a result, WMATA decided to perform the overhauls and extend the life of its vehicles and equipment, resulting in expected savings over time. With regard to SAP, because WMATA is in the process of assessing its requirements, it is not yet at the stage of its capital decision-making process where alternative approaches have been fully identified and evaluated.

Also, a committee of mid-level managers has been formed to review, among other things, the small number of requests for new IRP projects that are generated each year as part of the annual budget process. WMATA officials use briefing slides and other underlying analyses to reach consensus within the agency on IRP issues. In addition, WMATA\u2019s management must obtain approval for IRP-related issues and budgets from its Board of Directors, which has a formal Budget Committee that issues guidance, holds periodic meetings to review IRP and other budget issues, and documents its decisions and their rationale in formal meeting minutes.", "Although WMATA officials throughout the organization provide input into the IRP decision-making process, a more formal process with standardized procedures and documentation and periodic reviews of all ongoing and proposed IRP projects would provide WMATA with a sound basis for clarifying, justifying, and documenting its capital decisions. It would also provide greater continuity within the organization if key managers move to other positions or leave the agency. In response to our review, WMATA officials told us that they plan to establish a new office within the agency that will provide oversight of all established capital projects, including their program scope, schedules, and costs. We view this as a positive step in increasing WMATA\u2019s control over its ongoing projects, and it could provide the basis for a more formal executive review and approval process that promotes a continual evaluation of the merits of all ongoing and proposed capital projects in WMATA\u2019s Capital Improvement Program.", "Within the System Expansion Program, WMATA officials told us that they play a relatively small role in proposing, evaluating, and selecting projects.

According to WMATA officials, the agency has not periodically updated or reassessed the priority ranking completed in March 1999 because most of the projects in IRP have remained intact, and their priority does not change from year to year. They further noted that any minor changes required in the program from year to year are incorporated through the annual budget process.
