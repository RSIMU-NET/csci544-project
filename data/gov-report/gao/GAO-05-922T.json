WMATA's Metro Transit Police assists federal law enforcement agencies by providing expertise in civil disturbance management and explosives detection and by training first responders in emergency management techniques specific to transit environments. WMATA's Metrorail and Metrobus are the preferred means of transportation in an emergency scenario requiring evacuation, and both the regional and the District of Columbia emergency transportation plans rely heavily on them. A regional funding panel estimated WMATA's budgetary shortfall at $2.4 billion for fiscal years 2006 through 2015 if WMATA were to fund many of the projects in its 10-year capital improvement plan. This shortfall may be even greater because the panel's shortfall calculation did not include the costs of providing specialized transportation for persons with disabilities, as required under the Americans with Disabilities Act. To deal with WMATA's funding shortfall, the regional panel concluded that the region needs to develop a dedicated source of revenue for WMATA (e.g., local sales tax) and that the federal government needs to provide significant contributions because of the benefits it receives from WMATA. However, given the large federal budget deficit and competing claims on federal resources, GAO believes WMATA may also need to reexamine its own spending priorities. As part of its ongoing work on WMATA's oversight entities, GAO found that WMATA is subject to oversight from multiple entities that, since 2003, have issued hundreds of reports--which vary in scope--on a broad range of topics. These entities include WMATA's Auditor General, an independent external auditor, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), and industry peer review panels. The entities have made recommendations to WMATA, which WMATA has generally implemented or plans to implement. As part of its ongoing work, GAO plans to analyze these reviews in more detail to determine if they comprehensively identify and address WMATA's overall management and operational challenges. GAO's ongoing work will also cover other FTA reviews and safety reviews of WMATA's operations. Congress, the administration, and GAO have long recognized the benefits of having spending safeguards and management oversight for entities that receive federal funding. If Congress decides to provide WMATA with additional federal funding, there needs to be reasonable assurance that the funds will be spent effectively. We identified several options for additional oversight that could be incorporated into legislation that provides additional federal funding to WMATA, including having WMATA officials periodically report to Congress on how the funding is being spent; specifying the types of projects for which federal funds could be used; and requiring that any additional federal funding be subject to FTA's oversight programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to testify before you today on issues related to the  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and the federal  government.

At the same time, ridership is at an all-time  high, and WMATA continues to provide critical services and considerable  benefits that support the Washington region\u2019s economy and the federal  government. For example, WMATA operates a transit system that provides  an indispensable commuting option for hundreds of thousands of  Washington-area workers, including federal government employees,  tourists, and others who visit the region each day.", "Our statement today is based on the interim results of our work on  WMATA. We will discuss    WMATA\u2019s responsibilities for serving the interests of the federal  government, including the agency\u2019s role in transporting federal employees  and visitors to the nation\u2019s capital and in supporting homeland security for  the Washington metropolitan region;  the current funding challenges facing WMATA and the options proposed to  address these challenges;   preliminary information on some of the entities that currently provide  oversight of WMATA and the focus of their recent reviews; and   some considerations and options in providing spending safeguards and  oversight of any additional federal assistance provided to WMATA, should  Congress decide to provide such assistance.", "Our work is based on our review of WMATA\u2019s documentation of the  transit services it provides to federal employees and others; its budgetary  and other financial documentation; our analysis of reports on WMATA\u2019s  financial problems that we and others have issued; and interviews with  officials at WMATA, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), other  federal agencies that rely on WMATA\u2019s services, and officials with  expertise in the transit industry, transportation planning, and  transportation finance. We reviewed selected reports issued by entities  that oversee WMATA\u2014including WMATA\u2019s Auditor General, an  independent external auditor, and the Federal Transit Administration  (FTA). We also reviewed prior GAO reports on various oversight issues  related to mass transit and other areas of surface transportation. We  conducted our work from March 2005 through July 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. We obtained oral  comments on this statement from WMATA and DOT officials, who  generally agreed with the information and provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate. We also provided selected portions  of the statement to the District of Columbia Department of Transportation,  the General Services Administration, the Office of Personnel Management,  the National Capital Planning Commission, the U.S. Capitol Police, and the  U.S. Secret Service. Some of these agencies provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.

Additionally, WMATA trains first responders  in emergency management techniques specific to transit environments at  its tunnel facility in Landover, Maryland, and through its training course on  managing Metrorail emergencies. The Metrorail system is equipped with  chemical and radiological early warning systems to alert first responders  to potential hazardous materials incidents. In addition, both the regional  and the District of Columbia emergency transportation plans rely heavily  on Metrorail and Metrobus for transportation in an emergency scenario  requiring evacuation.", "Over the years, WMATA has faced funding challenges, and the options  proposed to address those challenges generally include both a dedicated  revenue source and a federal contribution. A regional panel, convened in  September 2004, estimated that under its current revenue structure,  WMATA would have a total budgetary shortfall of $2.4 billion during fiscal  years 2006 through 2015 if it went forward with the projects remaining in  its 10-year capital improvement plan, except for those that involved  expanding the current system. We believe that WMATA\u2019s anticipated  shortfall may be even greater because, in calculating the shortfall, the  panel did not include the costs of providing paratransit services as  required under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These costs are  significant; in fact, the panel estimated that these services could result in a  shortfall for WMATA of about $1.1 billion over the 10-year period from  fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2015, thus raising the total anticipated  shortfall to $3.5 billion for that period. In dealing with its funding  challenges, WMATA\u2014unlike most other major transit systems\u2014does not  have a dedicated source of revenue, such as a local sales tax whose  receipts are automatically directed to the transit authority. As a result, the  regional panel and others have concluded that the Washington region  needs to develop a dedicated source of revenue for WMATA. In addition,  the panel has concluded that the federal government needs to participate  \u201csignificantly\u201d in addressing WMATA\u2019s budgetary shortfall, particularly for  capital maintenance and system enhancement, because WMATA has  provided numerous benefits to the Washington region and the federal  government over the years. To the extent that the federal government  cannot provide significant additional support to WMATA because of  competing claims on federal resources, and WMATA\u2019s current revenue  structure continues to be insufficient to support its planned capital  projects, WMATA may need to reexamine its spending priorities, including  how it will meet its ADA obligations.", "As part of our preliminary review of WMATA\u2019s oversight entities, we found  that WMATA is subject to oversight from multiple entities that, since 2003,  have issued hundreds of reports and made dozens of recommendations.  These entities include WMATA\u2019s Office of Auditor General, which has  issued nearly 500 reports, including internal and investigative audits and  reviews of contracts and pricing proposals, and an independent external  auditor, which annually reviews WMATA\u2019s financial statements and  related internal controls. Additionally, FTA oversees WMATA\u2019s major  capital projects through the project management oversight program; FTA  has issued 125 monthly monitoring reports on seven of WMATA\u2019s major  projects through this program since 2003. FTA also reviews WMATA\u2019s  compliance with a wide range of administrative and statutory  requirements through its Triennial Review. In 2005, at WMATA\u2019s request,  panels assembled by a transit industry association conducted peer reviews  of WMATA\u2019s bus and rail operations. The peer review panels developed  recommendations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of bus and  rail operations in multiple areas, including staffing, organization,  maintenance, and technology. WMATA has generally implemented or  plans to implement the recommendations resulting from the various  oversight reviews. As part of our ongoing work, we plan to analyze these  reviews in greater detail to determine whether, taken as a whole, they  identify systemic problems and are adequate to address WMATA\u2019s overall  management and operational challenges. Our ongoing work will also  include FTA\u2019s in-depth reviews of program or system compliance, as well  as safety reviews conducted by external and internal entities.", "To control costs and ensure results\u2014especially for high-cost  transportation infrastructure projects\u2014Congress, the administration, and  GAO have long recognized the benefits of spending safeguards and  management oversight for the state and local governments and  transportation agencies that receive federal funding. For example, certain  federal laws have historically controlled the uses of federal transportation  funds, including instituting \u201cmatching\u201d requirements to ensure the use of  some local funds for capital infrastructure projects and prohibiting the use  of these funds for operating expenses. Several ongoing, planned, and past  efforts illustrate the benefits of management oversight and the ways it can  be carried out. At the local level, in the 1980s, New York City\u2019s ailing  Metropolitan Transit Authority was subject to increased oversight  legislated by the state. This oversight, along with increased revenue, was  followed by improvements in the performance of the authority\u2019s subway  system. We have also reported that safeguards should accompany any  increased federal funds provided to the District of Columbia to address the  structural imbalance between its costs and revenue-raising capacity. At the  federal level, FTA\u2019s project management oversight program is designed to  help ensure that grantees building major capital projects have the qualified  staff and procedures needed to successfully plan and carry out those  projects. Finally, the House and Senate versions of the surface  transportation reauthorization bill currently before Congress include  provisions that enhance management oversight for major capital projects  receiving federal funds. We have not fully analyzed the applicability of  these oversight options to WMATA or evaluated their relative merits.  However, we believe that should Congress decide to provide WMATA with  additional federal funding in recognition of its support of the federal  government, Congress should have reasonable assurances that the funds  would be spent efficiently and effectively. Accordingly, we identified  several options for writing safeguards into legislation that provides any  additional federal funding to WMATA. These options include having  WMATA officials periodically report to Congress on how the funding is  being spent; specifying the types of projects for which federal funds could  be used; and instituting additional oversight bodies for WMATA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["WMATA was created in 1967 by an interstate compact that resulted from  the enactment of identical legislation by Virginia, Maryland, and the  District of Columbia, with the concurrence of the U.S. Congress. WMATA  began building its Metrorail system in 1969, acquired four regional bus  systems in 1973, and began the first phase of Metrorail operations in 1976.  In January 2001, WMATA completed the originally planned 103-mile  Metrorail system, which included 83 rail stations on five rail lines. The  transit system encompasses (1) the Metrorail subway system, which now  has 86 Metrorail stations on five rail lines and a fleet of about 946 rail cars;  (2) the Metrobus system, which has a fleet of about 1,447 buses serving  350 routes; and (3) the MetroAccess ADA complementary paratransit  system, which provides specialized transportation services, as required by  law, to persons with disabilities who are certified as being unable to  access WMATA\u2019s fixed-route transit system.", "Congress and the executive branch have supported considerable federal  funding for WMATA since its inception in the 1960s, citing several reasons  including (1) the federal government\u2019s large presence in the area, (2) the  attraction of the nation\u2019s capital for tourists, (3) the overlapping needs of  adjacent jurisdictions, and (4) the limitations faced in raising other  revenue for transit needs. This federal funding has taken several forms  over the years. First, WMATA relied on federal funding to pay for nearly  70 percent of the costs to build its Metrorail subway system. From 1969  through 1999, the federal government provided about $6.9 billion of the  approximately $10 billion that WMATA spent to construct the original 103- mile system, according to WMATA officials. Second, WMATA has also  relied on federal funding to cover more than 40 percent of its capital  improvement costs during the last 10 fiscal years. Of about $3.5 billion that  WMATA received from all sources for capital improvements during fiscal  years 1995 through 2005 (as of February 2005), about $1.5 billion, or about  43 percent, came from the federal government, with the remaining $2  billion, or about 57 percent, coming from the state and local jurisdictions  that WMATA serves and from other sources. Most of this federal funding  has come through grants administered by FTA. Finally, WMATA received  about $49.9 million for congressionally designated projects, including a  new Metrorail station at New York Avenue in the District of Columbia,  during fiscal years 1995 through 2005.", "WMATA operates in a complex environment, with many organizations  influencing its decision-making and funding and providing oversight.  WMATA is governed by a board of directors\u2014composed of individuals  appointed by each of the local jurisdictions WMATA serves\u2014which sets  policies and oversees all of WMATA\u2019s activities, including budgeting,  operations, development, expansion, safety, procurement, and other  activities. In addition, a number of local, regional, and federal  organizations affect WMATA\u2019s decision-making, including (1) state and  local governments, which subject WMATA to a range of laws and  requirements; (2) the National Capital Region Transportation Planning  Board of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, which  develops the short- and long-range plans and programs that guide  WMATA\u2019s capital investments; (3) FTA, which provides oversight of  WMATA\u2019s compliance with federal requirements; (4) the National  Transportation Safety Board, which investigates accidents on transit  systems as well as other transportation modes; and (5) the Tri-State  Oversight Committee, which oversees WMATA\u2019s safety activities and  conducts safety reviews.", "WMATA\u2019s combined rail and bus ridership totaled about 343.8 million  passenger trips in fiscal year 2005. WMATA operates the second largest  heavy rail transit system and the fifth largest bus system in the United  States, based on passenger trips, according to WMATA. WMATA\u2019s fiscal  year 2005 budget is $1.29 billion. Of the total amount, about 76 percent, or  $977.9 million, is for operations, including maintenance activities, and the  remaining 24 percent, or $314.1 million, is for capital improvements.  WMATA obtains its funding from a variety of sources, including the  federal, state (Virginia and Maryland), District of Columbia, and local  governments; passenger fares; and other sources. In general, WMATA  relies on passenger fares and subsidies from its member jurisdictions to  cover the majority of its operating costs.

Then, in  September 2003, WMATA launched a campaign called \u201cMetro Matters\u201d to  obtain $1.5 billion in capital funding over a 6-year period to avert what  WMATA believed was a crisis in its ability to sustain service levels and  system reliability and to meet future demands for service. In response,  WMATA and its member jurisdictions approved a $3.3 billion funding plan  for fiscal years 2005 through 2010 to help pay for WMATA\u2019s most pressing  short-term capital investment priorities.", "As concerns about WMATA\u2019s anticipated funding shortfall grew, a regional  funding panel known as the Metro Funding Panel\u2014cosponsored by the  Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the Greater  Washington Board of Trade, and the Federal City Council\u2014was  convened in September 2004 to study the magnitude of the shortfall,  identify sources of funding, and evaluate options for generating additional  revenues to address that shortfall. The panel estimated that under its  current revenue structure, WMATA would have a total funding shortfall of  about $2.4 billion for fiscal years 2006 through 2015 for maintaining and  upgrading its existing system, assuming that Metro Matters was fully  funded. As shown in table 1, the panel attributed nearly 80 percent of the  total estimated shortfall of $2.4 billion to WMATA\u2019s capital activities (IRP  and SAP) and the remainder to operations activities associated with future  capital projects as they are completed.", "Funding for the following projects and activities is included in the shortfall  estimate:  IRP projects: The IRP projects occur in fiscal year 2011 through 2013, after  the Metro Matters funding agreement expires. These projects, which  provide ongoing maintenance and renewal of the Metrorail and Metrobus  systems, include replacing and rehabilitating buses and rail cars,  rehabilitating escalators and elevators, rehabilitating Metrorail stations  and parking lots, renovating rail car and bus maintenance facilities, and  rehabilitating electrical systems, among other things.", "SAP projects: These projects, which are intended to increase the capacity  of the current Metrorail and Metrobus systems to handle increased  passenger levels, include the purchase of 130 new rail cars and 275 new  buses; a variety of improvements to four maintenance facilities, two  storage facilities, two new bus garages, and one replacement bus garage;  enhancements at Metro Center, Union Station, and Gallery Place Metrorail  stations; the construction of pedestrian connections between two pairs of  Metrorail stations (between Farragut North and Farragut West and  between Metro Center and Gallery Place); and 140 miles of bus corridor  improvements, such as signal priority for buses, route delineation  techniques using pavement materials and painted markings, and passenger  waiting area enhancements.", "Operating activities: Finally, the panel included a relatively small portion  of WMATA\u2019s operating budget in the shortfall estimate. This portion  consists of some additional operating costs associated with some of the  capital projects. According to WMATA, these are mostly preventative  maintenance projects, such as bus engine overhauls, bus tire  replacements, bus parts, rail parts, and labor costs.", "Appropriately, the panel\u2019s budgetary shortfall estimate did not include the  portion of WMATA\u2019s capital improvement plan that involves expanding the  system\u2014by adding new rail lines, for example.

Likewise, we did not independently assess the suitability of including  these projects, as a whole or individually, in the shortfall estimate.  However, when WMATA developed its 10-year capital improvement plan  in 2002, the projects were approved by its board of directors, which  includes representatives from all of WMATA\u2019s member jurisdictions.

In the end, it is up to Congress to decide whether or in what  form to provide WMATA with additional federal funding in recognition of  its support of the federal government. In addition, if Congress decides to  provide WMATA with the additional funding, it is important for there to be  reasonable assurances that the funds will be spent efficiently and  effectively. WMATA is already subject to oversight from multiple entities,  but it is unclear whether this oversight is sufficient to provide such  assurances. WMATA\u2019s existing oversight could be supplemented by  including safeguards in any legislation that provides additional federal  funding. Our research has shown that a number of options are available  for such safeguards, although we have not fully analyzed their applicability  to WMATA or their relative merits. The options include the following:     Require WMATA officials to report to Congress on how they plan to spend  the federal assistance and regularly report on how it is being spent. For  example, Congress could require officials to submit a plan to Congress on  how they intend to spend the federal assistance\u2014before any funds are  obligated\u2014and update this plan as circumstances or priorities change.", "Further specify the types of projects for which federal funds could be used  or include a matching requirement to ensure that some local funds  continue to be used for infrastructure and capital requirements.", "Require that any additional funding provided to WMATA be administered  through DOT and FTA and therefore be subject to the PMO program.", "Institute additional oversight bodies for WMATA, either through or  independent of its board of directors.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
