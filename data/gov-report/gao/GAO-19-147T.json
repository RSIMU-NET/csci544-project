Specifically for  managing Coast Guard acquisitions, we have noted that a long-term plan  that includes acquisition implications would enable tradeoffs to be  addressed in advance, which leads to better informed choices and makes  debate possible before irreversible commitments are made to individual  programs. Without this type of plan, decision makers do not have the  information they need to better understand and address an agency\u2019s  long-term outlook. Similarly, according to the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s capital planning guidance referenced by the Coast Guard\u2019s  Major Systems Acquisition Manual, each agency is encouraged to have a  plan that justifies its long-term capital asset decisions. This plan should  include, among other things, (1) an analysis of the portfolio of assets  already owned by the agency and in procurement, (2) the performance  gap and capability necessary to bridge the old and new assets, and (3)  justification for new acquisitions proposed for funding.", "In June 2014, we found that the Coast Guard\u2014a component within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014did not have a long-term fleet  modernization plan that identified all acquisitions needed to meet mission  needs over the next two decades within available resources. Without  such a plan, the Coast Guard repeatedly delayed and reduced its  capabilities through its annual budget process and did not know the  extent to which it could meet mission needs and achieve desired results.  We recommended that the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet  modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the  current level of service and the fiscal resources necessary to build the  identified assets. DHS agreed with our recommendation but it has not yet  approved a 20-year plan.", "Further, in July 2018, we found the Coast Guard continues to manage its  acquisitions through its annual budget process and the 5-year Capital  Investment Plan, which is congressionally mandated and submitted to  Congress annually. Coast Guard officials told us the Capital Investment  Plan reflects the highest priorities of the department and that trade-off  decisions are made as part of the annual budget process. However, the  effects of these trade-off decisions, such as which acquisitions would take  on more risk so others can be prioritized and adequately funded, are not  communicated in the Capital Investment Plan to key decision makers.  Over the years, this approach has left the Coast Guard with a bow wave  of near-term unfunded acquisitions, negatively affecting recapitalization  efforts, and limiting the effectiveness of long-term planning. As a result of  this planning process, the Coast Guard has continued to defer planned  acquisitions to future years and left a number of operational capability  gaps unaddressed that could affect future operations. We recommended  that the annual Capital Investment Plans reflect acquisition trade-off  decisions and their effects. DHS concurred with this recommendation and  plans to include additional information in future Capital Investment Plans  to address how trade-off decisions could affect other major acquisition  programs. According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard plans to  implement this recommendation by March 2020.", "Examples of other fleet modernization plans include the Navy\u2019s annual  naval vessel construction plan (also known as the Navy\u2019s long range  shipbuilding plan), which reflects the quantity and categories of assets  that the Navy needs to buy as well as the total number of assets in  operation for each year. While we found in March 2006 that the Navy faced challenges associated with its long range shipbuilding plan, we also  observed that such a plan is beneficial in that it lays out a strategic  approach for decision making. In October 2016, NOAA\u2014which is within  the Department of Commerce\u2014approved a fleet plan that is intended to  identify an integrated strategy for long-term recapitalization, including  acquisition of up to eight new ships. In March 2017, NOAA indicated that  long-term recapitalization of the NOAA fleet requires an annual, stable  funding profile on the order of its fiscal year 2016 appropriations\u2014about  $80 million.

A sound business case requires  balance between the concept selected to satisfy operator requirements  and the resources\u2014design knowledge, technologies, funding, and time\u2014 needed to transform the concept into a product, such as a ship. At the  heart of a business case is a knowledge-based approach\u2014we have  found that successful shipbuilding programs build on attaining critical  levels of knowledge at key points in the shipbuilding process before  significant investments are made (see figure 1).", "We have previously found that key enablers of a good business case  include firm, feasible requirements; plans for a stable design; mature  technologies; reliable cost estimates; and realistic schedule targets.  Without a sound business case, acquisition programs are at risk of  experiencing cost growth, schedule delays, and reduced capabilities.", "In September 2018, we found the Coast Guard did not have this type of  sound business case when it established the cost, schedule, and  performance baselines for its polar icebreaker program in March 2018.  This was primarily due to risks in four key areas:", "Technology. The Coast Guard intends to use proven technologies for  the program, but did not conduct a technology readiness assessment  to determine the maturity of key technologies\u2014which include the  integrated power plant and azimuthing propulsors\u2014 prior to setting  baselines. As a result, the Coast Guard does not have full insight  into whether these technologies, which we believe are critical  technologies and merit such an assessment, are mature. Without a  technology readiness assessment, the Coast Guard is potentially  underrepresenting technical risk and increasing design risk.", "Cost. The cost estimate that informed the program\u2019s $9.8 billion cost  baseline\u2014which includes lifecycle costs for the acquisition,  operations, and maintenance of three polar icebreakers\u2014substantially  met our best practices for being comprehensive, well-documented,  and accurate, but only partially met best practices for being credible.  The cost estimate did not quantify the range of possible costs over the  entire life of the program, such as the period of operations and  support. As a result, the cost estimate was not fully reliable and may  underestimate the total funding needed for the program.", "Schedule. The Coast Guard\u2019s planned delivery dates of 2023, 2025,  and 2026 for the three ships were not informed by a realistic  assessment of shipbuilding activities, but rather were primarily driven  by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities once the Coast  Guard\u2019s only operating heavy polar icebreaker\u2014the Polar Star\u2014 reaches the end of its service life (see figure 2).", "The Polar Star\u2019s service life is estimated to end between fiscal years 2020  and 2023. This creates a potential heavy polar icebreaker capability gap  of about 3 years, if the Polar Star\u2019s service life were to end in 2020 and  the lead polar icebreaker were to be delivered by the end of fiscal year  2023 as planned. If the lead ship is delivered later than planned in this  scenario, the potential gap could be more than 3 years. The Coast Guard  is planning to recapitalize the Polar Star\u2019s key systems starting in 2020 to  extend the service life of the ship until the planned delivery of the second  polar icebreaker (see figure 3).", "Further, our analysis of selected lead ships for other shipbuilding  programs found the icebreaker program\u2019s estimated construction time  of 3 years is optimistic. An unrealistic schedule puts the Coast Guard  is at risk of not delivering the icebreakers when promised and the  potential gap in icebreaking capabilities could widen.", "Design. The Coast Guard set program baselines before conducting a  preliminary design review\u2014a systems engineering event that is  intended to verify that the contractor\u2019s design meets the requirement  of the ship specifications and is producible\u2014which puts the program  at risk of having an unstable design, thereby increasing the program\u2019s  cost and schedule risks. Although the Coast Guard set the program  baselines prior to gaining knowledge on the feasibility of the selected  shipbuilder\u2019s design, it has expressed a commitment to having a  stable design prior to the start of lead ship construction. This is  consistent with shipbuilding best practices we identified in 2009.", "To address these four areas and other risks, we made six  recommendations to DHS, Coast Guard, and the Navy in our September  2018 report. DHS concurred with all six recommendations and identified  actions it planned to take to address them.", "In its October 2016 fleet plan, NOAA indicated the need to construct up to  eight new ships by 2028 to maintain its capabilities for at-sea  requirements.

We also  found that the agreement itself did not address how the Coast Guard  and the Navy plan to handle any cost growth stemming from changes  to the scope, terms, and conditions of the detail design and  construction contract. We recommended that the Coast Guard, in  collaboration with the Navy, revise the agreement to clarify and  document how cost growth in the polar icebreaker program, including  changes in scope, will be addressed between the two organizations.

Options give the agency the  unilateral right to purchase additional supplies or services called for by  the contract, or to extend the term of the contract.

Before DOD and Coast Guard can enter into a multiyear contract,  certain criteria must be met. Table 1 provides some of the multiyear  contracting requirements for DOD and the Coast Guard.", "Multiyear contracts are expected to achieve lower unit costs compared to  annual contracts through one or more of the following sources: (1)  purchase of parts and materials in economic order quantities, (2)  improved production processes and efficiencies, (3) better utilized  industrial facilities, (4) limited engineering changes due to design stability  during the multiyear period, and (5) cost avoidance by reducing the  burden of placing and administering annual contracts. Multiyear  procurement also offers opportunities to enhance the industrial base by  providing contractors a longer and more stable time horizon for planning  and investing in production and by attracting subcontractors, vendors,  and suppliers. However, multiyear procurement entails certain risks that  must be balanced against the potential benefits, such as the increased  costs to the government should the multiyear contract be changed or  canceled and decreased annual budget flexibility for the program and  across an agency\u2019s portfolio of acquisitions.", "In February 2008, we found that it is difficult to precisely determine the  impact of multiyear contracting on procurement costs. For example, for  three multiyear procurements (Air Force\u2019s C-17A Globemaster transport,  the Navy\u2019s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter, and the Army\u2019s Apache  Longbow helicopter), we identified unit cost growth ranging from 10 to 30  percent compared to original estimates, due to changes in labor and  material costs, requirements and funding, and other factors. In some  cases, actual costs for the multiyear procurement were higher than  original estimates for annual contracts. We noted that we could not  determine how cost growth affected the level of savings achieved, if any,  because we did not know how an alternative series of annual contracts  would have fared. Although programs using annual contracts also have  unit cost growth, it is arguably more problematic when using multiyear  contracting because of the up-front investments and the government\u2019s  exposure to risk over multiple years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Block Buy Contracting Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Block buy contracting generally refers to special legislative authority that  agencies seek on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to purchase more  than one year\u2019s worth of requirements, such as purchasing supplies in  economic order quantities.

For  example:  In September 2018, we found that for the polar icebreaker program,  the Navy gave offerors an opportunity to provide the estimated  savings that the government could achieve if it were to take a \u201cblock  buy\u201d approach in purchasing the ships or purchasing supplies in  economic order quantities. The Navy told us that they did not  receive any formal responses from industry on potential savings from  block buys or economic order quantities.", "In April 2017, we found that the Navy\u2019s Littoral Combat Ship contracts\u2019  block buy approach could affect Congress\u2019s funding flexibility.  Specifically, the block buy contracts provided that a failure to fully fund  a purchase in a given year would make the contract subject to  renegotiation, which provides a disincentive to the Navy or Congress  to take any action that might disrupt the program because of the  potential for the government to have to pay more for ships.", "In February 2005, we found that the Navy believed that a block-buy  contract contributed to increased material costs for the Virginia class  submarine. Under this block-buy contract, subcontracts for  submarine materials were for single ships spread over several years.  According to the Navy, this type of acquisition approach did not take  advantage of bulk-buy savings and incurred the risk that funding will  not be available in time to order the material when needed.", "Based on our prior work, it is important for agencies to consider multiple  factors such as estimated savings, the stability of the requirements,  quantities required, and potential contract terms and conditions before  committing to a contracting mechanism approach.", "In conclusion, as the Coast Guard and NOAA continue investing taxpayer  dollars to modernize their fleets, they could benefit from the lessons  learned from prior recapitalization and acquisition efforts. It is important  for agencies to develop strategic and comprehensive approaches for  managing their respective portfolios so that future requirements and  capability gaps can be addressed in a timely manner. For each  acquisition within their portfolios, agencies should ensure that they have  established a sound business case before committing significant  resources. Additionally, leveraging the Navy\u2019s resources and expertise in  shipbuilding, such as by establishing integrated teams, could be  beneficial by helping agencies be more efficient.
