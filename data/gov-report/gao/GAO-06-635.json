The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required separate payment for the radioactive sources.

For example, CMS currently pays separate prospective rates for certain high-cost drugs based on the mean per-unit acquisition cost, as derived by CMS from data provided by drug manufacturers. A prospective rate is desirable because basing a rate on an average encourages those hospitals that provide the technology to minimize their acquisition costs. However, when CMS determines that the unit cost of a technology designated for separate payment varies substantially and unpredictably over time, or that reasonably accurate data are not available, it pays each hospital its cost for the technology. For example, CMS pays each hospital its cost for corneal transplant tissue, because it determined that the fees eye banks charge hospitals vary substantially and unpredictably. GAO's analysis suggests that CMS could set prospective payment rates for iodine and palladium because their unit costs are generally stable and CMS can base the payments on reasonably accurate data. According to interviews GAO conducted with hospitals and manufacturers, iodine and palladium have an identifiable unit cost that does not vary unpredictably over time. In addition, the results of GAO's survey of hospital purchase prices suggest that the unit cost of iodine and palladium does not vary substantially. Furthermore, GAO found that Medicare claims would be a reasonably accurate source of data for setting prospective rates for these sources. GAO was not able to determine a suitable methodology for paying separately for iridium. In contrast with iodine and palladium, which are permanently implanted in patients, iridium is reused across multiple patients, making its unit cost more difficult to determine. Although GAO surveyed hospitals on the unit cost of iridium, it did not receive sufficient data to identify and evaluate an average unit cost across hospitals. However, CMS has outpatient claims data from all hospitals that have used iridium. In order to identify a suitable methodology for determining a separate payment amount, CMS would be able to use these data to establish an average cost and evaluate whether the cost varies substantially and unpredictably."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under Medicare\u2019s hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS),  hospitals are paid a fixed, predetermined\u2014that is, prospectively set\u2014 amount for each procedure they provide to Medicare beneficiaries.  Hospitals are expected to use this prospective payment to cover the costs  of items and services, such as anesthesia and medical supplies, associated  with the procedure. In creating one payment bundle for items and services  associated with a procedure, Medicare provides hospitals with an  incentive to operate efficiently, as they retain the difference if the payment  exceeds the cost the hospital incurs in performing the procedure.  Although bundled payment is a fundamental principle of the OPPS,  Medicare pays separately for certain high-cost technologies because  bundling them into a payment with their associated procedures could  financially disadvantage hospitals even if they operate efficiently. Some  technologies are paid separately because they are new and their costs are  not represented in the historical data used to set bundled payments for  procedures. However, certain other technologies that are not new and  have historical claims have also been designated for separate payment  either by Congress or by the agency that administers Medicare, the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Department of  Health and Human Services.", "Brachytherapy is an example of a procedure involving a technology that is  not new and is separately paid. During the procedure, radioactive  materials, called sources, are implanted in or near a cancerous tumor. The  three radioactive sources most commonly used in this treatment are  iodine-125 and palladium-103, which provide a prolonged, low dose of  radioactivity, and iridium-192, which provides a brief, high dose of  radioactivity. In 2002, these three sources were billed on 98 percent of the  claims for radioactive sources associated with brachytherapy. Medicare  pays separately for these, as well as other radioactive sources associated  with brachytherapy, at each hospital\u2019s cost. According to our estimates,  payments in 2004 for iodine, palladium, and iridium sources represented  less than one-half of 1 percent of the $15.9 billion in OPPS spending.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) required that all radioactive sources used in brachytherapy be  paid separately rather than bundled into payment for their associated  procedures. The MMA specified that these separate payments be made at  each hospital\u2019s cost through December 31, 2006. While the MMA required  separate payment after this date as well, it did not specify a methodology  for determining the separate payment amounts. Rather, it directed us to  conduct a study and make recommendations regarding future payment for  radioactive sources. As discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, this  report examines (1) how CMS determines payment amounts for  technologies that are not new but are separately paid and (2) how  payment amounts for iodine, palladium, and iridium sources used in  brachytherapy could be determined.", "To examine how CMS determines payment amounts for technologies that  are not new but are separately paid, we reviewed federal law and  regulation pertaining to the OPPS. We also interviewed officials at CMS.  To examine how payment amounts for iodine, palladium, and iridium  sources used in brachytherapy could be determined, we conducted a  survey of purchase prices paid by 121 hospitals from July 1, 2003, through  June 30, 2004. These hospitals were selected to be representative of all  hospitals purchasing these sources in 2002, the most recent year from  which data could be used to construct a sample. We assessed the  reliability of the data we received from these hospitals. After excluding  questionable data, we determined that the remaining data were suitable  for our purposes. Our final results represented data from 62 hospitals, or  slightly more than 50 percent of the hospitals in our sample. Our results  can be generalized to the larger population of hospitals providing these  sources in the outpatient setting that met our sampling criteria. (See app. I  for more information on our hospital survey.) We also interviewed  representatives from a trade association of radioactive source  manufacturers, six radioactive source manufacturers, three associations  representing physicians and other health professionals involved in  brachytherapy, an association of cancer hospitals, and seven individual  hospitals. We conducted a site visit to a hospital that provides  brachytherapy. We also reviewed federal law and regulation pertaining to  the OPPS and interviewed officials at CMS.

During this procedure, approximately 20 to  200 tiny iodine or palladium sources are implanted in the prostate, deliver  radiation over a period of months, and then remain permanently in the  body. Generally, the choice between iodine and palladium is determined  by the aggressiveness of the tumor, and the number of sources by the size  of the prostate.", "In recent years, utilization of the high-dose brachytherapy procedure,  which typically uses iridium, has grown. Iridium can be used to treat a  variety of advanced-stage cancers\u2014most commonly gynecological  cancers. In high-dose brachytherapy, a single, highly radioactive iridium  source is implanted in the tumorous area for a brief period\u2014a matter of  minutes or hours\u2014and then withdrawn. Depending on a patient\u2019s clinical  needs, the patient may receive one or more such treatments, also known  as fractions, with the same source over the course of several days.

Prior to OPPS implementation in 2000, payment for outpatient items and  services was not bundled; rather, hospitals were paid under a complex  array of cost-based reimbursement methods and fee schedules. Generally,  neither of these payment methodologies provides a strong incentive to  furnish services efficiently. Under a cost-based methodology, each hospital  is paid its cost based on information it reports to CMS. Under a fee  schedule methodology, all hospitals receive a prospectively determined  rate for each item and service they provide, but little incentive exists for  them to provide only the necessary items and services.", "Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, CMS was required to implement  the OPPS, which was designed to streamline the historically complex  system of payment for outpatient care and better promote hospital  efficiency. CMS assigns each outpatient procedure to one of  approximately 850 ambulatory payment classification (APC) groups. Each  APC group includes procedures that share cost and clinical similarities  and has one payment rate for all procedures in the group. To set an APC  rate, CMS uses historical claims to calculate a median cost across a  group\u2019s procedures that includes the costs of the associated bundled  services and supplies, which are known as \u201cpackaged\u201d costs. A median,  rather than a mean, gives less weight to extreme values. That median cost  is then converted into a numeric weight, which determines the payment  hospitals receive for all procedures assigned to the APC. Because the  OPPS provides a single payment to cover the average total cost of a  procedure, the incentive for each hospital to efficiently provide the  necessary items and services associated with that procedure is greater  than when the hospital is paid its cost or a separate fee schedule payment  for each item and service used in the procedure.", "Although bundling is a fundamental principle of the OPPS, the number of  technologies that are paid separately from their associated procedures has  increased since the implementation of the payment system. Beginning in  2000, the first year of the OPPS, CMS was required to make temporary,  separate payments\u2014referred to as \u201ctransitional pass-through payments\u201d\u2014 for technologies that it determines to meet specified criteria for being new  and high cost. These payments supplement the bundled payments for  outpatient procedures associated with the technologies, and are designed  to compensate hospitals for the additional cost. A new technology is  eligible for pass-through payments for 2 to 3 years, after which time the  technology is no longer considered new and CMS can include the  technology in the payment bundle for the associated procedure. Over time,  other high-cost technologies that are not new\u2014mainly certain drugs and  radiopharmaceuticals\u2014have also been designated for separate payment  either by Congress or by CMS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPPS Payment for Radioactive Sources", "paragraphs": ["The payment methodology for radioactive sources associated with  brachytherapy has changed several times since the inception of the OPPS.

Because they are considered devices by Medicare, and devices  are typically bundled into payment for their associated procedures, CMS  bundled iodine and palladium into the payment bundle for the low-dose  brachytherapy procedure for prostate cancer, and iridium into the  payment bundle for the high-dose brachytherapy procedure, regardless of  cancer type. For iodine and palladium sources provided for conditions  other than prostate cancer, CMS continued to pay separately. Instead of  paying separately for these radioactive sources at each hospital\u2019s cost,  CMS set prospective rates for 2003 based on the median cost of each  source across hospitals.

For example, CMS pays for certain high-cost drugs prospectively  based on average per-unit acquisition cost. To calculate hospital  acquisition cost, CMS relies on per-unit average sales price (ASP) data,  which manufacturers are required to submit to CMS and are used in  making payments for physician-administered drugs.

CMS pays each  hospital\u2019s cost, for example, for corneal transplant tissue and certain  vaccines, including those for flu and pneumonia. CMS uses this  methodology for corneal transplant tissue because, after analyzing data  submitted by hospitals and other stakeholders, the agency determined that  the fees eye banks charge hospitals for this tissue can vary substantially  and unpredictably over time and across eye banks in a given year. The  amount of the fee charged by an eye bank depends heavily on the level of  charitable donations it receives, which it uses to subsidize the cost of  providing the tissue.

Though we were not able to estimate mean and median purchase prices  for iridium, this appendix also includes a discussion of the data we  received."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sample Design", "paragraphs": ["We developed a random sample of hospitals to survey for the purchase  prices of iodine, palladium, and iridium sources used in brachytherapy.  The sample frame consisted of 949 hospitals that (1) had charged  Medicare for radioactive sources during 2002, the most recent year for  which usable data were available; (2) were still Medicare providers on  July 1, 2004; and (3) were a subset of sample hospitals drawn for a survey  we conducted of hospital outpatient drug prices. The sampling frame  contained 98 percent of the 968 hospitals that submitted Medicare claims  for the three brachytherapy sources in 2002. We drew a sample of 121  hospitals from the sample frame, on the basis of an expected response rate  of 50 percent. Our results can be generalized to the larger population of  hospitals providing iodine and palladium in the outpatient setting and  meeting the above criteria.", "To improve the precision of our estimates of mean and median purchase  price, we stratified the sample of hospitals. The objective was to obtain a  sample of hospitals that mirrored the distribution of hospitals billing  Medicare for these sources. Because we did not have a measure of  purchase price of radioactive sources at the time we selected the sample,  we used total hospital outpatient drug charges to Medicare as a proxy for  purchase price variation. We used a regression model to identify  stratification factors (such as teaching hospital status) that would  maximize the difference in mean purchase price (as proxied by Medicare  drug charges) among strata. We grouped hospitals into major teaching  hospital, nonmajor teaching hospital, urban nonteaching hospital, and  rural nonteaching hospital strata. We placed small hospitals in a separate  stratum to ensure that hospitals with no or minimal charges for drugs  during the first 6 months of 2003 were appropriately represented.", "In our sample design, we defined a major teaching hospital as a hospital  for which the ratio of residents to the average daily number of patients  was at least 1 to 4 and a nonmajor teaching hospital as one having a ratio  of residents to patients of less than 1 to 4. We defined a hospital as urban if  it was located in a county considered a metropolitan statistical area (as  defined by the Office of Management and Budget) and rural if it was  located in a county not considered a metropolitan statistical area. We  defined a small hospital as a hospital with total Medicare drug charges of  less than $10,000 during the first 6 months of 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Collection and Data Processing", "paragraphs": ["To develop our survey of hospital purchase prices for radioactive sources,  we interviewed representatives from the Coalition for the Advancement of  Brachytherapy (CAB). CAB reports that it represents manufacturers of   90 percent of all brachytherapy sources and 100 percent of high-dose rate  brachytherapy sources in the United States. We also interviewed  representatives of the American Brachytherapy Society, the American  College of Radiation Oncology, the American Society for Therapeutic  Radiology and Oncology, and the Association of Community Cancer  Centers. We also interviewed representatives from six radioactive source  manufacturers and seven hospitals and officials at the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services. In developing the survey, we obtained  information from these associations and individual hospitals and pilot  tested the survey with 5 hospitals prior to sending it to the entire sample of  121 hospitals. As a result, we clarified certain protocols and procedures  but did not substantially change the survey instrument.", "The survey instrument was five pages long with one page for each  radioactive source, one page for rebate data, and one page defining the  terms in the previous pages. We collected data by reported purchase\u2014that  is, the purchase of a given quantity of a radioactive source at a particular  price on a specific date. For iodine and palladium sources, we asked  hospitals to provide the name of the manufacturer; the number of sources;  the price per source; and certain characteristics of the sources purchased,  such as radioactivity level. For iridium, we asked hospitals to provide the  name of the manufacturer, the number of treatments delivered, the source  price, and the rebate eligibility. We also asked hospitals to report  information on any rebates they received for these purchases.", "We contracted with Westat to administer the survey. Westat began data  collection on September 27, 2004. Key components of the data collection  protocol were    a first mailing to the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of  each hospital explaining the survey, followed by a telephone call to  identify the main point of contact;    a second mailing to the main contact outlining the data that were needed  and describing the options for submitting the data;    a follow-up telephone call to facilitate the main contact\u2019s understanding of  the data collection, provide technical assistance as needed, and obtain  some basic information about the hospital; and  telephone calls at regular intervals to remind the hospitals to submit their  data and to provide assistance as needed.", "Hospitals could submit data in one of three ways: by uploading electronic  files through the study Web site, by sending an e-mail to the study address  with data attached, or by sending electronic media or paper submissions  through the mail. When our contractor received a brachytherapy survey  from a hospital, it forwarded the survey to us for processing and analysis.", "Of the 121 hospitals surveyed, 62 hospitals submitted usable data, resulting  in an overall response rate of 51 percent. We considered iodine and  palladium data usable if we were able to identify the price per source and  the number of sources purchased. We considered iridium data usable if we  were able to identify the price per source and the number of fractions  provided with the source. Of the 62 hospitals, 52 hospitals submitted  usable data for iodine and 40 hospitals submitted usable data for  palladium, with some providing data for both radioactive sources. Sixty- five percent of hospitals providing data for iodine and 63 percent of  hospitals providing data for palladium were teaching hospitals.", "Our data were not sufficient to measure overall price differences by  radioactivity level and other characteristics across each of the two types  of sources. Specifically, hospitals did not indicate activity level for   37 percent of their reported purchases of iodine and 47 percent of their  reported purchases of palladium. They did not indicate source  configuration for 43 percent of their reported purchases of iodine and   51 percent of their reported purchases of palladium. Although we did not  receive enough data from hospitals to reliably identify any price  differences by source characteristic, we instructed hospitals to report all  their purchases during the survey period. Therefore, any price variation  due to source characteristic should be reflected in our data.", "We applied statistical trimming rules to eliminate outliers in the data.  Accordingly, 2 percent of the reported purchases of iodine were trimmed,  and none of the reported purchases of palladium were trimmed. The  resulting data allowed us to calculate the mean and median price per  source for iodine and palladium.", "Few hospitals reported receiving rebates. This is consistent with  information we received from hospitals during interviews\u2014that  manufacturer rebates were not commonly provided for radioactive  sources. Therefore, we did not factor rebates into our mean and median  purchase prices.", "We determined that there were insufficient data to estimate the price of  iridium. Of the 19 hospitals submitting iridium data, 11 either did not  provide number of treatments, reported a questionable iridium source  price, or both. Eight hospitals reported an iridium source price and the  number of treatments from which a unit cost could be calculated.  However, among these 8 hospitals there were inconsistencies in the data  provided. Some hospitals reported the total price of their iridium  contracts, which includes the cost of maintaining the iridium source, while  other hospitals isolated the price of the iridium source within the  contracts and reported that price."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimates of Mean and Median Purchase Prices for Iodine and Palladium Sources", "paragraphs": ["This section describes the rationale and method for weighting the hospital  sample, calculating mean purchase price, calculating median purchase  price, and calculating the associated coefficients of variation\u2014or standard  error reflecting sample design and weights."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Weighting the Hospital Sample", "paragraphs": ["To estimate hospitals\u2019 mean and median purchase prices for iodine and  palladium sources, the sample hospitals\u2019 purchase price data were  weighted to make them representative of the sample frame of hospitals  from which the sample was drawn.

That is, each  hospital in the sample represents 10 hospitals in the sample frame.  Consequently, if 5 hospitals in a sample bought a particular radioactive  source, and the sample weight was 10, we estimate that 50 hospitals in the  frame bought that radioactive source. In this report, we refer to sample  weights as \u201chospital weights.\u201d Our sample was stratified, so all hospitals in  a particular stratum (for example, major teaching hospitals) had the same  weight.
