As the federal government assumes greater financial responsibility for prescription drug expenditures with the introduction of Medicare part D, federal policymakers are increasingly concerned about prescription drug prices. GAO was asked to examine the change in retail prices and other pricing benchmarks for drugs frequently used by Medicare beneficiaries and other individuals with health insurance from 2000 through 2004. To examine the change in retail prices from 2000 through 2004, we obtained usual and customary (U&C) prices from two state pharmacy assistance programs for drugs frequently used by Medicare beneficiaries and non-Medicare enrollees in the 2003 Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) Federal Employee Program (FEP). The U&C price is the price an individual without prescription drug coverage would pay at a retail pharmacy. Additionally, we compared the change in U&C prices for brand drugs from 2000 through 2004 to the change in two pricing benchmarks: average manufacturer price (AMP), which is the average of prices paid to manufacturers by wholesalers for drugs distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade, and average wholesale price (AWP), which represents the average of list prices that a manufacturer suggests wholesalers charge pharmacies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["We found the average U&C prices at retail pharmacies reported by two state pharmacy assistance programs for a 30-day supply of 96 drugs frequently used by BCBS FEP Medicare and non-Medicare enrollees increased 24.5 percent from January 2000 through December 2004. Of the 96 drugs: Twenty drugs accounted for nearly two-thirds of the increase in the U&C price index; the increase in average U&C prices for 75 prescription drugs frequently used by Medicare beneficiaries was similar to the increase for 76 prescription drugs frequently used by non-Medicare enrollees; and the average U&C prices for 50 frequently used brand prescription drugs increased three times as much as the average for 46 generic frequently used prescription drugs. AWPs increased at a faster rate than AMPs and U&C prices for the 50 frequently used brand drugs from first quarter 2000 through fourth quarter 2004. Ten drugs in each index accounted for almost 50 percent of the increase for AMP, AWP, and U&C prices. Eight of these 10 drugs were consistent across the three price indexes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), two state pharmacy assistance programs, and BCBS FEP reviewed a draft of this report. While CMS noted that U&C and AWP do not reflect discounts in a drug's price, this report's focus was to examine price trends rather than price levels. Technical comments were incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Prescription drug spending as a share of national health expenditures  increased from 5.8 percent in 1993 to 10.7 percent in 2003 and was the  fastest growing segment of health care expenditures. In addition to  increasing utilization and the introduction of newer drugs, rising  prescription drug prices are a key component of increasing drug  expenditures. Increasing drug prices can affect consumers, employers, and  federal and state governments. Policymakers are increasingly concerned  about drug prices as the federal government will assume greater financial  responsibility for prescription drug expenditures with the introduction of a  prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries in January 2006,  known as Medicare part D. Medicare beneficiaries also will continue to be  responsible for a large share of drug costs under Medicare part D.", "Tracking prescription drug prices can be complicated by the different  prices that different purchasers, such as consumers, insurers and other  third-party payers, and wholesalers, pay for the same drug. Several price  benchmarks represent these differing amounts paid by different  purchasers. For example, individuals without prescription drug coverage,  including Medicare beneficiaries who do not currently have drug coverage,  may pay the full retail price at the pharmacy, known as the usual and  customary (U&C) price. Insurers and other third-party payers, including  state Medicaid programs, typically pay negotiated prices with retail  pharmacies, often receiving discounts from the average wholesale price  (AWP), commonly referred to as a list price. Retail pharmacies may obtain  drugs directly from pharmaceutical manufacturers or through wholesalers.  The average manufacturer price (AMP) represents the average of prices  paid to manufacturers by wholesalers for drugs distributed to the retail  pharmacy class of trade, and is used by the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS) to determine rebates due by law to Medicaid  programs. Prices also substantially vary depending on whether drugs are  marketed as brand or generic, with some third-party payers encouraging  the use of less expensive generic drugs through lower cost sharing for  consumers and other strategies.", "To provide a baseline of prescription drug prices before the  implementation of the Medicare part D drug benefit, you asked GAO to  review drug price changes from 2000 through 2004, including drugs  frequently used by seniors. Specifically, we examined the following  questions.  1.  How have retail prices for prescription drugs frequently used by  Medicare beneficiaries and other individuals with health insurance  changed from 2000 through 2004?  2.  How does the change in retail prices for brand drugs frequently used  by Medicare beneficiaries and other individuals compare to other drug  pricing benchmarks from 2000 through 2004?", "To examine the change in retail prices for prescription drugs frequently  used by Medicare beneficiaries and other individuals with health  insurance, we selected the 100 most frequently dispensed retail  prescriptions in 2003 for Medicare beneficiaries and for non-Medicare  enrollees in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) Federal Employee  Program (FEP). Combined, these two lists of 100 frequently used drugs  represented a total of 133 unique drugs. Of these 133 drugs, we analyzed 96  drugs (50 brand and 46 generic) for which we were able to obtain U&C  prices at retail pharmacies for every month from January 2000 through  December 2004. These 96 drugs included 75 drugs that were frequently  used by BCBS FEP Medicare enrollees and 76 drugs that were frequently  used by BCBS FEP non-Medicare enrollees, with 55 of these drugs  overlapping the Medicare and non-Medicare frequently used lists. To  calculate a price index, we weighted each drug using the number of  prescriptions dispensed to BCBS FEP enrollees in 2003. We collected the  average monthly U&C prices for a typical 30-day supply from two large  state programs that assist low-income Medicare beneficiaries in  purchasing prescription drugs: Pennsylvania\u2019s Pharmaceutical Assistance  Contract for the Elderly (PACE) program from January 2000 through  December 2004, and New York\u2019s Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance  Coverage (EPIC) program from August 2000 through December 2004.", "To compare the change in U&C prices at retail pharmacies with other  drug-pricing benchmarks, we examined changes in the AMP and AWP for  the 50 brand drugs frequently used by BCBS FEP enrollees. We calculated  a quarterly AMP index for a 30-day supply for the 50 brand drugs based on  data we collected from CMS from the first quarter of 2000 through the  fourth quarter of 2004. We calculated a quarterly AWP index for a 30-day  supply for the same 50 brand drugs based on data we collected from First  DataBank for the same period.

CMS also stated that neither the U&C price nor AWP reflect discounts,  such as manufacturers\u2019 discount programs, or other price concessions  affecting a drug\u2019s price. We noted in the report that U&C represents the  retail pharmacy price paid by consumers without insurance. The U&C  does not reflect prices available from other sources, such as mail order  pharmacies. We also noted that AWP is a list price that is not the actual  price paid by large purchasers. We agree that consumers may be able to  obtain lower prices than reflected by the U&C and AWP. However, the  focus of our analysis was to examine price trends rather than price levels,  and U&C and AWP are consistent measures used to assess price trends.  Further, increases in the published AWP may increase what many public  or private third-party purchasers pay for prescription drugs because AWP  is often included in the formula to calculate payments to pharmacies.", "Additionally, CMS suggested that we examine the effect on prices when  generic alternatives are introduced. We agree that the introduction of  generic drugs can reduce consumer payments for drugs.

Separately for drugs frequently used by Medicare and by non- Medicare enrollees, we calculated the share of the total number of BCBS  FEP prescriptions attributed to each drug. The price of each drug was then  weighted by its relative share of total Medicare or total non-Medicare  prescriptions in 2003 to calculate the average price for frequently used  Medicare drugs and the average price for frequently used non-Medicare  drugs for each month from January 2000 through December 2004. We  standardized these averages to create a Medicare price index and a non- Medicare price index, each with a value of 100 as of January 2000.", "We also separately analyzed monthly trends in U&C prices for brand and  generic drugs frequently used by BCBS FEP enrollees. Of the 96 drugs, 50  were brand drugs and 46 were generic drugs.
