A lack of uniformity in its procurement law and the CPO's limited authority not only undermines transparency, accountability, and competition but also increases the risk of preferential treatment for certain vendors and ultimately drives up costs. The current law exempts certain entities and procurements from following the law's competition and other requirements, and according to current and former District procurement officials, there is a push to expand independent procurement authority--a move that would reverse action taken by the District a decade ago. Other provisions of current law further erode competition. Notably, the law provides broad authority for sole source contracting and establishes high-dollar thresholds for small purchases, which are generally not subject to full and open competition. Also, in implementing the law, sufficient management oversight is lacking to ensure employees do not make unauthorized commitments. The District has been challenged to effectively manage and oversee its procurement function, due in large part to the low-level position of the procurement office in the governmental structure, the rapid turnover of CPOs, and multiple players having authority to award contracts and affect contract decisions. At the same time, the District does not have the basic tools that contracting and agency staff and financial managers need to effectively manage and oversee procurements--including a procurement manual, a professional development program, and an integrated procurement data system. In summary, the District's procurement system does not incorporate a number of generally accepted key principles and practices for protecting taxpayer resources from fraud, waste, and abuse. Specifically, the District lacks a comprehensive procurement law that applies to all District entities over which the CPO has sole procurement authority and promotes competition; an organizational alignment that empowers its procurement leadership; an adequately trained acquisition and contracting workforce; and the technology and tools to help managers and staff make well-informed acquisition decisions. To better ensure every dollar of its more than $1.8 billion procurement investment is well spent, it is critical that the District have a procurement system grounded in a law that promotes transparency, accountability, and competition, and helps to ensure effective management and oversight and sustained leadership. High-level attention and commitment from multiple stakeholders--including Congress--are needed if the District's procurement law is to provide the right structure and authority and if procurement reforms are to succeed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Information from the District of Columbia\u2019s lead contracting office and  other sources indicate that in fiscal year 2005, more than $1.8 billion\u2014 almost 22 percent of the city\u2019s $8.2 billion budget\u2014was spent on  procurement. To maintain public trust and fulfill public policy objectives,  an effective procurement system should provide timely acquisition of the  right goods and services while efficiently addressing agency needs and  obtaining the best value for taxpayer dollars. The success of any public  procurement system is rooted in law and policies with appropriate internal  controls, which if adhered to through effective management and oversight,  promote transparency, accountability, competition, and ultimately protect  resources from fraud, waste, and abuse.", "The District\u2019s history of procurement problems\u2014which include poor  planning, excessive use of sole source contracts, and unauthorized  personnel committing government resources\u2014is well documented.  Contracts have suffered from poorly defined requirements, noncompliance  with procurement rules, and avoidance of competition. Almost 10 years  ago in an effort to improve its procurement outcomes and promote  oversight and accountability, the District amended its procurement law\u2014 the Procurement Practices Act of 1985. A key component of the  amendment was the establishment of the Office of Contracting and  Procurement to centralize the District\u2019s acquisition function under the  direction of a newly created chief procurement officer (CPO). Since then,  the District\u2019s inspector general\u2019s and auditor\u2019s offices as well as numerous  press reports continue to identify improper contracting practices across  various District entities.", "Given these circumstances, you asked us to assess the District\u2019s  procurement system.

Our assessment also addresses recent actions the District has  taken to address persistent procurement challenges.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed the relevant District procurement laws  and regulations, and compared them with generally accepted key public  procurement principles and best practices from a variety of sources,  including the National Association of State Procurement Officials  (NASPO), the American Bar Association (ABA) model procurement code,  the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as well as our prior work on  effective procurement practices. To obtain perspectives from others on  the District\u2019s past and current procurement management challenges, we  reviewed various studies with recommendations that led up to the 1997  reorganization to establish the Office of Contracting and Procurement  headed by a CPO as well as selected District inspector general and auditor  reports since 2004. We interviewed current and former procurement,  executive, financial management, and auditing officials in the District to  discuss organizational, management, and policy challenges; procurement  reform; and related issues. We also spoke with state government  procurement leaders of NASPO about sound public procurement  principles and practices regarding public procurement and their views on  issues we raised about the District\u2019s system. In addition, we visited  Atlanta, Baltimore, and New York City to interview city procurement  officials about their views on issues we raised concerning the District\u2019s  system and to learn about related challenges they have faced and their  responses to these challenges.

Over two-thirds of the District\u2019s procurement dollars managed through the  lead contracting office was spent on professional and public safety  services, human care, and road and highway construction. In addition,  some District entities, including the Board of Education for District of  Columbia Public Schools and the Department of Mental Health, procure  independently of the lead contracting office. According to information  available from District sources, these entities spent over $600 million in  fiscal year 2005.", "The District also has special requirements related to being the seat of the  federal government. The fiscal relationship between the federal  government and the District as well as city governance have been  perennial questions for Congress, and the District\u2019s local autonomy has  evolved significantly in the last 30 years. In 1973, Congress enacted the  District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization  Act or Home Rule Act, which established the structural framework of the  current District government. The Home Rule Act allowed for an elected  Mayor and a council with certain delegated legislative powers. However,  Congress explicitly reserved legislative authority over the District. The  Home Rule Act generally provides a framework and processes for  Congress to enact, amend, or repeal any act with respect to the District.   Congress used this authority in the 1990s to enact laws intended to restore  the city to financial solvency and improve its management in response to a  serious financial and management crisis. Since the 1870s, the federal  government has made financial contributions to the District\u2019s operations.   In fiscal year 2006, federal government appropriations included $603  million in special federal payments to the District with $75 million for  elementary, secondary, and post-secondary education initiatives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Amendment to the District\u2019s Procurement Law Aimed at Addressing Reported Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In 1997, the council, with the Mayor\u2019s approval, amended the District\u2019s  procurement law to centralize procurement under one contracting office,  which would be the exclusive contracting authority for all procurements  covered under the act. The amendment also authorized the Office of  Contracting and Procurement to be headed by a CPO who would be  appointed by the Mayor for a 5-year term, with the advice and consent of  the council, and could only be removed from office for cause. The CPO  was required to have no less than 7 years of procurement experience in  federal, state, or local procurement. The CPO, by delegation of the Mayor,  was given the exclusive contracting authority for all procurements  covered under the law.", "The amendment was enacted around the same time that various  procurement studies were published, with one describing procurement in  the District as \u201cin crisis\u201d\u2014as evidenced by over 600 contracts expiring in  90 days and a rushed response to ensure that vital services were not  interrupted. The studies reported that procurement processing was  inconsistent and responsibilities were widely distributed across the  District; training for procurement personnel was insufficient and few were  professionally certified; agencies maintained separate databases; and there  was no acquisition planning process to define needs. Centralization under  the CPO\u2019s office was expected to improve the quality of the District\u2019s  procurement operations by promoting accountability, decreasing  procurement costs, eliminating duplication of effort, and increasing  financial control and performance. In particular, it was reported that  centralization of the acquisition function could allow the District to spend  money more effectively by promoting more competition and through bulk  purchases of goods and services used by multiple agencies.", "Despite the expected benefits, the District\u2019s inspector general\u2019s and  auditor\u2019s offices continued to identify deficiencies across the District\u2019s  procurement system that frequently produce negative impacts on the  integrity and operations of the District.

To promote transparency, accountability, and maintain integrity of  public procurement, NASPO and the ABA model procurement code for  state and local governments describe concepts for creating a uniform   procurement law that provides for central management of the entire  procurement system and broad discretion and authority to a CPO to  implement policies. Similarly, in the federal procurement system, the FAR  establishes uniform policies and procedures for acquisition by most  executive agencies under the President. Without such a foundation, the  District\u2019s procurement system is vulnerable to poor acquisition outcomes  and less capable of maintaining public trust.", "Twelve District entities, including the Water and Sewer Authority and  Housing Authority, are not under the authority of both the District\u2019s  procurement law and Office of Contracting and Procurement, and are  allowed to follow their own procurement rules and regulations. In many  cases, the procurement law specifically exempts these entities from  following the law, which is contrary to the central statutory purpose of the  District\u2019s procurement law to (1) eliminate overlapping or duplication of  procurement activities; (2) improve the understanding of procurement  laws and policies by organizations and individuals doing business with the  District government; and (3) promote the development of uniform  procurement procedures governmentwide. As a result, the District\u2019s law  has created a procurement environment where some entities follow  different rules and practices, undermining the District\u2019s ability to capture  an overall view of its procurements as well as placing an added burden on  vendors to understand how to do business with the District.", "According to NASPO, it is essential to have one uniform law that applies to  all agencies and their procurements and exclude blanket exemptions for  any executive agency or department. If exclusions are necessary, the law  should define them narrowly by types of goods and services procured.  NASPO state procurement leaders we spoke with said that they would be  unable to effectively run their own procurement systems without one  governing law. Without it, vendors are discouraged from competing since  they do not know what rules apply, which increases the risk that taxpayers  pay more for goods and services. According to several former and current  CPOs in the District, not having a uniform procurement law that governs  all entities has been problematic in ensuring transparency, accountability,  and oversight. Officials from other cities we reviewed agreed that having a  common procurement framework is critical for ensuring transparency and  integrity in the procurement system. Atlanta, for example, has one  procurement law that governs all agencies, which allows agencies,  vendors, and contracting employees to have a clear and consistent view of  how procurements should take place.", "The law also fails to provide a service agency that would be the exclusive  contracting agency for all District procurements under the Mayor\u2019s  direction. NASPO calls for a centralized procurement official with the  authority and responsibility to, at a minimum, develop standardized policy  and procedure, delegate procurement authority to executive agencies,  provide expert assistance and guidance on procurement issues, and  oversee the acquisition process. While the statutory purpose of the 1996  amendment to the procurement law was to centralize procurement in the  Office of Contracting and Procurement headed by a CPO, the law does not  give the CPO sole authority over the full spectrum of procurement  activities in the District. For example, although the law allows the CPO to  delegate procurement authority to employees of District entities covered  under the law and to the CPO\u2019s own staff in the Office of Contracting and  Procurement, the council, with the Mayor\u2019s approval, has used its  authority to pass emergency laws exempting entities and procurement  actions from the CPO\u2019s authority.", "The council\u2019s use of its emergency act authority has been problematic in  certain cases where it exempted District entities from conducting their  procurements through the CPO\u2019s office.

A senior official in the Office of Contracting and  Procurement said that circumventing the CPO\u2019s authority in this case was  not a solution largely because the library board trustees do not have the  contracting experience or staff to exercise the new authority. NASPO  recognizes that to ensure the appropriate level of transparency and  accountability and to preserve the integrity of the procurement system, it  is critical that the CPO have sole responsibility for delegating procurement  authority.", "According to the District\u2019s current and former CPOs, agencies and the  council are pushing to expand independent procurement authority  through exemptions. These efforts, if successful, could further undermine  efforts to establish a central authority\u2014a key objective of the procurement  law amendment more than a decade ago. NASPO state procurement  leaders as well as current and former CPOs in the District told us that this  is a move in the wrong direction and that amendments to the procurement  law should only be made to introduce more effective procurement  methods or when current laws no longer make sense.", "In addition to authorizing agencies to award their contracts independently  of the CPO, the council has eliminated the CPO\u2019s sole authority to debar or  suspend contractors from future contracts for various reasons, such as  conviction of certain offenses. In 2003, the council eliminated this  authority after the then-CPO debarred one vendor who pleaded guilty in  federal court to conspiracy in giving cash bribes to District public works  officials in return for falsified orders for asphalt-delivery. Prior to this  time, the procurement law gave the CPO sole authority for suspensions  and debarments. According to both a former CPO and a current senior  procurement official who were involved in this case, the procurement law  was amended to establish an interagency suspension and debarment panel  that reconsidered the CPO\u2019s decision in this case as well as made final  decisions in all future cases. After the panel\u2019s reconsideration, the vendor  was allowed to resume doing business with the District.

For example, in June 2006, the council  exempted the Director of the Department of Health from following the  competition and other requirements of the procurement law and allowed  the Director to select and contract with a vendor for an air quality study of  the Lamond-Riggs park within 30 days. In another case, in June 2006, the  council, with the Mayor\u2019s approval, exempted the Office of Contracting  and Procurement from following its procurement law for awarding a  construction contract on behalf of the Department of Youth Rehabilitation  Services for a youth center at Oak Hill. A senior District procurement  official told us that despite this exemption, the office intends to award  competitively.", "According to senior procurement officials in the CPO\u2019s office, entities seek  exemptions believing that working through the CPO or the competitive  process required by the law takes too much time. Current and former  District officials noted that in giving some entities their own temporary  procurement authority through exemptions in the law, the council and  Mayor have, in effect, created a culture of resistance to centralized  management and oversight of the acquisition function. One senior District  procurement official told us that such exemptions also create inequities  among agencies; explicitly discourage competition\u2014contrary to the  statutory purpose of the law; and occasionally show preferences for  certain agencies and vendors. A former District executive and former CPO  told us that such exemptions have over time distorted the procurement  law and made it difficult for any vendor interested in doing business with  the District to understand how and to whom the procurement law applies.  Further, it is questionable why the council would use emergency act  authority to make noncompetitive awards given that the procurement law  and implementing regulation already establish procedures for these types  of procurements.", "NASPO state procurement officials we spoke with voiced concerns over  exemptions that would give certain agencies the authority to operate  under their own rules or no rules at all and jeopardize the integrity of their  public procurement system. Moreover, they said that such exemptions  further undermine the CPO\u2019s authority over the District\u2019s procurement  system and ability to develop consistent procurement policy. Other cities  we reviewed have faced similar challenges with what they called \u201cpolitical  influence\u201d in the procurement process. New York\u2019s CPO told us the city  council plays no role in making procurement policy and under no  circumstances would the council be allowed to pass exemptions to the  city\u2019s procurement law similar to those passed in the District."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Provisions in the District\u2019s Procurement Law Create Barriers to Competition", "paragraphs": ["Long-standing procurement principles, policies, and procedures  implemented in the FAR and recommended by NASPO and the ABA  model procurement code recognize that maximizing the use of  competition ensures governments receive the best value in terms of price  and quality. According to a procurement law expert who participated in a  GAO forum on federal acquisition challenges and opportunities,  contractor motivation to excel is greatest when private companies, driven  by a profit motive, compete head to head in seeking to obtain work.  Consistent with this fundamental principle, the District\u2019s procurement law  mandates that full and open competition is the preferred acquisition  method. However, certain provisions in the District\u2019s procurement law  have resulted in a public procurement system that emphasizes flexibility  and speed over competition. Specifically, the law (1) authorizes sole-  source contracting under broad provisions, (2) establishes higher dollar  thresholds for limited competition small purchases than are allowed in  other cities or the FAR, and (3) mandates the use of a local supply  schedule with a limited number of vendors\u2014each of which permits use of  streamlined acquisition methods for high dollar procurements that result  in limited or no competition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Broad Authority for Sole- Source Contracting", "paragraphs": ["Both NASPO and the FAR recognize that circumstances sometimes make  it difficult or impossible to conduct formal competitive procurements and  that in such cases, the use of sole-source procurements is warranted.  However, NASPO and the FAR also recognize that such procurements  should only be permitted under narrowly defined conditions and should  always be properly justified. They state that to ensure transparency in  these types of procurements, the law should also require legal notice of  intent to initiate a sole-source procurement over a determined dollar  value. While recognizing there are situations in which competition must  and should be limited, NASPO states that artificially restricting  competition when competition is possible defeats a central tenet of public  procurement.", "Rather than restrict the conditions under which sole-source procurements  can occur, the District\u2019s procurement law has been amended\u2014as recently  as 2002\u2014to expand exceptions to full and open competition. Although  complete data District-wide on sole-source contracting are unavailable,  over 14 percent\u2014or $173 million\u2014of the fiscal year 2005 reported  procurement spending through the Office of Contracting and Procurement  was on a sole-source basis. Of the District\u2019s various sole-source provisions,  three account for the majority of sole-source contracts and spending (see  table 2). Of the three provisions, one is similar to an equivalent provision  in the FAR, while the remaining two provisions have no equivalent.  Senior  procurement officials and former CPOs pointed out that these provisions  in the procurement law establish a wide range of circumstances to bypass  competition.", "Over 40 percent of the District\u2019s fiscal year 2005 sole-source contracts  were awarded under provision (a)(1), which similar to an equivalent FAR  provision, requires agencies to justify that there is only one available  source for a good or service. Of the 296 contract awards under this  provision, 45 percent were made by the Office of the Chief Technology  Officer (OCTO) for a variety of information technology and  telecommunication services. According to NASPO officials we spoke with,  typically more than one vendor in the commercial marketplace provides  these services and the services would normally be competed. In 2005, the  District\u2019s inspector general reported on questionable single available  source justifications involving information technology services.  According to the inspector general, there were numerous competing firms  that could have satisfied the District\u2019s needs for eight selected single  available sole-source contracts they reviewed. For three sole-source  contracts for general purpose commercial information technology  equipment, software, and service, the inspector general found that there  were 700 vendors eligible to compete through the District\u2019s supplier  database and another 113 vendors located in the District eligible to  compete through the federal supply schedules. Overall, the inspector  general concluded that the District could have potentially saved at least  $589,000\u2014over 24 percent\u2014of the $2.5 million for the sole-source  contracts awarded.", "More than half of the fiscal year 2005 sole-source contracts were awarded  through the (a) ( 3) and (a) (3A) provisions, which permit agencies to  award sole-source contracts to any vendor who agrees to charge  according to a schedule of prices for federal agencies. Unlike the District\u2019s  single available source provision, these provisions have no equivalent in  the FAR or NASPO and ABA procurement guidance for state and local  governments. According to a senior District procurement official, these  two procurement law provisions were intended to save time in the  District\u2019s procurement process by piggybacking off the prices previously  set as a result of the prior competition\u2014primarily contracts awarded to  District and other vendors under the General Services Administration\u2019s  (GSA) multiple award schedule (MAS) program. The use of sole-source  provisions as a time-saving measure appears to conflict with the District\u2019s  own procurement regulations, which calls for contracting officers to avoid  sole-source procurements except where necessary.", "GAO\u2019s work has also found that while MAS has provided the federal  government with a more flexible way to buy commercial items and  services, contract negotiators do not always use the full range of tools to  ensure the government effectively negotiated prices. As a result, the  federal government has missed opportunities to save millions of dollars in  procuring goods and services. By eliminating competition altogether and  awarding sole-source contracts to vendors based on MAS pricing, the  District may be similarly missing significant cost-saving opportunities.  Moreover, the District may be at greater risk because its sole-source use of  the federal supply schedule is not subject to the FAR, and the District\u2019s  implementing procurement regulation does not provide specific guidance  on the use of the (a)(3) and (a)(3A) provisions. A senior procurement  official we spoke with noted that the CPO\u2019s office recently started  requiring District contract officers to additionally justify their use of these  methods after growing concerned about the large number of sole source  contracts being awarded.", "To ensure they get the best value for the taxpayer dollar, other cities we  reviewed have taken steps to emphasize competition over sole source.  These officials recommended that a procurement law\u2014similar to statutes  implemented in the FAR\u2014narrowly define sole-source contracting and  require that such actions be properly justified and documented. For  example, in Atlanta, sole-source contracts may only be awarded when the  CPO determines after conducting a good-faith, due diligence review of  available sources that there is only one available source for the required  good or service. Even for emergencies, Atlanta\u2019s procurement law requires  the CPO to use competition to the maximum extent practicable, and sole  source may only be considered in the case of a threat to public health,  welfare, or safety. According to Atlanta\u2019s CPO, in fiscal year 2005, only five  sole-source contracts were awarded. Similarly, New York\u2019s procurement  rules specify only one condition or circumstance in which sole-source  contracting is permitted for purchases above $5,000; there is only a single  available source and competition is not possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High Dollar Thresholds for Limited Competition Small Purchases", "paragraphs": ["For purchases under a certain dollar threshold, the administrative costs to  formally compete may outweigh the benefits of competition. In such cases,  procurement systems may permit streamlined acquisition procedures with  limited competition for purchases not exceeding a specified dollar  threshold.  In the District, small purchase procedures streamline the  process by limiting competition to oral or written price quotes from only a  few vendors, or eliminating competition altogether (see table 3).", "For the District, a series of legislative changes since 1985\u2014when the small  dollar threshold for small purchases was $10,000\u2014have increasingly  raised the threshold for some entities, expanding the opportunities to limit  competition.  Currently, the District\u2019s small purchase threshold is $500,000  for OCTO and the Metropolitan Police Department and $100,000 for all  other entities. The District\u2019s small purchase authority allows for  somewhat larger limited competitive purchases than that authorized in the  FAR. Under the FAR\u2019s micro-purchase authority, competition is not  required for purchases up to $3,000 when the contacting officer  determines that the price is reasonable. For small purchases between  $3,001 and $100,000, the FAR\u2019s simplified acquisition procedures require  that the contracting officer promote competition to the maximum extent  practicable. Generally, the contracting officer should consider obtaining at  least three price quotes or offers from sources within the local area and  evaluating those to determine the most advantageous to the government.  Under the District\u2019s small purchase authority, competition is not required  for purchases up to $10,000 when the contracting officer determines that  the purchase is in the best interest of the District. Moreover, contracting  officers in the District are allowed to waive the competitive small  purchase procedures under broad circumstances\u2014such as time  constraints and lack of available sources\u2014when it is impractical to obtain  the required number of quotes.", "In fiscal year 2005, over 75 percent of the District\u2019s procurements through  the Office of Contracting Procurement were for small purchases totaling  $163 million. However, small purchase procurements could increase in the  future. According to one senior District procurement official, there is a  move to increase the small purchase threshold from $100,000 to $500,000  for all agencies\u2014a limit five times as high as that prescribed in the FAR.  State and city procurement officials voiced concern that the District would  consider this change in an effort to expedite procurements by allowing  limited competition methods.  NASPO state procurement officials we  interviewed were surprised at how high the District\u2019s small purchase  thresholds were set, and viewed this as one of the procurement law\u2019s  major barriers to competition. Each of these officials said that they  consider such amounts to be large purchases, particularly at the $500,000  level. As one senior procurement official in the District put it, \u201cjust about  anything can be considered a small purchase in the District.\u201d", "Other cities we reviewed see the economic and quality benefits of  competition when larger procurements are involved, such as those the  District considers small purchases. In Atlanta, for example, the small  purchase threshold is $20,000 and New York, which spends over   $11 billion per year on procurement, only recently increased its small  purchase threshold to $100,000. According to the Atlanta CPO, raising  small purchase limits across the board ultimately compromises the  integrity of the procurement system by reducing transparency over  procurement decisions and source selection. One District official  remarked that, if these types of changes continue in their current  direction, the District will no longer have a recognizable procurement  system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliance on Local Supply Schedule", "paragraphs": ["The District of Columbia Supply Schedule (DCSS) program also limits  competition by restricting the pool of vendors for a variety of goods and  services to local companies; requiring entities to use the schedule as a first  source for all procurements $100,000 and below; and allowing limited  competition for purchases over $100,000\u2014to a ceiling as high as  $10 million for certain services. At the same time, there is no mechanism  in place to ensure that the incumbent vendor does not receive all DCSS  contracts for a particular schedule. NASPO has recognized that balancing  the need to promote socioeconomic goals with the need to ensure  maximum competition is an ongoing challenge. However, NASPO  recommends caution in the use of supply schedule programs, such as the  DCSS, because while there is the presumption of best value, competition  among vendors is often limited with no incentive to offer best price.", "The DCSS program was established in 2002 to help achieve the District\u2019s  local and small and disadvantaged requirement established in its  procurement law and expand the District\u2019s tax base. According to a former  District executive, the DCSS program was also intended to expedite  agencies\u2019 small purchases of common and routine items for which  competition would not be practical, such as office and janitorial supplies.  The current program is the primary vehicle for supporting the District\u2019s  small, local, and disadvantaged business enterprises (LSDBE) and requires  that District entities use DCSS small business entities to make purchases  of $100,000 and below. This mandatory use of the DCSS ultimately limits  the pool of vendors for a number of goods and services, which for some of  the schedules is fewer than three vendors. Though it may appear similar to  GSA\u2019s MAS program of federal supply schedule contracts, the DCSS serves  a different purpose. Under the FAR, the purpose of the GSA supply  schedules program is to provide federal agencies with a simplified process  for obtaining commercial supplies and services at prices associated with  volume buying. The FAR provides extensive guidance on the use of the  schedules to achieve that purpose. In contrast, the DCSS is designed to  promote LSDBEs and lacks the type of comprehensive guidance provided  to the federal supply schedules by the FAR.", "According to NASPO, unlimited use of supply schedules limits competition  and can increase costs because vendors have no incentive to meet the best  price of their competitors.  Further, open-ended contracts for the same  goods or services are awarded to many more vendors than needs appear  to demand, removing any consideration of need and price from the  purchasing decision. In fiscal year 2006, reported contract awards off of  the DCSS\u2014which contains 19 categories of goods and services with nearly  200 local vendors\u2014totaled almost $22 million (see table 4).", "Some DCSS contracts are valued much higher than $100,000, including  some fiscal year 2006 awards to DCSS vendors valued at $1 million and  one award for $5 million. Moreover, in 2006, the CPO\u2019s office raised the  contract ceilings for individual DCSS vendors on several of these  schedules including the information technology services schedule, which  is now set at $10 million. As a result, one DCSS information technology  vendor could in 1 year potentially receive a single limited competition  order worth up to $10 million. NASPO officials we spoke with voiced  concern about the ease with which the District makes what they would  consider large limited competition purchases off a supply schedule  originally intended to limit competition only for small purchases.", "In addition, District procurement officials told us that the DCSS program  has limited guidance and no procedure in place to ensure that each vendor  is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for orders. Under DCSS  terms and conditions, contracting officers must follow small purchase  procedures as described in table 3 when buying a good or service off  DCSS. However, these officials said that it is up to the contracting officer  to arbitrarily select three vendors from each schedule to obtain price  quotes; according to District procurement officials, this typically includes  the incumbent. For the 14 schedules that have more than three vendors,  this discretion could prove unfair to certain vendors. The FAR, in contrast,  advises contracting officers to request quotations or offers from two  sources not included in the previous solicitation. According to District  procurement officials, there is currently no requirement to monitor the use  of the schedule to determine whether it is promoting small businesses  overall or if a pattern of sole-source contracts to the same businesses is  occurring. They told us this type of information would be beneficial to  evaluating the effectiveness of the program and that an overall assessment  of the current program may be needed to determine if it is meeting its  original intent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The District\u2019s Law Allows Payments for Unauthorized Commitments to Vendors", "paragraphs": ["To safeguard the obligation of taxpayer dollars and protect the integrity of  a public procurement system, a government\u2019s procurement law should  grant exclusive authority to contracting officers for establishing contracts  and restrict employees from making unauthorized commitments for goods  and services. It should also grant the CPO the authority to ratify contracts  and authorize payments for goods and services received without a valid  written contract if certain conditions are met. Until recently, the District\u2019s  procurement law appeared to emphasize these standards. Under  September 1996 CFO guidance, direct voucher payments without having  been first obligated in the District\u2019s financial management system could  only be made in 21 specific non-procurement related circumstances\u2014all  of which were reasonable and included situations where the payees could  not be determined in advance, such as court ordered fines, workers\u2019  compensation, jury duty fees, and medical payments for assault crime  victims. However, in 2006, the council, with the Mayor\u2019s approval,  amended the procurement law that increased the circumstances under  which such payments may be made.", "Changing the policy may have had the unintended consequence of  focusing agency personnel attention on the process of paying for  unauthorized commitments rather than focusing on how to get  management attention on preventing employees from entering into  authorized commitments.  According to financial management officials, in  2005, the District\u2019s CFO office reviewed over 21,000 direct voucher  payments totaling $556 million made in fiscal year 2004. They stated that  the purpose of the review was in part to determine to what extent these  direct voucher payments resulted from unauthorized commitments by  District agencies for goods and services. The analysis confirmed that of  the vouchers reviewed, over 11,000 totaling $217 million were not in  compliance with 21 allowed uses under the 1996 CFO policy. Rather than  take steps to hold agencies accountable for these violations, the CFO\u2019s  policy was changed without consulting the CPO\u2019s office on the merits of  the change. CFO officials told us their office determined it was necessary  to accommodate agency circumstances for bypassing the procurement  process to more promptly obtain goods and services needed for critical  operations.", "Under Financial Management and Control Order No. 05-002, issued July  22, 2005, and revised October 17, 2005, the CFO added 7 new  circumstances for direct voucher payments to the 21 already included in  the 1996 financial guidance. Five of the seven added circumstances were  for new non-procurement related transactions, such as temporary welfare  payments to families and certain lawsuit settlement payments. The  remaining two are for procurement-related transactions, however, and are  problematic.  The first circumstance\u2014which allows direct voucher  payments for goods and services needed for an unanticipated and  nonrecurring extraordinary emergency\u2014duplicates provisions in the  District\u2019s procurement law that establish procedures for handling such  circumstances under emergency contracting procedures. A senior District  procurement official said that direct voucher payments should not be  made for emergency procurements. The second circumstance allows  agencies to make direct voucher payments for liabilities incurred through  unauthorized commitments to vendors for goods and services without  valid contracts after payment has been ratified\u2014a practice that could  further encourage employees to bypass established contracting  procedures.", "The District\u2019s inspector general has voiced a similar concern with this  change and in December 2005 testimony called for a reexamination of the  CFO\u2019s 2005 policy for allowing direct voucher payments for unauthorized  vendor commitments that bypass contracting rules. More recently, the  inspector general reported that in fiscal year 2005, District agencies greatly  increased payment ratification requests for unauthorized vendor  commitments and the procurement office ratified $34 million in  payments.", "In the federal procurement system under FAR Part 1.6, the policy provides   procedures for ratification actions to approve unauthorized commitments,  but also states that these procedures may not be used in a manner that  encourages such commitments be made by government personnel.  Moreover, the FAR provides a ratification procedure that not only  discourages unauthorized commitments, but allows for their approval if  certain conditions are met. Specifically, under the FAR, the chief of a  contracting office may ratify an unauthorized commitment only when the  goods or services have been accepted; the ratifying official has the  authority; the contract would have been proper if done by approved  personnel; the price is reasonable; the contracting officer recommends  payment; the funds were and are available; and the ratification complies  with any additional agency regulations.  In addition, the FAR states that  cases of nonratifiable commitments may be subject to further referral and  resolution under government claim procedures.", "Allowing government agency personnel to circumvent the normal  procurement process and enter into unauthorized commitments with  vendors to perform services or deliver goods eliminates the opportunity  for competition.  After reviewing a draft of this report, CFO officials  acknowledged the need to work with the Office of Contracting and  Procurement to strengthen the District\u2019s ratification policy.  They  indicated that unauthorized commitments that cannot be ratified should  be referred for possible Anti-Deficiency Act violations. Accordingly, we  revised our recommendations to the mayor and the CFO concerning the  use of direct vouchers and the ratification process.", "Other cities we reviewed have taken steps to curb the use of unauthorized  commitments.

Procurement is viewed as a strategic, service function within the  executive branch with the central procurement authority being a key  policy and management resource for the chief executive. The low-level  placement of the District\u2019s procurement office has led to high CPO  turnover and a lack of sustained leadership, significantly impeding  progress expected from the 1996 law.", "Within the District\u2019s government structure, the Office of Contracting and  Procurement is placed under the Deputy Mayor for Operations\u2014 essentially relegating procurement to an administrative and operations  support function\u2014as further evidenced by its position in relation to those  agencies that procure through this office (see fig. 1).", "According to former CPOs and current procurement officials, the low-level  position denies the CPO direct access to the city administrator, agency  heads, and deputy Mayors other than the Deputy Mayor of Operations. As  a result, this limits the CPO\u2019s ability to affect budget, program, and  financial management decisions. A former District official told us that to  improve management and oversight of the procurement system, the CPO  needs to be at all executive meetings to raise procurement issues that cut  across agency lines. This official told us that it would be helpful to elevate  the CPO\u2019s office to a high level similar to other centralized cross- government functions, such as the Office of the Chief Technology Officer,  which is responsible for all meeting all of the District\u2019s information  technology needs.", "The low-level position of the CPO\u2019s office in the District\u2019s governmental  structure has also undercut the CPO\u2019s ability to influence day-to-day  procurements across the District. According to several senior District  procurement officials, agencies often bypass the procurement office and  do not consult the CPO\u2019s designated contracting officer when initiating  procurements\u2014a practice that has led to unfavorable acquisition  outcomes. For example, the District\u2019s auditor reported in 2005 that the  offices of the Mayor and city administrator failed to involve the CPO\u2019s  office and violated contracting rules by entering into unauthorized  commitments with a vendor for international trade mission services  without a valid written contract, making the commitment invalid.  Ultimately, the CPO\u2019s office was left to ratify a transaction that did not  conform to the procurement law or regulations.", "One impact of CPO\u2019s low-level placement is manifested in the inability of  the CPO to ensure effective acquisition planning\u2014a critical process for  anticipating future needs, devising contracting programs to meet these  needs, and arranging for the acquisition to promote competition and use of  necessary resources. CPOs from the other cities we reviewed consider  acquisition planning as critical to managing the procurement system and  maximizing competition, and have put in place mechanisms and tools to  regularly address planning. In Atlanta, for example, the CPO requires his  contracting staff to meet bi-weekly with agency officials to plan for  expiring contracts and new requirements. Agencies are also required to  submit a quarterly report to the CPO detailing their procurement needs. In  New York, agencies awarding contracts must submit a draft plan detailing  anticipated procurement actions. They are also required to hold public  hearings on their plan within 20 days of its issuance and provide notice of  the hearings 10 days in advance.", "While the District has a process in place to facilitate acquisition planning  across agencies, the CPO lacks the ability to hold agencies accountable for  submitting accurate and timely plans. According to former CPOs and  current senior procurement officials, District entities in general do not  understand the importance of acquisition planning or involving the CPO\u2019s  office in planning efforts. Consequently, agencies largely view the required  annual plans as a paper drill. In recent years, the CPO\u2019s office has tried to  improve acquisition planning across the procurement system without  much success. For example, in 2000 the then-CPO implemented a new  acquisition planning tool that was aimed at guaranteeing short turnaround  for small and simple buys and sharing workload with partner agencies on  larger, more complex buys. Though this was the original intent, CPO  contracting officers we spoke with do not use the plans to schedule  procurement support activities for their agencies. Our analysis of selected  contracts conducted by the CPO\u2019s office in 2005 for three agencies against  procurements listed in their 2005 acquisition plans found none of the  contracts were recorded in the planning tool. conduct advanced planning for known projects, services, and procurement requirements  ultimately manifests in costly internally generated emergency contracts and purchases.\u201d A  senior District procurement official agreed and stated that the lack of  planning does not constitute an emergency, but all too often the lack of  planning occurs and forces emergency-type procurement actions.", "Finally, sustaining procurement leadership has been difficult due to the  low-level position of the CPO\u2019s office. Former CPOs agreed that in a  complex and large-scale procurement system such as the District\u2019s, it is  essential to have sustained leadership and a CPO with executive-level  procurement experience and qualifications. However, over the past 10  years, the District has had five CPOs\u2014three appointed for 5-year terms  and two interim\u2014and none served more than 3 years. According to each of  the three CPOs appointed to 5-year terms, the inability to effectively  coordinate acquisition activities across all agencies and manage and  oversee the District\u2019s procurement function undermined their efforts at  reform and ultimately discouraged them from completing their tenures.  The lack of sustained leadership is underscored by the 2-year vacancy in  the District\u2019s CPO position since September 2004, at which time the  Deputy Mayor for Operations became the interim CPO.

We also  visited representatives of the National Association of State Procurement  Officials (NASPO) in Springfield, Illinois, and city procurement officials in  Atlanta, Baltimore, and New York. In selecting cities to visit, we  considered those that have faced similar challenges to the District as well  as took various approaches to structuring their public procurement  systems and implementing reform. We did not assess the effectiveness of  their approaches or reform efforts and our report is not intended to  suggest that we evaluated or endorse any particular approach from these  cities, but only to draw comparisons to the District where applicable.", "In developing our criteria for generally accepted key principles for an  effective public procurement system, we relied on a variety of sources.  NASPO is a nationally recognized non-profit association comprised of  directors of central purchasing offices in each of the 50 states and other  member jurisdictions. NASPO has published a series of volumes related to  state and local government purchasing with the most recent edition  describing principles and suggested practices. We also spoke with state  procurement officials representing NASPO to obtain their perspectives on  our analysis as well as their own states\u2019 guiding principles and practices  for an effective public procurement system. In addition to NASPO, the  American Bar Association\u2019s (ABA) model procurement code for state and  local governments outlines principles for public procurement and provides  a variety of options and strategies applicable to all public bodies. The  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) also describes guiding principles of  public procurement and though these are aimed at the federal government,  many are not unique to the federal acquisition system and are equally  applicable to state and local governments. Finally, we leveraged our own  work since 2001 on effective procurement and acquisition management  practices.", "To assess whether the District\u2019s primary procurement law reflects  fundamental principles that promote transparency, accountability,  integrity, and competition, we did a detailed legal review and analysis of  the Procurement Practices Act of 1985, as amended. We did not do a  similar review or analysis of laws, policies, or regulations governing the  various independent agencies or procurement authorities. In comparing  the District\u2019s primary procurement law to generally accepted key  principles and assessing the impact of any shortfalls, we focused on  several key elements that are recognized by a variety of sources for  promoting transparency, accountability, integrity, and competition:          (1) uniform application of the law across all District organizations;           (2) adequacy of authority granted to the CPO for the full spectrum of  acquisition functions; (3) exemptions in the law through various  temporary, emergency, or permanent legislative amendments; and            (4) provisions in the law that limit or restrict competition, such as  authority for sole-source contracting, simplified acquisition procedures,  and use of supply schedule.

First, we examined the organizational  alignment and leadership for managing the acquisition function across all  District organizations. Second, we assessed management\u2019s commitment to  competence including elements required for a professional procurement  workforce. Third, we reviewed the District\u2019s development of procurement  management and oversight tools, including a procurement manual and  automated data systems for recording procurement information. To gain  insights on the challenges of procurement management and oversight in  the District, we interviewed current and former city procurement and  District executive officials to obtain their perspectives. To obtain an  historical perspective on the management and oversight challenges in the  District that drove legislation reform in 1996, we reviewed various studies  done at that time and their recommendations. To understand how the  District has addressed those challenges, we reviewed selected District  inspector general and auditor reports since 2004, and the resulting  recommendations as well as those from the internal study of the Center  for Innovation and Reform. We interviewed responsible city procurement  officials on the status of addressing those recommendations.

Specifically, information on procurement spending in  dollars and contracting and competition methods was generated from  various procurement data systems or compiled from manual inputs.  Though we did not conduct detailed tests of procurement transactions,  data reliability was suspect for these various reports based on very limited  testing and independent auditors have also raised questions about the  data. To fully test data reliability for all the various reports we received  would have required resources outside the scope of this review. Moreover,  an independent public accounting firm audits the District\u2019s financial  statements annually and reports on internal control and compliance over  financial reporting. Compliance with procurement regulations was part of  the fiscal year 2005 audit in which the District received an unqualified,  clean opinion.

As we state in the report, the CFO\u2019s analysis of fiscal year 2004 direct  voucher payments showed that $217 million fell outside a 1996  financial management and control order. It was only after the CFO, in  2005, added 7 more acceptable uses of direct vouchers to the original  order, that these payments were found to be acceptable. The $4 million  in payments referred to in the CFO\u2019s comments are those that fell  outside this updated policy.      2.  We recognize that the CPO\u2019s office is not directly responsible for  developing financial management policies. However, we believe that in  order to effect meaningful procurement reform, the CPO should be  consulted on any policy changes that affect procurement\u2014particularly  as such changes have been amended into the procurement law.  Elevating the CPO within the District government, as we recommend,  would facilitate needed coordination.  3.  Because the District\u2019s procurement law already establishes emergency  contracting procedures, we stand by our finding and recommendation  that including emergency procurements as an acceptable use of direct  vouchers duplicates the provision in the law and allows agencies to  bypass established contracting procedures.  4.  As we state in the agency comments section, we recognize the  obligation to pay for accepted goods and services, but we are  concerned that the current policy, now codified in the law, is a  symptom of the lack of necessary management focus to minimize the   number of unauthorized commitments that may be ratified and  ultimately paid through direct vouchers. In meetings with CFO staff,  they acknowledged that the ratification process needs strengthening to  include, in appropriate cases, possible referrals for Anti-Deficiency Act  violations.          5.  The scope of our review was on the District\u2019s procurement system as a  whole, not on the direct voucher process. As part of this review, we  examined and discussed with chief procurement officers reform  efforts in other cities.
