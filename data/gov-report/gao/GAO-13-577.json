The 7-year reassessment requirement is more frequent than the intervals found in industry consensus standards and provides greater assurance that operators are regularly monitoring their pipelines to address threats before leaks or ruptures occur. However, this requirement--which was established in a 2002 act as part of the gas integrity management program rather than by rulemaking--is not fully consistent with risk-based management practices, which ask operators to, for example, use information to identify, assess, and prioritize risks so that resources may be allocated to address higher risks first. While operators are required to determine an appropriate reassessment interval based on the threats to their pipelines in high consequence areas, they must reassess those pipelines at least every 7 years regardless of the risks identified.", "Implementing risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years would require a statutory change from Congress and could exacerbate current workload, staffing, and expertise challenges for regulators and operators. For example, PHMSA is facing workload problems with inspections, which could be worsened by allowing operators to use risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years; PHMSA has an initiative under way that could help address this issue. Further, some operators told us that extending reassessment intervals beyond 7 years would likely require additional data analyses over what is currently required. Operators GAO met with varied in the extent to which they currently calculate reassessment intervals and use the results of data analyses. Guidance to calculate reassessment intervals is lacking, and as a result, operators may perform a less rigorous determination of their reassessment intervals at this time. At Congress's request, in 2008 PHMSA described how it would establish and enforce risk-based criteria for extending the 7-year reassessment interval. PHMSA proposed retaining the current 7-year reassessment requirement, but establishing a process by which operators could use risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years if they met certain potential criteria, such as demonstrating sound risk analysis. While PHMSA and GAO have supported the concept of risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years, given the breadth of potential challenges with implementation, more information might help decision-makers better understand the resource requirements for this change.

However, this approach does not  systematically account for differences in the kinds of threats and the  degrees of risk that individual pipelines face. For example, pipelines  located in the Pacific Northwest are more susceptible to damage from  geologic hazards, such as land movement, than pipelines in some other  areas of the country. Federal efforts to incorporate risk-based concepts  into pipeline management began in earnest in the mid-1990s. For  example, the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996  required the Department of Transportation to establish risk management   The purpose of this effort was \u201cto demonstrate,  demonstration projects. through the voluntary participation by owners and operators of gas  pipeline facilities and hazardous liquid facilities, the application of risk  management; and to evaluate the safety and cost-effectiveness of the  program.\u201dapproach to safety: the integrity management program. Integrity  management helps ensure safety by, among other things, using  information to identify and assess risks and prioritizing risks so that  resources may be allocated to address higher risks first. The integrity  management program requires operators to perform a number of  activities, such as identifying high consequence areas and pipelines   These projects helped PHMSA establish a more risk-based  within those areas, as well as identifying the threats facing those  pipelines. PHMSA first implemented integrity management requirements  for hazardous liquid pipeline operators with 500 or more miles of pipelines  in December 2000, followed by hazardous liquid pipeline operators with  less than 500 miles in January 2002. The Pipeline Safety Improvement  Act of 2002 extended the integrity management program to gas  transmission pipelines, which include about 20,000 miles of pipeline  segments located in high consequence areas.subject to PHMSA\u2019s integrity management program, operators must still  meet the minimum safety standards noted above.", "As part of the integrity management program, operators are required to  assess the integrity of their pipelines within high consequence areas on a  regular basis using approved methods. Specifically, gas transmission  pipeline operators were required to complete a baseline assessment on  pipeline segments within high consequence areas by December 17,  2012. According to the 2002 act, operators are then required to complete  reassessments of these pipelines at least every 7 years. Gas  transmission pipeline operators completed most baseline assessments by  December 17, 2012, and reassessments are currently under way. From  2004 through December 2011 (the latest data available), baseline  assessments were conducted on over 23,450 miles of gas transmission  pipeline in high consequence areas.", "Over 4,470 miles of gas  transmission pipeline in high consequence areas\u2014or about 20 percent of  the pipeline miles that had a completed baseline assessment between  2004 and 2011\u2014were reported as reassessed between 2008 and 2011  (see fig. 1). Among other things, PHMSA\u2019s integrity management  regulations required operators to (1) prioritize their baseline assessments  to assess riskier pipelines first and (2) complete baseline assessments of  these riskier pipelines by December 2007, and all pipelines within high  consequence areas by December 2012. As a result, a small spike in the  mileage assessed occurred in 2007.", "Under PHMSA\u2019s regulations, gas transmission pipeline operators may  use any of three primary approaches to conduct assessments:  In-line inspection: In-line inspection involves running a specialized  tool\u2014often known as a smart pig\u2014through the pipeline to detect and  record anomalies, such as metal loss and damage (see fig. 2). In-line  inspection allows operators to determine the nature of any problems  without either shutting down the pipeline for extended periods or  potentially damaging the pipeline. In-line inspection devices can be  run only from specific launch and retrieval points, which may extend  beyond high consequence areas. Operators using in-line inspection  will often gather information along the entire distance between  launching and retrieval locations to gain additional safety information.  Based on PHMSA\u2019s data, the majority of pipeline miles assessed in  2011 (88 percent) were done using in-line inspection.", "Direct assessment: Direct assessment is an aboveground  assessment method used to identify problem areas on a pipeline. The  process includes gathering data on potential risks facing the pipeline,  analyzing those data to identify potential problem locations, and then  excavating and directly examining those locations.

If the pipeline leaks or ruptures, the  pipeline is excavated to determine the cause of the failure. Operators  must shut down pipelines to perform hydrostatic testing. Also, this  assessment method can weaken the pipeline due to the high  pressures involved, making it more susceptible to failure later. Finally,  operators must be able to dispose of large quantities of waste water in  an environmentally responsible manner.", "According to the operators we spoke with, the costs associated with  performing each of these assessment methods varies greatly. For  example, operators told us that the estimated average cost for conducting  a direct assessment ranges from $5,000 per mile to $500,000 per mile.  The costs vary due to a number of factors, such as the amount of pipeline  mileage to be assessed and the number of digs that must be performed  after completing an assessment to confirm the findings.", "PHMSA\u2019s regulations promulgated pursuant to the Pipeline Safety  Improvement Act of 2002 require gas transmission pipeline operators to  reassess their pipelines for all safety risks\u2014such as corrosion,  excavation, land movement, or incorrect operation\u2014at regular intervals  based on industry consensus standards. But the regulations limit the 7- year reassessment requirement in the 2002 act to corrosion damage only  because corrosion is the most frequent cause of failures that can occur  over time. The industry consensus standards adopted in PHMSA\u2019s  regulations require that gas transmission pipeline operators reassess  their pipelines for all safety risks at least every 10, 15, or 20 years,  depending primarily on the condition and operating pressure of the  pipelines, with pressure measured as a percentage of specified minimum   If an operator elects to establish a reassessment interval  yield strength.for all safety risks based on the industry consensus standards, it must\u2014in  order to comply with the 2002 act\u2014perform what is called a \u201cconfirmatory  direct assessment\u201d by at least the seventh year to assess corrosion  damage, and then conduct the reassessment for all safety risks at the  interval the operator established. Alternatively, an operator can elect to  perform a reassessment for all safety risks (including corrosion damage)  at least every 7 years in order to comply with both the 2002 act and  PHMSA\u2019s regulations. Figure 3 provides some examples in which an  operator can meet its reassessment requirements, either through  performing (1) a confirmatory direct assessment at year 7 and a  reassessment for all safety risks at a later year that comports with the  industry consensus standards, or (2) a reassessment for all safety risks  every 7 years.", "The 7-year reassessment requirement in the Pipeline Safety  Improvement Act of 2002 as well as the reassessment intervals noted in  PHMSA\u2019s regulations and the industry consensus standards are  maximum reassessment intervals: they represent the maximum number  of years between reassessments.

Based on these calculations, corrosion should not  grow to unsafe levels before the next reassessment.

A PHMSA  official told us that given the quantity of data pipeline operators are  already required to provide to PHMSA, asking them to report  conditions as either identified during baseline assessments or  reassessments would significantly increase the reporting burden.  Also, as pipeline operators begin their second round of  reassessments, the data will not identify repairs as coming from the  first, second, or later rounds of reassessments.

As a result, it is not possible to perform the type of  analysis at the national level that pipeline operators use to determine  reassessment intervals for an individual pipeline segment. For  example, calculating a corrosion growth rate using assessment data is  one way that pipeline operators can determine the appropriate  reassessment interval for a pipeline segment. This calculation  requires information about the history, condition, environment, and the  characteristics of individual anomalies found on that individual pipeline  segment. PHMSA\u2019s assessment data do not have that level of  necessary detail, so they cannot be used to determine an appropriate  maximum reassessment interval for the entire gas transmission  pipeline system in the United States.

As we reported in 2006, ASME  developed an industry consensus standard\u2014subsequently approved by  the American National Standards Institute \u2014on maximum reassessment  intervals for all safety risks (including corrosion damage) that PHMSA  incorporated into its regulations.

The gas integrity management program is based on risk-based  management practices. For example, it requires operators to integrate  information from various sources, such as assessments, to identify the  risks specific to their pipelines. To prioritize risks for resource allocation,  the gas integrity management program focuses on high consequence  areas and required operators to assess the riskiest segments of their  pipelines first. Our past work has shown the benefits of risk-based  management, including the integrity management program. For  instance, we reported in 2006 that the integrity management program  benefits public safety by supplementing existing safety requirements with  risk-based management principles that focus on safety risks in high  consequence areas.", "However, the 7-year reassessment requirement\u2014which was established  by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and is just one  component of the gas integrity management program\u2014is not fully  consistent with risk-based management practices. For example, the 7- year reassessment requirement does not permit operators to apply the  information that they have collected from their assessments: even though  operators must determine an appropriate reassessment interval based on  the threats facing their pipelines in high consequence areas, they must  reassess those pipelines at least for corrosion threats every 7 years  regardless of the risks identified. While operators can currently use  data\u2014such as pipeline conditions and other information learned from  previous assessments\u2014to determine that more frequent assessments  than every 7 years are required (e.g., every 5 years), operators cannot  bypass the 7-year reassessment requirement if they have data that  shows reassessment intervals longer than 7 years are justified (e.g.,  every 10 years). Rather, operators that choose to establish reassessment  intervals beyond 7 years must still conduct some type of reassessment at  least every 7 years in order to comply with the 2002 act. PHMSA officials  told us that the 7-year reassessment requirement does not take into  account risk, and while it may be an appropriate interval length for some  pipeline systems, it is too short or too long for other systems.", "In contrast to these regulations, there are no statutory requirements that  limit risk-based reassessment intervals for operators of a different type of  pipeline, that of hazardous liquids.

This reassessment interval\u2014which,  unlike the gas transmission pipeline reassessment interval, was  established by a PHMSA rulemaking using a data analysis\u2014can be  extended if an operator can provide an engineering basis to do so; that is,  operators have the ability to use the information learned from prior  assessments and other efforts to identify and assess the risks facing its  pipelines and determine that a longer reassessment interval is justified.  Because the 7-year reassessment requirement for gas transmission  pipelines was established by statute and not in a PHMSA rulemaking,  PHMSA does not have the authority to modify this requirement without  congressional action.", "In 2006, we reported that most of the operators we contacted preferred  that reassessment intervals be based on the conditions and  characteristics of the pipeline segment.

According to PHMSA  officials, confirmatory direct assessment was included in the  regulations to better align with risk management principles. However,  of the 27 operators with whom we spoke, only 5 told us that they  completed or planned to conduct confirmatory direct assessment.  According to some of the operators we spoke with, confirmatory direct  assessment\u2014which looks for corrosion damage only\u2014can be just as  costly and time-consuming as performing a reassessment for all  safety risks and, therefore, the operators chose to perform a  reassessment at the 7-year mark instead. Most of the regulators we  spoke with\u2014both at the federal and state levels\u2014also noted that  operators are generally not using confirmatory direct assessment.", "PHMSA\u2019s regulations allow operators with \u2018exceptional performance\u2019  to deviate from some of the requirements of the integrity management  regulations. These operators must have completed at least two  assessments (i.e., a baseline assessment and a reassessment) and  have remediated all anomalies found in the most recent assessment.  An operator satisfying all of the exceptional performance criteria is  generally permitted to deviate from most integrity management  regulations. However, in order to comply with the 2002 act and  PHMSA\u2019s regulations, the operator must still perform a confirmatory  direct assessment at least every 7 years. None of the operators we  spoke with are pursuing the exceptional performance option, with  most indicating that because they must complete a confirmatory direct  assessment to identify corrosion problems every 7 years, this option  holds little, if any, benefit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementing Risk- Based Reassessment Intervals beyond 7 Years Could Exacerbate Current Challenges and Would Benefit from More Information on Resource Requirements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes to the 7-Year Reassessment Requirement Requires Congressional Action and Could Exacerbate Current Issues with Reviewing and Justifying Reassessment Intervals", "paragraphs": ["Although PHMSA generally agreed in the past that risk-based standards  would allow operators to better tailor reassessments to pipeline threats,  PHMSA cannot change the current 7-year reassessment requirement  unless congressional action occurs because the requirement is in statute.  The reassessment requirement is in the regulation pursuant to the  requirement in the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. In 2006, we  recommended that this statutory requirement be amended to permit  operators to reassess at intervals based on risk factors, technical data,  and engineering analyses.", "In addition to requiring a statutory change, PHMSA officials noted that a  number of current challenges could potentially be exacerbated by  implementing risk-based reassessment intervals. For instance, inspecting  and evaluating risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years could  create additional workload, staffing, and expertise challenges for  regulators, such as PHMSA and state pipeline safety offices, for example:", "PHMSA officials told us that allowing all operators to participate in  risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years could add  significantly to the agency\u2019s workload in terms of inspecting operators\u2019  integrity management programs, including review of their calculated  reassessment intervals. For instance, these evaluations could require  inspectors to spend more time and resources than currently, which  could affect the number of inspections conducted overall. Moreover,  PHMSA has already experienced some workload problems with  inspections, which could be worsened by allowing operators to use  risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years. For example, in  2012, the Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of the Inspector  General reported that PHMSA has recently accumulated a backlog of  integrity management inspections for hazardous liquid operators,  caused in part by the agency redirecting resources to fulfill other  inspection requirements. In response, beginning in 2013, the agency  will implement a new approach to inspections, called integrated  inspections, where an inspector may use data and information about  a specific operator and pipeline system to custom-build a list of  regulatory requirements to evaluate during inspection. For these  integrated inspections, integrity management requirements would be  one of several regulatory requirements inspectors could choose to  focus on. However, the Inspector General\u2019s report noted that  PHMSA\u2019s proposed schedule to implement a number of  enhancements to its inspection program is ambitious and challenging,  and until PHMSA successfully completes the transition, the agency  may not be able to ensure sufficient and consistent oversight of all  integrity management programs.", "Officials from state pipeline safety offices we met with noted potential  concerns with staffing and training to effectively evaluate risk-based  reassessment intervals. For example, some state pipeline safety  officials suggested that they would need dedicated staff to evaluate  operators\u2019 results and analyses, while other state officials cited the  current difficulty with enrolling in PHMSA training courses due to long  waiting lists. Also, some operators we interviewed expressed concern  that inspectors from state pipeline safety offices may lack sufficient  training to review these analyses. For example, although state officials  currently inspect operators\u2019 integrity management programs, some  operators told us that inspectors do not typically challenge their  reassessment interval calculations.", "Regulating risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years could  be particularly challenging for PHMSA and state pipeline safety offices  because there is a lack of guidance for operators to perform risk  modeling. As a result, operators could use a variety of methodologies  to calculate appropriate reassessment intervals for pipeline systems  and even individual segments. The level of detail and review required  by regulators overseeing these operators would vary depending on  the sophistication of the operators\u2019 analyses.", "While current regulations require operators to use engineering and risk  analyses to determine the frequency at which reassessments must be  conducted, operators could face additional challenges in justifying and  calculating risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years. Some  operators told us that risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years  would likely be more labor-intensive and data-driven than the current  regulatory environment. For example, operators would likely have to  provide PHMSA more analyses to justify their calculated reassessment  intervals than currently. Based on our interviews, operators appear to  vary in the extent to which they currently calculate reassessment intervals  and use the results of the data analyses, for example:", "Some operators we spoke with told us that they perform a less  rigorous determination of their reassessment intervals and default to  the 7-year interval if they determine that there are no problems with  their pipelines. Also, one operator told us that unless evidence of  corrosion is found on the pipeline segment, the operator does not  perform a comprehensive calculation of the reassessment interval.", "Some operators we spoke with calculated reassessment intervals  resulting in 7 years, but still chose to reassess their pipelines more  frequently than their calculations due to identified conditions such as  pipeline coating issues. While such a decision prioritizes the safety of  the pipeline, it also illustrates some of the potential subjectivity  involved with reassessment interval calculations, which may have  accounted for such conditions, but did not ultimately determine a  shorter interval in the analysis. For example, some PHMSA officials  told us that oftentimes there is more than one correct conclusion  based on pipeline data and some operators will choose a more  conservative approach than others and vice versa. Further, some  technical experts told us that risk-based reassessment intervals would  require a higher level of skill and analysis beyond some operators\u2019  current capabilities, thus forcing the operator to seek the assistance of  contractors.", "As a result, the challenges operators currently have with justifying and  calculating reassessment intervals, partly because of a lack of guidance  from PHMSA, could be further affected if operators are to use these types  of analyses to justify risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years.  Without guidance for operators to use in determining and calculating  reassessment intervals, operators may use a range of approaches for  determining the relevant risks to their systems, which could then create  potential challenges for regulators with reviewing risk-based  reassessment intervals beyond 7 years and ensuring oversight of these  pipelines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PHMSA Has Previously Considered an Approach to Implementing Risk- Based Reassessment Intervals beyond 7 Years, but More Information on Resource Requirements Is Needed", "paragraphs": ["In 2008, PHMSA provided a detailed statement at the request of  Congress to explain how the agency would establish and enforce risk- based criteria for extending the 7-year reassessment interval.

As shown in table 1,  one potential criterion could require some operators to conduct  assessments using in-line inspection or hydrostatic testing (see  appendix II for a longer list of draft criteria provided by PHMSA).", "Third, PHMSA would review all the notifications to determine whether   For example, operators would  the criteria in the rule have been met.need to demonstrate through analyses and documentation that their  pipeline segments meet each criterion or provide substantial  justification that any failure to meet a criterion does not increase the  risk of corrosion in the segment. PHMSA would also consider in its  review the specific location of the pipeline segments, the potential  consequences if an accident were to occur at that location, and the  compliance and overall performance history of the operator.", "PHMSA officials expected that operators of some types of pipelines would  be more likely to use risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years  than others. For example, PHMSA cited operators that have  demonstrated that their pipe is sound and that their engineering and risk  analysis do not indicate the likelihood of time-dependent integrity  problems occurring during a reassessment interval beyond 7 years.  Although operators support the idea of using risk-based reassessment  intervals beyond 7 years, it is not clear how many operators would be  able to meet the potential criteria established by PHMSA, and PHMSA  officials could not estimate the number either. For example, not all  operators can conduct assessments using in-line inspection or hydrostatic  testing, which is one of PHMSA\u2019s proposed criteria for using risk-based  reassessment intervals. According to the proposal, operators would have  to meet each of the criteria. As a result, the mileage of pipelines that  would be affected by allowing risk-based reassessment intervals beyond  7 years is currently unknown.", "In light of the uncertain potential effect on resources and expertise for  both regulators and operators, an effort to implement risk-based  reassessment intervals beyond 7 years may benefit first from PHMSA  obtaining additional information regarding the resource requirements  needed prior to a rule change, such as how the Office of Pipeline Safety  initially established integrity management regulations. For example, the  Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996 directed the  Office of Pipeline Safety to establish a demonstration program to test a  risk management approach to pipeline safety. Under the program  envisioned by the legislation, the Secretary sought voluntary participation  by interstate natural gas and hazardous liquid transmission operators in  good standing to demonstrate company-specific risk management plans.  The Secretary then completed a rulemaking that outlined the  demonstration plan\u2019s elements and provided opportunities for full public  participation in the process. As a result, partly on the basis of the  agency\u2019s experience with the risk management demonstration program,  the agency moved forward with a new regulatory approach, known as  integrity management. Similarly, as noted above, PHMSA produced a  report at the request of Congress explaining how the agency would  establish and enforce risk-based criteria for extending the 7-year  reassessment interval. In effect, efforts such as these allowed the agency  to obtain preliminary results and information on the proposed rule such as  the potential benefits and impacts under a variety of conditions before  making a change."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Gas transmission pipeline assessments and reassessments have  resulted in critical repairs being made. While the 7-year reassessment  requirement has provided a safeguard by helping to identify these  problems before they cause leaks or ruptures, the prescriptive 7-year  reassessment requirement is not fully consistent with the characteristics  of risk-based management promoted by the Pipeline Safety Improvement  Act of 2002. PHMSA has generally agreed that risk-based reassessment  intervals would allow operators to better tailor reassessments to pipeline  threats and operators support this concept. Risk-based reassessment  intervals beyond 7 years would allow operators to use the information  they have collected about their pipeline systems to focus resources on  areas of greatest importance.", "PHMSA drafted a process to establish and enforce risk-based criteria for  the potential use of risk-based reassessment intervals in 2008. While this  process would be more consistent with risk management practices,  permitting operators to use risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7  years would not be without challenges, even if justified using an  engineering basis. First, Congress would have to amend the statutory  requirement mandating the 7-year reassessment interval. In 2006, we  recommended that this statutory requirement be amended to permit  operators to reassess at intervals based on risk factors, technical data,  and engineering analyses. If Congress were to amend the statute, both  federal and state regulators as well as operators anticipate that  overseeing and determining risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7  years may create workload, staffing, and expertise challenges over what  is currently required. Further, there is a lack of guidance to assist  regulators and operators in developing the risk models currently used to  calculate reassessment intervals. Without such guidance, operators could  use a range of approaches for determining the relevant risk to gas  transmission pipelines, potentially creating challenges with reviewing and  justifying reassessment intervals.", "Given these potential challenges, more information might help decision- makers better understand the resource requirements needed in allowing  risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years. In this context,  conducting a study or developing a legislative proposal for a pilot  program, in consultation with Congress, to examine the impact on  regulators and operators from the use of risk-based reassessment  intervals beyond 7 years could help stakeholders\u2014including regulators,  operators, and decision-makers\u2014determine the resource demands of  inspecting and evaluating these efforts. A full evaluation of the challenges  to implementing risk-based reassessment intervals beyond 7 years and  their associated resource requirements could help to identify the most  prudent and effective way to implement risk-based reassessment  intervals. Such an evaluation could help to ensure that the challenges  regulators and operators claim they may face from this change would not  negatively affect safety. Further, a study\u2014similar to the 2008 report  PHMSA prepared at the request of Congress and incorporating lessons  learned since publication of that report\u2014or a legislative proposal for a  pilot program\u2014similar to the one used in developing the integrity  management program\u2014could allow regulators to develop guidance on  calculating risk-based reassessment intervals as well as determine the  impact of these reassessment intervals.

We  analyzed the data reported to PHMSA by pipeline operators on, among  other things, age and operating pressure of transmission pipelines;  pipeline miles assessed; tools used to conduct assessments; immediate  and scheduled conditions found during assessments and subsequently  repaired; and incidents, leaks, and failures on gas transmission pipelines  in high consequence areas.", "We used two PHMSA data sources in our data analysis: the Gas Integrity  Management Semi-Annual Performance Measures Reports from 2004  through 2009 and the Annual Reports on Natural and Other Gas  Transmission and Gathering Pipeline Systems from 2010 and 2011. From  2004 to 2009, PHMSA collected information on miles assessed, incidents,  leaks, and failures in high consequence areas using the Gas Integrity  Management Semi-Annual Performance Measures Report. Through this  report, PHMSA collected data on baseline assessments and started  collecting data on reassessments in 2008. In 2010, PHMSA discontinued  the Gas Integrity Management Semi-Annual Performance Measures  Report and merged it with the Annual Report on Natural and Other Gas  Transmission and Gathering Pipeline Systems. The updated Annual  Report on Natural and Other Gas Transmission and Gathering Pipeline  Systems added questions on pipeline miles that were baseline assessed  and reassessed; tools used to conduct assessments; conditions identified  and repaired as a result of assessments; and incidents, leaks, and  failures in high consequence areas. One important change in the updated  Annual Report was PHMSA\u2019s new approach to documenting conditions  and repairs identified by baseline assessments and reassessments. Prior  to 2010, pipeline operators reported the number of repairs made on  pipelines to fix problematic conditions identified by the assessments\u2014a  single repair could mitigate multiple problems. For 2010 and later,  pipeline operators were required to report the number of repaired  conditions. Since operators have to report the actual number of problems  found and repaired, PHMSA expected the number of reported repairs to  spike. Due to this reporting change, we cannot compare repair data from  2004 to 2009 to repair data reported in 2010 and later. To assess the  reliability of PHMSA\u2019s gas transmission pipeline data, we spoke with  agency officials about data quality control procedures and reviewed  relevant documentation. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report, specifically to provide background  information and to describe repairs made in high consequence areas. To  ensure the accuracy of our data analysis, we internally reviewed our  calculations and shared preliminary results with PHMSA to ensure that  we analyzed its data appropriately.", "To determine the impact of the 7-year reassessment requirement on  regulators and operators, we reviewed relevant legislation and PHMSA  regulations on integrity management. We also interviewed federal and  state regulators, industry associations, gas transmission pipeline  operators, pipeline safety advocacy and environmental groups, research  firms, a state regulatory association, and technical experts. We selected  27 pipeline operators to interview based on our review of PHMSA data,  specifically looking for pipeline operators with gas transmission pipeline  miles in high consequence areas. We then divided pipeline operators into  six groups based on their mileage in high consequence areas and  whether they had conducted reassessments. We chose 3 to 5 operators  from each of the six groups, with the goal of ensuring diversity across  these and several other characteristics, including the number of recent  incidents caused by corrosion and their geographic location. The  information obtained in these interviews is not generalizable to the entire  population of pipeline operators. We also selected a non-generalizable  sample of eight state pipeline safety offices using PHMSA data to, for  example, identify states with relatively high pipeline mileage while also  achieving geographic diversity. Five of the states we spoke with serve as  interstate agents for PHMSA. To learn about the operations of a gas  transmission pipeline and the logistics of conducting an assessment, we  made two site visits to view a pipeline under construction in Manassas,  Virginia, and to view an in-line inspection tool being used on a pipeline in  Rockville, Maryland.", "To determine the potential challenges of implementing risk-based  reassessment intervals beyond 7 years, we reviewed PHMSA  documents.

We collected  additional data from three pipeline operators on their experiences in  calculating reassessment intervals and conducting reassessments. We  selected these three pipeline operators by using PHMSA data to identify  gas transmission pipeline operators with different ranges of mileage in  high consequence areas.
