DOD viewed this round as a unique opportunity to reshape its installations, realign forces to meet its needs for the next 20 years, and achieve savings. To realize savings, DOD must first invest billions of dollars in facility construction, renovation, and other up-front expenses to implement the BRAC recommendations. However, recent increases in estimated cost have become a concern to some members of Congress. Under the Comptroller General's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative, GAO (1) compared the BRAC Commission's cost and savings estimates to DOD's current estimates, (2) assessed potential for change in DOD's current estimates, and (3) identified broad implementation challenges. GAO compared the BRAC Commission's estimates, which were the closest estimates available associated with final BRAC recommendations, to DOD's current estimates. GAO also visited 25 installations and major commands, and interviewed DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since the BRAC Commission issued its cost and savings estimates in 2005, DOD plans to spend more and save less, and it will take longer than expected to recoup up-front costs. Compared to the BRAC Commission's estimates, DOD's cost estimates to implement BRAC recommendations increased from $21 billion to $31 billion (48 percent), and net annual recurring savings estimates decreased from $4.2 billion to $4 billion (5 percent). DOD's one-time cost estimates to implement over 30 of the 182 recommendations have increased more than $50 million each over the BRAC Commission's estimates, and DOD's cost estimates to complete 6 of these recommendations have increased by more than $500 million each. Moreover, GAO's analysis of DOD's current estimates shows that it will take until 2017 for DOD to recoup up-front costs to implement BRAC 2005--4 years longer than the BRAC Commission's estimates show. Similarly, the BRAC Commission estimated that BRAC 2005 implementation would save DOD about $36 billion over a 20-year period ending in 2025, whereas our analysis shows that BRAC implementation is now expected to save about 58 percent less, or about $15 billion. DOD's estimates to implement BRAC recommendations are likely to change further due to uncertainties surrounding implementation details and potential increases in military construction and environmental cleanup costs. Moreover, DOD may have overestimated annual recurring savings by about 46 percent or $1.85 billion. DOD's estimated annual recurring savings of about $4 billion includes $2.17 billion in eliminated overhead expenses, which will free up funds that DOD can then use for other priorities, but it also includes $1.85 billion in military personnel entitlements, such as salaries, for personnel DOD plans to transfer to other locations. While DOD disagrees, GAO does not believe transferring personnel produces tangible dollar savings since these personnel will continue to receive salaries and benefits. Because DOD's BRAC budget does not explain the difference between savings attributable to military personnel entitlements and savings that will make funds available for other uses, DOD is generating a false sense that all of its reported savings could be used to fund other defense priorities. DOD has made progress in planning for BRAC 2005 implementation, but several complex challenges to the implementation of those plans increase the risk that DOD might not meet the statutory September 2011 deadline. DOD faces a number of challenges to synchronize the realignment of over 123,000 personnel with the completion of over $21 billion in new construction or renovation projects by 2011. For example, the time frames for completing many BRAC recommendations are so closely sequenced and scheduled to be completed in 2011 that any significant changes in personnel movement schedules or construction delays could jeopardize DOD's ability to meet the statutory 2011 deadline. Additionally, BRAC 2005, unlike prior BRAC rounds, included more joint recommendations involving more than one military component, thus creating challenges in achieving unity of effort among the services and defense agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In a 2001 testimony before Congress, the Secretary of Defense stated that another BRAC  round would generate recurring savings the department could use for other higher-priority  defense programs.", "About 15,000 of these soldiers are included in the 123,000 personnel mentioned above.

Consequently, when evaluating DOD\u2019s candidate  BRAC recommendations, the BRAC Commission focused not only on  costs and savings but also on DOD\u2019s future force structure, the ongoing  conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and military transformation. In addition,  both DOD and the BRAC Commission reported that their primary  consideration in making recommendations for the 2005 round was military  value. To realize savings from BRAC, DOD must first invest billions of  dollars in facility construction, renovation, and other up-front expenses to  implement the BRAC recommendations.

These reports have identified complex challenges to  implementing recommendations from this BRAC round, including  retraining personnel to new missions, completing many construction  projects in a compressed time frame, and synchronizing personnel  movements with planned infrastructure improvements. We also reported  that Congress does not have full visibility over the total expected cost of  DOD\u2019s BRAC-related environmental cleanup efforts, several Air National  Guard recommendations are expected to result in annual costs instead of  annual savings, and DOD\u2019s cost estimates for implementing  recommendations related to the Army\u2019s reserve components have  increased while savings estimates have decreased. A listing of our   related products is at the end of this report.", "As with most of our BRAC-related work, we initiated this review under the  authority of the Comptroller General to conduct evaluations on his own  initiative and are reporting the results of our evaluation to you because of  your oversight role of DOD\u2019s infrastructure and the BRAC program. We are  also reporting the results of our work as a result of direction by the House  Armed Services Committee to report annually on DOD\u2019s implementation  of BRAC 2005. Our objectives are to (1) compare cost and savings  estimates in the BRAC Commission\u2019s report to DOD\u2019s current cost and  savings estimates, (2) assess the potential for further change in DOD\u2019s  estimated costs and savings related to implementing BRAC 2005  recommendations, and (3) identify broad challenges that could affect the  implementation of these recommendations and DOD\u2019s ability to meet the  statutory 6-year completion period.", "To address these objectives, we interviewed officials in the Office of the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment and  associated BRAC implementation offices in the Army, Navy, and Air Force.  To analyze BRAC cost and savings estimates, we compared the change in  these estimates using mostly information in two publicly available  documents\u2014the BRAC Commission\u2019s report to the President dated  September 2005 and DOD\u2019s latest BRAC budget submission to Congress  dated February 2007\u2014because they provided the most authoritative  financial information publicly available. Also, we compared the BRAC  Commission\u2019s estimates, which were the closest estimates available  associated with final BRAC recommendations, to DOD\u2019s current budgeted  estimates. To analyze net annual recurring savings estimates, we used  OSD\u2019s savings data for fiscal year 2012\u2014the fiscal year after DOD expects  to complete all BRAC recommendations\u2014because it more fully captured  the expected savings and allowed us to replicate the same methodology  used by the BRAC Commission in its calculation of this estimate. We  generally reported costs and savings in current dollars and not constant  dollars except where noted. Given the unprecedented number of BRAC  2005 closures and realignments, we focused our analysis on broad issues  affecting DOD\u2019s cost and savings estimates and implementation challenges  rather than on specific implementation issues of individual  recommendations. In addition, we visited 17 installations and 8 major  commands affected by some of the more costly BRAC realignments or  closures to obtain the perspective of officials directly involved in BRAC  implementation planning and execution. Overall, we determined that the  data to support our objectives were sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of making broad comparisons between the BRAC Commission and DOD\u2019s  cost and savings estimates and identifying implementation challenges.", "We conducted our work from November 2005, when the BRAC  recommendations became effective, through October 2007, so we could  analyze data in DOD\u2019s BRAC budget submission provided to Congress in  February 2007. Our work was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Further details on our scope and  methodology are described in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD has undergone four BRAC rounds since 1988 and is currently  implementing its fifth round. For the most recent BRAC round\u2014referred  to in this report as the BRAC 2005 round\u2014DOD applied legally mandated  selection criteria that included four criteria related to military value as  well as other criteria regarding costs and savings, economic impact to  local communities, community support infrastructure, and environmental  impact, as shown in figure 1.", "In applying these BRAC 2005 selection criteria, priority consideration was  given to military value. In fact, as required by BRAC legislation, military  value was the primary consideration for making BRAC recommendations,  as reported by both DOD and the BRAC Commission. DOD also  incorporated into its analytical process several key considerations  required by BRAC legislation, including the use of certified data and  basing its analysis on its 20-year force structure plan. In commenting on  DOD\u2019s BRAC process in July 2005, we reported that DOD established and  generally followed a logical and reasoned process for formulating its list of  BRAC recommendations. Using this analytical process, the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) provided over 200 BRAC recommendations to  the BRAC Commission for an independent assessment in May 2005.   The BRAC Commission had the authority to change the Secretary\u2019s  recommendations if it determined that the Secretary deviated substantially  from the legally mandated selection criteria and DOD\u2019s force structure  plan. After assessing OSD\u2019s recommendations, the BRAC Commission  stated that it rejected 13 recommendations in their entirety and  significantly modified another 13. Ultimately, the BRAC Commission  forwarded a list of 182 recommendations for base closure or realignment  to the President for approval. The BRAC Commission\u2019s recommendations  were accepted in their entirety by the President and Congress and became  effective November 9, 2005. The BRAC legislation requires DOD to  complete recommendations for closing or realigning bases made in the  BRAC 2005 round within a 6-year time frame ending September 15, 2011,  6 years from the date the President submitted to Congress his approval of  the recommendations.", "To provide a framework for promoting consistency in estimating the costs  and savings associated with various proposed BRAC recommendations,  DOD used an estimation model, known as the Cost of Base Realignment  Actions (COBRA). The COBRA model has been used in the base closure  process since 1988. It provided important financial information to the  selection process as decision makers weighed the financial implications  for various BRAC actions along with military value and other selection  criteria when arriving at final decisions regarding the suitability of BRAC  recommendations. In addition, the department designed the model to  calculate estimated costs and savings associated with actions that are  necessary to implement BRAC recommendations over the 6-year  implementation period and to calculate recurring costs or savings  thereafter. As such, the BRAC Commission continued to use DOD\u2019s  COBRA model for making its cost and savings estimates.", "The COBRA model relies to a large extent on standard factors and  averages but is not intended to\u2014and consequently does not\u2014represent  budget-quality estimates. As a result, neither DOD\u2019s or the BRAC  Commission\u2019s COBRA-generated estimates can be assumed to represent  the actual completion costs that Congress will need to fund through  appropriations or fully reflect the savings to be achieved after  implementation. We have examined COBRA in the past and have found it  to be a generally reasonable estimator for comparing potential costs and  savings among candidate alternatives but have not considered it a tool for  use in budgeting. In the intervening years, COBRA has been revised to  address certain problems we and others have identified after each round.  As with any model, the quality of the output is dependent on the quality of  the input. For example, a DOD analyst could assume a building could be  renovated to accommodate receiving personnel; however, when BRAC  implementation began, site surveys showed that the building could not be  renovated, thus requiring new construction that increased estimated costs.", "The model provides a standard quantitative approach to comparing  estimated costs and savings across various proposed recommendations.   In this and previous BRAC rounds, DOD subsequently developed budget- quality estimates once BRAC recommendations became effective. Thus,  the BRAC Commission\u2019s estimated implementation costs and savings were  useful for comparing candidate recommendations and DOD has  subsequently refined these estimates based on better information after  conducting site surveys.", "BRAC legislation requires DOD to submit an annual schedule containing  revised BRAC cost and savings estimates for each closure and realignment  recommendation to Congress. To meet this legislative requirement, DOD  presents its schedule in its annual BRAC budget submission to Congress.  For BRAC 2005 recommendations, DOD\u2019s first presentation of its cost and  savings schedule was in its fiscal year 2007 budget submission to Congress  in March 2006. However, the department stated in its submission that it did  not have enough time to formulate a reasonable BRAC budget and that the  fiscal year 2007 BRAC budget submission contained significant funding  shortfalls. DOD\u2019s second presentation of its cost and savings schedule was  its fiscal year 2008 BRAC budget submission to Congress in February 2007.", "For the BRAC 2005 round, the OSD BRAC Office\u2014under the oversight of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics\u2014has monitored the services\u2019 and defense agencies\u2019  implementation progress, analyzed budget justifications for significant  differences in cost and savings estimates, and facilitated the resolution of  any challenges that may impair the successful implementation of the  recommendations within the 6-year completion period. To facilitate its  oversight role, OSD required the military departments and certain defense  agencies to submit a detailed business plan for each of their  recommendations. These business plans include information such as a  listing of all actions needed to implement each recommendation,  schedules for personnel movements between installations, updated cost  and savings estimates based on better and updated information, and  implementation completion time frames. OSD\u2019s general process for  reviewing business plans is shown in figure 2.", "OSD BRAC officials consider their business plans to be living documents  that will evolve over the course of the 6-year implementation period.

Similarly, whereas the BRAC Commission  estimated that the implementation of the BRAC 2005 recommendations  would save DOD about $36 billion over a 20-year period ending in 2025,  BRAC implementation is now expected to save about $15 billion, a  decrease of 58 percent."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Plans to Spend More and Save Less Than Originally Estimated", "paragraphs": ["Since the BRAC Commission issued its cost and savings projections in  2005, cost estimates to implement the BRAC 2005 recommendations have  increased from $21 billion to $31 billion (48 percent) compared to the  BRAC Commission\u2019s reported estimates and net annual recurring savings  estimates have decreased from $4.2 billion to $4 billion (5 percent)  compared to the BRAC Commission\u2019s reported estimates as shown in   table 1.", "A comparison of the BRAC Commission\u2019s reported projections with DOD\u2019s  data shows that estimated implementation costs have increased by   $10.1 billion or 48 percent and estimated net annual recurring savings have  decreased by $212 million or 5 percent. However, another way to compare  expected BRAC costs and saving is by omitting the effects of inflation.   We found that using the same constant dollar basis as used by the BRAC  Commission\u2014meaning inflation is not considered\u2014DOD\u2019s estimated one- time costs to implement BRAC increased to about $28.6 billion or   36 percent in constant dollars and estimated net annual recurring savings  decreased to about $3.4 billion or 20 percent in constant dollars compared  to the BRAC Commission\u2019s reported estimates.", "We found that estimated military construction costs accounted for about  64 percent of the increase in expected BRAC one-time costs. Specifically,  the BRAC Commission estimated that to implement the BRAC  recommendations, military construction costs would be about $13 billion,  whereas DOD\u2019s current estimates for military construction, without  inflation, were about $20 billion. We estimated that inflation accounted for  about 25 percent, or about $2.6 billion of the increase in expected one-time  costs. This mostly occurred because the BRAC Commission presented its  estimates using constant fiscal year 2005 dollars, which does not include  the effects of projected inflation, whereas DOD\u2019s budgeted estimates were  presented in current (inflated) dollars because budget requests take into  consideration projected inflation. Further, the BRAC Commission  estimates did not include projected environmental cleanup costs for  BRAC-affected bases, which is a consistent practice with past BRAC  rounds because DOD is required to perform needed environmental  cleanup on its property whether a base is closed, realigned, or remains  open. Environmental cleanup added about 6 percent, or about $590 million  in expected costs. Finally, other projected expenses such as operation and  maintenance accounted for about 5 percent or about $500 million of the  increase in expected costs. Because the BRAC Commission\u2019s data do not  include some specific budget categories that are used in the DOD BRAC  budget, we could not make direct comparisons and precisely identify all  estimated cost and savings changes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Estimated One-time Costs Have Increased", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis shows that estimated one-time costs to implement 33 BRAC  recommendations, representing nearly 1/5 of all the BRAC  recommendations for this round, increased by more than $50 million each  compared to the BRAC Commission\u2019s estimates. (See app. II for a listing of  these recommendations.) DOD\u2019s expected costs to implement 6 of these  recommendations increased by a total of about $4 billion. Specifically, we  found about:    $970 million increase in the estimated costs of consolidating various  leased locations and closing other locations of the National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, largely because the agency  identified the need for additional supporting facilities, such as a  technology center and additional warehouse space, as well as increased  costs for information technology and furnishings to outfit the new  buildings. According to OSD\u2019s business plan, the COBRA analysis of  specific costs and the number of personnel to realign were classified;    $700 million increase in the estimated costs of realigning Walter Reed  Army Medical Center, D.C., and relocating medical care functions to the  National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, and Fort Belvoir,  Virginia, largely because planning officials identified the need for  additional space and supporting facilities at the receiving installations   that increased estimated military construction costs by almost   $440 million. Most of these estimated cost increases are expected to occur  at the National Naval Medical Center, Maryland, because of increased  requirements to renovate existing facilities, such as the medical center.  Additionally, several other facilities, such as a parking structure and a  larger than-initially-expected addition to the medical center, increased the  construction cost estimates as well;    $680 million increase in the estimated costs of relocating the Army\u2019s armor  center and school from Fort Knox, Kentucky, to Fort Benning, Georgia, to  support the creation of a new maneuver school, largely because the Army  identified the need for about $400 million in construction of several facility  projects, such as training ranges, instructional facilities, barracks, medical  facilities, and a child development center that were not in the initial  estimates. Also, the Army identified the need for about $280 million more  in infrastructure support, such as water, sewer, and gas lines, as well as  roads to support the new maneuver school at Fort Benning;    $680 million increase in the estimated costs of closing Fort Monmouth,  New Jersey, largely because of increases in expected military construction  costs, such as $375 million at Aberdeen Proving Ground, which is to  receive many of the missions from the planned closure of Fort Monmouth  and for additional facilities, such as a communications equipment building  and an instructional auditorium. Also, the Army identified the need for  additional infrastructure improvements at Aberdeen such as utilities,  roads, and information technology upgrades. The Army determined that its  military construction estimates would increase because the existing  facilities at Aberdeen could not accommodate an increase in size of   Fort Monmouth\u2019s Command, Control, Communications, Computers,  Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance mission as originally  estimated. Moreover, military construction costs to relocate the U.S. Army  Military Academy Preparatory School from Fort Monmouth to West Point,  New York, increased about $175 million largely because the scope of the  facility construction increased from approximately 80,000 square feet to  more than 250,000 square feet and planning officials identified the need to  spend about $40 million to prepare the site for construction, particularly  for rock removal, given the terrain at West Point. Also, DOD\u2019s cost  estimates for environmental cleanup at Fort Monmouth have increased by  more than $60 million;    $600 million increase in the estimated costs of co-locating miscellaneous  OSD, defense agency, and field activity-leased locations to Fort Belvoir  and Fort Lee, Virginia, largely due to increases in military construction  cost due to the identification of various required facilities at the receiving  installations not included in the original estimate. For example,  construction costs increased because it was determined a structured  parking garage costing about $160 million would be needed to  accommodate the increase in personnel with parking needs compared to  the original nearly $3 million estimate for a flat surface parking lot. An  additional estimated cost increase of nearly $50 million is needed to cover  the costs for a heating and cooling plant and various safety and  antiterrorism protection features. Estimated costs also increased by more  than $160 million to implement this recommendation for increased  information technology needs; and    $550 million increase in the estimated costs of establishing the   San Antonio Regional Medical Center and realigning enlisted medical  training to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, largely because planning officials  identified additional requirements to move medical inpatient care  functions from Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base,  Texas to Fort Sam Houston, including operating rooms and laboratory  facilities not included in the original estimate. Additionally, requirements  for more instructional and laboratory space increased to accommodate an  increase in the number of students expected to receive medical training at  Fort Sam Houston. Based on the services conducting additional analysis  and using other planning assumptions, the number of students now  expected to arrive at Fort Sam Houston for medical enlisted training  increased by more than 2,700 (44 percent)\u2014from about 6,270 students to  approximately 9,000 students.", "BRAC implementing officials told us that information gained from site  visits, such as better information on the actual condition and availability of  certain facilities, was a key factor as to why the department\u2019s estimates  changed from the BRAC Commission\u2019s estimates. For example, DOD\u2019s  estimated cost increased over earlier projections as a result of better data  becoming available on the realignment of the Army Forces Command  headquarters due to the closure of Fort McPherson, Georgia. These data  showed the Command realigned to Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base,  North Carolina would be located in over 20 different buildings. The Army  decided, therefore, to preserve existing operational efficiencies by keeping  the entire Command intact in one location, as it is now at Fort McPherson,  by building a new facility at Fort Bragg although this plan led to the  increase in expected costs to implement the recommendation.", "Moreover, data for some recommendations changed as certain  requirements became better defined over time. For example, personnel  requirements related to the recommendation to activate a brigade combat  team and its associated headquarters unit at Fort Hood, Texas, and then  relocate it to Fort Carson, Colorado, became better defined after the  BRAC Commission made its estimates. During the BRAC decision-making  process in 2005, the Army planned its facility requirement on about   3,200 soldiers per brigade combat team but subsequently increased the  personnel requirement to 3,900 soldiers per brigade combat team as it  budgeted for needed facilities in formulating the fiscal year 2008 BRAC  budget submission. Likewise, the personnel requirement in providing  facilities for an associated headquarters unit increased from 300 soldiers in  the initial analysis to 900, thus increasing the expected costs. Thus, the  number of personnel to be accommodated at Fort Carson in order to  implement this BRAC recommendation increased by 37 percent from what  was initially expected, which in turn increased the size of the facilities  necessary to house the additional soldiers expected to arrive at Fort  Carson, leading to an increase in expected cost to implement this  recommendation.", "As in all previous BRAC rounds, the BRAC Commission used DOD\u2019s  COBRA model to generate its estimates. Both we and the BRAC  Commission acknowledged in our respective BRAC 2005 reports that the  COBRA model, while valuable as a comparative tool, does not provide  estimates that DOD is expected to use in formulating the BRAC budget  and against which Congress will appropriate funds. We have stated that  COBRA does not necessarily reflect with a high degree of precision the  actual costs or savings that are ultimately associated with BRAC  implementation. We have also stated that the services are expected to  refine COBRA estimates following the BRAC decision-making process to  better reflect expected costs and savings using site-specific information.  While COBRA estimates do not reflect the actual costs and savings  ultimately attributable to BRAC, we have recognized in the past and  continue to believe that COBRA is a reasonably effective tool for the  purpose for which it was designed\u2014to aid in BRAC decision making\u2014and  that the BRAC Commission\u2019s COBRA-generated estimates are the only  reasonable baseline to use to identify BRAC cost and savings changes  since the recommendations became effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Savings Estimates Have Decreased", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis shows that estimated net annual recurring savings to  implement 13 BRAC recommendations decreased by more than   $25 million each compared to the BRAC Commission\u2019s estimates.

The BRAC  Commission estimated that BRAC 2005 would result in net annual  recurring savings of $4.2 billion beginning in fiscal year 2012; however, we  calculated that the net annual recurring savings have decreased to   $4 billion (5 percent). DOD attributed the decrease in its savings estimate  primarily to changes in initial assumptions or plans. We identified several  BRAC recommendations for which savings estimates decreased compared  to the BRAC Commission\u2019s estimates. Specifically, we found about:    $90 million decrease in the estimated savings of closing various leased  locations of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and realigning  other locations to Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  Initially, officials at the National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the OSD BRAC Office explained that  fewer personnel eliminations caused some of the decrease in savings.  Additionally, the day before we released this draft for comment, an OSD  BRAC Office official explained to us that they underreported the estimated  savings from expected lease terminations in the fiscal year 2008 BRAC  budget submission. However, time did not permit us to analyze this  information.    $80 million decrease in the estimated savings of closing three chemical  demilitarization depots (Deseret Chemical Depot, Utah; Newport Chemical  Depot, Indiana; and Umatilla Chemical Depot, Oregon), largely because  the Army expects not to close these facilities within the BRAC statutory  implementation time frame because DOD must complete the chemical  demilitarization mission to comply with treaty obligations before these  facilities can close, which resulted in less expected savings;    $70 million decrease in the estimated savings of establishing joint bases at  multiple locations, largely because the Army did not include its share of  the expected savings due to unresolved issues concerning joint base  operations, whereas the other services included the COBRA-generated  savings in DOD\u2019s BRAC budget submission to Congress. OSD had not  approved the business plan for this recommendation; thus additional  information on expected savings was not available for us to review; and    $50 million savings decrease in realigning the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s  supply, storage, and distribution network, largely because of the need to  retain higher inventory levels than anticipated and less personnel  elimination."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Will Take Longer to Recoup Up-Front Costs Than the BRAC Commission Expected", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s current estimates to implement the BRAC recommendations   show that it will take until 2017 for the department to recoup its up-front  costs\u20144 years longer than the BRAC Commission\u2019s estimates indicated it  would take for DOD\u2019s up-front investments to begin to pay back.  Historically, it has taken DOD about 6\u00bd years to recoup up-front costs for  actions such as constructing new facilities, providing civilian severance  pay, or moving personnel and equipment as a result of implementing  BRAC recommendations. Our analysis of the BRAC Commission\u2019s  estimates shows that the time required to recoup such costs would be 8  years, or in 2013. However, using DOD\u2019s current estimates, our analysis  shows that the time required to recoup costs would be 12 years, or in 2017,  as shown in figure 3.", "Similarly, because DOD expects to spend more and save less compared   to the BRAC Commission\u2019s estimates, projected 20-year savings have  decreased by more than half.

Since the majority of expected BRAC costs  are for military construction, systemic increases in the cost of  construction could have a considerable effect on the total cost to  implement BRAC 2005. This change is important because DOD\u2019s estimate  of $21 billion in military construction is the single largest cost item  associated with implementing BRAC 2005 recommendations and is  unprecedented given that DOD spent less than $7 billion for military  construction in the four previous BRAC rounds combined.

While this difference  was as high as 6.1 percentage points in 2004, the difference between the  actual rate of construction inflation and the government\u2019s budgetary  inflation rate has diminished recently. USACE officials told us that if   the extent to which the actual rate of inflation continues to exceed the  budgeted rate as implementation proceeds, and if construction material  costs are higher than anticipated, they would either have to redirect  funding from other sources to provide for construction projects or resort  to a reduction in the scope of some construction projects.

USACE has developed a strategy intended to reduce  construction costs by 15 percent and reduce construction time by   30 percent. Through its transformation strategy, USACE intends to change  how it executes construction projects by    standardizing facility designs and processes,    expanding the use of premanufactured building where sections or modules  of a building are constructed and transported to a construction site to be  assembled,    executing military construction as a continuous building program rather  than a collection of individual construction projects, and    emphasizing commercial rather that government building standards,  which would allow contractors greater flexibility to use a wider variety of  construction materials to meet construction requirements.", "The Army has already incorporated a 15 percent reduction into its BRAC  construction estimates and has budgeted accordingly.

In addition, our analysis shows that the current percentage of  estimated annual recurring savings from military personnel entitlements  (46 percent) is considerably higher compared to the last round of BRAC  that took place in 1995, in which DOD derived about 5 percent of BRAC  annual recurring savings from military personnel entitlements.

Greater transparency over the assumptions behind DOD\u2019s BRAC  savings estimates would help to promote independent analysis and   review and facilitate congressional decision making related to the  multibillion-dollar BRAC implementation program.", "In addition to taking issue with how DOD characterizes military personnel  savings, we also disagree with DOD claiming savings for closing a base  that is actually going to stay open.

Though Fort Belvoir in  October 2007 announced new plans to obtain property near Fort Belvoir  that might lessen traffic congestion for the move of miscellaneous OSD,  defense agency, and field activity leased locations, Fort Belvoir officials  told us that these plans could raise new implementation challenges to  meet the statutory deadline because of additional time needed for  environmental impact studies, planning and design of new construction,  and demolition of existing structures at the new proposed site.", "Fort Sam Houston, Texas: Installation officials at Fort Sam Houston  told us that they have to synchronize numerous actions involving eight  separate BRAC recommendations and have concerns about coordinating  the availability of facilities\u2014either to be constructed or renovated\u2014with  the planned net increase of over 10,000 personnel. Furthermore, officials  told us the lack of guidance on how installation officials will establish a  joint base with nearby Lackland and Randolph Air Force Bases, Texas, in  accordance with the BRAC recommendation on joint basing exacerbates  the uncertainty in planning for the implementation of these  recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Force Structure Initiatives Further Complicate DOD\u2019s BRAC Implementation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Two Army force restructuring initiatives\u2014modularity and overseas  rebasing strategy\u2014could exacerbate the Army\u2019s BRAC synchronization  challenges. The Army considers modularity to be the most extensive  reorganization of its force since World War II, in which it restructures  itself from a division-based force to a more agile and responsive modular  brigade-based force. According to Army estimates, this initiative will  require a significant investment through fiscal year 2011. DOD\u2019s Global  Defense Posture Realignment Plan, also known as overseas rebasing, will  result in a global realignment of U.S. forces and installations, including the  planned transfer to American territory of up to 70,000 defense personnel  and about 100,000 family members and civilian employees currently living  overseas. As a result of mostly these force structure initiatives and BRAC,  the Army plans to relocate over 150,000 soldiers and civilian personnel by  fiscal year 2012, representing over 20 percent of the Army\u2019s total projected  active-duty and civilian personnel end strength. To illustrate, Army  installations that expect personnel increases of greater than 5,000 over the  next 5 years, as of March 2007, are shown in table 2.", "As shown in table 2, some installations are expecting substantial growth;  Forts Belvoir, Bliss, Riley, and Lee each anticipate net personnel gains of  more than 50 percent. For example, the Army plans to relocate at Fort  Bliss, Texas, about 18,000 personnel as part of BRAC, the transformation  of Army modular brigade units, and DOD\u2019s overseas rebasing efforts. The  Army is planning 54 new construction projects over the 6-year BRAC  implementation period to accommodate the increase in base population at  Fort Bliss.

According to our analysis, 43 percent of the 240 OSD- required business plans involved formal coordination between at least two  services or agencies. Service officials said that gaining consensus among  military services and defense agencies has been challenging in the areas of  personnel and facility requirements, implementation schedules, and  funding responsibilities. For example, officials told us it was a challenge  due to the joint nature in planning for the implementation of the  recommendation to realign Fort Bragg, North Carolina, by relocating  Army\u2019s 7th Special Forces Group to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Service  officials told us it took time for the Army and Air Force to coordinate how  to share base operations costs given these two services have different  standards for calculating these costs. Similarly, regarding the  recommendation to establish the Joint Strike Fighter initial joint training  site at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, it took time for the Navy, Marine  Corps, and Air Force to agree on cost-sharing arrangements and a joint  training curriculum designed to achieve savings from consolidated training  on the aircraft. Likewise, other complex joint cross-service  recommendations could be slowed by a similar need to coordinate and  negotiate agreements. The following are some BRAC recommendations  with unresolved coordination challenges.", "Create joint bases involving multiple defense installations: The   26 defense installations involved with creating 12 new joint bases required  DOD to define the governance structure over how these joint bases should  be organized, the associated chain of command authority, and the  operational concepts for managing these joint bases. According to  service officials, some of their most challenging issues to resolve include   1) transferring real property and budget authority to the lead service,   2) determining standard levels of base operating support and which base  functions to transfer to the lead service, 3) deciding whether civilian  personnel on a joint base will become employees of the lead service,   4) agreeing on common terminology and standards, and 5) funding  contributions from each service. These challenges to establishing joint  bases have been problematic since each service has its own concept of  how installations should be managed and organized. In particular, during  recent congressional testimony, the Air Force expressed views on joint  basing concepts contrary to those of OSD and the other services. To  overcome these challenges, OSD formed a special working group to  resolve these issues and OSD officials told us they would approve the joint  basing business plan when more of the planning details have been  resolved.", "Realign supply, storage, and distribution management at multiple  locations: There are several potential issues between the Defense  Logistics Agency and the military services that may affect the planned  implementation of the recommendation. While baseline agreements have  been reached between the Defense Logistics Agency and the services on  the transfer of supply-related personnel positions and related inventories  to the Defense Logistics Agency, some important aspects of the  implementation plans are incomplete and still need to be resolved. For  example, performance-based agreements that will establish  responsibilities, metrics to measure performance, costs, and business  rules between the Defense Logistics Agency and the services have yet to  be negotiated and agreed upon. Additionally, the funding and decision- making process for future maintenance, upgrades, usage, and integration  of information technology systems transferring to Defense Logistics  Agency has not been agreed to. Lastly, due to the way the Defense  Logistics Agency plans to implement the recommendation by staging the  personnel transfers over time by each military service, it plans to apply  lessons learned to resolve issues as implementation proceeds. We also  reviewed a separate BRAC action, which is part of this recommendation,  in more detail and issued our report in October 2007.", "Co-locate medical command headquarters: The affected agencies have  had challenges in reaching agreement on where to co-locate these medical  commands.

As such, OSD has not yet approved the  business plan for this recommendation.", "As a result of these coordination challenges, the planning process has  lengthened beyond that which DOD officials initially expected, which  could result in delayed implementation of certain recommendations.   The need for gaining consensus about planning and implementation details  among the services and defense agencies could continue throughout the  BRAC implementation period.  At the same time, DOD believes the review  process helps to ensure that BRAC actions meet the intent of the law, are  accurate, and effectively coordinated. However, if gaining consensus  among these entities continues to be a challenge or if new organizations  established under BRAC continue to lack fully developed operational  concepts and organizational structures, it may become increasingly  difficult to implement these recommendations before the statutory 2011  deadline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["DOD recognizes that its BRAC recommendations and its implementation  are of high public interest. As such, it is paramount that DOD  communicates openly about the expected savings that could result from  the implementation of BRAC actions. As long as DOD continues to assert  that nearly half of its estimated $4 billion in annual recurring BRAC  savings come from military personnel reassignments, which will not free  up funds for other defense priorities, DOD could create a false sense that  BRAC 2005 will result in a much higher dollar savings than will actually be  realized to readily fund other priorities. Without explaining the difference  between annual recurring savings attributable to military personnel  reassignments and annual recurring savings that will make funds available  for other defense priorities, DOD could lessen the credibility of the BRAC  program and decrease the public\u2019s trust in the BRAC process. Greater  transparency over the source of expected BRAC savings could help to  preserve public confidence in the integrity of the BRAC program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide more transparency over DOD\u2019s estimated annual recurring  savings from BRAC implementation, we recommend that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics, in consultation with the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller), to explain, in DOD\u2019s BRAC budget submission to  Congress, the difference between annual recurring savings attributable to  military personnel entitlements and annual recurring savings that will  readily result in funds available for other defense priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with our  recommendation and agreed to include an explanation of the annual  recurring savings in its BRAC budget justification material that  accompanies the annual President\u2019s budget. DOD also noted in its  comments to us that military personnel reductions attributable to a BRAC  recommendation as savings are as real as savings generated through end  strength reductions. DOD also stated that while it may not reduce overall  end strength, its reductions in military personnel for each  recommendation at a specific location are real and these personnel  reductions allow the department to reapply these military personnel to  support new capabilities and improve operational efficiencies. While we  recognize these benefits from reapplying freed up military personnel to  other locations due to implementing BRAC recommendations, we do  question that nearly half of DOD\u2019s annual recurring savings estimate of $4  billion includes military personnel entitlements\u2014such as salaries and  housing allowances\u2014for military personnel DOD plans to shift to other  positions but does not plan to eliminate thus requiring DOD to continue  paying the salaries and benefits. While DOD disagrees with us, we do not  believe that shifting or transferring personnel to other locations produces  tangible dollar savings outside the military personnel accounts that DOD  can use to fund other defense priorities since these personnel will  continue to receive salaries and benefits. DOD did acknowledge however,  that these savings may not be available to fund other defense priorities  because they have already been spent to fund military personnel priorities.  It is also worth noting that DOD commented that although its net annual  recurring savings estimates have decreased from $4.2 billion to $4 billion,  these savings still represent a significant benefit that will result from the  implementation of BRAC recommendations.

Recognizing that the Department of Defense (DOD) was in the process of  initial planning for base realignment and closure (BRAC) implementation,  and the associated financial data were changed frequently during our  review, we compared BRAC cost and savings estimates primarily using  two key publicly available documents\u2014the 2005 BRAC Commission report  to the President released in September 2005 and DOD\u2019s latest BRAC  budget submission provided to Congress in February 2007. We used data  from the BRAC Commission report to the President because the estimates  contained in this report were the closest estimates available associated  with the final and approved BRAC recommendations. We used DOD\u2019s  most recent BRAC budget submission because it was the most  authoritative information publicly available for making broad comparisons  of BRAC cost and savings estimates. Specifically, we compared the change  in cost estimates as well as the estimates for net annual recurring savings  that DOD expects to incur after BRAC implementation and noted those  recommendations that have increased the most in expected costs and  decreased the most in expected savings. In addition, we used the BRAC  Commission\u2019s data generated from DOD\u2019s estimation model, known as the  Cost of Base Realignment Actions, to determine changes in expected one- time costs, to include military construction cost estimates and inflation.  We generally reported costs and savings in current dollars and not  constant dollars except where noted.", "To calculate DOD\u2019s estimate of net annual recurring savings, we used  OSD\u2019s data provided to us for estimated savings in fiscal year 2012\u2014the  year after OSD expects all recommendations to be completed\u2014because  these data more fully captured these savings and allowed us to replicate  the same methodology used by the BRAC Commission in its calculation of  this estimate. We used OSD\u2019s fiscal year 2012 data and subtracted the  estimates for annual recurring costs from the estimates for annual  recurring savings, which is the same method both DOD and we have used  for prior BRAC rounds. To determine expected 20-year savings\u2014also  known as the 20-year net present value\u2014we used the same formulas and  assumptions as DOD and the BRAC Commission used to calculate these  savings. Specifically, we used DOD\u2019s BRAC fiscal year 2008 budget data  for expected costs and savings to implement each recommendation for  fiscal years 2006 through 2011. We also used data that the BRAC Office in  the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and  Environment provided us for expected net annual recurring savings after  the completion of each recommendation for fiscal years 2012 to 2025. We  then converted these data to fiscal year constant 2005 dollars using DOD  price indexes to distinguish real changes from changes due to inflation.  We used fiscal year 2005 dollars to calculate 20-year savings because the  BRAC Commission also used fiscal year 2005 dollars for this calculation.Finally, we calculated how many years it would take for expected BRAC  savings to recoup the expected initial investment costs to implement the  recommendations, comparing the fiscal years, or break-even points, when  cumulative net savings would exceed cumulative one-time costs. We did  this to be consistent with the way DOD had reported their break-even  points for past BRAC rounds, which is a methodology we also replicated in  our prior reports on BRAC implementation.", "To assess the reliability of DOD\u2019s BRAC cost and savings data, we tested  computer-generated data for errors, reviewed relevant documentation, and  discussed data quality control procedures with officials at the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) BRAC Office. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of making broad comparisons  between DOD\u2019s reported cost and savings estimates and the BRAC  Commission\u2019s reported estimates.", "To determine why DOD\u2019s estimates changed compared to the BRAC  Commission\u2019s estimates, we reviewed over 200 OSD-approved business  plans that outlined actions, time frames, and financial estimates for  implementing each BRAC recommendation. We also obtained and  analyzed information from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers about its  recent initiative to transform how it manages military construction  projects and how these new initiatives are expected to reduce military  construction costs during BRAC implementation. We did not validate the  services\u2019 or defense agencies\u2019 BRAC military construction requirements  because DOD\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, the Army Audit Agency,  the Naval Audit Service, and the Air Force Audit Agency were reviewing  BRAC military construction projects at the time of this report. Their work  in this area is expected to continue over the next several years. However,  we met with staff of these audit services periodically over the course of  our review.", "Further, we met periodically with officials at the OSD BRAC office and  corresponding BRAC implementation offices in the Army, Navy, and Air  Force to determine why DOD\u2019s estimates changed compared to the BRAC  Commission\u2019s estimates. We also met with these officials to discuss their  roles and responsibilities as they began BRAC implementation planning  and to obtain their perspectives on any implementation challenges that  they encountered. Given the unprecedented number of BRAC 2005  closures and realignments, we focused our analysis on broad issues  affecting DOD\u2019s cost and savings estimates and implementation challenges  rather than on specific implementation issues of individual  recommendations.", "To obtain the perspective of installation and command officials directly  involved in BRAC implementation planning and execution, we visited   17 bases and 8 major commands affected by BRAC.
