Thirty-two states used a definition based primarily on the number of dropouts over a 4-year period and graduates. The remaining states used other definitions. Because the cohort definition is more precise, most states not using it planned to do so when their data systems can track students over time, a capability many states do not have. Education has assisted states primarily on a case-by-case basis, but it has not provided guidance to all states on ways to account for selected students, such as for students with disabilities, thus creating less consistency among states in how graduation rates are calculated. The primary factor affecting the accuracy of graduation rates was student mobility. Students who come and go make it difficult to keep accurate records. Another factor was whether states verified student data, with fewer than half of the states conducting audits of data used to calculate graduation rates. Data inaccuracies can substantially raise or lower a school's graduation rate. Education has taken steps to help states address data accuracy issues. However, Education officials said that they could not assess state systems until they had been in place for a while. Data accuracy is critical, particularly since Education is using state data to calculate graduation rate estimates to provide consistency across states. Many interventions are used to raise graduation rates, but few are rigorously evaluated. GAO identified five that had been rigorously evaluated and showed potential for improving graduation rates, such as Project GRAD. In visits to six states, GAO visited three schools that were using such interventions. Other schools GAO visited were using interventions considered by experts and officials to show promise and focused on issues such as self esteem and literacy at various grades. Education has not acted on GAO's 2002 recommendation that it evaluate intervention research, a recommendation the agency agreed with, and has done little to disseminate such research."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About one third of students who enter high school do not graduate and  face limited job opportunities. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001  (NCLBA) was passed in part to increase the likelihood that all of the 48  million students in our nation\u2019s public school systems will graduate and  requires states to use high school graduation rates, along with test scores,  to assess how much progress high schools are making in educating their  students. Graduation rates\u2014used in conjunction with test scores\u2014provide  a more complete picture of school performance than test scores alone,  because a school\u2019s test proficiency rate will be higher if low-performing  students drop out and do not have their scores included with their peers.  Graduation rates are used as part of the determination about whether  schools meet federal requirements for school progress. If schools do not  meet such requirements, their students may be eligible to transfer to  another school or receive tutoring. Currently, the Department of  Education (Education), National Governors Association, and several  national education organizations and foundations are working on high  school reform initiatives to address issues, such as school structure and  curriculum, which may help low-performing students and increase the  likelihood of graduation. In addition, our 2002 report on high school  dropouts identified the need for better information on the success of  interventions designed to increase the likelihood of students staying in  school until they graduate.", "NCLBA defines graduation rates as the percentage of students who  graduate from high school with a regular diploma in the standard number  of years. Education\u2019s regulations do not permit states to count an  alternative degree that is not fully aligned with the state\u2019s academic  standards, such as a certificate of attendance or a General Educational  Development certificate (GED).

We analyzed the plans states were required to submit to  Education to identify the graduation rate definitions states used and  graduation rate goals set by states, reviewed updates to plans through July  2005, and letters from Education to states regarding its decisions about  state plans and updates. We also surveyed officials in 50 states, the District  of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to obtain information about the extent to  which states verify school and district data used to calculate high school  graduation rates and use unique student identifiers. We selected and  contacted 20 states for further analysis. States were selected to capture  variation in high school graduation rate definitions, geographic location,  and types of interventions with the potential to increase graduation rates.  We conducted a case study in 1 state to calculate graduation rates; site  visits in 3 states to review data accuracy; site visits in 6 states to observe  interventions and interview staff at 16 schools; and phone interviews in all  20 states to obtain information on definitions used, implementation status,  and guidance provided. To identify which interventions have the potential  to increase graduation rates, we reviewed the research on interventions  and interviewed Education officials and dropout prevention experts. We  also reviewed available evaluations of the types of interventions we  observed to assess their findings and methodological approaches. To  determine how Education assists states, we reviewed Education  regulations, guidance, and other documents and interviewed Education  and state agency officials. We also interviewed Education and state  officials to determine the degree to which Education has enhanced and  disseminated knowledge about interventions. To determine the extent to  which reported dropout rates may be understated, we interviewed experts  in this area and reviewed research on the topic. Finally, we interviewed  officials from the National Governors Association, national education  organizations, and other experts in the area of high school graduation  rates and reviewed related research to obtain an understanding of the  issues surrounding these rates and high school reform efforts to address  them.

IASA required testing in each of three grade spans to  determine whether a school made adequate yearly progress (AYP). NCLBA  requires, by the 2005-06 school year, that annual tests in math and reading  be administered to students in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school;  by 2007-08, students must also be tested in science. In order to make AYP,  schools are to show that increasing numbers of students reach the  proficient level on state tests and that every student is proficient by 2014.  NCLBA also designated specific groups of students for particular focus.  These four groups are students who (1) are economically disadvantaged,  (2) represent major racial and ethnic groups, (3) have disabilities, and (4)  are limited in English proficiency. For a school to make AYP, its student  body as a whole and each of the student groups must, at a minimum, meet  the state targets for testing proficiency.", "Under NCLBA, schools must also use at least one other academic  indicator, in addition to annual tests, to measure AYP. High schools must  use graduation rate as one of their other academic indicators. The law  defines graduation rate as the percentage of students who graduate from  secondary school with a regular diploma in the standard number of years.  Education officials told us that standard number of years is determined by  a state and is generally based on the structure of the school. For example,  a high school with grades 9 through 12 would have 4 as its standard  number of years while a school with grades 10 through 12 would have 3 as  its standard number of years.", "NCLBA regulations specifically require a high school, in order to make  AYP, to meet or exceed its other academic indicators, including what the  state has set as the graduation rate for public high schools. NCLBA does  not specify a minimum graduation rate that states must set. States have  used a variety of methods to measure AYP on their graduation rate  indicator. For example, states have set graduation rate targets or goals or  have allowed schools to show progress toward a target or goal as a way  for schools to meet the graduation rate indicator requirement. The law  does not require states to increase their graduation rate over time.", "The law requires states to demonstrate that their definitions produce  graduation rates that are valid and reliable. A valid rate would be one that  measures what it intends to measure. A reliable rate is one which, with  repeated data collections and calculations, produces the same result each  time such collections and calculations are performed. A key aspect of the  reliability of graduation rates is the quality of the data used to calculate  them. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Education\u2019s  chief statistical agency, has funded a document that describes the  following dimensions for ensuring that data are of high quality:    Accuracy.

If these  schools continue not to make AYP, they must take additional actions, such  as providing supplemental services to students\u2014including transportation,  tutoring, and training. States and school districts are required to provide  funding for such actions up to a maximum specified in law. However,  according to Education officials, most high schools do not receive Title I  funding, and therefore, if these schools do not make AYP, they are not  required to take improvement actions, such as offering school choice or  supplemental services.

An additional 18 states using other  definitions planned to adopt the cohort definition no later than the 2007-08  school year. The cohort definition compares the number of 12th grade  graduates with a standard diploma, with the number of students enrolled  as 9th graders 4 years earlier, while also taking into account those who left  the cohort, such as those who transferred in and out. A study  commissioned by NCES found that a cohort definition designed to track  individual students over time\u2014from when they enter high school until  they leave\u2014could result in a more precise high school graduation rate  than one calculated with other definitions. The data in figure 1 show a  hypothetical high school class from the time students enrolled in 9th grade  until they graduated with a standard diploma, including those who  dropped out, transferred, received alternative degrees, continued in  school, or took 5 years to graduate.", "If the school was in a state that used the cohort definition and considered  4 years to be on-time graduation, its graduation rate would be 60 percent.  The 60 percent figure comes from using the number of students who  started (100), the net number of transfers over the 4 years, and the number  who graduate in 4 years (60). Figure 2 shows the formula of the cohort  definition. The year students in the cohort graduate is denoted by \u201cy,\u201d  while \u201cT\u201d signifies the net number of students who transfer in and out in  any given year. The cohort definitions actually used by states may vary  somewhat from the basic definition. For example, Kansas used dropout  and transfer data in its definition. Additionally, some states track  individual students, while others track groups of students based on the  entering 9th grade cohort.", "According to state plans, 32 states used a definition of high school  graduation rate, referred to as the departure classification definition,  based primarily on the number of dropouts over a 4-year period and  graduates. Essentially, this definition looks back from a 12th grade class at  those who (1) graduated (regardless of when they started high school),   (2) dropped out in 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades (including those who  enrolled in GED programs) and (3) did not graduate, but received some  form of alternative completion certificate. So, using this definition, the  data from the high school shown in figure 1 would result in a graduation  rate of 65 percent. The 65 percent figure comes from using the number of  students who graduated (65), the number who received an alternative  certificate (5), and the number who dropped out (30), as shown in Figure  3. Unlike the cohort definition, this definition does not take into  consideration the number of students entering high school 4 years earlier.  As noted earlier, some of these states (13) planned to adopt the cohort  definition by school year 2007-08.", "The departure classification definition includes students who drop out.  Each of the \u201cD\u201d designations refers to the number of dropouts during one  year. For example \u201cD y-2g10\u201d stands for the number of students who  dropped out in the 10th grade.", "Prior to NCLBA, many states had been using a similar version of this  formula, which NCES developed in collaboration with several states.  However, earlier definitions used by states may have also included as  graduates those who receive GED certificates. Under NCLBA, Education  required states to modify the formula so that GED recipients were not  counted as graduates.", "Different data systems accommodated the use of different definitions. The  departure classification definition allowed many states to continue using  existing data systems, according to Education officials. Such systems  generally collect aggregate data, rather than data at the student level. The  cohort definition generally requires states to implement a state-level  student tracking system, often with a mechanism that can uniquely  identify each student. Such a system identifies students in the 9th grade  and tracks them throughout high school, indicating whether they graduate,  transfer or drop out. This system also allows for students who transfer  into a school to be placed in the proper cohort.", "The more specific information required by the cohort definition may result  in the calculation of more precise graduation rates than those produced by  the departure classification definition. Since the cohort definition follows  students entering high school, either by individual students or groups of  students, it can better be used to include only on-time graduates. However,  how it is implemented may affect the level of precision of the rate  calculated. Tracking individual students may result in a more precise rate  than tracking groups of students.", "In our analysis of one state\u2019s school year 2002-03 data, we found that the  variations in data collection and calculations between the two types of  definitions, produced different graduation rates. Our analysis showed that  the departure classification definition produced a graduation rate that was  12 percent greater than when we used the cohort definition. Because the  departure classification definition does not track the entering cohort, it  does not account for students who were held back, and therefore  differences may result. Our findings are consistent with observations made  by other researchers that show differences in graduation rates based on  the definition used. In addition, NCES plans to complete a study this year  that examines high school graduation rate definitions and how rates differ  depending on the definition used.", "According to state plans, the remaining eight states that did not use either  a departure classification or cohort definition used a variety of other  definitions.

A majority of states that allowed  progress as a way for schools to demonstrate they met state graduation  rate requirements had set no minimum rate of progress.

Table 1 shows the number of states that  allow schools to show progress toward the state goals as a means of  meeting state graduation rate requirements, for all states as of the time we  completed our review.", "By showing progress toward state graduation rate targets, schools can still  make AYP even though they do not meet target rates. For example, our  analysis of one state\u2019s data from the 2002-03 school year showed that 46  out of 444 high schools made AYP by increasing their graduation rates  toward the state graduation rate target of 66 percent rather than by  meeting or exceeding this target. Specifically, these schools met or  exceeded the state\u2019s requirement for 1 percentage point progress in  increasing the graduation rate, even though the schools were below the 66  percent target. Another 232 schools made AYP for the year by meeting or  exceeding the target of 66 percent.", "In addition, allowing schools to use progress as the NCLBA graduation  rate indicator could result in schools making AYP annually, while not  meeting state graduation rate targets for decades, if at all. For example, a  hypothetical school with a graduation rate of 56 percent can meet the state  high school graduation indicator by increasing its graduation rate by 0.1  percent each year.

However, we found that issues raised, such as students enrolled in 5-year  programs, were common to many states. States varied in how they  included students enrolled in these programs in their graduation rate  definitions.

Some inaccuracies may lead to the reporting of lower graduation  rates, such as recording all students with \u201cunknown\u201d status as dropouts or  counting students who drop out, return to school, and then drop out again  as a dropout each time, as may happen in schools in states that use the  departure classification definition. Other inaccuracies may lead to the  reporting of higher graduation rates, such as schools\u2019 recording students  who drop out as transfers. This may occur when school staff record such  students as transfers before they receive documentation that the student  actually enrolled in a different school. Since the number of dropouts  counts against a school in calculating its graduation rate in many states,  schools that record such students as transfers\u2014because they were  unaware that the students had actually dropped out\u2014may be reporting  inflated graduation rates.", "A second factor that affects data accuracy is how staff members  understand and follow policies and procedures for recording students as  transfers to other schools. For example, staff members in schools in two  states reported that they electronically record a student as having  transferred to another school on the day that student withdraws from their  schools. However, the policy in these states is that a student is to be  recorded as having transferred only upon receiving a request for records  from the school to which the student transfers. In one of these schools,  staff assigned to record student data reported contradictory practices and  beliefs about state policy regarding when to record a student as a transfer.  One staff member stated that the policy and her practice was to record the  student as a transfer upon receiving the records request while another  staff member said that no such policy existed and that she recorded the  student as a transfer on the day of withdrawal. Therefore, how a student  transferring out the school was counted depended on which staff member  recorded the student\u2019s data.", "The accuracy of data may be further compromised when schools have  large numbers of students who transfer in a given year because the more  students come and go, the more difficult it is for schools to accurately  account for them. Some schools are in areas where families tend to move  more frequently. For example, officials in one school we visited near an  Army base reported that their school had an enrollment of about 1,200  students and that 187 students had left the school by December of the  academic year. The status of 19 of those 187 students was recorded as  \u201cunknown\u201d because of difficulty in maintaining contact with these  families. The policy in that state was for students whose status is  \u201cunknown\u201d (because they could not be contacted) to be counted as  dropouts, even if, in fact, the student had transferred to another school.  Staff in another school reported the presence of several children from  another country. Their experience has been that these particular students  report plans to return to their country of origin, but they often do not  know the status of these students once they leave the school. The school\u2019s  procedure is to record such students as having an \u201cunknown\u201d status, and  these are eventually counted as dropouts, unless another school requests  their records. Research has shown higher mobility rates among certain  subgroups of students compared to all other students, including those who  are African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and those classified as  having limited English proficiency and as children from migrant families.  Consequently, schools with higher concentrations of these subgroups  would likely report less accurate graduation rates.", "Another factor affecting the accuracy of graduation rate data is the  absence of state audits or verification checks. For example, in our survey  of state officials, over half (27) reported that their states did not audit the  data received from local officials that the state used to calculate high  school graduation rates. The lack of such auditing or verification implies  that states were likely to be unaware of the extent of certain errors in  data\u2014such as students\u2019 indicating they were transferring to another  school but not actually doing so\u2014and consequently were unable to ensure  that data they received from schools and districts were accurate. Officials  in only one of the six schools we visited reported that their data on  student transfers had been audited or verified by an outside party, leaving  the accuracy of transfer data in the other schools uncertain.", "A fourth factor that contributes to challenges in assuring accurate data is  the lack of a unique identifier for each student. In our survey, officials in  22 states reported that their state did not have a unique identifier for each  of their students. Concerns about using student identifiers include the cost  of implementing data systems that support such identifiers and privacy  issues. The lack of a unique identifier for students made it difficult to  obtain accurate data. Officials in one state that did not use unique  identifiers stated that they had to compute graduation rates based on  aggregating student data and as a result, they could not track on-time  graduates. Officials in another state estimated that they were only 90  percent accurate in identifying students, because, without a unique  identifier for each student, they had to use other information. Using this  information, such as the student\u2019s name or birth date, can lead to  identifying more than one student with the same characteristics, resulting  in inaccurate data used in calculating graduation rates.", "A fifth factor we found that may affect data accuracy is variation in  security and accountability practices. For example, we found that while  some schools restricted the ability to change student enrollment  information (such as transfers) to one or two people in the building (e.g., a  registrar), others allowed many staff members to do so. Further, while  some schools\u2019 data systems kept a record of each person who accessed a  student\u2019s record and the changes made, other systems did not maintain  such information. Without sufficient security and record monitoring, there  is a greater risk of inaccurate data being entered and used to calculate  graduation rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Inaccuracies May Affect Schools\u2019 Meeting State Graduation Rate Goals", "paragraphs": ["We analyzed data from one state to estimate the effect of errors of various  sizes in reporting dropouts on school graduation rates and found that such  errors could raise or lower a school\u2019s graduation rate substantially. This  state used a high school graduation definition that incorporated the  number of graduates and dropouts in calculating its graduation rate. For  example, its median high school in school year 2002-03, with 924 students,  reported 41 dropouts and had a graduation rate of 75 percent. We re- estimated its graduation rate after assuming that the school had more  dropouts, up to twice as many more than reported. In this case, if the  school had 82 dropouts, its graduation rate fell to 64 percent. We also re- estimated its graduation rate after assuming that it had fewer dropouts, as  few as half as many dropouts as reported. Thus, if it had 21 dropouts, its  graduation rate rose to 88 percent. Figure 6 shows how the estimates of  graduation rates were affected by assumed errors in counting dropouts for  this school.", "Our analysis was performed for all high schools in the state. As expected,  when we assumed the number of dropouts was higher than what schools  reported, their estimated graduation rates decreased.", "Our analysis also found the extent to which schools miscount their  dropouts affects their likelihood of reaching the state\u2019s graduation rate  target. We estimated that an additional 70 of 444 high schools in the state  in school year 2002-03 would not have reached the state target if they were  in fact reporting only half of their dropouts. On the other hand, an  additional 77 high schools would have reached the state target if in fact  their dropout counts were overreported at twice the actual level.  According to the NCLBA, high schools that do not meet the state\u2019s  requirements for its graduation rate are designated as not making AYP.  Such designations if made for 2 or more consecutive years would result in  the district\u2019s providing technical assistance to schools that receive Title I  funding. Thus, schools that undercount their dropouts may be precluded  from receiving the attention and assistance from the state they need to  improve students\u2019 school retention and graduation while those with over  counts may receive such services unnecessarily."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Has Taken Some Steps to Help States with Data Issues, but Data Accuracy Remains a Key Challenge", "paragraphs": ["Education has taken steps to help states address data collection issues.  First, Education helped states prepare information to address how their  graduation rate definitions were valid and reliable. Education gave  instructions in its regulations and in a template given to each state to help  states prepare the accountability plans they were to submit to Education  for approval in 2003. Education also worked with states on an as-needed  basis when state officials had questions about what information the  Department needed to review. Education officials indicated that they  reviewed information in each state\u2019s plan when they conducted site visits  to states as part of the state plan approval process. According to  Education, most states were in some stage of transition in calculating their  graduation rates: some were implementing plans to transition from their  current definition to a cohort indicator; others were improving their data  systems; and some were collecting information on designated student  groups for the first time. For these states, Education reported that it was  unable to meaningfully examine the reliability of data used to calculate the  graduation rate because such definitions of such rates had not been in  place for a sufficient number of years necessary to determine whether the  rate would produce consistent results.", "Second, Education, as part of its state monitoring, introduced a data  review component to examine data states used for graduation rates,  among other aspects of their participation in the Title I program. As of  August 2005, Education had monitored and reported on 29 states, and  expected to monitor the remaining states by the end of fiscal year 2006 as  part of its 3-year monitoring plan. This monitoring consisted of broad  questions intended to collect information about how states corrected or  addressed errors in student data received from districts and schools,  including data used to calculate graduation rates. The monitoring was also  designed to identify written procedures states used to confirm the  accuracy of their data, the extent to which these procedures were  communicated to districts, and how data validity issues related to schools  and districts have been addressed. According to Education officials, their  reviews of the nine states identified no significant problems with data  systems these states used to calculate high school graduation rates.", "Third, in response to recommendations from GAO and Education\u2019s  Inspector General, Education contracted with a firm to develop a guide to  help states improve data collection processes. According to Education  officials, this guide is to consist of three parts. One part is designed for  state officials and is to focus on the design and implementation of data  systems. A second part, which focuses on data management issues such as  methods for verifying the accuracy of data, is designed for district and  school officials. A third part summarizes the first two parts and is to be  suitable for oral presentation to state, district, and school officials.  According to department officials, this guide will be issued by the end of  2005.", "Although Education monitors states to determine if they have written  procedures for ensuring data quality and have methods to address data  quality issues, it does not evaluate other methods of ensuring data  accuracy. For example, it does not assess whether states ensure that  districts and schools have effective controls to accurately record student  status, including transfers. Further, Education\u2019s monitoring approach does  not capture whether states ensure that schools have computer controls  that allow only authorized staff to make changes to student data.  Department officials said that the guide it is developing is planned to  address these issues.", "However, departmental efforts have not resolved immediate data accuracy  problems. In July 2005, Education announced that it planned to calculate  and report interim graduation rate estimates for each state to provide a  nationwide, comprehensive perspective. Education stated that the interim  rate that it developed, based on data NCES collects from states, will  provide more accurate on-time graduation rates. Some states\u2019 graduation  rates rely on the same data reported to NCES, while other states rely on  different data. However, these states also provide data that are requested  by NCES. The quality of the data states provide to NCES varies across  states depending, in part, on the extensiveness and rigor of their internal  controls and other data verification checks.

For  example, studies have shown that students who are not at least  moderately skilled at reading by the end of 3rd grade are less likely to  graduate from high school. Besides basic literacy skills, there are a  variety of other academic and family-related factors that contribute to  whether a student graduates. For example, poor grades and attendance,  school disciplinary problems, and failure to advance to the next grade can  all gradually lead to disengagement from school and result in a student not  finishing high school. In addition to these academic factors, students from  low-income backgrounds, students with low levels of self esteem, or  students with a learning or behavioral disability drop out at a much higher  rate than other students.", "Schools and districts have implemented a range of interventions to  address these factors and they vary in scope from redesigning the  structure of an entire school to an individual school\u2019s mentoring program.

For example, one school official noted that  little information exists on what interventions increase graduation rates  among Native American students and that such information would be  helpful in designing interventions.", "Education has made some efforts to address the problem of high school  completion by sponsoring research and disseminating information through  conferences and on its Web site. For example, Education officials noted  that Education\u2019s Office of Special Education Programs has supported  research papers on dropout interventions for youth with disabilities. These  studies are currently being completed and will be available in late 2005. In  terms of dissemination, Education\u2019s 2nd Annual High School Leadership  Summit held in December 2004 included sessions on dropout prevention  and recovery as well as strategies for creating higher-performing schools.  Additionally, Education\u2019s Office of Vocation and Adult Education has  dedicated a part of its Web site to the High School Initiative. The pages on  the Web site contain information on high school reform models,  adolescent literacy initiatives as well as information on research based  practices that may help high schools.", "While Education has made some efforts to help states and districts  address the dropout problem, the agency has not acted on its commitment  to implement the recommendation, contained in our 2002 report on  interventions, that Education evaluate results from research. Agency  officials have commented several times that they plan to evaluate the  research on dropout prevention efforts and then disseminate the results  through the agency\u2019s What Works clearinghouse. However, the Web space  for this effort still contains placeholder information. Agency officials  indicated that reviews of other topics, such as elementary reading and  math, have come before the reviews necessary for the dropout section of  the Web site."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s public school systems are responsible for educating 48  million students, the majority of our future workforce. Providing them  with the skills needed to succeed is vital to the nation\u2019s economic strength  and ability to compete in a global economy. NCLBA was passed to ensure  that all students have access to a high-quality education and to increase  the likelihood that these students will graduate. In particular, the act seeks  to make significant changes in public education by asking federal, state,  and local education officials to reconsider how they assess the academic  achievement of the nation\u2019s students. NCLBA specifies that states must set  high school graduation rate indicators as an additional benchmark, along  with test results, for measuring schools\u2019 progress. However, increasing and  accurately calculating graduation rates have been formidable challenges  for many states and districts. Many states have used flexibility to define  their indicators as both numerical goals as well as progress toward those  goals, where progress has generally ranged from no increase to a 1 percent  increase from the previous year. Therefore, some states have set  expectations that their schools may not graduate many more students than  previously.", "Education has addressed these challenges by developing some guidance  and providing support such as on-site peer reviews, conferences, and  information on its Web site. However, because Education\u2019s approach has  been to provide guidance on how to deal with specific student  circumstances on a case-by-case basis, not all states have received such  guidance. Without guidance, state officials may not appropriately include  students in these specific circumstances in their graduation rate  definitions, resulting in graduation rates that may be inaccurate. Such  inconsistent calculations raise questions about the quality of graduation  rates reported by states.", "A key challenge for states is to ensure that student data used for  calculating state graduation rates, as well as data provided to NCES, are  accurate and that state systems have the internal controls and data  verification checks to promote data reliability. As some states transition to  new graduation rate definitions, it is important that they ensure that such  controls are part of new student data systems. Student data accuracy is  particularly important because Education plans to use those state data  reported to NCES to develop interim graduation rate estimates, which are  intended to promote consistency across states and provide a nationwide  perspective.", "Finally, little is known about the success of interventions that are designed  to increase high school graduation rates. While some programs have  shown potential to increase such rates, few have been rigorously  evaluated. Some interventions have conducted limited evaluations of a  variety of different outcomes (attendance, test scores, job attainment), but  more comprehensive evaluations are necessary to understand programs\u2019  effects on graduation rates. As a result, schools and districts may not be  using the most effective approaches to help their students stay in school  and graduate. Education could play an important role in evaluating  existing research, which was a recommendation we made in our 2002  dropout report. Although Education agreed with this recommendation, the  agency has not established a clear plan or timetable for carrying it out.", "Additionally, Education should disseminate the results of research, since  such information will be critical as high school reform moves forward."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To assist states in improving their definitions of high school graduation  rates and enhancing the consistency of these rates, we recommend that  the Secretary of Education make information available to all states on  modifications available to account for students in special programs and  students with disabilities in their graduation rate calculations. This  information could include fuller explanations or examples of available  flexibilities.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Education, before developing interim  graduation rate estimates, assess the reliability of data submitted by states  used for this purpose. This assessment could include specific criteria that  demonstrate that states\u2019 data systems can produce accurate data.", "We recommend that the Secretary establish a timetable for carrying out  the recommendation in our 2002 report that Education evaluate research  on dropout interventions, including those interventions that focus on  increasing graduation rates. In addition, we recommend that the Secretary  disseminate research on programs shown to be effective in increasing  graduation rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education for review and comment.  In its letter, Education concurred with two of our three recommendations:  (1) about making information available to all states on modifications  available to account for students in special programs and students with  disabilities in their graduation rate calculations and (2) about evaluating  research on dropout interventions and disseminating such research on  those programs shown to be effective in increasing graduation rates.   Regarding our recommendation that that the department assess the  reliability of data submitted by states that it plans to use to develop  interim graduation rate estimates, Education noted that it has taken a  number of steps to conduct such reliability assessments.  However, it is  not clear whether these efforts include those data that Education will be  using to develop interim graduation rate estimates. Although data  submitted to Education are publicly available and have been reported by  states for years, their reliability has not been determined. We believe that  Education should take additional steps to ensure the reliability of these  data before they are used in calculating such estimates.  Education  officials also provided technical comments that we incorporated into the  report where appropriate. Education's written comments are reproduced  in appendix II.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Education,  relevant congressional committees, and other interested parties. We will  also make copies available to others upon request. In addition, the report  will be made available at no charge on GAO\u2019s Web site at  http://www.gao.gov.", "Please contact me at (202) 512-7215 if you or your staff have any questions  about this report.

We analyzed the plans states were required to  submit to Education to identify the graduation rate definitions states used  and graduation rate indicators set by states, reviewed updates to plans  submitted through July 2005 and reviewed letters from Education to states  regarding its decisions about state plans and updates.", "As part of another GAO review, we surveyed officials in 50 states, the  District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to obtain information about two  issues\u2014the extent to which (1) states verify school and district data used  to calculate high school graduation rates and (2) have unique student  identifiers. The surveys were conducted using self-administered electronic  questionnaires posted on the World Wide Web. We sent e-mail  notifications to all 52 state Performance Based Data Management Initiative  coordinators (50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico)  beginning on November 15, 2004. We closed the survey on January 13,  2005, after the 50th respondent had replied. Washington state and the  District of Columbia did not complete the survey in time to be included in  our analysis.", "We selected 20 states for further analysis. States were selected to capture  variation in high school graduation rate definitions, geographic location,  and types of interventions with the potential to increase graduation rates.  We conducted    a case study in 1 state (Washington state) to calculate graduation rates;    site visits in 3 states (Georgia, North Carolina, and Washington) to review    site visits in 6 states (Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Washington,  and Wyoming) to observe interventions and interview program staff; and   semi structured telephone interviews in all 20 states to obtain information  on definitions used, implementation status, and guidance provided by  Education.", "See table 4 for a list of states selected for site visits and phone interviews  based on the research objective we studied.", "In our case study we used student data from Washington state for the  2002-03 school year, the most recent school year for which data were  available at the time of our review. Using these data, we conducted an  analysis comparing the results of calculating the high school graduation  rate using two different graduation rate definitions\u2014the cohort definition  and the departure classification definition. Washington state used a  modified cohort formula that was based on tracking student dropouts  rather than on tracking student transfers. It also required all students with  \u201cunknown\u201d status to be reported as dropouts. We also used these data to  analyze the effects of allowing schools to make progress toward the  graduation rate target as a means of making AYP and using an estimated  miscount of the number of dropouts on the graduation rate. We  interviewed experts to determine reasonable rates at which dropouts may  be in error. We analyzed data using a set of 444 out of 547 of the state\u2019s  high schools. The 103 high schools that were not included in our analysis  were those with graduation rates of 10 percent or less. These were  generally alternative high schools, such as those designed to serve  students who had committed serious crimes. We also interviewed a state  official who confirmed our understanding of the omitted schools and  agreed with the reasonableness of the criterion.", "Although our analyses were based on a 4-year period, we used the 1 year  of student data and estimated information for the 3 prior years. We did not  obtain student data from prior years because state officials told us that  data accuracy had improved significantly in the 2002-03 school year. We  assessed the reliability of the Washington state data by (1) performing  electronic testing of required data elements for missing data and for  obvious errors, (2) reviewing existing information about the data and the  system that produced them, and (3) interviewing Washington state  officials knowledgeable about the data. However, we did not check the  data to source information. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To identify interventions with the potential to increase graduation rates,  we used a \u201csnowballing\u201d approach. Using this approach, we reviewed the  literature on interventions and interviewed Education officials and  dropout prevention experts and reviewed Web sites, such as the National  Dropout Prevention Centers Web site  (http://www.dropoutprevention.org/), to identify those that have the  potential to increase high school graduation rates. Based on the research  we reviewed and on recommendations from experts, we selected several  interventions at various locations around the country. For those  interventions we selected to visit we reviewed available evaluations,  including the findings related to outcomes, such as increased graduation  rates and improved literacy. We also assessed the methodological  approaches of these evaluations. Based on our review, we identified 3  interventions that had been rigorously evaluated and have shown potential  to increase graduation rate and visited 3 schools that had implemented  these programs. (Rigorous evaluations of 2 other interventions which  showed promising results were released subsequent to our field work. We  reviewed the results of these evaluations and reported their findings.) We  also visited schools that had implemented 13 other interventions that  experts and research showed promise in affecting factors that may  improve grad rates. However, rigorous evaluations on these programs had  not been done at the time of our review.", "To determine how Education assists states, we reviewed Education  regulations, guidance, and other documents and interviewed Education  and state agency officials. We also interviewed these officials to determine  the degree to which Education\u2019s actions have enhanced and disseminated  knowledge about interventions. Finally, we interviewed officials from the  National Governors Association, national education organizations, and  other experts in the area of high school graduation rates and reviewed  related research to obtain an understanding of the issues surrounding  these rates and high school reform efforts to address them.
