Covered entities include certain hospitals and federal grantees (such as federally qualified health centers). About one-third of the more than 12,000 covered entities contract with outside pharmacies\u2014contract pharmacies\u2014to dispense drugs on their behalf. GAO's review of 30 contracts found that all but one contract included provisions for the covered entity to pay the contract pharmacy a flat fee for each eligible prescription. The flat fees generally ranged from $6 to $15 per prescription, but varied by several factors, including the type of drug or patient's insurance status. Some covered entities also agreed to pay pharmacies a percentage of revenue generated by each prescription.", "Thirty of the 55 covered entities GAO reviewed reported providing low-income, uninsured patients discounts on 340B drugs at some or all of their contract pharmacies. Of the 30 covered entities that provided discounts, 23 indicated that they pass on the full 340B discount to patients, resulting in patients paying the 340B price or less for drugs. Additionally, 14 of the 30 covered entities said they determined patients' eligibility for discounts based on whether their income was below a specified level, 11 reported providing discounts to all patients, and 5 determined eligibility for discounts on a case-by-case basis.", "GAO found weaknesses in HRSA's oversight that impede its ability to ensure compliance with 340B Program requirements at contract pharmacies, such as:", "HRSA audits do not fully assess compliance with the 340B Program prohibition on duplicate discounts for drugs prescribed to Medicaid beneficiaries. Specifically, manufacturers cannot be required to provide both the 340B discount and a rebate through the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. However, HRSA only assesses the potential for duplicate discounts in Medicaid fee-for-service and not Medicaid managed care. As a result, it cannot ensure compliance with this requirement for the majority of Medicaid prescriptions, which occur under managed care.", "HRSA requires covered entities that have noncompliance issues identified during an audit to assess the full extent of noncompliance. However, because HRSA does not require all the covered entities to explain the methodology they used for determining the extent of the noncompliance, it does not know the scope of the assessments and whether they are effective at identifying the full extent of noncompliance.", "HRSA does not require all covered entities to provide evidence that they have taken corrective action and are in compliance with program requirements prior to closing the audit. Instead, HRSA generally relies on each covered entity to self-attest that all audit findings have been addressed and that the entity came into compliance with 340B Program requirements.", "Given these weaknesses, HRSA does not have a reasonable assurance that covered entities have adequately identified and addressed noncompliance with 340B Program requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including that HRSA's audits assess for duplicate discounts in Medicaid managed care, and HRSA require information on how entities determined the scope of noncompliance and evidence of corrective action prior to closing audits.

According to the Health Resources and  Services Administration (HRSA), the agency within the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for administering and  overseeing the 340B Program, the purpose of the 340B Program is to  enable covered entities to stretch scarce federal resources to reach more  eligible patients and provide more comprehensive services.

Covered entities can realize substantial savings through 340B price  discounts\u2014an estimated 20 to 50 percent of the cost of the drugs,  according to HRSA. In addition, covered entities can generate revenue as  they can purchase 340B drugs for eligible patients whose insurance  reimbursement exceeds the 340B price paid for the drugs. The statute  authorizing the 340B Program does not dictate how covered entities  should use this revenue or require discounts on the drugs to be passed  along to patients. Incentives for participation by drug manufacturers are  strong because they must participate in the 340B Program to receive  Medicaid reimbursement for their drugs.", "A covered entity typically purchases and dispenses 340B drugs through  pharmacies\u2014either through an in-house pharmacy; through the use of a  contract pharmacy arrangement, in which the entity contracts with an  outside pharmacy and pays it to dispense drugs on its behalf; or both.  The adoption and use of contract pharmacies in the 340B Program is  governed by HRSA guidance, and in March 2010, HRSA issued final  guidance allowing covered entities to have an unlimited number of  contract pharmacies. Since that time, the number of contract pharmacies  has increased significantly, from about 1,300 at the beginning of 2010 to  around 20,000 in 2017.", "Covered entities are required to meet certain conditions set forth both in  law and interpretive agency guidance.

They are also  prohibited from subjecting manufacturers to \u201cduplicate discounts\u201d in which  drugs prescribed to Medicaid beneficiaries are subject to both the 340B  price and a rebate through the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Covered  entities that use contract pharmacies are responsible for overseeing  those pharmacies to ensure compliance with 340B Program prohibitions  on drug diversion and duplicate discounts. Some covered entities hire  and pay a private company, referred to as a third-party administrator  (TPA), to help determine patient eligibility and manage 340B inventory as  a means to ensure compliance with 340B Program requirements at  contract pharmacies.", "In a September 2011 report, we identified inadequacies in HRSA\u2019s  oversight of the 340B Program and recommended ways for HRSA to  improve oversight and ensure appropriate use of the program. In  response, HRSA has taken action to improve its oversight of covered  entities, including implementing a systematic approach to conducting  audits of covered entities. Given the growth in the 340B Program, there  has been continued interest in program oversight, and how the increase  in contract pharmacies affects the integrity of the program. You asked us  to review the use of contract pharmacies in the 340B Program. In this  report we  1.  describe the extent to which covered entities contract with pharmacies  to distribute 340B drugs, and characteristics of these pharmacies;  2.  describe financial arrangements selected covered entities have with  contract pharmacies and TPAs related to the administration and  dispensing of 340B drugs;  3.  describe the extent to which selected covered entities provide  discounts on 340B drugs dispensed by contract pharmacies to low- income, uninsured patients; and  4.  examine HRSA\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with 340B Program  requirements at contract pharmacies.", "To examine the extent to which covered entities contract with pharmacies  to distribute 340B drugs and the characteristics of these pharmacies, we  analyzed HRSA\u2019s 340B Program database to identify the covered entities  registered to participate in the 340B Program and the contract  pharmacies registered to dispense 340B drugs for each entity, as of July  1, 2017\u2014the most current data available when we began our analysis.  The pharmacy characteristics we reviewed included the type of pharmacy  and the distance between the pharmacy and the covered entities with  which it had a contract. To determine the types of pharmacies that  participated as contract pharmacies, we matched the pharmacies  included in the 340B database with data from the National Council for  Prescription Drug Programs\u2019 DataQ\u2014a database used by health care  payers and claims processors across the country to identify pharmacies,  which contains information reported by pharmacies on their pharmacy  type and ownership, among other items. We used the addresses  included in the 340B database to determine the location of each covered  entity, its affiliated sites, and its contract pharmacies and used this  information to determine the distance between the entity and its contract  pharmacies. We calculated the distance (in miles) from the pharmacy to  the nearest site of the covered entity. To assess the reliability of the 340B  and DataQ databases, we obtained information from officials who are  knowledgeable about them regarding steps taken to ensure the accuracy  of the information contained in each, and performed checks to identify  missing or incorrect data. Based on these steps, we determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objective.", "To describe financial arrangements selected covered entities have with  contract pharmacies and TPAs, we reviewed a sample of contracts  between entities and pharmacies and collected information from selected  entities and TPAs. We selected a nongeneralizable sample of 30  pharmacy contracts from among those that HRSA had collected\u2014 contracts the agency obtained during audits of covered entities from fiscal  years 2014 through 2016. We selected contracts to obtain variation in  the type of covered entity (15 hospitals and 15 federal grantees) and  geographic location. For these selected contracts, we identified the types  and amounts of fees that covered entities agreed to pay contract  pharmacies for dispensing and managing 340B prescriptions, as well as  determined factors that may have impacted the fee amounts. To describe  financial arrangements covered entities have with TPAs, beginning in  September 2017, we sent a data collection instrument\u2014which we refer to  as a questionnaire in this report\u2014to a nongeneralizable sample of 60  covered entities that had contract pharmacies to obtain information about  the arrangements they had with TPAs. We received responses from 55  of the covered entities\u201428 hospitals and 27 federal grantees. In addition,  we interviewed 10 of the 55 covered entities that responded to our  questionnaire to obtain more detailed information about the fees they pay  their TPAs. We selected covered entities to receive the questionnaire and  for interviews to achieve variation in terms of their type, geographic  location, and number of contract pharmacies. Finally, we interviewed two  TPAs to gain insights about the types of financial arrangements they have  with covered entities.", "To describe the extent to which selected covered entities provide  discounts on 340B drugs dispensed by contract pharmacies to low- income, uninsured patients, we used the same questionnaire as  previously noted to collect information about any discounts provided. This  included information on the proportion of pharmacies at which discounts  on 340B drugs were available, how covered entities determined which  patients were eligible for those discounts, the prices these patients  generally paid to obtain the drugs, and how covered entities inform  patients and contract pharmacies about the availability of discounts.  Additionally, we asked officials from the 10 covered entities we  interviewed for additional information about discounts provided on 340B  drugs dispensed to low-income, uninsured patients at contract  pharmacies.", "To examine HRSA\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with 340B Program  requirements at contract pharmacies, we reviewed relevant policies,  procedures, and guidance, including HRSA\u2019s 2010 guidance on contract  pharmacy services and documentation of the agency\u2019s audit procedures.  We also analyzed summaries of HRSA\u2019s audits of covered entities for  fiscal years 2012 through 2017, posted on its website as of February 8,  2018. We conducted an in-depth review of a nongeneralizable sample  of 20 audits that were conducted from fiscal years 2014 through 2016 for  covered entities that had contract pharmacies at the time of the audit.  We selected this sample from among audits that were closed by HRSA to  obtain variation in terms of covered entity type and audit findings. We  also interviewed HRSA officials about their oversight activities, including  their audit process, and spoke with the contractor that has conducted  audits on HRSA\u2019s behalf since fiscal year 2017. Additionally, we asked  officials from the 10 covered entities interviewed about their practices for  overseeing contract pharmacies.

Child sites can  include satellite clinics, off-site outpatient facilities, hospital departments,  and other facilities.

The adoption and use of contract  pharmacies in the 340B Program is governed by HRSA guidance.  HRSA\u2019s original guidance permitting the use of contract pharmacies  limited their use to entities that did not have in-house pharmacies and  allowed each entity to contract with only one outside pharmacy.  However, March 2010 guidance lifted the restriction on the number of  pharmacies with which a covered entity could contract. Since that time,  the number of contract pharmacies has increased more than fifteen-fold,  from about 1,300 to approximately 20,000. According to HRSA guidance,  a covered entity is required to have a written contract in place with each  pharmacy through which it intends to dispense 340B drugs, but is not  generally required to submit its pharmacy contracts to HRSA. A covered  entity that has more than one site at which it provides health care may  enter into separate pharmacy contracts for the parent site and each child  site, or one comprehensive pharmacy contract including all sites intending  to use the pharmacy. It is up to the covered entity to determine which of  its sites will be included in a contract with a pharmacy, and thus have  what is referred to as a contract pharmacy arrangement with that  pharmacy. Figure 2 provides an illustration of a covered entity that has  four contract pharmacies but a total of six contract pharmacy  arrangements, as not all of the entity\u2019s sites have contracts with each of  the pharmacies.", "Covered entities that choose to have contract pharmacies are required to  register with HRSA the names of each of the pharmacies with which they  contract. Covered entities may register their contract pharmacies in one  of two ways: 1) only in relation to the parent site (use by child sites would  be allowed as long as the sites were included in a comprehensive  contract between the entity and the contracted pharmacies); or 2)  separately for each site (parent and child) involved in a contractual  arrangement with the pharmacy. As part of this registration, HRSA  guidance specifies that covered entities must certify that they have signed  and have in effect an agreement with each contract pharmacy and have a  plan to ensure compliance with the statutory prohibitions on 340B drug  diversion and duplicate discounts at their contract pharmacies.", "Like other pharmacies, when contract pharmacies fill prescriptions, they  collect payments from the patient; if the patient has health insurance, the  pharmacy will bill the insurer for the drug. In addition, each covered entity  must determine which prescriptions are for eligible patients of the entity,  and thus, can be filled with 340B drugs. One way that a covered entity  could choose to do this is to employ a TPA to review all the prescriptions  filled by a contract pharmacy to determine which, if any, prescriptions  were issued by the covered entity to an eligible patient, and thus are  eligible for the 340B discount. The covered entity then pays both the  contract pharmacy and the TPA fees that they have negotiated for their  roles in managing and distributing 340B drugs. These fees are typically  deducted from the reimbursed amounts received from patients and their  health insurers by the pharmacy and TPA, and then the balance is  forwarded to the covered entity.

HRSA\u2019s audits include covered entities that are randomly  selected based on risk-based criteria (approximately 90 percent of all  audits conducted each year), and covered entities that are targeted based  on information from stakeholders such as drug manufacturers (10 percent  of the audits conducted). The criteria for risk-based audits include a  covered entity\u2019s volume of 340B drug purchases, number of contract  pharmacies, time in the 340B Program, complexity of its program, and  history of violations or allegations of noncompliance associated with  diversion and duplicate discounts.", "Among other things, HRSA\u2019s audits include reviews of each covered  entity\u2019s policies and procedures, including those for overseeing contract  pharmacies; an assessment of the entity\u2019s compliance with respect to  340B eligibility status, the prevention of duplicate discounts and diversion,  and other program requirements; and reviews of a sample of  prescriptions filled during a 6-month period, including prescriptions  dispensed by contract pharmacies, to identify instances of non- compliance.

(See  fig. 5 for the distribution of contract pharmacies by covered entity type.)  However, we found that a covered entity that contracts with a pharmacy  may not actually use the pharmacy to dispense 340B drugs. For example,  three covered entities that received our questionnaire told us that  although they had one or more contract pharmacies registered with  HRSA, they did not use those pharmacies to dispense 340B drugs.  Moreover, officials from a covered entity we interviewed reported that  while the entity maintained a contract with a specialty pharmacy, it had  not dispensed 340B drugs through that pharmacy in several years.  Officials explained that the covered entity maintained its contract and  continued to register this pharmacy with HRSA because it would be  financially beneficial should it have a patient fill a 340B-eligible specialty  drug at this pharmacy in the future.", "The actual number of 340B contract pharmacy arrangements\u2014the  number of contractual arrangements between contract pharmacies and  the sites of a covered entity\u2014is unknown because HRSA does not  require a covered entity to register pharmacies with each of its child sites.  Rather, HRSA gives covered entities the option to register contract  pharmacies only in relation to the parent site: child sites may use that  pharmacy if included in the written contract between the entity and the  pharmacy. Based on our analysis of HRSA data, 1,645 covered entities  that had at least one child site registered their contract pharmacies only  with their parent sites. These 1,645 covered entities had a total of 25,481  registered contract pharmacy arrangements. However, if the  pharmacies were contracted to work with all of the covered entities\u2019  sites\u2014the parents and all the child sites\u2014then these 1,645 entities could  have as many as 866,388 contract pharmacy arrangements.

Furthermore, the majority (75 percent) of 340B contract pharmacies were  chain pharmacies, while 20 percent were independent pharmacies and 5  percent were other pharmacies.

Critical access hospitals had a higher proportion of  independent contract pharmacies (40 percent of their pharmacies)  compared to other covered entity types (which ranged from 11 percent for  disproportionate share hospitals to 21 percent for other federal grantees).  Our analysis suggests that this is likely due, in part, to a larger proportion  of critical access hospitals compared to other types of covered entities  being located in rural areas; independent contract pharmacies are also  more likely than other contract pharmacies to be located in rural areas.", "Across all covered entities, the distance between the entities and their  contract pharmacies ranged from 0 miles (meaning that the contract  pharmacy and entity were co-located) to more than 5,000 miles; the  median distance was 4.2 miles.

However, because covered entities differ in the way they register their  contract pharmacies, HRSA, and its publicly available database, does not  have information on all of an entity\u2019s contract pharmacy arrangements.

HRSA\u2019s audits  only assess the potential for duplicate discounts in Medicaid fee-for- service. They do not include a review of covered entities\u2019 processes to  prevent duplicate discounts for drugs dispensed through Medicaid  managed care. The potential for duplicate discounts related to Medicaid  managed care has existed since 2010 when manufacturers were required  to pay Medicaid rebates under managed care, and currently, there are  more Medicaid enrollees, prescriptions, and spending for drugs under  managed care than fee-for-service.", "HRSA officials told us that they do not assess the potential for duplicate  discounts in Medicaid managed care as part of their audits because they  have yet to issue guidance as to how covered entities should prevent  duplicate discounts in Medicaid managed care. They agreed that the  lack of Medicaid managed care guidance for covered entities was  problematic, and HRSA\u2019s December 2014 policy release stated, \u201cHRSA  recognizes the need to address covered entities\u2019 role in preventing  duplicate discounts under Medicaid managed care, and is working with  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to develop policy in  this regard.\u201d According to HRSA, in the absence of formal guidance,  covered entities should work with their states to develop strategies to  prevent duplicate discounts in Medicaid managed care. However, 8 of the  10 covered entities we spoke with described challenges working with their  states and local Medicaid managed care organizations to ensure that  duplicate discounts were not occurring or expressed the need for more  guidance from HRSA on how to comply with 340B requirements related to  duplicate discount prevention. As a result of these challenges, some  covered entities acknowledged that they did not have assurance that  duplicate discounts were not occurring with their Medicaid managed care  claims, while other entities told us that they did not seek discounts for the  drugs of managed care patients due to compliance challenges.", "Federal internal control standards related to control activities and  monitoring state that agencies should 1) implement control activities  through policies, such as by determining the necessary policies based on  the objectives and related risks for the operational process; and 2)  establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control  system and evaluate results, such as by establishing and operating  monitoring activities that are built into each entity\u2019s operations, performed  continually, and responsive to change. In addition, federal law directs  the agency to develop detailed guidance describing methodologies and  options for avoiding duplicate discounts. Until HRSA develops guidance  and includes an assessment of the potential for duplicate discounts in  Medicaid managed care as part of its audits, the agency does not have  assurance that covered entities\u2019 efforts are effectively preventing  noncompliance. As a result, manufacturers are at risk of being required to  erroneously provide duplicate discounts for Medicaid prescriptions.", "Audit closure process does not ensure all identified issues of  noncompliance are addressed. Under HRSA\u2019s audit procedures,  covered entities with audit findings are required to 1) submit corrective  action plans to HRSA that indicate that the entities will determine the full  scope of any noncompliance (beyond the sample of prescriptions  reviewed during an audit); 2) outline the steps they plan to take to correct  findings of noncompliance, including any necessary repayments to  manufacturers; and 3) specify the timelines for implementing the  corrective action plans. HRSA closes the audit when a covered entity submits a letter attesting that its corrective action plan, including its  assessment of the full scope of noncompliance, has been implemented  and any necessary repayments to manufacturers have been completed.", "However, we identified two specific deficiencies in HRSA\u2019s approach.  First, although HRSA requires that covered entities determine the full  scope of noncompliance found in audits, it does not provide guidance as  to how entities should make this assessment. Specifically, HRSA does  not specify how far back in time covered entities must look to see if any  related noncompliance occurred and instead, relies on each entity to  make this determination. For example, a document from a fiscal year  2017 audit revealed that a covered entity that had participated in the  340B Program for 3 years only reviewed 5 months of claims to determine  whether any other instances of diversion had occurred, diminishing the  likelihood that its efforts identified the full scope of noncompliance.  Additionally, until April 2018, HRSA did not require covered entities that  were audited to communicate the methodology used to assess the full  scope of noncompliance, or the findings of their assessments, including  how many or which manufacturers were due repayment. Beginning April  1, 2018, HRSA requires covered entities subject to targeted audits to  document their methodology for assessing the full scope of  noncompliance. However, as previously noted, only 10 percent of the 200  audits HRSA currently conducts each year are targeted audits.  Consequently, the vast majority of covered entities audited are not  required to provide HRSA with information on their methodology for  assessing the full scope of noncompliance. Furthermore, HRSA officials  told us that they believe determining the scope of noncompliance is a  matter between the covered entities and manufacturers. Thus, HRSA  relies on manufacturers to determine the adequacy of a covered entity\u2019s  effort to assess the full scope of noncompliance. However, covered  entities only contact the manufacturers that they determine were affected  by the noncompliance based on the methodology they choose to apply;  thus, it is unclear how manufacturers not contacted would be in a position  to negotiate an acceptable assessment of the scope of noncompliance  and any applicable repayment.", "Federal internal control standards related to control activities state that  agencies should implement control activities through policies, such as by documenting policies in the appropriate level of detail to allow  management to effectively monitor the control activity. As HRSA does  not provide guidance on how covered entities are to assess the full scope  of noncompliance and does not review most entities\u2019 methodology for  making such assessments, the agency does not have reasonable  assurances that entities have adequately identified all instances of  noncompliance.", "Second, HRSA generally relies on each covered entity to self-attest that  all audit findings have been addressed and that the entity is now in  compliance with 340B Program requirements. Beginning April 1, 2018,  HRSA requires the 10 percent of covered entities that are subject to  targeted audits to provide documentation that they implemented their  corrective action plans prior to HRSA closing the audits. However, it still  relies on the remaining 90 percent of audited covered entities to self- attest to their compliance with program requirements.", "HRSA officials told us they believe that a covered entity providing a  description of the corrective actions is sufficient, and that the self- attestation of corrective action plan implementation provides HRSA with  the information necessary to close the audit. However, aside from the  self-attestation, HRSA\u2019s only mechanism to ensure that the majority of  audited covered entities have implemented their corrective action plans is  to re-audit the entities\u2014in other words, subject the entity to a targeted  audit. To date, the agency told us that it has re-audited 21 covered  entities, and based on those re-audits, determined that 1 entity did not  fully implement its corrective action plan from the original audit. However,  we found that of the 19 re-audited covered entities for which results were  available, 12 had similar findings of noncompliance in their second audits,  as were identified in their original audits (e.g., diversion findings in both  audits), 3 of which were caused by the same issue, according to  information provided to us by HRSA.", "Federal internal control standards for monitoring specify that agencies  should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal  control system and evaluate the results, for example by using ongoing  monitoring to obtain reasonable assurance of the operating effectiveness  of the service organization\u2019s internal controls over the assigned process.", "By only reviewing evidence of corrective action plan implementation for  the limited number of covered entities subject to targeted audits, HRSA  does not have reasonable assurance that the majority of covered entities  audited have corrected the issues identified in the audit, and are not  continuing practices that could lead to noncompliance, thus increasing the  risk of diversions, duplicate discounts, and other violations of 340B  Program requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HRSA\u2019s Guidance for Covered Entities\u2019 Oversight of Contract Pharmacies Lacks Specificity", "paragraphs": ["HRSA guidance for covered entities on their oversight of contract  pharmacies lacks specificity and thus provides entities with considerable  discretion on the scope and frequency of their oversight practices.

The expansion of contract pharmacies  presents an opportunity for entities to fill more prescriptions with  discounted 340B drugs, but it also increases potential risks to the 340B  Program, such as risks related to diversion and duplicate discounts.  Although covered entities and HRSA have taken steps to ensure that  340B Program requirements are being met at contract pharmacies,  HRSA\u2019s audits continue to identify instances of noncompliance.", "As currently structured, weaknesses in HRSA\u2019s oversight impede its  ability to ensure compliance with 340B Program requirements at contract  pharmacies. HRSA cannot ensure that its limited number of audits target  covered entities with the most complex 340B programs, and thus the  greatest risk of noncompliance, because the agency does not have  complete data on entities\u2019 contract pharmacy arrangements. Additionally,  HRSA\u2019s audit process does not adequately identify compliance issues,  nor does it ensure that identified issues are corrected. HRSA\u2019s audits do  not assess compliance with a key 340B Program requirement (the  prohibition regarding duplicate discounts) as it relates to Medicaid  managed care, and HRSA does not provide audited entities with  guidance for determining the full scope of noncompliance, which reduces  the effectiveness of HRSA\u2019s audits in identifying drug diversion and  duplicate discounts. Moreover, where audits identify instances of  noncompliance, HRSA\u2019s process does not confirm that all covered  entities successfully correct the deficiencies and take steps to prevent  future noncompliance. Although HRSA made improvements to its process  for targeted audits during the course of our review, the agency does not  require most covered entities subject to an audit to provide evidence of  corrective actions taken.", "Moreover, the lack of specificity in HRSA\u2019s guidance to covered entities  on the methods through which they should ensure compliance may  impede the effectiveness of entities\u2019 oversight. For example, without  guidance instructing covered entities how to prevent duplicate discounts  in Medicaid managed care, entities are left to individually navigate the  policies and practices of states and private insurers. Furthermore, by not  clearly communicating expectations for covered entities\u2019 oversight of their  contract pharmacies, HRSA faces the risk that instances of  noncompliance, such as diversion, at contract pharmacies will not be  identified and addressed.

Regarding our recommendation related to guidance on  duplicate discounts, HHS concurred, but commented that the  recommendation did not account for the critical role that CMS would play  in its successful implementation. We agree that CMS would play an  important role in ensuring compliance with the prohibition on duplicate  discounts in Medicaid managed care, which is why we recommended that  HRSA coordinate with CMS on the guidance. HHS indicated that HRSA  and CMS are strategizing on effective ways to address this issue. HHS  also concurred with our recommendations to issue guidance related to  identifying the full scope of noncompliance and covered entities\u2019 oversight  of their contract pharmacies, although it noted that HRSA would face  challenges in issuing guidance related to areas where it does not have  explicit regulatory authority. While we recognize that HRSA\u2019s authority to  issue regulations governing the 340B Program may be limited, our  recommendations were focused on HRSA clarifying certain program  requirements through whatever format the agency deems appropriate.  Since the establishment of the 340B Program, HRSA has used  interpretative guidance and statements of policy to provide guidance to  covered entities regarding compliance with program requirements. HRSA  has also used certain of its audit procedures, such as the template  provided to covered entities for the development of corrective action  plans, to provide such clarifications. Our recommendations are intended  to expand the availability of information HRSA provides to covered  entities to help them improve compliance with existing program  requirements. As such, we continue to believe that further clarification,  whether provided as interpretive guidance, audit procedures, or another  format, is necessary to help ensure compliance with program  requirements.", "Among the recommendations with which HHS did not concur was our  recommendation to require covered entities to register contract  pharmacies for each site of the entity for which a contract exists. HHS  stated that its current registration process is responsive to our concerns  for all covered entity types other than hospitals and health centers.  However, as we note in the report, hospitals and FQHCs are typically the  covered entity types that have multiple sites, and are generally more likely  to have contract pharmacies. HHS cited administrative burden for both  covered entities and HRSA as a reason not to require covered entities to  provide more complete information about contract pharmacy  arrangements. However, given that HRSA requires covered entities to  register both their sites and their contract pharmacies with the agency, it  is unclear why there would be significant additional burden for covered  entities to indicate which of the previously registered sites had contracts  with which contract pharmacies. It is also important to note that contract  pharmacy use by covered entities is voluntary, and covered entities that  choose to have contract pharmacies are required to oversee those  pharmacies to ensure compliance with 340B Program requirements.  Therefore, the use of contract pharmacies inherently comes with  additional administrative responsibilities for the covered entity, and we  believe that the requirement to register each contract pharmacy  arrangement with HRSA should present limited additional burden on  covered entities.", "Rather than implementing our recommendation, HHS stated that HRSA  will make changes to its audit selection process; HRSA will assume that  all contract pharmacies registered with the parent site would also be used  by all sites of the covered entity prior to selecting entities for risk-based  audits. Although this may be a good step forward, it does not provide  information on the actual number of contract pharmacy arrangements for  each covered entity. As such, we continue to believe that HRSA needs  more complete information on contract pharmacy arrangements to best  target its limited number of audits to covered entities with the most  complex 340B programs. This is also important information to provide  manufactures to help ensure that 340B discounted drugs are only  provided to pharmacies on behalf of a covered entity site with a valid  340B contract with that site.", "HHS also did not concur with our two recommendations to require  covered entities to specify their methodologies for identifying the full  scope of noncompliance identified during their audits as part of their  corrective action plans, and to provide evidence that these plans have  been successfully implemented prior to HRSA closing audits. In its  response, HHS noted that on April 1, 2018, HRSA implemented these  requirements for entities subject to targeted audits (including re-audits),  which represent 10 percent of all entities audited. However, HRSA  indicated that implementing these requirements for all covered entities  that are audited would create a significant burden for these entities. As  we previously noted, HRSA already requires covered entities with audit  findings to determine the full scope of noncompliance and to submit  corrective action plans. Thus, it is unclear how requiring covered entities  to include written descriptions of their methodologies for identifying the full  scope of noncompliance, which should already be formulated, and to  provide evidence that the corrective actions that entities developed have  been implemented, would create significant additional burden for these  entities.", "HHS also expressed concern that these additional steps would  significantly delay the audit process and repayments to manufacturers.  We recognize that reviewing these documents may create some  additional work for HRSA and possibly require additional time to close  audits. However, we believe this additional work and time is necessary for  the audits to be effective at adequately identifying compliance issues and  ensuring that those issues are corrected. Furthermore, these additional  actions could reduce the need for re-audits which are burdensome in  terms of cost and time, for both the covered entity and HRSA.", "Finally, HHS also expressed concerns about some of the other  information included in the draft report.", "HHS stated that disclosing actual fees paid by covered entities to  pharmacies and TPAs could cause disruptions in the drug pricing  market and fluctuations in fees entities pay. Our report provides fees  for a small and nongeneralizable sample of contracts, covered  entities, and TPAs. For example, we provide contract pharmacy fees  for 30 of the thousands of contracts that exist between covered  entities and pharmacies. It is unclear how this information could cause  disruptions in the drug pricing market or lead to fluctuations in fees  covered entities may pay, and HHS did not provide any evidence to  support its assertion. Additionally, HHS has raised questions about  the effect of the 340B Program on drug pricing. As such, we believe  that our discussion of fees brings enhanced transparency to the 340B  Program, and provides Congress with important information it  requested to gain a better understanding of the program and enhance  its oversight.", "Regarding the distance between contract pharmacies and covered  entities, HHS noted that the longest distance was for a specialty  pharmacy that was registered for 17 days. As noted in our scope and  methodology, our analysis was of covered entities and contract  pharmacies participating as of July 1, 2017. Additionally, there were  other contract pharmacy arrangements of similarly long distances.  HHS also expressed concern that the draft report did not note that  such specialty pharmacies may be needed due to restricted  distribution by a manufacturer, which would be outside a covered  entity\u2019s control. In our report, we noted that the 340B database does  not provide information on why a covered entity may choose to  contract with a pharmacy that is located a long distance away.  However, the report does include some potential reasons HRSA  provided us as to why this may occur.", "HHS also commented that our table on the number and percent of  covered entities audited does not fully reflect HRSA\u2019s auditing efforts  because it does not include the number of entity sites and contract  pharmacies included within each audit. However, HRSA\u2019s audits of  covered entities generally do not include visits to multiple covered  entity sites, or all contract pharmacies that distribute 340B drugs on a  covered entity\u2019s behalf. Additionally, while the audits include a review  of a sample of 340B drugs distributed, that sample may not include  prescriptions written at, or dispensed from, all of the covered entity\u2019s  sites or contract pharmacies. As a result, information in our report  highlights the number of entities that were audited.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Health  and Human Services, the Administrator of HRSA, and other interested  parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO\u2019s  website at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-7114 or at DraperD@gao.gov.
