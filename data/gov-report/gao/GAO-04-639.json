Because of the concern about women's access to opportunities in the sciences, which receive billions of dollars in federal assistance, this report addresses: (1) how do the Department of Education (Education), the Department of Energy (Energy), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) ensure that federal grant recipient institutions comply with Title IX in math, engineering, and science; (2) what do data show about women's participation in these fields; and (3) what promising practices exist to promote their participation?"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Four federal science agencies have made efforts to ensure that grantees comply with Title IX in the sciences by performing several compliance activities, such as investigating complaints and providing technical assistance, but most have not conducted all required monitoring activities. Agency officials at Energy, NASA, and NSF told us that they refer complaints to Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where they are investigated. However, only Education has monitored its grantees by conducting compliance reviews--periodic, agency-initiated assessments of grantees to determine if they are complying with Title IX. Women's participation in the sciences has increased substantially in the last three decades, especially in the life sciences, such as biology. The proportion of women science students has grown, but to a lesser extent at the graduate level than the undergraduate level. Meanwhile, the proportion of faculty in the sciences who are women has also increased, but they still lag behind men faculty in terms of salary and rank. However, studies indicate that experience, work patterns, and education levels can largely explain these differences. Studies also suggest that discrimination may still affect women's choices and professional progress. We found several examples of agencies and grantees that have instituted practices designed to foster greater women's participation in the sciences. While some of the practices are aimed at encouraging more women to pursue the sciences, others provide time off and fewer teaching duties so faculty can balance work and family life. Finally, a few practices seek to expand the recruiting pool for jobs in the sciences and make them more attractive to a greater portion of the U.S. population, including women."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Discrimination against women in areas such as college admissions,  intercollegiate athletics, and employment was widespread 40 years ago.  Although civil rights laws in the 1960s barred discrimination in  employment, it was not until Title IX of the Education Amendments of  1972 that these protections were extended to students and faculty by  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and  activities receiving any federal financial assistance. While researchers  would agree that Title IX has contributed to greater inclusion of women  and girls in sports programs, some have stated that there is little  awareness that the law applies to academics.", "In the 32 years since Title IX was enacted, women\u2019s roles in American life  have changed greatly and women have made significant gains in many  fields. Despite these gains, much attention has focused on the limited  participation of women in mathematics, engineering, and science.  Because of increased interest about women\u2019s access to mathematics,  engineering, and science, which receive billions of dollars in federal  assistance, you asked us to determine what is being done to ensure  compliance with Title IX in regard to the sciences. This report addresses:  (1) how do the Department of Education (Education), the Department of  Energy (Energy), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) ensure that federal  grant recipient institutions comply with Title IX in mathematics,  engineering, and science; (2) what do data show about women\u2019s  participation in these fields; and (3) what promising practices exist to  promote their participation?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed the legislation and regulations to  identify all areas of compliance relevant to each federal agency. We  interviewed officials at each agency and gathered documentation to  identify agency activities to ensure compliance with Title IX. We analyzed  data from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at Education and the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\u2014the agencies where most  sex discrimination complaints are filed. Given its role as coordinating  agency of Title IX compliance, we also gathered data and interviewed  officials at the Department of Justice (Justice). We visited seven research  universities where we interviewed officials, students, and faculty. We also  visited six national laboratories and technology centers where we talked  with administrators and scientists. To gather information on women\u2019s  participation and experiences in the sciences, we analyzed national data  from Education and NSF. We also reviewed literature about women in the  sciences and challenges they face preparing for and pursuing careers in  the sciences. To identify promising practices to promote women\u2019s  participation in the sciences, we spoke with students and practitioners. To  assess the reliability of the various Education and NSF data sources, we  reviewed documentation on how the data were collected and performed  electronic tests to look for missing or out-of-range values. In addition, we  reviewed the methodology of studies and reports using generally accepted  social science principles as a basis for including their results in our report.  On the basis of these reviews and tests, we found the data and studies  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We conducted our review from July  2003 through June 2004 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. (See app. I for a more extensive  explanation of this report\u2019s objectives, scope, and methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["With certain exceptions, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  requires all entities receiving any form of federal financial assistance to  prohibit sex discrimination in their education programs or activities,  which are defined broadly under Title IX to include all the operations of  the entity. Because most postsecondary schools have students who  receive federal financial assistance, such as federally supported student  aid, Title IX applies to most 2-year and 4-year schools, both public and  private. In addition to postsecondary schools, many other recipients of  federal educational grants, such as K-12 school districts, private  laboratories, and museums, are also subject to Title IX. Title IX\u2019s  provisions apply to all operations and ancillary services of covered  programs. For example, the law applies to recruitment, student  admissions, scholarship awards, tuition assistance, other financial  assistance, housing, access to courses and other academic offerings,  counseling, employment assistance to students, health and insurance  benefits and services, and athletics. It also applies to all aspects of  employment, including recruitment, hiring, promotion, tenure, demotion,  transfer, layoff, termination, compensation, benefits, job assignments and  classifications, leave, and training.", "Under Title IX, federal agencies that administer grants are required to  conduct several compliance activities. For example, Title IX regulations  require agencies to conduct periodic compliance reviews of their grant  recipients. A compliance review is an agency-initiated assessment of  grantees to determine if they are complying with the law. Agencies must  also make a prompt investigation in response to timely written complaints  from individuals who allege that a grantee has engaged in sex  discrimination, or whenever a compliance review or any other information  indicates a possible failure to comply with Title IX. If the investigating  agency does not find evidence that the grantee has failed to comply with  Title IX, it must inform both the grant recipient and the complainant in  writing. If the investigating agency does find evidence of noncompliance  with Title IX, then the agency must first attempt to resolve the matter  informally. For example, the agency could attempt to mediate the issue to  encourage the grantee to voluntarily modify its activities in order to  comply with the law. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, then the  agency must take additional steps to secure compliance, including  suspending or terminating federal financial assistance. Individuals or  groups are allowed to file their complaints with grantees or with funding  agencies such as Education or NSF. If complainants are not satisfied with  the result of investigations, they can file their complaints with another  entity. For example, if a complaint is filed at the grantee level and the  complainant is unhappy with the result, he or she can file a complaint at  the agency level.  In addition to filing complaints, individuals or groups  have the option of filing suit in federal court. (See app. III for information  on selected legal cases and events involving Title IX since 1972.)", "While federal agencies have primary responsibility for ensuring  compliance with Title IX, recipients of federal grants also have some  compliance responsibilities. For example, grantees are required to provide  assurances that their education programs or activities are operated in  compliance with Title IX. Grantees are also required to designate at least  one employee to coordinate their compliance efforts and to establish  complaint procedures to resolve student and employee Title IX  complaints. Finally, grantees must provide notification to students and  employees that sex discrimination is prohibited in their programs or  activities.", "All federal agencies have enforcement responsibilities under Title IX. All  federal agencies, including Education, Energy, NASA, and NSF, are  responsible for handling Title IX enforcement of their own grantees and  may refer complaints against educational institutions to Education\u2019s OCR  and employment-related sex discrimination complaints to EEOC.  Education\u2019s OCR plays a key role in ensuring compliance with Title IX  because it has primary responsibility to investigate most types of  complaints at educational institutions, including complaints referred from  other federal agencies.", "Although EEOC does not have any authority under Title IX, it does have  authority under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to investigate sex- based complaints of employment discrimination, including sex  discrimination against faculty and scientists. Even though Title IX  regulations specifically include employment as a protected activity,  agencies generally send all employment-related discrimination complaints  to EEOC for investigation. EEOC officials told us that they process these  complaints as Title VII complaints. As such, EEOC will review referrals  from other federal agencies made under Title IX to see if they warrant  investigation under Title VII.", "The Department of Justice (Justice) was given authority under Executive  Order 12250 for the \u201cconsistent and effective implementation\u201d of several  civil rights laws, including Title IX. Specifically, Justice is responsible for  the coordination of agencies\u2019 enforcement of Title IX, including   (1) reviewing and approving of agencies\u2019 regulations, (2) developing  standards and procedures for conducting investigations and compliance  reviews, (3) arranging for referral of cases between agencies, and   (4) representing federal agencies in court proceedings. Justice  consequently published a Final Common Rule in August 2000, which  promulgated Title IX regulations adopted by 21 agencies, patterned after  the Department of Education\u2019s Title IX regulations. Figure 1 broadly  outlines the various complaint processes under Title IX.", "The four science agencies we reviewed for this request\u2014Education,  Energy, NASA, and NSF\u2014award billions of dollars in grants each year for  mathematics, engineering, and science grants and projects. Combined,  these four agencies awarded almost $5 billion in grants for the sciences in  fiscal year 2003. NASA, Energy, and NSF have been promoting scientific  and technological research and programs in K-12 schools, higher  education, and private industry for decades. Although Education\u2019s mission  encompasses more than scientific research, it has several programs  dedicated to the sciences. One such program, Graduate Assistance in  Areas of National Need, provides fellowships, through academic  departments of institutions of higher education; these fellowships assist  graduate students with excellent records who demonstrate financial need  and who plan to pursue the highest degree available in a field designated  as an area of national need. This program has designated biology,  chemistry, computer and information science, engineering, geological  science, mathematics, and physics as areas of national need. This program  was funded at over $30 million in fiscal year 2003.

Because  grantees are not required to report on complaints filed with them, the  agencies could not determine whether grantees have investigated Title IX  sex discrimination complaints they have received. To encourage  compliance with Title IX, federal agencies have provided grantees  technical assistance and also require an assurance statement from every  grantee that it will not discriminate. However, only Education has  monitored its grantees by conducting periodic compliance reviews\u2014an  agency-initiated assessment of grantees to determine if they are complying  with the law. The lack of grantee monitoring was, in part, because  agencies have not effectively coordinated the implementation of  compliance reviews and, according to agency officials, a shortage of  resources to conduct the reviews."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Conducted Complaint Investigations, but They Are Unaware of the Extent to Which Grantees Conducted Investigations", "paragraphs": ["Each of the four agencies we reviewed has established a process to ensure  that complaints made under Title IX are reviewed and addressed.  Specifically, Education officials told us that it investigated or resolved all  Title IX complaints it has received involving educational institutions,  including those referred to it by other agencies through formal and  informal agreements. Excluding athletic complaints, Education reported  that it has received over 3,300 Title IX complaints against institutions of  higher education since 1993. Some of these complaints were referred to  Education by other agencies, including Energy, NASA, and NSF. Education  officials told us that they are unable to determine which of the complaints  concerned higher education programs in the sciences because their data  management system does not track that information. Officials at Energy,  NASA, and NSF told us that complaints meriting further investigation were  referred to Education if they involved educational institutions or to EEOC  if they were related to employment issues. However, officials at Energy,  NASA, and NSF told us that they have received very few Title IX  complaints each year. (See table 1 for information on compliance  procedures required by Title IX.)", "EEOC also has established procedures to review complaints made under  Title IX, but the full number of complaints it has reviewed cannot be  determined. Officials at EEOC told us that it has received some Title IX  referrals, but since EEOC does not have statutory authority under Title IX,  it reviews complaints to determine if Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of  1964 applies. Consequently, EEOC does not track which complaints  originated as Title IX complaints, and it cannot determine how many Title  IX complaints it has investigated under Title VII. Although EEOC  investigates tens of thousands of complaints each year, officials told us  that they cannot determine if their investigations involved scientists, or  one of the four agencies, because EEOC\u2019s database does not track the  employee\u2019s occupation or the department in which the complaint  originated.", "While grantees are required to establish procedures to resolve Title IX sex  discrimination complaints, agencies could not determine whether they had  done so because grantees are not required to report this information.  Despite this requirement, there is some evidence that some grantees have  not established these procedures. For example, Education recently  reviewed the Title IX compliance status of selected grantees and found  several instances in which grantees had not adopted or published  complaint procedures. Recognizing this issue, Education issued a \u201cdear  colleague\u201d letter in April 2004 to its grantees reminding them of their Title  IX requirements to establish and publicize complaint procedures. Even if  grantees have established procedures to address Title IX complaints, they  may not be tracking the complaints they handle. Officials from every  university we visited told us that they had an internal process to handle  Title IX sex discrimination complaints, but a few were unable to provide  us with actual numbers because they do not keep these data. Also, some  officials told us that most complainants choose to file at the grantee level  rather than with the federal government.", "Students and university and laboratory officials we spoke with offered a  number of reasons why there have been so few Title IX sex discrimination  complaints involving the sciences filed with Education, Energy, NASA, and  NSF. Specifically, many students and staff suggested that their peers  would be unlikely to file a complaint because of a lack of awareness that  Title IX covers academics. For example, scientists and students at most  schools we visited told us that they thought Title IX covered only sports  and did not know the law also encompassed academic issues. Also, others  suggested they would be unlikely to file a complaint for fear of retribution  from supervisors or colleagues. For example, some women faculty  members we spoke with said that although they perceive that  discrimination exists in their department, filing a complaint could hinder  their ability to attain tenure. In addition, filing a sex discrimination  complaint would take time away from their research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Required Statements of Assurance from Grantees and Provided Technical Assistance to Promote Compliance with Title IX", "paragraphs": ["Officials at federal agencies told us that they required statements of  assurance from grantees and provided technical assistance to grantees  upon request. Each agency required grantees to submit a statement of  assurance that their education programs or activities are operated in  compliance with Title IX, as well as with other civil rights laws, as part of  their grant application. (See table 1.)  In addition to obtaining these  statements, agencies provide outreach materials or technical assistance to  grantees. We found that each agency provided materials to grantees to  help them better understand Title IX and its requirements.

Education has conducted 17  compliance reviews of academic programs\u2019 adherence to Title IX at  institutions of higher education since 1993, 3 of which have dealt with the  sciences. Education officials told us that each year they plan to conduct a  number of reviews of compliance based on available funding remaining  after they conduct complaint investigations and provide technical  assistance to grantees. Officials reported that their goal is to use 20  percent of their budget for both outreach and reviews of compliance with  federal laws, but in reality only about 15 percent of their budget goes  toward these activities. When choosing which reviews would be  conducted, officials reported that they identify compliance issues based  on Education\u2019s priorities and issues raised by Congress or interest groups.  Specifically, Education officials told us that the three compliance reviews  of science grantees\u2014conducted in 1994 and 1995\u2014were initiated because  of congressional interest. This year, Education plans to conduct over 50  compliance reviews on issues related to special education and  accommodations for the disabled. Officials told us that they are not  conducting any compliance reviews involving Title IX this year. In addition  to the requirement that Education conduct its own compliance reviews,  Education has agreements with 17 other agencies to conduct compliance  reviews of educational institutions under Title IX as well as other civil  rights laws. However, Education officials stated that performing  compliance reviews for other agencies was never feasible and that  Education has informed those agencies that it could not conduct these  reviews for them.", "Energy, NASA, and NSF officials reported that they have not conducted  any Title IX compliance reviews of their grantees. Energy officials  reported that they have provided their field office staff with guidance on  conducting compliance reviews and that many field office staff attended  training on compliance reviews offered by Justice. Energy officials also  told us that they have conducted site visits to several field offices to  determine if compliance reviews were being done, but found that no  compliance reviews have been conducted, primarily due to resource  constraints. While NASA has an agreement with Education for Education  to conduct compliance reviews, neither Education nor NASA has  conducted reviews of NASA\u2019s grantees. Recognizing this, NASA has begun  to take steps toward ensuring that compliance reviews are conducted on  their grantees.  NASA officials reported that they are developing a  compliance review program and have requested compliance information  from all of their grantees. Officials reported that they are in the process of  reviewing grantee responses to systematically ascertain if grantees are in  compliance, identify problem areas, and assist in targeting grantees for  possible on-site compliance reviews.

Some technical assistance has taken  the form of published guidance for agencies to assist them with Title IX  compliance, while other assistance is provided to agency officials directly  to address specific issues. For example, Energy officials reported that they  consult with Justice from time to time on how to handle complex  complaints they receive.", "Justice officials reported that they helped to arrange the agreements  between Education and other agencies whereby Education has agreed to  conduct complaint investigations and compliance reviews on behalf of the  other agencies. Justice officials reported that they were not aware that  Education has not been adhering to the compliance review portion of the  agreements.  However, Justice officials were aware that other agencies,  including Energy, NASA and NSF, were not conducting compliance  reviews as required, due to limited resources.", "Justice officials reported that every agency submitted annual reports on  their compliance activities. Agencies are required to report the numbers of  complaints they received under Title VI and Title IX and what action was  taken on those complaints. Agencies must also report on the total number  of grants the agency awarded and whether those grantees completed a  statement of assurance not to discriminate. In addition, agencies have to  report and characterize any agreements they may have with other  agencies, such as Education. Justice officials reported that they review  these reports to determine gaps in compliance and subsequently provide  agencies with guidance on how to alleviate those gaps. Although  Executive Order 12250 requires Justice to coordinate the implementation  and enforcement by executive agencies of various nondiscrimination  provisions of several civil rights laws, including Title IX, it has no legal  authority to make agencies conduct required compliance activities.

These  reviewers evaluate grant proposals based on two merit criteria: first, what  is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity; second, what are the  broader societal impacts of the proposed activity. This second criterion  includes promoting teaching, broadening the participation of  underrepresented groups, and enhancing research infrastructure, such as  facilities and partnerships, as well as the integration of diversity into NSF  projects, and research mentoring, particularly for students typically  underrepresented in the sciences.", "Projects meeting NSF\u2019s societal impact criterion may increase interest in  the sciences among students or provide valuable experience to a diverse  group of researchers, but to date there has not been a full evaluation of  this criterion. Beyond the first year of graduate school, science education  is largely laboratory centered. NSF grantees may take more care to include  graduate students or other researchers from diverse backgrounds as staff  on their projects. This could help ensure that women and minorities can  get the training and experience they need to complete advanced degrees  and work in an academic environment. However, the effects of  implementing the second criterion have yet to be fully evaluated. A review  by the National Academy of Public Administration in 2001 found that NSF  does not have adequate data to track changes or improvements to  encourage greater participation by underrepresented minority researchers.", "In addition, researchers told us that many NSF supported projects include  outreach components, frequently aimed at undergraduates and K-12  students.

In addition, some junior faculty  fear that stopping the clock will be counted against them in the tenure  decision. Even though adjusting the tenure clock may be university policy,  that policy may not be evenly implemented in all departments.
