The objectives of this report are to (1) describe major business and demographic changes and their effect on the Service's mail processing and distribution infrastructure; (2) describe what actions the Service is taking in response to these changes, and what challenges exist; and (3) discuss the Service's strategy for realigning its infrastructure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Several major changes have affected mail processing and distribution operations including marketplace changes, such as declines in First-Class Mail and increased competition; increased automation and mail processing by mailers; and shifts in population demographics. Effects of these changes include excess capacity in the mail processing and distribution infrastructure and variations in productivity among plants. The Service is exploring ways to realign its infrastructure by closing annexes, consolidating operations, and employing tools to model its infrastructure needs, while at the same time attempting to increase efficiencies in its current operations by expanding automation, improving material handling operations, creating a comprehensive transportation network, and introducing standardization programs. Also, there is a large range in productivity among plants. Reducing this range is difficult due to the complexity of operations and differences in plant layout. In addition, the Service faces challenges in eliminating excess capacity, while maintaining service standards, due to workforce rules and resistance to plant closings. Questions remain about how the Service intends to realign its processing and distribution infrastructure and workforce. The Service's strategy for realigning has not been clear because the Service has outlined several seemingly different strategies over the past 3 years. None of these strategies include criteria and processes for eliminating excess capacity, which may prolong inefficiencies. Also, the strategy lacks sufficient transparency and accountability, excludes stakeholder input, and lacks performance measures for results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States Postal Service (Service) has developed a highly complex  infrastructure that includes about 450 plants that process and distribute an  average of 660 million pieces of mail per day. To meet its universal service  obligation, which requires it to provide mail delivery services to all people  residing in the United States, the Service delivered mail to over 142 million  addresses in fiscal year 2004. This represented an increase in addresses  over fiscal year 2003 of 1.8 million. Mail processing costs amount to about  $20 billion annually, while annual transportation costs are about $5 billion.  The Service is subject to a mandate to break even that requires that postal  rates and fees shall provide sufficient revenues so that the Service\u2019s total  estimated income and appropriations will equal as nearly as practicable its  total estimated costs. For the first time in its history, the Service  experienced declining First-Class Mail volumes for 3 years in a row. This  trend is expected to continue and raises specific concerns, since  traditionally First-Class Mail provided high revenue-per-piece, which helps  cover the Service\u2019s institutional expenses. Another challenge is that  compensation costs, which account for over 79 percent of the Service\u2019s  total costs, grew 3 percent from fiscal year 2003 to 2004 while the number  of full-time employees decreased. This increase in compensation costs is  due in part to healthcare benefits that increased 7 percent over the same  period. With major changes that affect its mail processing operations,  including declining mail volumes, increasing compensation costs, and a  more competitive marketplace, the need for the Service to increase  efficiency and reduce expenses has become more urgent.", "In April 2002, in response to a GAO recommendation, the Service issued a  Transformation Plan that outlined the steps it planned to take to address  the challenges it faced. One key goal cited in the Transformation Plan was  for the Service to become more efficient by standardizing operations and  reducing excess capacity in its mail processing and distribution  infrastructure. Mailer interest groups and a report by the Presidential  Commission on the Postal Service also supported the goal of \u201crightsizing\u201d  the nation\u2019s postal infrastructure; that is, establishing a least-cost network  for the Postal Service and the entire mailing industry while improving  overall efficiency and service.", "To assist Congress in monitoring the Service\u2019s progress in implementing the  realignment of its mail processing and distribution infrastructure, this  report addresses three key objectives. First, it describes major business  and demographic changes and the effect of these changes on the Service\u2019s  mail processing and distribution infrastructure. Second, it describes the  actions the Service is taking to achieve a more efficient and flexible  network in response to these changes, and the challenges associated with  implementing these actions. Finally, it discusses the Service\u2019s strategy for  realigning its infrastructure.", "To address these objectives, we interviewed mailing industry associations,  postal officials at Service headquarters, and employee union  representatives about their views of the major changes affecting mail  processing and distribution operations and infrastructure, as well as the  Service\u2019s plans, strategy, and progress to realign its infrastructure. We also  visited several Service mail processing plants to observe operations and  interviewed plant managers in the Pacific, Southeastern, Eastern, and  Capital Metro areas about their efforts to improve efficiency. We analyzed  Service productivity data and documentation related to its productivity and  efficiency improvement efforts, including plans and implementation  schedules. We also reviewed Service documents related to its  infrastructure realignment and discussed the direction and progress of its  realignment efforts with the Service\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, the area vice  presidents, and other senior management officials involved in this effort.  We assessed the reliability of the Service\u2019s data used in our assessment of  productivity and efficiency and found it reasonable for our purposes. We  conducted our review at Service headquarters and field locations between  April 2004 and January 2005 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. A more detailed discussion of our  objectives, scope, and methodology is included in appendix I. We requested  comments on a draft of this report from the Service and its comments are  discussed later in this report and reproduced in appendix IV."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Service\u2019s mail processing and distribution infrastructure, whereby mail  is prepared for sorting on automation equipment by applying a barcode,  sorted through various processing equipment, and transported between  plants, consists of interdependent networks where operations in one part  affect operations throughout. For example, if mail processing is delayed in  one plant and misses the cut-off time for being loaded onto trucks for  distribution, transportation will not be fully used because the trucks will  leave without that mail. Subsequent processing will also be affected at  plants that will receive this mail. In addition, the Service\u2019s infrastructure is  part of a larger economic sector commonly referred to as the mailing  industry. According to research conducted by the Mailing Industry Task  Force, the Service, and the Direct Marketing Association, the core mailing  industry is a $976 billion industry comprised of the Service, its competitors,  direct and indirect mailers, and mail intensive business segments such as  mail order, publishing, and printing houses. This industry accounts for 9  million domestic jobs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Mailers  generally use one of the four major classes of mail:   First-Class Mail consists mainly of bills, bill payments, correspondence,  and advertising and also includes the expedited product, Priority Mail;   Periodicals Mail encompasses mainly magazines and local newspapers;   Standard Mail is primarily bulk advertising and direct mail solicitations;   Package Services Mail includes parcels, merchandise, catalogs, media,  and books.", "Tables 1 and 2 describe the major types of businesses that make up the  mailing industry and how they generally interact with the Postal Service.", "The Service processes mail through its nationwide infrastructure according  to shape and class of mail. There are three basic mail shapes (1) letters,  which are small rectangular pieces no thicker than 1/4 inch; (2) flats, which  are rectangular pieces no thicker than 3/4 inch; and (3) parcels, which are  three-dimensional pieces weighing up to 70 pounds.", "The Service established national service standards over 30 years ago that  direct how many days it should take mail to reach its destination,  depending on its origin and mail class. For example, First-Class Mail has  service standards of overnight, 2 and 3 days depending on the distance it  has to travel. In addition, the Service developed class-specific processing  networks to process specific types of mail including:   a Processing and Distribution Center (P&DC) network that primarily  processes First-Class Mail, Periodicals, and some parcels, as well as  some Standard Mail;   a Priority Mail Processing Center (PMPC) network that processes   a Bulk Mail Center (BMC) network that processes bulk Standard Mail  and parcels.", "Each of these networks uses separate processing and distribution plants as  described in table 3.", "First-Class Mail is collected from mailboxes, houses, or post offices and  transported to a P&DC or deposited directly at the P&DC by the mailer.  Depending on where the mail originates from (origination) and where it is  being delivered to (destination), this mail can be processed in multiple  plants. It may be transported (1) directly between P&DCs, (2) through a  hub and spoke plant, (3) through an air mail center, or (4) through a  combination of these. Once the mail has reached the destination P&DC, the  mail is transported to a delivery unit for carrier delivery. For example, a  birthday card mailed from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento, CA, would be  mailed as First-Class Mail and might follow these steps:  1. picked up from mailbox by carrier and brought to local post office;  2. transported to Suburban Maryland P&DC where the postage stamp is  cancelled and a barcode reflecting the proper destination is applied to  the mailpiece so it can be sorted according to destination;  3. 4. flown to San Francisco, CA;  5. transported to San Francisco Air Mail Center where it is sorted to the  proper destination plant; 6. transported to West Sacramento P&DC where it is sorted into delivery  order; and 7. transported to local post office to be picked up by carrier and delivered  to addressee.", "Priority Mail can either be processed in the Priority Mail network or in the  P&DC network similar to First-Class Mail. For example, legal documents  sent Priority Mail from Rochester, NY, to Sacramento, CA, might follow  these steps: 1. transported from local post office to Rochester Priority Mail Processing  Center where it is separated from local Priority Mail and sorted  according to destination; 2. transported to Rochester Air Mail Center where it is assigned to a  specific flight; 3. flown to San Francisco, CA;  4. transported to San Francisco Air Mail Center where it is sorted to  proper destination plant; and 5. transported to West Sacramento P&DC where it is sorted into delivery  order; and 6. transported to local post office to be picked up by carrier and delivered  to addressee.", "Discount mailings (Standard Mail, bulk parcels, etc.) can enter the bulk  mail network by being weighed and paid for at the mailer\u2019s plant through a  detached mail unit, or at a postal plant through a Business Mail Entry Unit.  A mailing is initially processed at the bulk mail center where it was entered,  and then pieces are transported to the bulk mail center in the area where it  will be delivered. To receive additional discounts or achieve faster delivery  time, the mailer can enter mail closer to its destination. This is called  dropshipping. For example, a Standard Mail advertisement dropshipped  from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento, CA, might follow this path:  1. accepted into mailstream through detached mail unit at a mailer\u2019s plant  in Washington, D.C.; 2. transported by mailer to the West Sacramento P&DC and sorted into  delivery order; and  3. transported to local post office to be picked up by carrier and delivered  to addressee.", "Figure 1 depicts how mail flows through these networks, while figure 2  maps the location of the Service\u2019s processing and distribution plants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Changes Have Impacted the Service\u2019s Mail Processing and Distribution Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Since the U.S. Post Office Department was reorganized into the U.S. Postal  Service by the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, there have been several  major changes, the effects of which include excess capacity in the mail  processing and distribution infrastructure, as well as productivity  differences among plants. These changes include:   changes in the marketplace and the role of industry that have resulted in  declines in mail volume and changes in mail mix;   the evolution of the Service\u2019s processing and distribution infrastructure,  and the advent of processing automation, that has led to an  infrastructure consisting of processing and distribution plants that differ  markedly from one another; and  changes in demographics and modes of transportation that affect the  optimal location of the Service\u2019s plants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changing Marketplace Has Led to Changes in Mail Volume and Mail Mix", "paragraphs": ["Changes in the marketplace, including the substitution of electronic  communication for First-Class Mail, shifts in how customers use the mail,  increased competition in overnight mail and package services, and the  changing role of mailers, have led to changes in mail volume and mix.  These changes have intensified the Service\u2019s future financial challenges.  Historically, the Service\u2019s business model depended on revenues from  increasing mail volumes to cover its expanding infrastructure. This model  has proven more difficult to sustain because of the decreasing mail  volumes, particularly in First-Class Mail. As the Service\u2019s Chief Financial  Officer stated, \u201cthis shift in mail mix to lower revenue-per-piece mail  classes will result in shrinking margins, which are used to maintain  universal service.\u201d"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Electronic Diversion Has Led to Decreases in First-Class Mail Volume", "paragraphs": ["First-Class Mail volume, the class that contributes the majority of revenue  to institutional costs, declined 5 percent from fiscal year 2000 to 2004 and  this downward trend is expected to continue. The Service has attributed  the declining First-Class Mail volume to the impact of electronic diversion  as businesses, nonprofit organizations, governments, and households  increasingly automate their financial transactions and divert  correspondence to the Internet. For example, electronic bill payment  allows users to pay bills using the Internet rather than sending checks  through the mail. In 2003, the majority of noncash payments were made  electronically; just 3 years earlier the majority had been made by check.  Recent Federal Reserve studies found that the number of checks paid in  the United States has continued to decline since it peaked in the mid-1990s.  There were nearly 50 billion checks paid in 1995. By 2000, that number had  declined to 41.9 billion and by 2003 that number had dropped to 36.7  billion. Between 2000 and 2003, electronic payments increased from 30.6  billion to 44.5 billion, an increase of over 45 percent. Further, recent  legislation that became effective October 28, 2004, is intended to improve  the efficiency of check processing and may reduce reliance on the physical  movement of checks through the mail. It is likely that this change will  accelerate the decline in First-Class Mail volume."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shift in Mail Usage Has Led to Challenges in Revenue Generation", "paragraphs": ["As a result of declining First-Class Mail volumes and the lower revenue per  piece provided by Standard advertising mail volumes, the Service will be  challenged to generate sufficient revenue to cover institutional costs.

According to postal officials, Standard  Mail volume is projected to be greater than First-Class Mail volume by  fiscal year 2005.", "In fiscal year 2003, combined First-Class Mail and Standard Mail accounted  for almost 94 percent of the Service\u2019s total mail volume. It takes  approximately 2.5 pieces of Standard Mail to make up for the lost  contribution from 1 piece of First-Class Mail. During fiscal year 2003, First- Class Mail declined by 3.3 billion pieces, resulting in a loss in revenue to be  contributed toward institutional costs (contribution) of $675 million, while  Standard Mail increased by 3.1 billion pieces for a gain in contribution of  $256 million. The net loss in contribution from these two classes in fiscal  year 2003 was $419 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Competition in Packages and Overnight Mail Have Hurt Mail Volume", "paragraphs": ["Competition in the overnight and package business is increasing. In 1971,  the Service and United Parcel Service each had roughly a 50 percent share  of the national parcel market. FedEx entered the parcel ground delivery  market with the acquisition of Caliber in 1998 and, by 2001, the Service\u2019s  share of the parcel ground market had slipped to less than 10 percent. In  addition, the Service\u2019s market share of overnight and 2 and 3 day air  package services decreased between fiscal years 2000 and 2003. As seen in  figure 4, volume for the Service\u2019s products in this category, Priority Mail  and Express Mail has declined precipitously in recent years.", "Over the past 30 years, the role of mailers has changed, leading to further  shifts in the mail mix. This change is due in large part to the advent of the  Service\u2019s worksharing discounts. Postal worksharing activities generally  involve mailers preparing, barcoding, sorting, or transporting mail to  qualify for reduced postage rates. Key worksharing activities include (1)  barcoding and preparing mail so the Service can sort it on automated  equipment; (2) presorting mail, such as by ZIP Code or specific delivery  location; and (3) entering mail closer to destination, commonly referred to  as dropshipping. The first of many presort and automation worksharing  discounts was introduced in 1976, followed by dropship discounts for  periodicals in 1985, and Standard Mail in 1991. Presorting and barcoding by  mailers allows the Service to avoid primary sorting activities, while  dropshipping allows it to avoid transporting mail as well. For example,  prior to dropshipping, mail entered the infrastructure at the point of origin.  Dropshipping allows the mailer a discount for bypassing the origination  plant and transporting the mail closer to its destination point.", "Presort discounts spawned the mail consolidation business, whereby  consolidators gather mail from many different mailers, sort it, and convey it  to the Service for final delivery. The dropship discounts were the catalyst  for major growth within the consolidation business. As seen in figure 5,  virtually all of the growth in volume since 1972 is in workshared mail.  Worksharing contributes to excess capacity because mail volume bypasses  operations that occur early in the processing and, in some cases, as with  dropshipping, mail volumes bypass entire plants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Evolution of the Service\u2019s Processing and Distribution Infrastructure Has Resulted in Markedly Different Plants", "paragraphs": ["The Service\u2019s mail processing and distribution infrastructure has developed  over time resulting in an infrastructure comprised of plants that are  markedly different from one another. This evolution has resulted in some  plants\u2019 inability to accommodate processing equipment because the floor  space requirements differ for manual and automated processing; and the  plants were not originally designed to house the advanced technology.  Also, some plants exclusively process certain types of mail, which has  driven up the cost per piece for those types of mail. Today, the Service\u2019s  mail processing and distribution infrastructure includes plants that range in  age from 2 to 72 years old, range in square footage from 455 square feet to  1,538,494 square feet, have different layouts, serve different processing  functions, and do not share the same amount and type of processing  equipment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Plants Have Had to Accommodate Equipment in Buildings That Were Not Designed to House the Technology", "paragraphs": ["Originally, the Service developed mail processing and distribution plants to  manually sort mail using pigeonhole cases. The Service took major steps  toward mechanizing plants in the mid-1950s with the introduction of the  letter sorting machine. The letter sorting machine required an operator to  read the address on an envelope and key the information into a console. A  conveyor belt system then directed the piece to the appropriate receptacle  for the address. In the early 1980s, the Service began replacing the  mechanized letter sorters with automated systems that used optical  character readers rather than manual keying of addresses. The concept of  mechanized sorting was expanded to include flats in the 1980s. The Service  recently deployed automated flat sorters and has begun deploying  automated parcel sorting equipment. Figure 6 depicts the evolution of mail  processing operations.", "The floor space required to accommodate automation equipment is  different than that needed to accommodate manual or mechanized sorting  equipment, and not all plants have room for new equipment that could  increase efficiency. As seen in figure 7, many of the Service\u2019s plants were  built prior to the advent of automation. Therefore, some plants may not  have enough floor space to accommodate the newer equipment.", "Some plants are part of dedicated networks that exclusively process  certain types of mail and have resulted in higher costs. The Service  developed dedicated mail processing networks within its infrastructure to  process certain classes of mail, including a bulk mail network and a  Priority Mail network. In general, by law, each postal product must cover  the costs attributable to provision of that product plus a reasonable amount  of institutional costs. Consequently, when a network is dedicated to only  one type of mail, that type of mail must bear the costs of the dedicated  network. In addition, with a dedicated network, transportation capacity  utilization is limited to the amount of mail that is traveling through the  dedicated network and redundancies can occur. For example, Priority and  Standard Mail may be traveling through the same area and may even use  the same roads; however, because they are processed in separate  networks, they do not travel on the same truck. Therefore, two trucks that  are 50 percent full might make the trip rather than one truck that is 100  percent full.", "In the 1970s, the Service developed a bulk mail network to maintain its  share of the parcel market against United Parcel Service, and built 21  plants to process and distribute parcels. These plants also process sacks of  bulk Standard Mail. As operations have evolved over 30 years, the BMCs  have encountered a number of difficulties in trying to process the mail  efficiently. Furthermore, bulk Standard Mail is increasingly bypassing the  BMC network through dropshipping.", "Bulk letter mail, which first enters the bulk mail network in sacks or trays,  can be processed more efficiently through automated letter sorters when it  reaches the processing and distribution plants if it is presented in trays  rather than sacks. Consequently, the Service made a concerted effort to  move mail out of sacks and into trays. However, this move caused  problems for the BMCs, which used sack-sorting machines. During our  visits to postal plants, managers told us that sack-sorting machines were  not designed to process rectangular trays. Sorting trays on the sack sorters  often resulted in trays, which carry an average of 500 pieces of mail,  breaking open and spilling mail over the conveyor belt. Consequently, the  sack sorter had to be turned off while the individual mail pieces were  collected and either sent to a P&DC for processing or processed on  equipment that had been brought into the BMC specifically to deal with this  problem. The BMCs were told by headquarters to remove all trays from  automated equipment beginning in October 2004, and some BMCs are now  processing the trays manually, which results in an increase in workhours.", "In addition, changes in the way trucks are loaded and unloaded have  affected dock space at the BMCs. For example, when trucks were loaded at  processing plants by manually stacking packages inside the truck  (bedloaded), it took 8 hours to unload a truck filled to capacity. Today, the  Service uses automated loading machines that fill containers with  packages, which are then loaded by forklift into the trucks. Trucks are  unloaded by forklift, and automated equipment dumps the containers  directly onto the conveyor belts that lead to the sorting equipment. Using  this procedure it only takes 30 minutes to unload the same amount of mail.  Figure 8 depicts the difference between bedloaded and container-stacked  truckloads. While this has been a great improvement in workhour savings,  BMCs now have problems storing all the mail because of limited dock  space. We also observed and were told that some of the equipment in the  BMCs is so old that it cannot run at full capacity and in some cases was not  being used. For example, in one BMC the tow-line\u2014used for transporting  mail throughout the building\u2014was shut down 18 years ago because it  needed constant repairs. Consequently, mail is moved between operations  either manually or using forklifts and tow trucks.", "The Service also has a dedicated network for its expedited product,  Priority Mail, which has driven up the cost of Priority Mail and led to  declines in volume. In 1997, the Service awarded a 5-year contract to Emery  to develop a PMPC network on the east coast to improve Priority Mail\u2019s  service performance. The Service also contracted with Emery to provide a  dedicated transportation network for Priority Mail. Because the network  only processed Priority Mail, all of the costs were borne by Priority Mail  users. Large rate increases in 1999, 2001, and 2002 for Priority Mail, coupled  with service problems, contributed to a 31 percent decline in Priority Mail  volume from fiscal year 2000 to 2004. Table 4 shows rate increases and mail  volumes. Consequently, the Service cancelled its processing and  transportation contract with Emery in 2001, absorbed the processing back  into its infrastructure, and contracted with FedEx for transportation  services. While the Service is still processing Priority Mail in PMPCs, it is  moving Priority Mail operations into other processing plants. It has also  begun converting some PMPCs to Logistics and Distribution Centers  (L&DC), which process multiple types of mail, and according to Service  officials, it is the Service\u2019s intent to eventually convert all PMPCs to L&DCs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Postal Service Plants May Not Be Optimally Located Due to Changes in Demographics and Transportation", "paragraphs": ["Due to population shifts, household growth, and the changing  transportation landscape in the United States, Service plants may not be  optimally located. The Service stated in September 2003 that, \u201cpopulation  shifts, changes in mail processing technology, and external events that  occurred during the last two years, have required dramatic shifts in  operating conditions resulting in rising costs to maintain the existing  network.\u201d", "Most Service processing plants are located in eastern states\u2014states that  historically have had the highest populations. During the 1990s, U.S.  household growth trends began moving west and south, with Nevada and  Arizona ranking as the two fastest growing states in the nation. As seen in  figure 9, the majority of the Service\u2019s processing plants are located in states  whose household growth is not as rapid as others. The Service has said that  the operational challenge it faces in 2004 and beyond is to locate  processing plants and employees within efficient reach of most of the  population, while at the same time providing universal service to the rest of  the nation at reasonable cost.", "Additionally, Service processing plants built in the first half of the 20th  century were built near major railroad stations. In 1930, the bulk of  domestic mail was moved by rail on over 10,000 trains nationwide. In 1965,  only 190 passenger trains carried mail, and by 1970, virtually no First-Class  Mail was carried by rail. In September 2004, Amtrak announced that it  would discontinue transporting mail for the Service. Changes have also  taken place in the Service\u2019s use of air transportation. As a result of the  September 11, 2001, attacks, new federal aviation security restrictions  prohibited the transportation of mail weighing more than 16 ounces on  commercial flights. As a result, the majority of the mail previously  transported by commercial air has shifted to surface transportation or is  flown by FedEx. Ongoing shifts in transportation have created an  environment where most mail is now moved by highway and air, and some  processing plants would be better located so that major highways and  airports are easily accessible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes Have Contributed to Variations in Productivity Among Processing Plants and Excess Capacity", "paragraphs": ["The changing marketplace, evolution of mail processing, and shifts in  demographics have contributed to variations in productivity across plants  and excess capacity. The growth in infrastructure over time has resulted in  differences in processing plants and contributed to variations in  productivity and cost among plants. The decline in mail volume and the  evolution of mail processing have contributed to excess capacity.", "Productivity Varies among Plants Average productivity\u2014total pieces processed per hour\u2014varies among the  Service\u2019s mail processing and distribution plants, which indicates that  some plants are not processing mail as efficiently as others. Service  officials have attributed this variation to several factors, including size of  plant as measured by workload, number of employees, layout of plants, and  the use of nonstandardized processes. An analysis of productivity data for  processing and distribution plants for fiscal year 2004 indicates that none  of these factors, in isolation, can explain the variations; rather, as seen in  table 5, it seems that plants with low productivity exhibit a number of  contributing factors. For example, according to a Western Area Postal  Service official, the processing plant in Spokane, WA, is one of the most  productive plants because the plant is new, all operations are performed on  one floor, and it has an automated system to transport mail among the  different operations. The processing plant in Des Moines, IA, on the other  hand, has very low productivity. This plant is 50 years old, has multiple  floors where processing occurs, does not have enough dock space, and  does not have adequate floor space for new processing equipment.", "According to Service managers, a plant\u2019s annual workload impacts its  productivity. The Service classifies its plants based on the number of  workhours that should be required to process the plant\u2019s annual workload  (earned hours). The classifications are small\u2014295,000 or less earned  workhours, medium\u2014between 295,001 and 680,000 earned workhours, and  large\u2014more than 680,000 earned workhours. According to the managers,  small plants are more efficient then larger plants because operations at  small plants are not as complex as operations at larger plants and large  plants often have additional responsibilities. For example, one plant  manager told us that the plant he had previously managed had a large  contingency of mail carriers that operated out of it in addition to the plant\u2019s  processing duties, which lead to space constraints. Larger plants often  consolidate and sort mail from smaller plants, which makes sorting  schemes more complicated and requires additional workhours to  accommodate the increased complexity. However, as seen in figure 10,  there are also large gaps in productivity among the plants within each size  classification. Therefore, it appears size, as measured by workload, is only  one contributing factor to the variation in productivity among plants.", "Service officials also told us that the size of the workforce employed at a  plant impacts the plant\u2019s productivity. According to these officials, plants  with large numbers of employees have lower productivity than plants with  fewer employees because with fewer employees, management has better  visibility and therefore better control over its operations. Plants with fewer  employees also have fewer layers of management and more direct manager  to employee contact. One manager, who had managed both large and small  plants, told us that productivity increases can be attributed to making sure  employees are doing what they are suppose to be doing and that this is  easier to manage with a smaller number of employees. Table 6 shows the  average productivity for plants broken down by number of employees.", "Another factor, according to Service officials, is the physical layout of  plants, particularly when plants are multistoried, because more time is  spent moving mail between floors and among operations. For example, one  multi-story plant that we visited has a number of difficulties in processing  mail. Currently, the plant receives mail on the first floor, transports the mail  to the third floor where it is cancelled, then sends the mail to the second  floor for processing, and then back to the first floor for outgoing trucks.  Due to cost constraints, the plant does not have an automated system to  transport mail among the different floors and all mail must be moved  among the floors by elevator. Unfortunately, many of the elevators are  continually out of service. According to the manager at the plant, there are  13 elevators in the building and on a good day, 8 elevators are working.  Consequently, according to the manager, more workhours are used to move  mail around and prepare it for operations then would be used in a single- floor plant. This lowers productivity and increases the plant\u2019s processing  costs. Figure 11 depicts the processing of a letter at a multistory plant  versus a single-floor plant.", "The Service has 40 multistory processing plants across the country. The  average productivity at multistory plants in fiscal year 2004 was 1,381  pieces per hour, while in single floor plants it was 1,828 pieces per hour.  However, as seen in figure 12, there was a large gap between the  productivity at the most productive multistory plant and the productivity at  the least productive multistory plant in fiscal years 2001 through 2004.  While overall productivity improved for all plants between fiscal years 2001  and 2004, the gap in productivity also increased from 1,395 fewer pieces per  hour processed at the least productive plant than the most productive in  2001 to 1,524 fewer pieces in 2004.", "Another factor in the productivity variation between plants is that the  Service does not have standardized processes across plants. Consequently,  one plant may be using a very efficient method to sort mail while another  plant may be using a less efficient method. For example, table 7 shows the  productivity of common automated mail processing operations varies by  area (the Service has divided its national network into nine geographic  areas).  evolution of mail processing operations from manual to automation  equipment have led to excess capacity. There are different types of excess  capacity including:  excess workhours, which occur when more workhours are used than  are necessary for processing the mail;   excess physical infrastructure, which occurs when more square footage  is available for processing mail than is necessary (this may include  entire plants);   excess transportation capacity, which occurs when trucks are run at  less than full capacity; and  excess machine hours, which occur when machines sit idle.", "Declines in mail volume have led to excess equipment capacity because  less mail is being processed on the same amount of equipment. As stated  earlier, worksharing contributes to all types of excess capacity because  more mail volume is bypassing Service operations that occur early in the  process, such as cancellation and initial sorting. In the case of  dropshipping, volumes of mail bypass entire plants. With automation, mail  can be sorted faster than with manual processing. This has led to earlier  processing completion times and higher productivities. On average, 525  pieces of letter mail can be sorted in 1 hour using manual processing  operations, while 8,171 letters can be sorted in 1 hour using automated  processes. Consequently, mail no longer needs to be processed on all plant  shifts and equipment is being used fewer hours a day. Advancements in  technology have also lessened the need for certain types of plants, such as  air mail centers and remote encoding centers\u2014which are separate plants  established to perform address barcoding on letters that could not be read  by the automated equipment in the mail processing plants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Service Is Pursuing Several Initiatives in Response to Changes but Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["To achieve a more efficient and flexible infrastructure in response to  changes in the marketplace, the evolution of the mail processing  infrastructure, and shifts in demographics, the Service is exploring broad  infrastructure realignment, while at the same time pursuing several  initiatives to address inefficiencies in its current infrastructure.

The Service has also taken some concrete steps to  realign its infrastructure by closing some processing annexes, approving  construction on plants in certain locations, and consolidating operations in  various plants. In addition, the Service is pursuing several initiatives to  improve efficiency in its current infrastructure. It is expanding automation,  improving material handling operations, creating a comprehensive  transportation network, and introducing standardization programs in an  effort to reduce workhours and increase productivity.

By November 2003, the Service  had collected detailed operational and volume data and had developed  data-based models. In January 2004, the Service reported that the models  were being tested and validated. Since then, there has been little public  information on the results of these models or the Service\u2019s implementation  plans.", "The Service has also begun closing annexes\u2014temporary plants used for  mail operations when space is limited\u2014 and consolidating mail processing  operations in order to address the issue of excess capacity.

Consequently, it is unclear whether the Service is  incorporating its future infrastructure needs into its current projects.", "Between fiscal year 2002 and 2004, the Service closed 50 annexes.  According to Postal Service officials, decisions to close annexes are based  on volume and do not take future network configuration into  consideration. Because annexes are usually staffed by temporary  employees, for whom the Service does not have the same notification and  reassignment requirements as it does for permanent employees, they are  easier to close than other plants and the closing can be done relatively  quickly and with little controversy. Also, while most processing plants are  owned by the Service, most annexes are leased and therefore can be closed  without having to dispose of the asset. Table 8 shows the number of plants  and annexes owned and leased by the Service.", "However, according to Service officials, closing annexes is a short-term  solution. In some cases, the Service is planning on eliminating certain types  of plants altogether. For example, the Service\u2019s Chief Operating Officer told  us that there is no longer a need for processing mail at air mail centers  because, due to technological advances, mail can be assigned to specific  flights right at the mail processing and distribution plants. The leases for air  mail centers are typically very expensive; and in many areas of the country,  the Service is considering closing down the plants as the leases expire.  Another example is the reduction and eventual elimination of the separate  address barcoding centers, remote encoding centers. Enhancements in the  ability of automation equipment to read addresses have now significantly  reduced the need for remote encoding centers. Initially, the Service had 55  of these centers and is now down to 17.", "In several areas, rather than closing entire plants, the Service has  consolidated sorting operations at several plants into one plant. For  example, in the Pacific Area, Saturday mail processing has been  consolidated from 23 plants to 11 plants. An area official told us that the  consolidation effort began a few years ago in response to volume declines.  The official pointed out that consolidation of Saturday mail processing  reduces processing costs, but may increase transportation costs because  the mail has to be rerouted to the plant that is processing the consolidated  volumes. The Service is able to consolidate Saturday processing because  there is no delivery on Sunday. Therefore, the Service can reroute the mail  and still meet its service standards. Officials in other areas told us that they  are also consolidating Saturday processing. While efforts to close plants  and consolidate operations have taken place, the Service has not provided  any public information on its future closings and consolidations, nor does it  have a standard procedure in place for closing plants, and instead operates  on a case-by-case basis.", "The Service has begun constructing, or has approved funding for the  construction of new plants because, as stated earlier, some plants cannot  accommodate necessary equipment, do not have room for current  operations, or are not optimally located. For example, in Philadelphia, the  Service is building a new processing and distribution center to replace the  current one, which was built in 1935 and consists of two four-story  buildings connected by a bridge. Mail at this plant is processed on separate  floors and is moved between operations using elevators. The new plant will  be two stories but will have a tray management system that will assist in  moving the trays between the floors. It will also be able to accommodate  mail-processing equipment that will not fit in the current plant and will  have more dock space.

This mail costs the Service approximately $1.8 billion a year.  Currently, undeliverable-as-addressed mail is processed to the delivery unit  where the carrier identifies the piece as undeliverable. The mail is then  transported to a Computerized Forwarding System site, where the  undeliverable-as-addressed mail is manually keyed and redirected for  processing to the correct location. This means that each piece is essentially  processed twice, resulting in increased costs. To address this expenditure,  the Service is deploying software technology called the Postal Automated  Redirection System.

In 1982, the Service began moving  flats out of manual processing by introducing mechanized sorting  machines. However, the Service experienced problems with the  mechanized machines, including frequent jams and high maintenance  costs. Many of these problems were due to mail pieces that were wrapped  in plastic, or too flimsy to be processed on the equipment, and resulted in  an increase in the unit mail processing cost for flat mail, particularly  periodicals. In fiscal year 1996, the Service began replacing the older  machines with a flat sorting machine (FSM 1000) that, although still not  automated, was designed to handle pieces wrapped in plastic and less rigid  pieces. In 2000, the Service also introduced an automated flat sorting  machine (AFSM 100) that contains an automated flat feeder and optical  recognition technology to read addresses. In plants that do not have  enough flat volume to justify deployment of the AFSM 100, the Service is  modifying the existing FSM 1000 to include scanning capabilities that  replace the need for manual keying. The AFSM 100 has a throughput rate of  17,000 or more flat pieces of mail per hour, which is more then twice as fast  as the FSM 1000. As seen in table 9, the higher throughput results in higher  productivity than manual or mechanized operations.", "While the AFSM 100 has a faster throughput for processing flat mail than its  predecessor, when it was first deployed, mailers experienced problems  with the feeder system ripping the covers, which generally contain  addresses, off of magazines. Consequently, subscribers were not receiving  their magazines or were receiving just the cover. The Service is currently  working to enhance the feeders with upgrades designed to significantly  decrease the amount of damage. In addition, the equipment requires many  workhours to prepare the mail to be fed through the machine. Therefore,  some of the benefit of the increased productivity may be lost. For example,  most mail that will be processed on the AFSM 100, must first be stacked  into a flat mail cart, which takes 40 minutes for one employee to fill. Due to  the speed at which the AFSM 100 can process flats, six carts have to be  manually prepared for each hour the AFSM 100 is run, resulting in a  significant amount of workhours needed to prepare the flat mail and square  footage needed to store the prepared mail waiting to be processed on the  equipment. The Service has said that it is exploring ways to automate and  standardize the mail preparation process to reduce workhours. Figure 13  shows empty flat mail carts and the space needed to store them and the  volume of flat mail in a flat mail cart when it is full.", "Unlike letter mail that is sorted on automated sorting machines into the  order the mail will be delivered on the carrier route (delivery point  sequence), flat mail must be sorted manually by the carrier into delivery  order. The Service is exploring automation that would sort flat mail into  delivery sequence order to reduce the need for the carrier to sort flats in  the office and technology that would package flat and letter mail together  for delivery operations to eliminate carrier sorting. While this technology is  still in the research and development stage, it could eventually have a  significant effect on the Service\u2019s infrastructure and on operations and mail  processing across the entire postal network including how mailers prepare  and present their mail to the Service.

For example, several Service managers told us that it  is difficult for them to move excess employees to positions where they are  needed because of these workforce rules. These workforce rules include  steps to be followed when eliminating positions, and rules regarding  transferring employees between positions, such as clerks, mailhandlers,  and carriers. When transferring between positions, employees will often  lose their seniority so they elect not to transfer. Therefore, if a plant has too  many clerks and not enough mailhandlers, it cannot simply move some  clerks to mailhandler positions. In addition, moving employees between  plants requires the Service to follow specific steps that often limit  managers\u2019 flexibility. One area vice president told us that it is very  challenging to move employees from one plant to another. For example,  this vice president had worked out an agreement between the regional  unions to allow employees to move from a plant that had too many  employees to a plant with too few.

The workforce contracts also  include \u201cno layoff\u201d clauses and procedures that must be followed when  plants are closed or tours consolidated, including a formal agreement that  requires 60-days notice whenever the Service is going to close a plant.", "Another obstacle to eliminating excess capacity is the resistance the  Service has historically encountered when it tries to close plants. In each of  the three cases we reviewed, the Service encountered resistance to its  plans to close plants. For example:   When the Service wanted to move operations from the Pendleton, OR,  plant to nearby Pasco, WA, because of equipment limitations in  Pendleton, many people protested. Local congressional representatives  made a formal request to the Service not to close the plant. In response,  the Service modified the equipment to fit into the existing plant.", "When the Service considered moving the business mail entry unit from  St. Paul, MN, to Minneapolis, MN, because of security concerns and  cramped plant space, local union members and representatives got  involved and urged the Service to reconsider. Although none of the 30  employees at the St. Paul plant would have lost their jobs, their  schedules and commutes would have changed. The Service agreed to  delay the closing pending further review.", "At the Marina Del Rey, CA, processing and distribution plant, local  managers began moving some operations out of the plant and  consolidating them with operations at the Los Angeles, CA, plant. Before  any decisions were announced at the headquarters level, word got out  that the plant was being considered for closing. Local unions contacted  local government representatives, and union members picketed the  plant. Some of this resistance was due to the Service\u2019s failure to  communicate with its employees and unions regarding the Marina Del  Rey plant.

In 2002, the Service  announced a strategy for realigning its infrastructure that outlined an  ambitious effort to \u201cinitiate sweeping logistics changes.\u201d According to the  Service, a modeling tool referred to as Network Integration and Alignment  (NIA) was to be used to determine what specific changes would be made.  These changes were to include consolidation of plants, redefined roles for  plants, reduced transportation costs, and a streamlined network. An  implementation plan for this strategy was to be developed by December  2002. However, to date the Service has not developed an implementation  plan. Following a recommendation we made, in November 2003, the  chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and a senator  asked the Service to provide a plan on how it intended to optimize its  infrastructure and workforce that described the criteria, process, and data  the Service was using to make decisions, as well as the strategies, timing,  and funding necessary. In December 2003, the chairmen, and ranking  minority members, of the House Committee on Government Reform and  the Special Panel on Postal Reform and Oversight also asked the Postal  Service to submit a plan on how it intended to fund capital investments  needed to ensure the long-term viability of the Postal Service, including  how the Service intended to rationalize its infrastructure and workforce. In  response, in January 2004, the Service submitted to the House Committee  on Government Reform, a report entitled, Infrastructure and Workforce  Rationalization: Funding Key Capital Investments. This report, which  was not made public by the Postal Service, described a \u201cpromising  alternative\u201d being considered that the Service called a consolidation hub  concept. Under this concept there would be two basic types of facilities,  origination and destination facilities, which would be the initial recipients  of collection mail and the final plant before delivery, and consolidation  hubs where the mail would be consolidated and distributed. According to  the report, \u201cthe major difference between this concept and the current mail  processing environment is that it envisions a single uniform network.\u201d \u201cA couple of years ago there was a lot of fanfare and misunderstanding about a concept  known as \u201cNIA\u201d - Network Integration and Alignment. Many saw it as the ultimate plan to  consolidate and close facilities. Well, it\u2019s not. \u201cWhy? Because nobody can predict 5, 10, or 15 years from now what mail volume will be, or  what type of mail processing equipment we will be using to sort the mail. So we have  decided, instead, to do what we\u2019ve done for decades. That is, take the next step in evolving  our networks, and that\u2019s our E-N-D game -- short for Evolutionary Network Development.  \u201cIt\u2019s an END game that never ends, because rationalizing and optimizing security, plants,  processing systems, transportation, and staffing is something we have to continue to do to  keep our networks efficient and our systems affordable.\u201d", "Neither the Service\u2019s report, the strategy outlined in meetings with Postal  Service officials, or the Postmaster General\u2019s speech sets criteria for  making realignment decisions, nor do they include a process for making  these decisions.

The Service has procedures  that it uses when making decisions to consolidate operations in its mail  processing plants, which are outlined in appendix N of the Transformation  Plan. These procedures include a feasibility study, preparation of proposal  documentation, an approval process, and implementation steps. However,  in discussions with Service officials, we were given vague and confusing  information on the Service\u2019s procedures for closing plants. Consequently, it  is not clear how these procedures relate to the Service\u2019s realignment  strategy, whether these procedures are used when closing plants, are  applicable to all plants, or if these procedures are used consistently. In  addition, the procedures outlined in appendix N lack specificity regarding  who is responsible for initiating proposals,   who conducts feasibility studies and how,   what criteria are used to evaluate proposals,   who is responsible for approving these proposals,   how these proposals are implemented, and  who is held accountable for these decisions.", "It is also unclear how stakeholders are notified, when they are notified, and  by whom."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Attempting to Evaluate the Service\u2019s Strategy We Developed Criteria", "paragraphs": ["In evaluating the Postal Service\u2019s strategy, we established criteria based on  the Service\u2019s stated goals for realignment, our previous work, the  Committee on Government Reform report that accompanied House postal  reform legislation (House Report), the Committee on Governmental Affairs  report that accompanied Senate postal reform legislation (Senate Report),  and the President\u2019s Commission on the United States Postal Service  (Commission) report.

These consolidations have contributed to the Service\u2019s  impressive reduction in workhours over the past 3 years. However,  consolidating shifts may lead to excess capacity in other areas. For  example, if mail is no longer processed on certain shifts this means that the  processing equipment sits idle during that shift. In addition, if several  plants in a particular area have eliminated processing shifts it may be  feasible to consolidate these plants and dispose of excess physical  infrastructure. Due to the Service\u2019s lack of transparency about the results  of its network modeling activities, however, it is difficult to assess the  extent of opportunities for eliminating unnecessary plants. The Service\u2019s  strategy of taking advantage of opportunities as they arise may not result in  consolidations or closings in the areas with the most excess capacity.

For example, the Service has been deploying automation  equipment throughout its network although some of the plants that are  receiving equipment may ultimately be closed, which would necessitate  moving or disposing of the equipment. Similarly, equipment and  transportation costs will be higher than necessary if the network is not as  streamlined and simplified as it could be.
