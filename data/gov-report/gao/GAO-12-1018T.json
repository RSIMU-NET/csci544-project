This statement discusses how NTIA manages spectrum to address governmentwide spectrum needs and the steps NTIA has taken to repurpose spectrum for broadband. As part of an ongoing review, the statement also discusses preliminary information on the factors that prevent spectrum sharing and actions that can encourage sharing and efficient spectrum use.

In 2003, the President directed NTIA to develop plans identifying federal and nonfederal spectrum needs, and in 2008, NTIA issued the federal plan. GAO found it did not identify governmentwide spectrum needs and did not contain key elements and conform to best practices for strategic planning. Furthermore, NTIA\u0092s primary spectrum management operations do not focus on governmentwide needs. Instead, NTIA depends on agency self-evaluation of spectrum needs and focuses on mitigating interference among spectrum users, with limited emphasis on overall spectrum management. Additionally, NTIA\u0092s data management system is antiquated and lacks internal controls to ensure the accuracy of agency-reported data, making it unclear if reliable data inform decisions about federal spectrum use. NTIA is developing a new data management system, but implementation is years away.", "Despite these limitations, NTIA has taken steps to identify spectrum that could potentially be made available for broadband use. For example, in 2010 NTIA evaluated various spectrum bands and identified 115 megahertz of spectrum that could be repurposed within the next 5 years. In doing so, NTIA worked with a special steering group consisting of the Assistant Secretaries with spectrum management oversight in agencies that were the major stakeholders in the spectrum bands under consideration. For each of the identified bands, NTIA reviewed the number of federal frequency assignments within the band, the types of federal operations and functions that the assignments support, and the geographic location of federal use.", "In addition to efforts to repurpose spectrum, industry stakeholders have also suggested that sharing spectrum between federal and nonfederal users be considered to help make spectrum available for broadband. Our ongoing work has identified several barriers that limit sharing. Primarily, many users may lack incentives to share assigned spectrum. Typically, paying the market price for a good or service helps to inform users of the value of the good and provides an incentive for efficient use. But federal agencies pay only a small fee to NTIA for spectrum assignments, and may, in some contexts, have little incentive to conserve or share it. Federal agencies may also have limited budgets to upgrade to more spectrally-efficient equipment that would better enable sharing. Nonfederal users are also reluctant to share spectrum. For instance, license holders may be reluctant because of concerns that spectrum sharing could encourage competition. A lack of information on federal spectrum use may limit users\u0092 ability to easily identify spectrum suitable for sharing.", "GAO\u0092s ongoing work suggests that some actions might provide greater incentives and opportunities for more efficient spectrum use and sharing. These actions could include assessing spectrum usage fees to provide economic incentive for more efficient use and sharing, expanding the availability of unlicensed spectrum, and increasing the federal focus on research and development of technologies that can enable spectrum sharing and improve spectral efficiency. However, all of these actions also involve challenges and may require further study."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on issues related to  spectrum management and spectrum sharing practices in the United  States. Radio frequency spectrum enables wireless communications  services critical to the U.S. economy and a variety of government  functions, such as scientific research and national defense. Spectrum  capacity is necessary to deliver wireless broadband to consumers and  businesses and broadband deployment stimulates economic growth and  boosts the nation\u2019s capabilities in areas such as education and health  care. As the U.S. experiences significant growth in commercial wireless  broadband services, the demand for spectrum has increased and  additional capacity will be needed. However, nearly all usable spectrum  has been allocated either by the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration (NTIA) for federal government use or by the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for commercial and other  nonfederal use. Virtually no \u201cgreen fields\u201d of spectrum are currently  available to allocate to new uses or technologies.", "Currently, federal government initiatives are under way to identify  spectrum that can be made available to meet the nation\u2019s increased  demand for commercial wireless broadband services. In particular, the  National Broadband Plan recommended that 500 megahertz (MHz) of  spectrum be made newly available for broadband use within the next 10  years, and in June 2010, the President issued a memorandum directing  NTIA to begin identifying federal spectrum that can be made available for  wireless broadband. Solutions geared toward greater sharing of  spectrum among users\u2014federal and nonfederal\u2014have become attractive  because of the potential access to more spectrum and opportunities to  use spectrum more efficiently that sharing presents. The President\u2019s  Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recommended  that 1,000 MHz of spectrum previously occupied only by federal users be  shared with nonfederal users.", "GAO, Spectrum Management: NTIA Planning and Processes Need Strengthening to  Promote the Efficient Use of Spectrum by Federal Agencies, GAO-11-352 (Washington,  D.C.: April 12, 2011).

All of our work was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. We provided a draft of this  statement related to spectrum sharing to FCC and NTIA officials to obtain  their comments. FCC and NTIA provided technical corrections, which we  incorporated where appropriate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The radio frequency spectrum is the part of the natural spectrum of  electromagnetic radiation lying between the frequency limits of 3 kilohertz  (kHz) and 300 gigahertz (GHz). Not all spectrum has equal value. The  spectrum most highly valued generally consists of frequencies between  225 MHz and 3700 MHz, as these frequencies have properties well suited  to many important wireless technologies, such as mobile phones, radio,  and television broadcasting. According to NTIA, as of September 2012,  federal agencies had exclusive access to about 18 percent of these high- value frequencies, and nonfederal users had exclusive licenses to about  33 percent. The remainder of this spectrum is allocated to shared use.  However, in many cases in these shared bands, federal or nonfederal  uses may dominate and actual sharing is nominal. NTIA has concluded  that overall, approximately 43 percent of these high-value frequencies are  predominantly used by federal operations.", "Federal agencies use spectrum to help meet a variety of missions,  including emergency communications, national defense, land  management, and law enforcement. Over 60 federal agencies and  departments combined have over 240,000 frequency assignments.  Agencies and departments within the Department of Defense have the  most assignments, followed by the Federal Aviation Administration, the  Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the  Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, U.S. Coast  Guard, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce,  respectively. These federal agencies and departments hold 94 percent of  all federally assigned spectrum. Nonfederal entities (which include  commercial companies and state and local governments) also use  spectrum to provide a variety of services. For example, state and local  police departments, fire departments, and other emergency services  agencies use spectrum to transmit and receive critical voice and data  communications, while commercial entities use spectrum to provide  wireless services, including mobile voice and data, paging, broadcast  radio and television, and satellite services (see fig. 1).", "In the United States, responsibility for spectrum management is divided  between NTIA and FCC. NTIA and FCC jointly determine the amount of  spectrum allocated for federal, nonfederal, and shared use. After this  allocation occurs, in order to use spectrum, nonfederal users must follow  rules and obtain authorizations from FCC to use specific spectrum  frequencies, and federal users must follow rules and obtain frequency  assignments from NTIA. In order for nonfederal users to share federal  spectrum, NTIA and FCC are jointly involved in the process. The  nonfederal party petitions FCC, and FCC in turn coordinates rulemakings  and licenses with NTIA through IRAC. NTIA manages sharing between  federal users on a day-to-day basis. If federal users are requesting  frequency assignments in exclusive nonfederal or shared bands, that  request is coordinated through IRAC with FCC. If sharing is solely  between nonfederal users in exclusive nonfederal bands, sharing is  generally governed by FCC rules and does not go through NTIA, unless  there could be out-of-band interference. In addition to its spectrum  allocation and authorization duties, NTIA serves as the President\u2019s  principal advisor on telecommunications and information policy and  manages federally assigned spectrum, including preparing for,  participating in, and implementing the results of international radio  conferences, as well as conducting extensive research and technical  studies through its research and engineering laboratory, the Institute for  Telecommunication Sciences. NTIA has authority to issue rules and  regulations as may be necessary to ensure the effective, efficient, and  equitable use of spectrum both nationally and internationally. It also has  authority to develop long-range spectrum plans to meet future spectrum  requirements for the federal government.", "Spectrum sharing can be defined as the cooperative use of common  spectrum. In this way, multiple users agree to access the same spectrum  at different times or locations, as well as negotiate other technical  parameters, to avoid adversely interfering with one another. For sharing  to occur, users and regulators must negotiate and resolve where  (geographic sharing), when (sharing in time), and how (technical  parameters) spectrum will be used (see fig. 2).", "Spectrum sharing also occurs with unlicensed use of spectrum, since it is  accessible to anyone using wireless equipment certified by FCC for those  frequencies. Equipment such as wireless microphones, baby monitors,  and garage door openers typically share spectrum with other services on  a non-interference basis using low power levels to avoid interference with  higher priority uses. In contrast with most licensed spectrum use,  unlicensed spectrum users have no regulatory protection against  interference from other licensed or unlicensed users in the band.  However, unlicensed use is regulated to ensure that unlicensed devices  do not cause undue interference to operations with a higher priority. For  example, in the 5 GHz band, wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) devices share a  band with military radar subject to the condition that the Wi-Fi devices are  capable of spectrum sensing and dynamic frequency selection; if radar is  detected, the unlicensed user must immediately vacate the channel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NTIA\u2019s Processes for Managing Federal Spectrum Lack Governmentwide Focus and Accountability", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NTIA\u2019s Spectrum Management Efforts", "paragraphs": ["As the federal agency authorized to develop national spectrum policy,  NTIA has been directed to conduct several projects focused on reforming  governmentwide federal spectrum management and promoting efficiency  among federal users of spectrum; however, we reported in 2011 that its  efforts in this area had resulted in limited progress toward improved  spectrum management.

From an economic  perspective, when a consumer pays the market price for a good or  service and thus cannot get more of it without this expense, the consumer  has an incentive to get the most value and efficiency out of the good as  possible. If no price is attached to a good\u2014which is essentially the case  with federal agencies\u2019 use of spectrum\u2014the normal market incentive to  use the good efficiently may be muted. In the case of federal spectrum  users, obtaining new spectrum assignments may be difficult, so an  agency may have an incentive to conserve and use the spectrum it  currently has assigned to it or currently shares efficiently, but the extent of  that incentive is likely weaker than if the agency had had to pay a market  price for the all of their spectrum needs. As such, federal spectrum users  do not fully face a market incentive to conserve on their use of spectrum  or use it in an efficient manner. The full market value of the spectrum  assigned to federal agencies has not been assessed, but, according to  one expert, would most likely be valued in the tens of billions of dollars.  Similarly, many nonfederal users, such as television broadcasters and  public safety entities, did not pay for spectrum when it was assigned to  them and do not pay the full market price for their continuing use of  spectrum so, like federal agencies, they may not fully have market-based  incentives to use spectrum efficiently.", "While licensed, commercial users who purchased spectrum at auction  generally have market incentives to use their spectrum holdings  efficiently, these users also have incentives that work against sharing  spectrum, except in those instances where the incumbent licensee is  unlikely to build out its network or offer services to a particular area, such  as in certain remote, sparsely populated areas. FCC officials and industry  stakeholders and experts told us that these users may prefer not to share  their unused spectrum because they are concerned about the potential  for interference to degrade service quality to their customers. Also, they  may prefer to not give potential competitors access to spectrum.

One such barrier is that  federal agencies will not risk mission failure, particularly when there are  security and public safety implications. According to the agency officials  we contacted, federal agencies will typically not agree to share spectrum  if it puts achieving their missions at risk. The officials stressed that when  missions have security and safety implications, sharing may pose  unacceptable risks. For example, the military tests aircraft and trains  pilots over test ranges that can stretch hundreds of miles, maintaining  constant wireless contact. The ranges, according to officials, cannot  share the communication frequencies because even accidental  interference in communications with an aircraft could result in  catastrophic mission failure. Further, sharing information about such  flights could expose particular pilots and aircraft, or the military\u2019s larger  mission, to increased risk.", "According to FCC officials, concerns about risk can drive conservative  technical standards that can make sharing impractical. In general, the  technical analyses and resulting standards are based on worst-case  scenarios, and not on assessments of the most likely scenario or a range  of scenarios. Moreover, in contrast to FCC\u2019s open rulemaking process,  there is little opportunity for public input to the standards setting process.  Stakeholders may meet or have discussions with NTIA and the relevant  federal agencies, but this occurs without any formal public process.

As a result of needing to mitigate inference for multiple  users, costs to share spectrum in that band could increase.", "Federal users often use and rely on proven older technology that was  designed to use spectrum to meet a specific mission and typically is  not conducive to operating as efficiently or flexibly as the state-of-the- art technologies might now allow. Limited budgets may prevent them  from being able to invest in newer technology which can facilitate  easier sharing.", "Additionally, we found that spectrum sharing approval and enforcement  processes can be lengthy and unpredictable. FCC and NTIA processes  can cause two main problems when nonfederal users seek to share  federal spectrum, or when nonfederal users share with one another,  according to stakeholders:", "The spectrum-sharing approval process between FCC and NTIA can  be lengthy and unpredictable, and the risk associated with it can be  costly for new entrants. FCC officials told us that its internal processes  can potentially last years if requiring a rulemaking to accommodate  shared use of spectrum. In addition to that time, NTIA officials said  that IRAC\u2019s evaluation of potential harmful interference could take  months. In one example, the Department of Defense, along with other  federal agencies and nonfederal entities, currently shares a spectrum  band between 413-457 MHz with a nonprofit medical devices provider  for use in implant products for veterans. It took approximately 2 years  (from 2009 to 2011) for FCC and NTIA to facilitate this arrangement,  as FCC required a rulemaking and NTIA required a lengthy evaluation  of potential interference. This nonprofit is funded by an endowment  and was not dependent on income from the device to sustain itself  during this process, but such delays, and the potential for a denial,  could discourage for-profit companies from developing and investing  in business plans that rely on sharing federal spectrum.", "Stakeholders we interviewed told us that when federal or nonfederal  users share spectrum, both parties have concern that harmful  interference may affect their missions or operations if the other party  overreaches or does not follow the agreement.

In 2011, the CSMAC Incentives  Subcommittee recommended that NTIA and FCC study the  implementation of spectrum fees to drive greater efficiency and solicit  input from both federal and nonfederal users who might be subject to  fees. The National Broadband Plan has also recommended that  Congress consider granting FCC and NTIA authority to impose spectrum  fees on unauctioned spectrum license holders\u2014such as TV broadcasters  and public safety entities\u2014as well as government users. Fees may help  to free spectrum for new uses, since licensees who use spectrum  inefficiently may reduce their holdings or pursue sharing opportunities  once they bear the opportunity cost of letting it remain fallow or  underused.

Other members suggested that fees will  have no effect because agencies will be assured additional funds for their  spectrum needs. Similarly, the National Broadband Plan notes that a  different approach to setting fees may be appropriate for different  spectrum users, and that a fee system must also avoid disrupting public  safety, national defense, and other essential government services that  protect human life, safety, and property.", "To address some of the concerns regarding agency budgets, the recent  PCAST report recommended the use of a \u201cspectrum currency\u201d process to  promote spectrum efficiency. Rather than using funds to pay for  spectrum, federal agencies would each be given an allocation of synthetic  currency that they could use to \u201cbuy\u201d their spectrum usage rights. Usage  fees would be set based on valuations of comparable private sector uses  for which the market has already set a price. Agencies would then have  incentive to use their assignments more efficiently or share spectrum. In  the PCAST proposal, agencies would also be rewarded for making  spectrum available to others for sharing, by being reimbursed for their  investments in improving spectrum sharing from a proposed Spectrum  Efficiency Fund.", "Expanding the availability of spectrum for unlicensed use. Unlicensed  spectrum use is inherently shared spectrum access, and according to  spectrum experts we interviewed and other stakeholders, unlicensed use  of spectrum is a valuable complement to licensed spectrum and more  spectrum could be made available for unlicensed use. Spectrum for  unlicensed use can be used efficiently and for high value applications, like  Wi-Fi, for example. Increasing the amount of spectrum for unlicensed use may allow more users to share without going through lengthy  negotiations and interference mitigations, and also allow for more  experimentation and innovation.", "More recently, FCC has provided unlicensed access to additional  spectrum, known as TV \u201cwhite spaces,\u201d to help address spectrum  demands. The white spaces refer to the buffer zones that FCC assigned  the television broadcasters to mitigate unwanted inference between  adjacent stations. With the more efficient TV transmission capabilities that  resulted from the digital television transition, the buffer zones are no  longer needed and FCC approved the previously unused spectrum for  unlicensed use. To identify available white space spectrum, devices must  access a database which responds with a list of the frequencies that are  available for use at the device\u2019s location. As an example, one local  official explained that his city uses TV white space spectrum to provide a  network of public Wi-Fi access and public safety surveillance functions.", "Increasing the federal focus on research and development of  technologies. Several technological advances promise to make sharing  easier, but are still at early stages of development and testing. For  example, various spectrum users and experts we contacted mentioned  the potential of dynamic spectrum access technology. If made fully  operational, dynamic spectrum access technology will be able to sense  available frequencies in an area and jump between frequencies to  seamlessly continue communication as the user moves geographically  and through the spectrum. According to experts and researchers we  contacted, progress has been made but there is no indication of how long  it will be before this technology is fully deployable. Such new technologies  can obviate or lessen the need for extensive regulatory procedures to  enable sharing and can open up new market opportunities for wireless  service providers. If a secondary user or sharing entity employs these  technologies, the incumbent user or primary user would theoretically not  experience harmful interference, and agreements and rulemakings that  are currently needed may be streamlined or unnecessary to enable  sharing.", "Although industry participants indicated that extensive testing under  realistic conditions is critical to conducting basic research on spectrum  efficient technologies, we found that only a few companies are involved in  such research and may experience challenges in the testing process.  Companies tend to focus technology development on current business  objectives as opposed to conducting basic research that may not show an  immediate business return. For example, NTIA officials told us that one  company that indicated it would participate in NTIA\u2019s dynamic spectrum  access testing project removed its technologist from the testing effort to a  project more closely related to its internal business objectives.  Furthermore, some products are too early in the development stage to  even be fully tested. For example, NTIA officials also said six companies  responded to NTIA\u2019s invitation to participate in the previously mentioned  dynamic spectrum access testing project. However, only two working  devices were received for the testing, and a third device received did not  work as intended. Other companies that responded told NTIA that they  only had a concept and were not ready to test an actual prototype.", "Recent federal advisory committee recommendations emphasize the  importance of funding and providing incentives for research and  development endeavors. For example, to promote research in efficient  technologies, PCAST recommended that (1) the Research and  Development Wireless Innovation Fund release funds for this purpose  and (2) the current Spectrum Relocation Fund be redefined as the  Spectrum Efficiency Fund. As discussed, this adjustment would allow for  federal agencies to be reimbursed for general investments in improving  spectrum sharing. Similarly, CSMAC recommended the creation of a  Spectrum Innovation Fund. Unlike the Spectrum Relocation Fund, which  is strictly limited to the actual costs incurred in relocating federal systems  from auctioned spectrum bands, the Spectrum Innovation Fund could  also be used for spectrum sharing and other opportunities to enhance  spectrum efficiency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["Radio frequency spectrum is a scarce national resource that enables  wireless communications services vital to the U.S. economy and to a  variety of government functions, yet NTIA has not developed a strategic,  governmentwide vision for managing federal use of this valuable  resource. NTIA\u2019s spectrum management authority is broad in scope, but  NTIA\u2019s focus is on the narrow technical aspects of spectrum  management, such as ensuring new frequency assignments will not  cause interference to spectrum-dependent devices already in use, rather  than on whether new assignments should be approved based on a  comprehensive evaluation of federal spectrum use from a  governmentwide perspective. Lacking an overall strategic vision, NTIA  cannot ensure that spectrum is being used efficiently by federal agencies.  Furthermore, agencies are not required to submit justifications for their  spectrum use and NTIA does not have a mechanism in place to validate  and verify the accuracy of spectrum-related data submitted by the federal  agencies. This has led to decreased accountability and transparency in  how federal spectrum is being used and whether the spectrum-dependent  systems the agencies have in place are necessary. Without meaningful  data validation requirements, NTIA has limited assurance that the  agency-reported data it collects are accurate and complete.", "In our April 2011 report, we recommended that NTIA (1) develop an  updated plan that includes key elements of a strategic plan, as well as  information on how spectrum is being used across the federal  government, opportunities to increase efficient use of federally allocated  spectrum and infrastructure, an assessment of future spectrum needs,  and plans to incorporate these needs in the frequency assignment,  equipment certification, and review processes; (2) examine the  assignment review processes and consider best practices to determine if  the current approach for collecting and validating data from federal  agencies can be streamlined or improved; and (3) establish internal  controls for management oversight of the accuracy and completeness of  currently reported agency data. With respect to our first  recommendation, NTIA has not developed an updated strategic plan and  previously noted that the Presidential Memorandum of June 28, 2010,  and the Wireless Innovation Initiative provide significant strategic direction  for NTIA and the other federal agencies. In September 2012, NTIA  officials told us that NTIA intends to update its strategic plan by October  2013. NTIA concurred with our other two recommendations and is taking  action to address them. For example, NTIA has proposed approaches to  implement new measures to better ensure the accuracy of agency- reported data, and is taking steps to implement internal controls for its  data management system in a cost efficient manner.", "With respect to spectrum sharing, there are currently insufficient  incentives to encourage more sharing, and even if incentives were  created, several barriers to sharing will continue. Options to address  these issues in turn create new challenges, and may require further  study.", "Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Eshoo, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
