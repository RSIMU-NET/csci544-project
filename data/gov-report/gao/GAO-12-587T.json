NASA\u0092s decision to rely on the new commercial vehicles to transport cargo starting in 2012 and to transport crew starting in 2017 is inherently risky because the vehicles are not yet proven and are experiencing delays in development. Further, NASA does not have agreements in place for international partners to provide cargo services to the ISS beyond 2016. The agency will also face a decision regarding the need to purchase additional seats on the Russian Soyuz vehicle beyond 2016, likely before commercial vehicles have made significant progress in development, given the three-year lead time necessary for acquiring a seat. This decision is further complicated because restrictions prohibit NASA from making certain payments to Russia in connection with the ISS unless the President makes a determination. Further, NASA currently expects to transport all cargo needed by the ISS in 51 flights through 2020, but if international partner agreements and commercial service contracts do not materialize as the agency plans for the years beyond 2016, the situation could lead to a potential cargo shortfall.", "If NASA can access the station, it will next be challenged with fully utilizing the ISS national laboratory for its intended purpose\u0097scientific research. To take steps to meet this challenge and consistent with a 2009 GAO recommendation, in 2011 NASA selected an organization to centrally oversee ISS national laboratory research decision-making. It is too soon, however, to determine whether this organization is ensuring full scientific utilization of the ISS. Regardless of the efforts of the management body, as GAO noted in a 2009 report, constraints on crew time for conducting science could also impact full utilization.", "If NASA can overcome its challenges related to accessing the station, it has reasonable approaches in place for estimating spare parts and assessing the structural health of the space station.

This achievement involved dedication and effort on the part of all  participating nations and individuals. With construction completed and a  full crew of six astronauts on-board, the ISS stands poised to deliver  scientific breakthroughs enabled by its unique capabilities. The potential  of the ISS program to deliver on the promise of scientific discovery,  however, is inextricably linked to NASA\u2019s ability to safely access, sustain,  and fully utilize the laboratory in orbit.", "Now that ISS construction is finished, NASA and the ISS program face  three major challenges, which will be the focus of my testimony.

In a November 2009 report, we iterated our  concerns that limited international partner vehicle capacity and potential  delays in planned commercial vehicle development could impede efforts  to maximize utilization of all ISS research facilities. In 2011 reports and  testimony, we observed that commercial cargo launch development  remained behind schedule and, even when coupled with international  partner launch capacity, may not cover all of the ISS anticipated needs  beginning in 2014.

From 1994 through 2010, NASA estimates that it directly invested  over $48 billion in development and construction of the on-orbit scientific  laboratory, the ISS. NASA intended ISS assembly to be complete much  sooner than it was. For example, in 1995, NASA expected to ISS  assembly to be finished by June 2002, whereas the agency actually  completed assembly in 2010. With ISS expected to be in use only through  2015, this slower pace shortened the amount of time NASA had available  to take advantage of the significant monetary investment and to fully  utilize the station. As a result, the NASA Authorization Act of 2010  required the NASA Administrator to take all actions necessary to ensure  the safe and effective operation of the ISS through at least September 30,  2020.", "The ISS is the largest orbiting man-made object. (See fig. 1) It is  composed of about 1 million pounds of hardware, brought to orbit over  the course of a decade. The ISS includes (1) primary structures, that is,  the external trusses which serve as the backbone of the station and the  pressurized modules that are occupied by the ISS crew, and (2)  functional systems made up of replaceable units, that is, systems that  provide basic functionality such as life support and electrical power that  are made of modular components that are replaceable by astronauts on  orbit.", "The ISS was constructed to support three activities: scientific research,  technology development, and development of industrial applications. The  facilities aboard the ISS allow for ongoing research in microgravity,  studies of other aspects of the space environment, tests of new  technology, and long-term space operations. The facilities also enable a  permanent crew of up to six astronauts to maintain their physical health  standards while conducting many different types of research, including  experiments in biotechnology, combustion science, fluid physics, and  materials science, on behalf of ground-based researchers. Furthermore,  the ISS has the capability to support research on materials and other  technologies to see how they react in the space environment.", "NASA planned for the space shuttle to serve as the means of transporting  crew, hardware, and supplies to the ISS through the end of the station\u2019s  life. However, in 2004, President George W. Bush announced his Vision  for Space Exploration (Vision) that included direction for NASA to develop  new spaceflight systems under the Constellation program to replace the  space shuttle as NASA\u2019s primary spaceflight system. The Vision also  included provisions for NASA to pursue commercial alternatives or  providing transportation and other services to support the ISS after 2010.NASA established the Commercial Crew and Cargo Program in 2005 to  facilitate the private demonstration of safe, reliable, and cost-effective  transportation services and purchase these services commercially. When  the Constellation program was cancelled in 2010, the commercial  vehicles became NASA\u2019s primary focus for providing cargo and crew  transportation to the ISS.

Currently,  SpaceX\u2019s next demonstration launch to the ISS has been delayed from  November 2011 to late April 2012 because of additional testing and  resolution of some technical issues such as electromagnetic interference.  Likewise, Orbital experienced programmatic changes and developmental  difficulties that led to multiple delays of several months\u2019 duration. In May  2011 testimony, we noted that Orbital\u2019s inaugural demonstration mission  had been delayed to December 2011. Currently, this flight has been  delayed further to August or September 2012, primarily because of issues  related to construction and testing of the launch pad at Wallops Island,  Virginia. NASA has made efforts to accommodate delays in commercial  vehicle development, including use of the final shuttle flight in July 2011  to pre-position additional ISS spares.

As we also noted in that report, NASA\u2019s funding level  for fiscal year 2012 is almost 50 percent less than it anticipated when it  developed its approach for procuring commercial crew services. Given  this funding level, NASA indicated it could not award contracts to multiple  providers, which weakened prospects for competition in subsequent  phases of the program. The main premise of its procurement approach  to control costs\u2014full and open competition for future phases of the  program\u2014therefore was likely no longer viable. Without competition,  NASA could become dependent on one contractor for developing and  providing launch services to the space station. Reliance on a sole source  for any product or service increases the risk that the government will pay  more than expected, since no competitors exist to help control market  prices.

NASA will likely need to decide by the end of 2013 whether to purchase  additional seats that might be needed beyond 2016 because the lead  time for acquiring additional seats on the Soyuz is 3 years. However, in  the 2013 time frame, NASA cannot be fully confident that domestic crew  efforts will succeed because the vehicles will not yet have entered the test  and integration phase of development. Furthermore, the decision to  purchase crew seats on the Russian Soyuz is complicated by restrictions  found in the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act. These  restrictions prohibit NASA from making certain payments to Russia in  connection with the ISS unless the President makes a determination.  NASA currently has a statutory exemption from this restriction that allows  certain types of payments, but that exemption expires in 2016.
