Since the 1960s, states have had maximum UI benefit durations of 26 weeks or longer. However, since 2011, nine states have reduced their maximum benefit durations: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, and South Carolina. GAO was asked to review the states' reductions.", "GAO examined (1) the circumstances in which states reduced the maximum duration of UI benefits, (2) the implications of these reductions for individuals, (3) the effects on federal UI costs, and (4) their broader economic effects. GAO reviewed relevant federal and state laws; visited Georgia and Michigan, which had different approaches to reducing durations; analyzed UI program data from 2006 (before the recession) to 2014; and reviewed relevant economic research."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The unemployment insurance (UI) system, a federal and state partnership that provides benefits to eligible workers who have lost their jobs, was under financial pressures during the recent recession and recovery. Since 2011, nine states reduced the maximum length of time (duration) individuals could receive state benefits. These states reduced duration from 26 weeks to as few as 12 weeks, with 20 weeks being the most common new maximum. Compared to states that did not reduce duration, those that did generally had higher unemployment rates and weaker UI trust fund balances and were more likely to have federal loans as their UI reserves became depleted. Officials in five of the nine states said that replenishing their trust fund balance was a key rationale for reducing benefit duration. GAO found that most of the nine states, like other states, also increased employer taxes for their UI program and made other benefit reductions such as by changing UI eligibility rules.", "Reductions in state benefit durations resulted in some individuals receiving substantially less in total UI benefits. During the period from 2009 through 2013, individuals who exhausted their state benefits could receive additional weeks of benefits from the federal government. The duration of federal benefits was based on the duration of state benefits; shorter maximum state benefit periods resulted in shorter maximum federal benefit periods. As a result, some individuals received substantially less in total UI benefits because the durations of both their state and federal benefits were reduced. For example, in 2013, an individual in a state that had shortened its maximum benefit duration to 20 weeks could have received up to 52.4 additional weeks of federal benefits, for a total of 72.4 weeks. However, had the state maximum duration remained at 26 weeks, that individual could have received up to 67 weeks of federal benefits, for a total of 93 weeks. In contrast, individuals eligible for UI benefits for relatively short periods of time were unaffected by the reduced durations.", "The effects of these reductions on federal UI program costs are unclear. Although GAO's prior work on past recessions found it can be useful for federal agencies to assess the unintended consequences of state policy responses, the Department of Labor (DOL) has not assessed the extent of any cost shift to the federal government. The net impact on federal UI costs would depend on how reductions in the duration of state benefits affect the number of people receiving federal benefits and for how long. On the one hand, federal costs are increased to the extent that state duration reductions shift individuals to federal benefits earlier. On the other hand, federal costs are decreased to the extent that fewer weeks of federal UI benefits are available. However, because DOL has not analyzed state data on individuals' weekly benefits, it remains unclear whether the federal government incurred a net cost due to the states' duration reductions.", "Relevant research suggests that reductions in benefit duration may reduce the positive effects of UI on the economy. The economic literature that GAO reviewed, including analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, generally indicates positive macroeconomic effects from the UI program, based on the likelihood that benefits are spent, thus providing a stimulus to the economy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Labor examine the implications of state duration reductions for federal UI program costs and develop recommendations, if warranted.

From the 1960s until recently, according  to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), all states provided  benefits up to 26 weeks, and 2 states provided additional weeks. During  periods of high unemployment, the federal government has provided UI  benefits beyond the states\u2019 maximum durations. Since 2011, however, 9  states reduced the maximum allowable duration for their benefits:  Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, North  Carolina, and South Carolina.

We selected 3 of these states\u2014Indiana,  Ohio, and Tennessee\u2014based on their similarity to the states that reduced  benefit duration. We selected the fourth state, Washington, on the basis  of expert recommendation. To identify state characteristics that most  distinguished the states that reduced duration from those that did not, we  analyzed data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, primarily  from the Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL) Office of Unemployment Insurance  and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The data analyzed included both UI  program and financing characteristics, as well as state demographic and  economic characteristics.

There are two kinds of eligibility requirements. Monetary  eligibility typically refers to an earnings threshold and employment history  that applicants must meet in order to qualify for benefits. Based on such  eligibility criteria, individuals may qualify for less than a state\u2019s maximum  duration. The other category of eligibility requirements is non-monetary,  which according to DOL, refers to states\u2019 criteria to determine if an  individual\u2019s job loss is through no fault of his or her own, and that the  individual is able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work.

Figure 3  shows the various tools states generally use to balance program revenue  and benefits.", "Although states have flexibility to change both revenues and benefits,  they can exhaust their UI reserves during periods of exceptional  unemployment. In such times, states may borrow from the federal  government. If a state satisfies certain conditions, loans taken from  January 1 through September 30 and repaid before October 1, are  interest free as long as the state does not borrow again during the fourth  quarter of the calendar year. In states that do not repay their loans within  a specified period, employers lose a portion of the FUTA tax credit.  However, states with outstanding loans can still seek relief from these  loan provisions in the form of a limit to the reduction of the FUTA tax  credit and the opportunity to delay interest payments.

For example, in states  that reduced the maximum duration of state UI benefits from 26 weeks to  20 weeks, those claimants who were eligible for benefits for more than 26  weeks transitioned to federal benefits 6 weeks earlier.

As a result, there are likely to be fewer claimants receiving benefits at the  back end of the program than during the front end. Therefore, even  though state duration reductions may have resulted in fewer weeks of  federal benefits, costs to the federal government may have increased. In  other words, the front end cost caused by an earlier transition to federal  programs by more claimants may exceed any savings generated by  paying fewer weeks of federal benefits to those claimants still receiving  benefits at the back end of the federal programs.", "It is difficult to measure the magnitude of the front end costs and back  end savings because, while DOL collects aggregate data on benefits  paid, it does not collect data on weekly benefits at the individual level.  Nevertheless, using data provided by two states, Missouri and Georgia,  we found that the earlier transition to federal benefits shifted some costs  from these states to the federal government.", "In order to illustrate the front end cost shift to the federal government for  one calendar year quarter for the weeks from the end of state benefits  through week 26, for example, we analyzed data from Missouri and  Georgia on the number of claimants who received weekly benefits, by  benefit week.

First, we calculated the probability that claimants would be  affected by a maximum duration reduction, equal to the estimated survival  probability at the new maximum duration. Second, we calculated the total  number of claimants affected by the policy change, equal to the survival  probability at the new maximum duration multiplied by the population of  claimants receiving benefits at the beginning of the quarter. (We did not  calculate this quantity for Michigan, due to uncertain population sizes  from which our sample was drawn.) Finally, we calculated the benefit that  a claimant receiving the average benefit amount in the period shortly  before the policy change could have expected to lose due to a shorter  maximum duration, equal to the survival probability at the new maximum  duration multiplied by the total benefits received by the average recipient  over the weeks exceeding the new maximum duration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Washington State Simulation", "paragraphs": ["We also asked Washington\u2019s state Employment Security Department to  project the implications of reducing benefits from 26 weeks to 20 weeks,  using the state\u2019s Benefit Financing Model.
