An \u201coutcome measure\u201d assesses  the actual results, effects, or impact of an activity compared with its  intended purpose.", "USAID has acknowledged the difficulty of developing a set of trade  capacity building performance indicators for missions to use in their  performance monitoring plans. A USAID official stated that the agency had  not, to date, developed a set of trade capacity building indicators because  most of the agency\u2019s trade capacity building activities focus broadly on  economic development, whose benefits are difficult to quantify. Although  currently many missions use increased exports as an indicator, one USAID  official pointed out that exports can increase for reasons unrelated to trade  capacity building. The USAID official also said that coming up with  indicators is sometimes less of a problem than collecting the data, which  can be hard to come by in many developing countries. For instance, USAID  contractors may have to rely on a country\u2019s private sector to obtain data on  value-added products since the local government would not collect such  data. On a small project, with individual firms, this would be feasible, but it  would be costly for a whole sector, the official said. Furthermore, another  USAID official stated that USAID has struggled to help missions  understand the distinction between economic development projects and  trade capacity building projects. For instance, the official said that,  although USAID had undertaken many agricultural projects in the past,  many project activities were not linked to markets and trade. One USDA  official said, however, that he considered the development of new  institutions, laws, and regulations to be good performance indicators for  trade capacity building efforts.", "Despite the challenges of monitoring and measuring the results of trade  capacity building assistance, USAID is working on its own and through the  international community to develop trade capacity building performance  indicators for missions to use in their performance monitoring plans.  USAID has contracted for a consultant\u2019s study and expects to have a draft  report on trade capacity building indicators in the near future.  Furthermore, USAID is not alone in dealing with the difficulties of  evaluating trade capacity building efforts, as other countries face the same  issues. USAID has been collaborating with other country donors through  the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee to develop a common  framework for results monitoring and assessment of trade capacity  building efforts. To date, the OECD committee members have discussed a  flexible \u201ctool kit\u201d of trade capacity building indicators, in recognition that  the wide range of trade capacity building projects would argue against  using the same indicators for all trade capacity building activities.", "Based on our interviews, U.S. agencies have not specifically conducted  program evaluations to assess the effectiveness of their trade capacity  building efforts. Program evaluation is an assessment of the effects of a  program or policy that can measure unintended results, both good and bad,  and can be used to validate or find error in a program\u2019s basic purposes and  premises. GPRA called for agencies to improve congressional decision  making by providing more objective information on the relative  effectiveness and efficiency of their programs and spending.", "According to agency officials with whom we spoke, some agencies have  evaluated their activities but not in relation to trade capacity building. For  instance, Department of Labor officials stated that Labor evaluates its  projects against project-specific objectives that are not trade capacity  building objectives. USTDA officials stated that they have a set of measures  for the development effectiveness of each of their activities. USTDA  officials stated further that, while they have recently developed a system  for evaluating the development impact of their activities over the next 6  years, the system is not meant to measure trade capacity per se. USTDA  officials do believe, however, that their development impact measures will  in most cases ultimately serve as a good proxy for measuring trade capacity  building impact. Examples of effectiveness in the USTDA system would  include the percentage of activities that lead to the adoption of market- oriented reforms or result in the transfer of advanced technology to  increase productivity. Finally, USTDA officials emphasized that few of their  trade capacity building activities are mature enough to be evaluated. The  Department of State evaluates the effectiveness of its International Visitor  Leadership Program with general anecdotal feedback from participants.  One USDA official said that the agency has not done any assessments  specifically of the effectiveness of its trade capacity building efforts, but  that USDA did do program evaluations. For example, one USDA evaluation  concluded that a refrigeration project resulted in improved refrigeration  management and a reduction in perishable losses of one company of 60  percent.", "USAID reported in May 2004 that it has conducted fewer program  evaluations overall since instituting its performance measurement system  under GPRA, replacing them with annual reports \u201cthat measure progress  toward specific goals on a country by country basis\u201d rather than evaluating  the effectiveness of the program as a whole. In addition, one USAID official  said that USAID moved away from using formal evaluations about 10 years  ago because of lack of personnel. In October 2004, USAID issued the  report, USAID Trade Capacity Building Programs: Issues and Findings,  which examined issues related to USAID\u2019s trade capacity building  assistance programs. The report concluded that USAID should collect and  analyze more trade capacity building data to monitor results and use those  results to conduct program evaluations. It also said that USAID should  conduct more and better evaluations of its trade capacity building projects  to know what approaches work best and under what conditions.", "While several of the agencies we reviewed emphasized trade capacity  building in their strategic plans or annual performance plans, and two  agencies have produced trade capacity building specific strategies, the lack  of performance data linked to trade capacity building limits their ability to  monitor and measure current results. In addition, without evaluations  identifying what trade capacity building activities are effective, the  agencies will have difficulty determining whether their efforts are  achieving their overall trade capacity building goals. Finally, as we discuss  in appendix IV, greater openness to international trade can have a variety of  effects, both positive and negative, on different aspects of developing  countries\u2019 domestic economies. Therefore, evaluating the effectiveness of  trade capacity building efforts is important to identify those that build trade  capacity and those that do not and to determine if any negative effects  should be mitigated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The executive branch and the Congress have elevated trade capacity  building as a crucial tool for U.S. trade and development policy.

The challenge is that the estimated $2.9 billion in  U.S. trade capacity building assistance covers multiple categories of  assistance across numerous types of trade and development programs that  have many goals and are implemented by multiple agencies. The cross- cutting nature of this assistance argues for a coordinated approach to its  implementation. The trade capacity building interagency group has  demonstrated that a coordinated approach is possible under the right  circumstances by bringing agencies together to deliver relevant, focused,  and timely technical assistance to countries participating in free trade  agreements. The cross-cutting nature of trade capacity building also makes  it difficult to evaluate. While agencies track the results of individual  activities, they do not consistently do so in terms of building trade capacity,  in part, due to the relative newness of the concept and the lack of a  common framework for evaluation. USAID is working independently and  in conjunction with other country donors to develop a common set of  indicators to monitor and measure performance and to assess trade  capacity building effectiveness.

To address these objectives,  we reviewed agency information on trade capacity building programs. We  visited overseas missions in Egypt, El Salvador, and Ghana; we chose these  countries because they were among the 20 countries receiving the most  trade capacity building funding, and they represented different regions and  income levels (low and middle income). We initially interviewed officials  from 12 U.S. agencies responsible for trade capacity building activities. We  then narrowed this down to the six agencies that funded and implemented  96 percent of trade capacity building assistance. These agencies were the  Departments of Agriculture, Labor, State, and the Treasury, the U.S. Agency  for International Development (USAID), and the U.S. Trade and  Development Agency.

We also reviewed documents from the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United  Nations Conference on Trade and Development. To determine the U.S.  definition of trade capacity building, we examined congressional  documents providing guidance on funding and implementation, as well as  relevant U.S. legislation, and relevant agency documents. We also  examined the guidance and definitions specified in the U.S. government  trade capacity building survey administered by USAID. We surveyed  economic literature on the relationships among trade, economic growth,  and development in developing countries. We examined U.S. government  reports on trade capacity building assistance, annual agency reports, and  agency trade capacity building planning and project documents.

At the missions overseas, we examined  program documents and interviewed USAID officials to understand the  types of trade capacity building programs the missions manage. In addition,  in conjunction with our work at the missions, we held meetings with other  key U.S. government officials, USAID contractors, host government  ministry officials, and various trade capacity building recipients.

We also interviewed the USAID  contractor that manages the data collection and analyzed the steps the  contractor took to ensure data reliability. For example, we asked the  contractor how the survey data were collected, what quality checks were  performed, and what other internal controls were in place.

Following the rapid growth of certain East  Asian countries, and more recently China, the role of international trade in  fostering growth and development has become more widely accepted.

First, greater  openness to imports from other countries increases competition in the  country\u2019s domestic market. This can lead to greater efficiency as less  competitive producers are driven out of the market. In addition, resources  will shift to more competitive producers and industries enabling them to  expand. Second, these expanding domestic producers may now be able to  export their products to a worldwide market, rather than sell them only in  the local economy. With a larger market, some producers also may benefit  from economies of scale in production; that is, they are able to reduce their  costs per unit of output by producing on a larger scale. Third, overall  productivity in the economy can increase due to greater competition and  specialization. Competition increases the number of efficient producers  and reduces the number of less efficient producers. Fourth, imports also  may provide access to machinery and equipment that the domestic  economy does not produce but are needed so domestic firms can expand.  These imports may embody technology and innovations that the domestic  economy lacks but which help improve labor productivity and benefit  industries that use them.", "Increased openness to trade may also create incentives for foreign direct  investment and institutional reforms, both of which may facilitate growth.  For example, a more liberal trading regime that reduces costs on both  imported manufacturing inputs and exported final products may create  incentives for foreign producers to invest in new production in the  domestic market since the cost of foreign-produced components used  domestically is lower and producers can export more competitively.  Lower tariffs mean the domestic industry can import components used in  their final products more cheaply, while lower export taxes enable the final  products to be sold at a lower price internationally. Increased foreign  investment expands developing countries\u2019 stock of capital, technology, and  managerial expertise, which may expand production directly through new  subsidiaries and have positive spillover effects on other companies and  industries in the economy. Trade liberalization also may positively affect  institutional development and reform. For example, some economists  argue that greater competition from imports may encourage institutional  reforms and reduce corruption by reducing the monopoly power of  domestic interests that benefited from the protected market. At the same  time, export industries that are expanding to take advantage of  opportunities in the world market have an incentive to lobby for further  reforms that increase the competitiveness of the domestic economy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Greater Dependence on Trade May Also Create Significant Challenges for Developing Countries", "paragraphs": ["Economists have also pointed to a variety of significant challenges that  international trade raises for developing countries. For example, many  developing countries have significant exports of primary products, such as  agriculture and raw materials.   Dependence on these types of exports,  particularly for countries that generate their export earnings from a few  products (such as coffee, cocoa, or bananas), creates large economic  fluctuations since primary product prices tend to be relatively unstable. In  addition, many developing country exporters also have faced deterioration  in their terms of trade, as the prices of their export products fell relative to  the prices they paid for their imports. This can create a situation in which  trade barrier reductions in the domestic market increase demand for  imports and displace domestic production, but export sectors do not  expand to capture these resources because prices in world markets are  declining. Consequently, the gap between export earnings and import  payments may lead developing countries to maintain current account  deficits. This means that more foreign currency for imports is paid for  imports than received from selling exports. To acquire foreign currency to  cover this deficit, countries need an inflow of foreign financial assistance,  either through private investment or public assistance (such as loans and  aid). Persistent current account deficits were partly responsible for the  accumulation of debt among developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s.", "Some economists point out that, although trade may benefit a country\u2019s  growth and overall wealth, distributional problems such as wage inequality,  unemployment, and poverty may accompany this growth and be contrary  to a country\u2019s development goals. For example, trade liberalization may  worsen a country\u2019s income distribution and reduce the wages of low-skilled  workers if it encourages (as a result of increased foreign competition) the  adoption of technologies that favor more skilled workers.

Eighteenth-century economists such as  Adam Smith and David Ricardo argued for the benefits of international  trade for economic growth. In the twentieth century, the rise of trade  barriers among the major trading nations and the resulting decline of  international trade has been cited as one of the reasons for the depth and duration of the worldwide recession in the 1930s. Following World War II,  the reduction of trade barriers among trade partners was seen as an  important component of the world economic system. The General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was inaugurated in 1947 and then followed  by successive rounds of negotiations, which resulted in the formation of  the World Trade Organization in 1995. Similarly, the United Nations  Conference on Trade and Development was formed in 1964 because of a  general understanding that trade and development were interrelated.", "Despite these developments, economists and developing countries from  the 1950s through the 1970s held divergent views about the best policies for  growth and development. These views involved engaging the world market  versus sheltering certain industries from competition until they were better  able to compete. Ultimately, the divergent experiences of developing  countries over this period led to a broader acceptance of the role of  openness to international trade in fostering economic growth and  development. Many countries, such as Argentina, El Salvador, Ghana, and  Nigeria, pursued an inwardly focused development strategy known as  import substitution. This strategy focused on restrictive trade policies that  sought to protect certain domestic industries in order to foster a diverse  industrial base. On the other hand, certain East Asian economies,  including Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, pursued a more  outwardly focused development strategy known as export promotion,  which sought to encourage industrial development by tapping into larger  export markets rather than relying on protected domestic markets.  Although the debate between these two broad approaches has swung back  and forth, export promotion, and trade liberalization in general, was more  broadly accepted by the 1980s as the dominant development strategy. This  was due in large part to the rapid growth of the East Asian economies, as  well as China more recently, and the relatively stagnant growth of many  countries that pursued more restrictive policies. Openness to trade, sound  fiscal and monetary policy, security of property rights, and privatization  were key policy prescriptions in what became known as the \u201cWashington  Consensus.\u201d This consensus generally characterized the advice of the  World Bank and International Monetary Fund (both based in Washington,  D.C.) to developing countries.", "As a result, since the 1980s, a variety of countries have liberalized their  trade regimes by reducing trade barriers through unilateral, bilateral,  regional, and multilateral trade negotiations. The range of policies that  affect the trade openness of particular countries makes it difficult to  measure levels of openness over time and across countries. However, a  wide variety of evidence shows that developing countries have liberalized  their trade regimes extensively over the past two decades. For example,  average tariffs of developing countries have fallen from around 36 percent  in the early 1980s to around 16 percent currently, based on World Bank and  International Monetary Fund statistics. However, the trend to greater  openness varied among regions and countries, with Latin America tending  to move the most rapidly and comprehensively, while South Asian  countries made little progress until the 1990s. For Ghana and Egypt\u2014 countries we visited in our work\u2014average tariffs were similar in the early  1980s at 43 percent and 47 percent, respectively. However, Ghana reduced  its average tariff much more rapidly than Egypt, so that currently Ghana\u2019s  average tariff is about half that of Egypt (16 percent compared to 30  percent)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Empirical Studies Confirm a Positive Relationship between Trade and Growth, but Critics Raise Caution", "paragraphs": ["A large economics literature exists on the relationship between trade and  growth. Many studies have attempted to empirically measure (and confirm)  the relationship between a country\u2019s level of openness to trade and per  capita income, or the relationship between changes in trade flows and  changes in gross domestic product (growth). For example, regularly cited  research by economists David Dollar, Aart Kraay, Jeffrey Sachs, Andrew  Warner, Dan Ben-David, and Sebastian Edwards generally finds an  important relationship between changes in trade flows or liberalization and growth rates across countries. The studies construct measures of  openness to trade and econometrically estimate the relationship to growth,  controlling for causality (e.g., growth may also spur increased trade) and  other factors that affect growth. Similarly, research over the past 15 years  by economists Robert Hall, Charles Jones, Andrew Rose, Jeffrey Frankel,  and others have found that large differences across countries in the level or  the growth rate of real GDP per capita may be systematically related to the  level (or degree) of openness of those countries. However, these studies  have also found that institutional quality, such as the effectiveness of  government, is also an important factor affecting growth and difficult to  separate from the effects of openness.", "Although there is a general acceptance that trade can play an important  role in economic development, some economists have criticized the  methodologies used to study the relationship between openness and  growth. For example, Francisco Rodriguez and Dani Rodrik argue that  methodological problems in this literature leave the results open to diverse  interpretations. They find little convincing evidence that changes in trade  policy (i.e., reductions in government-imposed trade barriers) are  significantly associated with economic growth. One challenge that affects  the robustness of studies trying to estimate the impact of trade  liberalization on economic growth is constructing reliable and reasonable  measures of \u201copenness.\u201d The few measures that are relatively widely  available, such as tariff rates, do not fully capture the wide range of policies  that governments may put into place to affect trade. Data are not readily  available on barriers other than tariffs (e.g., nontariff barriers such as  quotas) for many developing countries. Furthermore, for those countries  for which some data are available, generally only information on whether  or not nontariff barriers are in force is available, rather than precise  information on their relative restrictiveness or actual effect on trade.", "In addition, less is known about the relationship between trade capacity  building and other factors affecting economic growth and development  (such as institutions and human capital). Although increased trade appears  to be potentially beneficial to growth and development, countries that have  liberalized over time have had mixed experiences. As mentioned above,  institutional factors also appear important, as do geographical factors  (proximity to trade partners), in the extent to which countries benefit from  greater connectedness to the world economy. Countries in sub-Saharan  Africa have remained relatively less developed and marginalized compared  to developing countries elsewhere, despite undergoing some degree of  trade liberalization. Trade liberalization alone does not appear to be a  sufficient criterion for development but is one of several important factors.  Also, the speed at which the global economy evolves may initially benefit a  developing country but later pose difficulties as labor tries to adjust to new  conditions. For example, the removal of textile and apparel trade  restrictions on January 1, 2005, by developed economies such as the United  States and European Union will allow China and other large clothing  producers to compete against other developing countries for their market  share previously protected by the quotas. Some economies may have  difficulties adjusting to rapid changes in their export markets after having  built up significant industries under the quota system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the U.S. Agency for International  Development\u2019s letter dated January 18, 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.
