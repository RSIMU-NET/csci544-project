The United States has also relied on financial institutions to report to regulatory and law enforcement authorities, those customers who are engaged in known or suspected financial crimes or suspected of circumventing CTR requirements. Over the past few years, U.S. bank regulators have required that financial institutions adopt anti-money-laundering programs that, at a minimum, include (1) internal policies, procedures, and controls; (2) the designation of a compliance officer; (3) ongoing training of employees; and (4) an independent audit to test the adequacy of these programs.", "Financial institutions have also adopted so-called \u201cknow your customer\u201d policies to help them identify customers engaged in known or suspected financial crimes.

U.S. anti-money-laundering efforts are expected to continue relying on CTRs, but to a lesser extent. This change in emphasis from routine reporting of currency transactions above a given threshold to reporting of suspicious transactions is a key component of a flexible and cost-efficient compliance program required to combat money laundering through financial institutions, according to the Treasury. In a related matter, the Treasury said it is working on meeting a statutory goal seeking a 30-percent reduction in the number of CTRs filed by financial institutions. Congress took this action in part because of concerns about (1) the burdens imposed on the banking industry of routinely filing millions of CTRs annually, (2) the costs incurred by the Treasury of processing these CTRs, and (3) the ability of law enforcement to use information from the Treasury\u2019s cluttered CTR database. The BSA Advisory Group, which consists of officials from the Treasury and bank regulators and representatives from financial institutions, is identifying and increasing the categories of businesses that will not have to file routine CTRs, as a means to reach the 30-percent reduction goal, according to Treasury officials.", "U.S. regulatory and banking association officials told us that the ongoing shift toward greater reliance on suspicious transaction reports necessitates several key changes. They said it will require more training for financial institutions on identifying suspicious transactions.

The Department of Justice pointed out that law enforcement investigation of crimes associated with money laundering and law enforcement intelligence sharing identify the majority of the money-laundering offenses and are among the most productive ways to detect money-laundering offenses. This report points out that law enforcement investigations of crimes associated with money laundering and intelligence sharing are among the methods used to combat money laundering.

However, Justice pointed out that the United States is involved in several other international initiatives to combat money laundering.

The Department of State pointed out that our focus on money-laundering issues in the seven European countries we visited is not representative of money-laundering issues in different parts of the world, such as the Caribbean, Asia, and Africa. We recognize that the money-laundering issues in the European countries we visited may be different from those in other parts of the world. As we note in this report, our scope was limited to these seven countries in order to also conduct our concurrent work on counterfeit currency. On the basis of our discussions with banking regulators and Treasury and Justice officials, certain issues we discuss are relevant to other parts of the world. For example, the issues related to U.S. banking regulators\u2019 oversight of U.S. overseas branches\u2019 anti-money-laundering controls would also be applicable to other countries besides the seven European countries we visited. Likewise, our discussion on FATF efforts expands beyond those of the European countries we visited. Nevertheless, we revised the report to include more recent U.S. international initiatives that focus on different parts of the world, such as the Summit of the Americas. 2. The Department of State commented that in certain sections of this report, we suggest problems in U.S. efforts to combat money laundering overseas and that we do not substantiate instances where these problems have prevented the enforcement of U.S. laws. As an example, they pointed out that we suggest that U.S. regulators are routinely denied opportunities to examine U.S. overseas branches for compliance with U.S. anti-money-laundering laws, but that we do not substantiate instances where these problems have interfered with or prevented the enforcement of U.S. laws. We did not intend to suggest that regulators are routinely denied opportunities to examine overseas branches, and we have revised the text to ensure that there is no such inference. Also, we have revised the text to more clearly state that in some countries, U.S. regulators are prevented from conducting on-site examinations of U.S. bank branches. The Department of State further noted that even in countries in which U.S. regulators conduct on-site examinations of U.S. banks, they do not examine these banks to determine if they comply with U.S. anti-money-laundering laws. We agree with the Department of State and have revised this report to clarify this point. We also noted that in countries in which U.S. regulators can conduct on-site examinations of U.S. banks\u2019 anti-money-laundering controls, these examinations are not as thorough as those in the United States. 3. The Department of State commented that our discussion on U.S. approaches to combat money laundering through financial institutions appears to imply that the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have lead agency responsibility for money laundering. We did not intend to imply that these two regulators are solely responsible or have lead responsibility for all U.S. anti-money-laundering efforts. We have revised our discussion on U.S. approaches to combating money-laundering through financial institutions to more clearly specify that under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the regulators require that financial institutions maintain and file certain records as well as develop money-laundering compliance programs, including \u201cknow your customer\u201d policies. As we note in this report, U.S. law enforcement agencies play a key role in investigating crimes involving money laundering. However, we did not review the effectiveness of various tools and methods they use to detect domestic and international money laundering such as undercover operations, \u201cstings,\u201d informants, and wiretaps. 4. The Department of State pointed out that both law enforcement agencies and regulators have begun to rely more on \u201cknow your customer\u201d policies and the reporting of suspicious transactions. We have revised the text to acknowledge that both law enforcement agencies and regulators, under BSA, are expected to rely more on the reporting of suspicious transactions. 5. The Department of State commented that our description of the European Union (EU) Directive could be read to suggest that the EU countries followed the U.S.\u2019 lead in drafting the directive. We have revised our discussion to specify that the EU Directive was patterned after anti-money-laundering recommendations adopted by FATF. 6. The Department of State indicated that the draft gave the erroneous impression of European CTR reporting in several instances. The Department of State further commented that only two countries (the United States and Australia) require routine reporting of currency transactions. We revised the text to clarify that West European countries we visited require recording large currency transactions and that Italy also requires routine reporting of currency transactions. 7. The Department of State commented that our discussion on U.S. regulators\u2019 oversight of overseas branches of U.S. banks can be read to suggest that cooperation with Switzerland is a problem. We have revised the text to more explicitly state that U.S. regulators cannot conduct on-site examinations of U.S. banks in countries with strict bank secrecy laws such as Switzerland. We discuss several other measures, such as exchanges of bank examinations among regulators, that U.S. regulators can use to assess U.S. branches\u2019 anti-money-laundering controls in countries such as Switzerland. However, we did not assess the effectiveness of such measures. 8. The Department of State commented that we may be unduly negative about FATF because we mention two members who expressed concerns about the direction of FATF. We did not intend to be unduly negative of FATF and have revised the text. To add balance, we revised the text to add information on more recent FATF initiatives that focus on the identification and dissemination of current and emerging money-laundering schemes. 9. The Department of State noted that our discussion on the U.S. presidency of FATF could suggest that the United States initiated (1) FATF\u2019s monitoring of members\u2019 new laws, (2) FATF\u2019s efforts to identify new money-laundering schemes, and (3) FATF\u2019s external relations. We have revised the text to better reflect the role that the United States has played during its tenure as president, which is to build upon those efforts that FATF initiated over the past few years. 10. The Department of State pointed out that we do not explain the underlying reason why the United States has one approach to combat money laundering through financial institutions while other countries have a different approach. We focused our efforts on becoming familiar with and describing the U.S. and European approaches rather than focusing on determining the underlying reasons why the United States and Europe adopted their respective approaches. 11. The Department of State noted that our footnote on Switzerland\u2019s role in adopting the EU Directive was potentially misleading. We have revised the footnote to more accurately describe Switzerland\u2019s role. 12. The Department of State indicated that our statement that U.S. regulators cannot exchange information requested for law enforcement purposes may be incorrect. We have revised this report to focus only on the procedures for the exchange of supervisory and examination information between U.S. regulators and foreign counterparts, as described in OCC document PPM-5500-1, dated May 25, 1993.
