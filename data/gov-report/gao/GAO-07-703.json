Though data are limited on the prevalence of conflicts involving plan fiduciaries and consultants, a 2005 SEC staff report examining 24 registered pension consultants identified 13 that failed to disclose significant conflicts. GAO's analysis found that, in 2006, these 13 consultants had over $4.5 trillion in U.S. assets under advisement. GAO also analyzed a sample of ongoing DB plans associated with the 13 consultants that, as of year-end 2004, had total assets of $183.5 billion and average assets of $155.3 million. Additional sample analysis showed that the DB plans using these 13 consultants had annual returns generally 1.3 percent lower than those that did not. Because many factors can affect returns, and data as well as modeling limitations limit the ability to generalize and interpret the results, this finding should not be considered as proof of causality between consultants and lower rates of return, although it suggests the importance of detecting the presence of conflicts among pension plans. Whether specific financial harm was caused by a conflict of interest is difficult to determine without a detailed audit. As a creditor and a trustee of terminated plans, PBGC's policies and procedures are oriented toward the likely recovery of assets, rather than explicitly focusing on losses associated with conflicts of interest involving service providers. Although PBGC has broad legal authority to recover losses attributable to conflicts of interest, PBGC officials told us that the agency limits its pursuit of cases to those in which the recovery will likely exceed the cost of bringing a case to court successfully. While monetary recoveries by PBGC may improve the agency's financial position, they generally have little effect on participant benefits because most affected participants already receive their full benefits promised by their plans. According to PBGC, more than 90 percent of all beneficiaries of PBGC trusteed plans received their full promised plan benefit. While EBSA's enforcement program is concerned with conflicts of interest affecting all private pension plans, it does not have specific procedures for plans trusteed or likely to be trusteed by PBGC. EBSA has recently initiated the Consultant/Advisor Project (CAP) to focus on conflicts among service providers, though it includes no specific focus on high risk or terminated plans. Moreover, existing law limits EBSA's efforts to pursue conflicts and redress for financial harm when certain service providers are either not fiduciaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) or did not knowingly act in concert with a fiduciary. Coordination among EBSA, PBGC, and the SEC on conflicts of interest is primarily informal, in part because of agencies' different responsibilities. The agencies' investigative activities for conflicts of interest tend to operate independently. Differences in agency missions pose challenges to the three agencies' developing a coordinated focus to pursue conflicts of interest affecting individual pension plans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The bankruptcies of United Airlines, Bethlehem Steel, and other firms  since 2000 have resulted in the termination of a number of large  underfunded pension plans and their becoming the responsibility of the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the federal guarantor of  private sector defined benefit (DB) plans. Since then, the number of  pensioners who depend on the agency for their retirement benefits has  almost tripled, and the agency\u2019s single employer insurance program has  moved from a surplus of $9.7 billion to an accumulated financial deficit in  2006 of more than $18 billion. Recent experiences involving the  termination of large DB plans have illustrated the weaknesses in funding  rules. Adding to concern over the health of DB plans have been recent  reports about conflicts of interest among pension consultants \u2013 advisers  who often play a major role in guiding plan investments. In June 2005, the  Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, which represents certain  employee groups in terminated United and Northwest Airlines DB plans,  expressed concern that conflicts of interest may have been present in the  DB plans of employees the union represents. The union\u2019s concerns were  raised as a result of a May 2005 study by Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) staff on conflicts of interest among pension  consultants. The SEC study revealed that many pension consultants have  failed to adequately disclose conflicts of interest in the process of advising  pension plans and their trustees, including DB plans. A conflict of interest  is typically a situation in which someone in a position of trust, such as a  pension plan trustee or investment adviser, has competing professional or  personal interests. Such competing interests can make it difficult for  fiduciaries and others, in general, to fulfill their duties impartially and  could cause them to breach their duty to act solely in the interest of  investors, plan participants, or beneficiaries. Having a conflict in and of  itself does not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. However, given the  potential of financial harm to plan sponsors and participants, concerns  have been raised about the extent and nature of these conflicts of interest.", "In view of the importance of protecting the retirement security of plan  participants and bolstering the financial position of the PBGC, you asked  us to pursue the following questions:    What is known about conflicts of interest on the part of service  providers and plan fiduciaries to single employer, private sector DB  plans?", "What policies and procedures does the PBGC have in place to identify  and recover losses attributable to conflicts of interest in plans it  trustees?", "Does the Department of Labor\u2019s (Labor) Employee Benefits Security  Administration (EBSA) have procedures in place to detect conflicts of  interest among service providers and fiduciaries for plans now trusteed  by PBGC?", "To what extent do EBSA, PBGC, and SEC coordinate their activities to  identify and investigate conflicts of interest?", "To determine what is known about the existence of conflicts of interest in  the context of single employer private sector DB plans, we interviewed a  variety of professionals with expert knowledge of the issue, including  agency officials, forensic auditors, accountants, attorneys, financial  industry representatives, and academics. We also analyzed Form 5500  data, Nelson\u2019s Directory of Plan Sponsor data, Nelson\u2019s Directory of  Pension Consultants data, SEC examination data, Pensions and  Investments periodicals, and data received from the PBGC associated with  terminated DB plans. In addition, we analyzed Standard and Poors (S&P)  rate of return and asset allocation data for ongoing and terminated plans.  To determine the policies and procedures PBGC has in place on conflicts  of interest, we interviewed PBGC and EBSA officials and reviewed PBGC  documentation related to this issue. To determine the procedures EBSA  has in place to detect and investigate conflicts of interest at service  providers or plan fiduciaries, we reviewed EBSA\u2019s enforcement materials,  our previously issued reports on EBSA\u2019s enforcement program, and  interviewed EBSA officials. To determine EBSA\u2019s, PBGC\u2019s, and SEC\u2019s  coordination efforts, we interviewed officials at all three agencies and  reviewed previously issued reports that provided related information on  this issue. We conducted our work between February 2006 and May 2007  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. See  appendix I and appendix II for more information on our scope and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["ERISA is the primary federal law governing the sponsorship and operation  of private sector employee pension plans, including DB plans. Title I of  ERISA gives Labor the primary authority to enforce requirements  governing the conduct of fiduciaries of pension and other employee  benefit plans. EBSA is the Labor agency responsible for administering and  enforcing Title I. ERISA has requirements relating to the standard of  conduct of plan fiduciaries and also prohibits certain transactions  between fiduciaries and parties in interest. Under Title IV of ERISA, PBGC  was established to provide insurance to covered private-sector single- employer and multiemployer DB plans. The PBGC is not an enforcement  agency and receives no funds from general tax revenues. When a bankrupt  plan sponsor terminates an underfunded pension plan, PBGC assumes  trusteeship of the assets and liabilities of the plan, pays participant and  beneficiary benefits, and acts as a creditor of the bankrupt sponsor in the  interest of the plan\u2019s participants and beneficiaries. As plan trustee, PBGC  may file suit to recover missing assets of the plan as well as other assets of  the bankrupt sponsor or to recover losses and debts owed to a plan,  including those resulting from the improper actions of anyone whether or  not they are considered fiduciaries under ERISA.", "Among other things, ERISA provides that private sector employee pension  plans, including DB plans, must have one or more named fiduciaries who  have authority to control or manage the operation and administration of  the plan. ERISA requires fiduciaries to discharge duties solely in the  interest of the participants and beneficiaries with care, skill, prudence, and  diligence. The law states that a person acts as a fiduciary when they 1)  exercise any discretionary control or authority over plan management or  any authority or control over plan assets; 2) render investment advice for a  fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys  or property of a plan or has any authority or responsibility to do so; or 3)  have any discretionary authority or responsibility in the administration of  a plan.", "Pension plans and their fiduciaries often rely on consultants and other  service providers to assist them in plan administration and asset  management, which include selecting money managers and monitoring  money managers\u2019 performance and brokerage transactions. Not all of  these consultants and service providers are at all times fiduciaries under  ERISA. ERISA takes a functional approach to fiduciary status. Fiduciaries  that breach their plan duties are personally liable for making up losses to  the plan, restoring any profits made through the use of plan assets, and  face removal as plan fiduciaries. To the extent that a service provider was  not functioning as a fiduciary under ERISA; however, EBSA can seek  recovery against that provider if it knowingly participated in a breach by a  fiduciary. Any such recovery is limited to plan funds the service provider  received (typically in the form of fees paid to it) and any proceeds derived  from those funds to the extent that they remain in the service provider\u2019s  possession.", "SEC regulates certain money managers and pension consultants under the  Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), which requires those  firms meeting certain criteria to register with the commission as  investment advisers. SEC regulates potential conflicts of interests at  registered investment advisers and requires that they disclose information  about affiliations, business interests, and compensation arrangements to  their advisory clients, primarily by providing Part II of SEC\u2019s Form ADV or  a brochure containing the same information to clients at the beginning of a  relationship and by offering to provide it annually thereafter. According  to SEC, investment advisers have a fiduciary obligation under the Advisers  Act to provide disinterested advice and disclose any material conflicts of  interest to their clients. When an adviser fails to disclose information  regarding material conflicts of interest, clients are unable to make  informed decisions about entering into or continuing the advisory  relationship. Failure to act in accordance with requirements under the  Advisers Act may constitute a violation. According to an SEC official, if  SEC becomes aware of conflicts of interest that are inadequately disclosed  or pose harm to investors, it can require a firm to remedy the deficiencies  or take formal enforcement action against the firm. SEC also regulates  broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act),  which governs how they may engage in transactions in securities for their  customers and make recommendations to their customers.", "The financial services industry and the DB pension system have changed  significantly since the early 1970s. The globalization of financial markets,  as well as technological and international regulatory changes, has  facilitated the development of new financial instruments and the  complexity of investment opportunities. Meanwhile, despite the long  term decline in the number of plans and active participants, DB pension  plans remain a major holder of financial assets. Consequently, the  financial services industry has responded to the growing need for  assistance with managing, investing, transferring, settling, valuing, and  holding pension assets. In 2005, over 81 percent of large  public/government plans utilized a consultant and 42 percent of private  pension plans did so. According to an SEC official, as of October 31, 2005,  there were more than 1,800 SEC-registered investment advisers that  indicated on their SEC registration forms that they provide pension  consulting services. The official stated that these firms vary widely from  small one-person operations to large organizations employing hundreds.  Some firms only provide pension consulting, while others may have  started as pension consultants, but then added additional business  operations such as brokerage and money management. It has been  reported by a financial newspaper that in order to remain competitive,  some consulting firms are assuming the fiduciary responsibility of making  investment decisions and have been expanding the range of services they  offer.", "This trend toward diversification leads to the potential for conflicts of  interest that could harm pension plans because of competing professional  interests. While conflict of interest is a broad term that can encompass  many specific arrangements, according to an SEC official, conflicts can  occur in the case of money managers, broker-dealers, or pension  consultants when business relationships, particularly those that involve  business among each other, may make them vulnerable to breaching their  fiduciary obligation or duty. Such competing interests can make it difficult  for fiduciaries, in general, to fulfill their duties impartially and could cause  them to breach their duty to act solely in the interest of investors, plan  participants, and beneficiaries. According to Labor officials, having a  conflict in and of itself does not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.  However, under securities law, acting on and benefiting from the  existence of a conflict without making full and fair disclosure of all related  issues to clients potentially affected by the conflict may very well  constitute a breach. As ERISA fiduciaries, plan trustees also may face  significant conflicts of interest as they may have allegiance both to the  plan and its beneficiaries, as well as to the plan sponsor that appoints  them, and they may receive economic benefits directly or indirectly from  plan service providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Pension Plan Service Providers May Have Conflicts of Interest, but Determining Whether Harm Results Is Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Although no complete information is available regarding the prevalence of  conflicts of interests, pension plan consultants assisting significant  numbers of pension plans sponsors may have conflicts of interest as a  result of their affiliations or business arrangements with other firms that  could affect the advice they provide to these plan sponsors. A May 2005  SEC staff study of pension consultants registered as investment advisers  found that more than half (13 out of 24) of the 24 consultants examined  had failed to disclose significant conflicts of interest to their pension fund  clients, including ongoing and PBGC trusteed DB plans. We determined  that, in 2006, these 13 consultants had over $4.5 trillion in U.S. assets  under advisement, including private DB and defined contribution (DC)  plan assets, as well as public pension plan and other types of assets. We  also analyzed a sample of ongoing DB plans associated with the 13  consultants that, as of year-end 2004, had assets of $183.5 billion for these  plans, while average assets were $155.3 million.  Additional analysis found  that the DB plans using these 13 consultants had annual returns that were  generally 1.3 percent lower than those that did not. Because many factors  can affect returns, and data and modeling limitations limit the ability to  generalize and interpret the results, this finding, while suggestive, should  not be considered as proof of causality between consultants and lower  rates of return. Although SEC staff have reported that some of the  consultants examined in their study have since taken corrective action,  our analysis illustrates the importance of detecting the presence of  undisclosed conflicts of interest among ongoing plans, and likely among  terminated plans. However, independent experts, EBSA and PBGC  officials all concur that while analyzing rates of return is a useful first step,  determining whether conflicts resulted in financial harm to individual  plans and the magnitude of that harm is often extremely difficult to detect  without a detailed forensic audit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pension Plan Fiduciaries and Money Managers Can Have Conflicts of Interest, Although Little Information Is Available on Their Prevalence", "paragraphs": ["According to experts we interviewed, fiduciaries of pension plans often  have an inherent conflict of interest because they are frequently  employees of the plan sponsor. As fiduciaries, they are charged by law to  act solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries, but they  may also have loyalty to the plan sponsor. For example, in 2004, United  Airlines, a plan sponsor, appointed itself fiduciary of its employee pension  plans after all three members of its plan trustee board resigned during  bankruptcy negotiations. A conflict of interest existed because the newly  appointed fiduciaries would have reason to make decisions that would  benefit the plan sponsor instead of the plan participants. In this instance,  the fiduciaries of the United Airlines\u2019 plans faced the obligation to ensure  that minimum funding standards explicitly set in ERISA were satisfied by  the plan sponsor. United Airlines subsequently decided to stop making  contributions to the pension plans it was attempting to terminate. Labor  stated that United Airlines\u2019 decision to stop funding its pension plans made  clear the need to appoint an independent fiduciary to represent the  interest of workers and retirees and resolve this conflict of interest.  Subsequently, Labor and United Airlines agreed that United Airlines would  appoint an independent fiduciary.", "Plan fiduciaries may also be more prone to conflicts of interest such as  prohibited transactions involving improper loans or more serious actions  such as taking money from the pension plan for personal or business use  when the plan sponsor is financially unstable and may be heading toward  bankruptcy. Experts told us that plan fiduciary conflicts of interest and  other acts such as these are less likely to occur in larger plans since they  often have many professionals to assist with a plan\u2019s administration and  management of plan assets. Despite this potential, there is little  information on the extent to which conflicts of interest occur among plan  fiduciaries of DB plans.", "Though no formal study has reported statistics quantifying the prevalence  of conflicts of interest among money managers, SEC through its  examination and enforcement efforts has also identified potential conflicts  of interest at money managers that could result in harm to clients,  including pension plans. Money managers may in some cases have  incentives to allocate investment opportunities in a way that could be  unfair to certain advisory clients. For example, an adviser might make  more money in fees based on how it allocates an investment opportunity\u2014 such as an initial public offering\u2014among its clients and steer that  opportunity to the advisors\u2019 more lucrative clients. In deciding whether to  allocate the opportunity among its clients, the adviser may have an  incentive to unfairly allocate the investment to a client that pays higher  fees. For example, as between a hedge fund and a pension fund, the  adviser could make more money in fees paid by the hedge fund (for which  fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the fund\u2019s overall  performance, which could increase significantly from the investment) than  in fees paid by the pension plan (for which fees are generally calculated as  a percentage of plan assets). Another form of this conflict of interest,  referred to as \u201ccherry picking,\u201d occurs when an adviser places a trade  without immediately identifying the client the trade is associated with, and  then allocates the investment after learning of its value. If the purchase  appears valuable based on market conditions, the adviser might place it in  its own portfolio or a more profitable portfolio, but if it appears less  valuable, the advisor might instead place it in one of its client\u2019s portfolios.", "Money managers, including those at pension plans, may also face conflicts  of interest because of due to soft dollar payment arrangements. Under soft  dollar arrangements, money managers use part of the brokerage  commissions their clients pay to broker-dealers for executing trades to  obtain research and other services. These arrangements can create a  number of problems. They can create incentives for investment advisers to  trade excessively to obtain more soft dollar services, thereby increasing  costs to pension plan clients or other clients. They can also influence  advisers to place trades with a broker-dealer that provides the adviser with  soft-dollar services rather than another broker-dealer that might provide  best execution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consultants Identified by SEC as Having Significant Ongoing Conflicts of Interest Provide Services to Many Pension Plans", "paragraphs": ["No complete information exists about the presence of conflicts of interest  at pension plan service providers. However, a 2005 SEC examination of  the activities of 24 pension consultants from 2002 through 2003 revealed  that 13 out of 24 of the firms examined failed to disclose significant  ongoing conflicts of interest. These ongoing conflicts took a number of  different forms. For example, SEC found that 13 pension consultants or  their affiliates were found to have conflicts of interest because they  provided products and services to both pension plan advisory clients and  money managers and mutual funds on an ongoing basis without  adequately disclosing these conflicts. Specifically, the study found that 10  pension consultants sold money managers analytical software packages,  which they use to help analyze and improve the performance of clients\u2019  holdings. This creates a conflict of interest for the pension consultant that  might be more inclined to recommend to pension plans the money  managers that buy software because those business relationships are  profitable for the consultant. Similarly, 13 pension consultants hosted  conferences attended by pension plan advisory clients, who were typically  invited to attend without charge, and money managers, who were often  invited to attend for a fee. A consultant hosting such a conference has a  conflict of interest because it might be more inclined to recommend to  pension plans the money managers that pay fees to attend conferences as  such fees are used to offset costs incurred in hosting the conference.", "SEC staff also found that the majority of pension consultants examined  had business relationships with broker-dealers that raised a number of  concerns about potential harm to pension plans. For example, in certain  directed brokerage arrangements, a pension consultant may convince a  pension plan client to direct their money manager to place plan trades  through a broker-dealer that was affiliated with the consultant as a means  for paying advisor fees a plan owed to its consultant using a portion of the  brokerage commission paid on such trades. These arrangements raised  concerns that plans might not have received the best price for each  trade\u2014or \u201cbest execution\u201d\u2014because the directions given to a plan\u2019s  money manager by the plan may have restricted the money manager\u2019s  ability to select a broker-dealer that was the best able to execute a trade.  These arrangements raised the additional concern that consultants might  be overpaid because the plan did not always know when the fee had been  paid in full because brokerage commissions were being used to pay the fee  rather than checks drawn on the plan\u2019s checking account.", "Following up on its examinations of 24 pension consultants, in late 2005,  SEC staff subsequently sought to determine what steps these firms had  taken to address the findings from the earlier examinations. According to  SEC staff, in general, most pension consulting firms it had examined had  taken positive steps to reevaluate, revise, and implement changes to their  policies and procedures. Specifically, pension consultants implemented  policies and procedures to insulate their advisory activities from other  activities, including for example, creating separate reporting lines and  firewalls between employees that perform these separate functions, and  considering employee compensation and incentives. In addition, SEC staff  said that most consultants they examined had updated their policies and  procedures to improve their disclosure of material conflicts of interest to  pension plan clients and potential clients. Many pension consultants the  SEC staff examined also reviewed and improved their policies and  procedures to prevent conflicts of interest with respect to brokerage  commissions, gifts, gratuities, entertainment, contributions, and donations  provided to clients or received by money managers. However, SEC staff  noted that while the pension consultants it had examined had improved  their practices, it was not able to conduct examinations of all 1,800  investment advisers that indicated that they provide pension consulting  services.", "Our analysis of industry data regarding the 13 pension consultants that  failed to disclose serious conflicts of interest found that these consultants  provided services to a number of pension plans. In particular, the 13  consultants:  in 2006, had over $4.5 trillion in U.S. assets under advisement, including  private DB and defined contribution (DC) plan assets, as well as public  pension plan and other types of assets;     provided advisory services to 36 percent (9 out of 25) of the largest  plan sponsors, in terms of claims, currently trusteed by PBGC since  2000;    provided advisory services to 14 percent (12 out of 86) of the plan  sponsors that were trusteed by the PBGC in 2005; and    provided advisory services to 24 percent (1009 out of 4203) of the  sponsors of ongoing DB plans between the years 2000 and 2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis Shows an Association between Inadequate Disclosure of Conflicts and Lower Rates of Return, Although Proof of Financial Harm Requires a Detailed Audit", "paragraphs": ["We conducted an analysis using ongoing DB plans that revealed a  statistical association between inadequate disclosure and lower  investment returns for ongoing plans, suggesting the possible adverse  financial effect of such nondisclosure. Specifically, we conducted an  econometric analysis using ongoing DB plans and SEC study data on  pension consultants that either adequately disclosed their conflicts of  interest and those who did not. We found lower annual rates of return for  those ongoing plans associated with consultants that had failed to disclose  significant conflicts of interest, with lower rates generally ranging from a  statistically significant 1.2 to 1.3 percentage points over the 2000 to 2004  period, depending on the different model specifications tested. Since the  average return for the ongoing plans that used consultants who did not  have significant disclosure violations was about 4.5 percent, the model  implies that the average returns for ongoing plans that used consultants  who failed to disclosure significant conflicts was 3.2 to 3.3 percent for the  period. We did not find significant differences in returns for those plans  that had associations with both types of consultants. As of year-end 2004,  our sample of ongoing plans represented assets of $183.5 billion for these  plans, and average assets were $155.3 million.

Although the analysis controlled for plan size,  funding level, performance of asset markets, differences in plan fiscal  years and other key variables, other unknown, omitted factors could have  influenced the results of our analysis. While this result gives an indication  of the potential harm conflicts of interest may cause in the aggregate,  these results cannot be generalized to the population of pension  consultants since the consultants examined by the SEC were not selected  randomly. In addition, while these findings are consistent with the views  of the experts we interviewed concerning the adverse effect that complex  service provider related conflicts of interest can have on pension plans, we  cannot rule out the possibility that some other differences between the  plans could explained the differences in estimated returns. See appendix II  for a fuller discussion of the limitations and caveats.", "Although statistical analysis is useful, a detailed audit would be needed to  uncover a conflict of interest in any one plan. Independent experts and  officials stated that though a typical first step to identify harm related to a  conflict of interest is to examine a plan\u2019s investment returns, determining  whether any financial harm is caused to an individual pension plan by a  conflict of interest requires a detailed forensic audit. A rate of return for  any single plan is not necessarily a good litmus test for deciding whether  to pursue an investigation. For example, two trusteed sponsors of plans  that had some history with consultants reported as having business  arrangements that could pose conflicts of interest had very different rates  of return for their plans. The U.S. Airways plans, which were trusteed by  PBGC in 2003 and 2005, had a rate of return that exceeded the average  measured the benchmark returns earned by the Standard and Poors (S&P)  500, CalPERS (a major public plan) and the Thrift Savings Plan (the  defined contribution plan for federal employees). Yet, at some point from  2000 through 2005, the U.S. Airways plan used the services of consultants  who had business arrangements that are of the form described in the SEC  study that raise concerns regarding conflicts of interest. These business  arrangements included directed brokerage arrangements and hosting  conferences. (See figure 1.)", "On the other hand, at some point during that time period United Airlines  used a pension consultant who had been noted for engaging in business  arrangements such as directed brokerage and commission recapture  programs that are similar in form to the type that SEC concluded in their  2005 study posed a conflict of interest. During our analysis period, United  Airlines showed a rate of return somewhat lower than three of the four  benchmarks. (See figure 1).  For both cases, and very likely most cases, a  detailed, forensic audit would be necessary to identify any accrued harm  from a conflict of interest. Even then, the magnitude of the harm could be  difficult to determine. Experts told us that determining harm often  involves a resource-intensive audit of a plan\u2019s service provider\u2019s records  and the investment performance of the plan\u2019s assets. To perform such an  audit effectively, experts told us that they would need, at a minimum, 5  years worth of service provider specific documents, including contracts  with the plan sponsor, fees charged, payments and other financial  transactions between service providers and those involving plan  fiduciaries. In addition, experts told us that it would be important to  review the investigative files and complaint records of agencies like the  SEC to determine if there is a history of problems at plans and service  providers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "PBGC\u2019s Current Policy and Procedures Are Not Focused on Detecting Conflicts of Interest among Service Providers", "paragraphs": ["As a creditor and a trustee of a sponsor\u2019s terminated plan, PBGC\u2019s policies  and procedures are designed to review a plan\u2019s assets and liabilities and  recover any shortfall.

However, agency officials and experts explained that  since PBGC is not an enforcement agency, their responsibility is to bring  cases to recover losses to a plan, not to bring cases for ERISA violations.  For example, a kickback arrangement\u2014where an investor receives a  financial benefit for choosing a particular investment\u2014or other types of  self-dealing constitute conflicts of interest that may violate ERISA\u2019s  prohibited transaction rules. Although it is often difficult to determine  whether a kickback causes a loss to a plan, under the prohibited  transaction provision, the existence of a violation does not depend on  whether any harm results from the transaction. Hence, identifying and  bringing these types of cases would not necessarily be something that  PBGC would pursue unless the violation caused a loss to the plan.", "PBGC has pursued cases against plan fiduciaries in an effort to seek such  recoveries. However, in many instances, according to PBGC officials,  seeking recoveries from the plan fiduciary of a small plan to recover  missing money or improper loans may prove fruitless since the plan  fiduciary may have few assets to place a claim against. In fact, in some  cases, a plan fiduciary\u2019s only asset from which to recover may be an  accrued pension benefit. PBGC officials told us that the majority of their  cases of fiduciary breach involve action by a fiduciary that adversely  affected plan assets.

The small percentage of  participants and beneficiaries who currently could be helped by such  monetary recoveries represents those that have lost promised plan  benefits that were not guaranteed by PBGC and were not funded by the  plan\u2019s assets.", "PBGC is required by law to use a portion of its employer liability  recoveries and remaining plan assets to cover the non-guaranteed benefits  of pension holders after guaranteed benefits are funded and allocated.

Agency officials told us that recoveries on claims for employer  liability are distributed as prescribed by law and typically increases a  participant\u2019s benefit payment less than $20 per month.

Meanwhile, EBSA has recently expanded its ERISA  enforcement effort by implementing its new Consultant/Adviser Project  (CAP) to focus more heavily on conflicts of interest at all pension plans.

There are several reasons for this, according to EBSA officials.  First, they emphasized the view that it is primarily the failure of plan  sponsors to adequately fund pension plans causing plan underfunding  problems rather than poor investment advice from self-interested service  providers. Second, officials told us that while they do have the  responsibility to enforce fiduciary violations regardless of whether a plan  has terminated, they do not focus their enforcement efforts on PBGC  trusteed plans and generally leave the responsibility of identifying  potentially harmful conflicts of interest to PBGC for the plans under their  control. EBSA officials also said, that while their agency has subpoena  power, PBGC has the necessary authority and access to the many  documents needed to pursue conflicts in the plans it trustees. However,  PBGC officials noted that while this may be true for terminated plans, it  does not have jurisdiction to collect such documents for plans that have  not yet terminated.", "Finally, EBSA officials told us they had not had occasion to investigate any  PBGC-trusteed plans for conflicts of interest insofar as PBGC had not  made any investigative referral to EBSA concerning conflicts of interest.  Further, EBSA officials said they had not received any complaints  regarding service providers\u2019 conflicts of interests involving a terminated  plan prior to a letter it, along with PBGC, received in 2005 from  representatives of certain United Airlines employees. Agency officials told  us that they responded to concerns raised in that letter by reviewing the  plan performances and the portfolio distributions of United Airlines\u2019 plans  and determined that they were in line with those demonstrated in the  industry. In fact, in some discrete years, the performance for the United  Airlines plans exceeded some industry benchmarks. Finally, EBSA used  United\u2019s Form 5500 information to review the fees paid to service  providers and found them to be comparable to other plans and reasonable.  Thus, the agency did not believe that a forensic audit for service provider  conflicts at United Airlines\u2019 plans was warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EBSA Has a New Initiative to Focus on Conflicts of Interest among Service Providers", "paragraphs": ["Despite the current lack of information about the extent of any harm that  may have occurred as a result of conflicts of interest, EBSA officials  acknowledged that such conflicts are a growing concern for their agency.  In order to address these concerns, the agency has, therefore, undertaken  a new national enforcement project, known as the Consultant/Adviser  Project (CAP), which largely focuses on issues identified in the SEC\u2019s 2005  study of pension consultants. In addition, with this project, EBSA hopes  to identify other service providers that may be using or managing plan  assets for personal benefit. Specifically the agency will look for improper,  undisclosed compensation such as kickbacks, pay-to-play arrangements,  and soft dollar arrangements. Further, to acquire more information about  the fees charged by service providers, EBSA has proposed several  revisions to the Form 5500, which plan sponsors are required to file  annually. Among the many changes, the revised form would require  increased disclosure regarding the types and amounts of payments made  to service providers, including amounts paid via third-party arrangements,  both direct and indirect.", "Despite these changes, EBSA officials said the CAP will not have specific  procedures focused on examining service providers of high risk and  underfunded plans once they are trusteed by PBGC. In addition, as we  previously reported, challenges remain for pursuing more complicated  conflicts of interest cases impacting plans in the context of EBSA\u2019s overall  enforcement program. For example, EBSA uses participant complaints  and other agency referrals as sources of investigative leads and to detect  violations. EBSA also identifies leads through informal targeting efforts by  investigators primarily using data reported by plan sponsors on their Form  5500 annual returns. While these sources are important, such methods are  generally reactive and may reveal only those violations that are sufficiently  obvious for a plan participant to detect or those that are disclosed and not  those violations that are more complex. Moreover, complaints have  primarily originated from participants in defined contribution (DC) plans  since certain problems (e.g., failure to credit participants\u2019 accounts with  deposits) involving DC plans are often more apparent to participants.  Requiring more information on the Form 5500 could, according to experts,  uncover or discourage many abuses concerning conflicts of interest.  However, the Form does not necessarily offer the agency timely or  accurate information, because of the 285 days allowed for its completion  and the possibility that errors may be present on the Form 5500 using the  current paper-based filing system.", "It is also unclear how much time EBSA investigators, given their other  duties, will be able to devote to the complex conflicts of interest cases  similar to those targeted by the CAP. EBSA officials told us that they are  addressing their resource constraints in the CAP by concentrating on a  relatively small number of carefully targeted cases. They said they are  undecided as to whether the agency will expand CAP beyond the cases  identified as a result of the SEC study once these investigations are  completed. We had previously reported that Labor\u2019s revised performance  goals for EBSA enforcement may encourage a focus on cases that are  more obvious and easily corrected, such as those involving delinquent  employee contributions to DC plans, rather than on investigations of  complex and emerging violations where the outcome is less certain and  may take longer to attain. We had suggested changes to EBSA\u2019s approach  to assessing performance to better promote industry compliance and  address emerging violations although the agency has yet to make  substantial changes to its performance measures.", "Further, though fiduciaries are considered the first line of defense in  avoiding conflicts of interest, EBSA does not conduct routine compliance  examinations or routinely evaluate plan fiduciaries that are not part of an  ongoing investigation to determine how well they select and monitor  service providers. Agency officials and experts have stated that having a  formal set of procedures and guidelines in place to guide the selection of  service providers as well as a formal investment strategy to guide how  assets are to be invested helps to mitigate conflicts of interest. EBSA  officials said the agency lacks sufficient resources to conduct such general  oversight and, instead, uses outreach programs to educate fiduciaries on  the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest. Other expert observers,  however, commented that EBSA\u2019s education program only addresses  abuses that occur as a result of ignorance or unintentional negligence, not  those conflicts that are intentional. The experts emphasized that it is  difficult to detect harmful conflicts of interest without some form of  regularized or routine examinations. Although EBSA, in concert with the  SEC, has issued a \u201ctip list\u201d of questions to help plan fiduciaries avoid  conflicts among service providers, EBSA has no compliance procedures to  determine whether fiduciaries are generally using this information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EBSA Officials Cite ERISA as Constraint in Pursuing Conflicts of Interest", "paragraphs": ["EBSA\u2019s ability to recover plan losses related to conflicts of interest by a  service provider is largely limited by the extent to which the service  provider was functioning as a fiduciary under ERISA. Additionally, for  EBSA to take action against an individual or entity, there generally must  be a breach of fiduciary duty. Many service providers carefully structure  their contracts with plans in an attempt to avoid meeting the ERISA  definition of a fiduciary, but whether or not they do depends on the facts  and circumstances in each case. EBSA officials said that many service  providers, such as accountants, auditors, and actuaries are seldom  fiduciaries under ERISA even though they provide important consulting  services to DB plans by evaluating plan assets, calculating required  funding levels, and evaluating financial statements. Experts told us that  broker-dealers are a growing concern, for example, because they have  been expanding their services to include both consulting and investment  services\u2014triggering conflicts of interest questions because offering both  services raises concerns regarding the best execution of trades and  introduces incentives that may not promote practices in the best interest  of plans and participants.

EBSA  officials said that proving such knowing involvement is often quite  difficult. Even in cases where EBSA can prove that a non-fiduciary  knowingly participated in a fiduciary breach, however, EBSA is limited in  its ability to obtain meaningful recoveries. Specifically, EBSA cannot  recover plan losses but usually only amounts the plan paid to the non- fiduciary and any profits derived from those payments. Furthermore,  courts have required proof that these amounts remain in the possession of  the non-fiduciary plan in order for them to be recovered.", "In addition to such monetary recoveries, EBSA can also obtain injunctions  against fiduciaries initiating or continuing, and non-fiduciaries knowingly  participating with fiduciaries in, activities constituting fiduciary breaches.

In addition,  differences in definitions and terminology create challenges for the  agencies to gather useful information for collaborating on investigations.

Although EBSA does have broad subpoena powers, the use of  these subpoena powers and enforcing subpoenas can involve significant  delays in enforcement and case resolution.", "The lack of formal collaboration between the three agencies also reflects  their differing missions. While the SEC and EBSA both have an  enforcement role, their missions have different orientations. SEC enforces  securities law and is primarily concerned with regulating professional  entities, such as pension consultants or investment advisers, to the extent  that all conflicts of interest are adequately disclosed and plan sponsors  can make informed decisions about whom to hire. In most cases, the SEC  is able to act administratively, in that it can levy fines and suspend  registered advisers without having to use federal courts.

In most cases,  EBSA must prove that each violation it pursues was caused by a plan  fiduciary or a party carrying out a fiduciary function. EBSA officials told  us that a consultant or other adviser is a fiduciary investment adviser only  to the extent that advice was provided (1) on the purchase or sale of  securities or other property of the plan, (2) on a regular basis, (3) pursuant  to a mutual agreement, arrangement, or understanding, (4) as a primary  basis for investment decisions, and (5) based on the particular needs of  the plan. While the courts have ruled in some cases that EBSA can pursue  non-fiduciaries that contribute to a fiduciary breach, EBSA officials stated  that the remedies they have available to them under ERISA are limited  when pursuing these entities. Moreover, EBSA officials told us that there  can be situations where a pension consultant may not meet the conditions  necessary to be considered a fiduciary under ERISA; in which case EBSA  generally would not be able to take action against the consultant.", "The role of PBGC, in turn, is not to regulate pension plan trustees and  service providers, but to insure benefits for the beneficiaries of terminated  pension plans. Therefore, PBGC\u2019s primary goal is to preserve plan assets  to the degree possible in order to pay promised benefits and keep  expenses to a minimum.

In fact, the pre-ERISA world of  1974 never anticipated the multiplicity and complexity of financial  instruments that have expanded both investment opportunities and risks  for plan fiduciaries. Index and hedge funds, the growth of complicated  financial derivatives, and access to international financial markets  represent only some of the extraordinary number of choices confronting  today\u2019s pension plan fiduciaries.", "Of necessity, DB pension plan fiduciaries must utilize the variety of service  providers that have become available to help them assess choices. While  conflicts of interest are not necessarily inherent in the provision of such  financial services, the prevalence and the proliferation of consulting work  and the complexity of business arrangements among investment advisers,  plan consultants, and others have increased the likelihood. Our analysis of  ongoing plans suggests that, in the aggregate, there may be some cause for  concern. While many consultants have taken remedial action, there are  pension plan consultants that advise on a sizeable portion of U.S. pension  assets that did not fully disclose conflicts of interest in the past. Although  not generalizeable to all consultants and plans, our analysis cautiously  suggests an association with such undisclosed conflicts and plan  performance. However, assessing the extent and magnitude of the  problem of conflicts of interest at an individual plan level, at the outset,  may require a coordinated effort among the regulatory agencies because of  the complexities involved and the significant resources associated with  investigative audits. Regardless of the difficulty of finding a financial trail  of damage, to the extent that financially harmful conflicts of interest exist,  they pose a potential threat to the investment confidence of sponsors and  participants. For this reason, alone, credible and visible enforcement is  essential to prevent such erosion.", "Yet our findings reveal that there is limited regulatory framework for  deterrence in this area, particularly for terminated DB plans and those  likely to terminate. EBSA\u2019s recent CAP initiative to target conflicts of  interest among service providers may help, but it does not include any  specific emphasis on service providers of plans either under PBGC\u2019s  trusteeship or those considered likely to terminate. In addition, as EBSA  officials have noted, ERISA\u2019s definition of fiduciary and associated  remedies and penalties to correct potential breaches of fiduciary  responsibility, conceived to address the pension issues of the 1970s, are  less effective in combating conflicts of interest in the far more complex  world of today. Further, the SEC concluded in its study that many pension  consultants do not consider themselves to be fiduciaries to their clients. In  fact, many pension consultants believe they have taken appropriate  actions to insulate themselves from being considered a fiduciary under  ERISA. As a result, it appears that many consultants believe they do not  have any fiduciary relationships with their advisory clients and ignore or  are not aware of their fiduciary obligations under the Advisers Act.", "Meanwhile, PBGC\u2019s recent decision to conduct an overall risk assessment  and implement new screening procedures acknowledges the need for  improvement in PBGC\u2019s reviews for conflicts of interest and other risk  factors. Without procedures to evaluate the effect of conflicts of interest  on high risk and terminated plans, however, potential ERISA violations  related to such conflicts of interest could possibly go undetected.  Moreover, the current levels of collaboration among the three agencies  most involved with DB pension plans -- EBSA, PBGC, and the SEC -- or  their service providers, present opportunities that could enhance  enforcement. Because SEC conducts examinations of some registered  advisers it oversees, consistent inquiry by EBSA and PBGC into SEC\u2019s  inspection results would be a good first step toward bridging the  information gap. In addition, in the spirit of creating efficiencies with  overseeing service providers doing business with pension plans, EBSA and  PBGC may greatly benefit from SEC\u2019s regular exams by giving some  thought to what SEC could collect during its efforts that would be useful  to the other two agencies.", "Nevertheless, it would be prudent and responsible to carefully weigh the  benefits of any new regulatory approaches against their potential effect on  continued sponsorship of DB plans.

As a result, panel data are able to  identify and measure effects that are not detectable in other designs. There  are two commonly accepted approaches to estimating panel data, the  \u201crandom-effects\u201d model and the \u201cfixed-effects\u201d model. In a \u201cfixed- effects\u201d  model individual effects are estimated in this case for each plan to reflect  the assumption that special features specific to each plan such as  investment style or skill can be captured best with a different, time- invariant intercept for each plan. In a \u201crandom-effects\u201d model, in this  context, these individual effects are captured through treating the  intercept as a random variable with an unique error term for each plan.  While each model has its advantages and disadvantages, the random  effects model is appropriate when we can plausibly assume that the  individual effects (which are unobserved and unmeasured in the model)  are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables that are measured and  included in the model. If this assumption holds, the random-effects model  is especially attractive if the cross-sectional units (pension plans) are  drawn randomly from a common population or alternatively when the  number of cross-sectional units is large and the time period is small.  Otherwise, the fixed-effects model is preferred, especially as a control for  omitted variables bias.", "Using panel data as stated above, basic model takes the form:  (1) yit = \u03b8 + Xit\u03b2 + Z\u03b4 + \u03b5it where  y =   the dependent variable (plan returns).", "X =  a matrix of explanatory variables that varies across time and  individual plans.

Therefore we specify the composite error structure for the disturbance  term as follows:  (2) \u03b5it = \u03b1 + \u03b7it where  \u03b1 =  plan-specific error component which captures the  unobserved heterogeneity across plans (either as a fixed- or random- effect).", "E(Xit\u03b7it) =   0 (there is no correlation between \u03b7it and Xit).", "The \u03b1 is the individual effect which can be treated as either fixed or  random. The fixed- and random-effect models which take account of the  repetition inherent in the data and allow us to use the individual  differences effectively. Correspondingly, if we treat the individual effect as  zero we can estimate the model using the simple ordinary least squares  (OLS) procedure. Essentially, this is a pooled regression model where we  assume the intercept and slope coefficients are constant across time and  space and the normal error term (\u03b7it) captures differences over time and  individual plans. However, when the true model is a random-effects model,  pooling the observations in this manner using OLS produces biased  estimates that are also not efficient when compared to the more complex  GLS procedure (outlined hereafter). The pooled OLS model is also  susceptible to omitted-variables bias.", "The random-effects technique proceeds under the premise that the  ignorance about the unobserved differences in returns across plans is  better captured through the disturbance term rather than the intercept.  The random-effects model basically maintains that the 1,111 pension plans  in the sample are a drawing from a much larger universe of such plans and  that they have a common mean value for plan returns (represented by the  constant term, \u03b8) and that the individual differences in the intercept values  of each plan are captured in the error term \u03b5it. Given the composite nature  of the new disturbance term that incorporates the individual random  effect of each plan, the appropriate method for producing estimates is  generalized least squares (GLS). Feasible GLS derives an estimate of the  covariance matrix of the error term and uses the information  (heteroscedasticity from repeated observations of the same cross-section  unit) to estimate the coefficients in the model. serially correlated across time, invalidating OLS estimates. depend more heavily on the control variables included in the model to  capture differences across plans, unless the omitted variables (unobserved  heterogeneity across plan) are uncorrelated with the conflict dummy  variable. If this is the case, the random-effect model may produce more  appropriate estimates than the fixed-effects model. In our case, the  unobserved effects, \u03b1, were found to be unimportant (relative to the  variance of \u03b7) as the random-effect estimates approximated the pooled  OLS results. This made the choice between random and pooled OLS a  moot point (see below)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fixed-Effect Model", "paragraphs": ["When there is heterogeneity that cannot readily be explained, another  analytical approach is to incorporate it into a fixed-effects model. In the  case of the fixed-effects model, \u03b1it is estimated uniquely for each plan as a  fixed coefficient to be added to the intercept term. In this way, we take  into the account the individuality of each plan (each cross-sectional unit)  by letting the intercept vary by a fixed amount for each plan. The benefit  of the fixed-effects estimator is that it is consistent in the presence of  omitted variables. Because many variables that impact returns across  plans are difficult to measure or could not be obtained this omission could  bias the parameter estimates. With panel data and a fixed-effect  specification it is possible to obtain consistent estimates of the impact of  undisclosed conflicts of interest even when there are correlated omitted  effects. The differences that exist across plan are essentially pulled out  and accounted for explicitly, allowing for a more valid estimation of the  impact of conflicts of interest on plan returns. Moreover, in many cases  the fixed-effects estimates will still produce consistent estimates even  when the random effects model is valid.", "While the easiest way to implement the fixed-effects estimator is to  include a dummy variable for each plan, we could not run a fixed-effect  model directly due to the nature of our primary regressor of interest. Since  the fixed-effects are time-invariant and the conflict variable in our model is  a qualitative variable (dummy) that does not change over the 2000 to 2004  period either, the fixed effects model is not able to identify the impact of  the variable. Essentially the variable is collinear with the fixed effect  intercepts. Therefore we used an alternative procedure to achieve the  same effect. To produce the fixed-effects estimator we used the fixed- effects vector decomposition approach. The technique estimates the  fixed-effects estimator in three stages: the first stage runs a fixed-effect  model without the time invariant variables (Z). We then decompose the  fixed-effects estimator into a portion explained by the time invariant  variables (Z) and an error term. The final stage re-estimates the first stage  with the time invariant and time variant variables and the error term from  the stage two. In the third stage, estimated by pooled regression, we used  robust standard errors adjusted for the degrees of freedom. In this manner  we were able to approximate the unbiased, consistent estimator in the  presence of time-invariant omitted variables. While some researchers  have found that this procedure has better finite sample properties than the  alternative approaches for estimating the effect of time-invariant variables  using panel data, it should be noted that this is a recently applied  econometric technique."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variables Included in the Model", "paragraphs": ["The dependent variable in all of our econometric models is plan returns.

We included a number of control variables in attempt to  capture the variation in plan return across plans although time constraints  restricted the variables we could include. Because different plans may  allocate assets differently because of investment style or age composition  of plan participants, some plans may track more conservative or  aggressive benchmarks rather than the overall market. As a result in  addition to a general market indicator, the S&P 500, we also include a  measure of hedge fund performance as well as a fixed income measure.  The broad market measure the performance of the S&P 500 over plan i\u2019s  fiscal year for year t. Our measure of hedge fund performance is the  Credit Suisse/Tremont hedge fund index. The fixed-income measure is the  Moody\u2019s yield on corporate seasoned Aaa bonds taken from the Federal  Reserve Board. These variables were constructed in a manner that also  accounts for the varied fiscal year end dates across plans. Moreover, since  the size and the funding level of the plan may influence asset allocation  and investment strategy, we included assets at the beginning of the fiscal  year and the degree of under-funding as explanatory variables as well.  Including funding status creates potential simultaneous equations bias  since the funding ratio is most likely dependent on plan returns. Since  lagging the variable resulted in a loss of both a year\u2019s data and large  number of observations as well as severe autocorrelation, we included the  contemporaneous funding ratio but did not include the variable all  specifications. The asset variable was substantively and/or statistically  insignificant across multiple specifications and therefore it was not  included in some instances.", "We also included time period effects whenever possible. This amounts to  creating a dummy variable for 4 of the 5 time periods covered in the  database.

Although the panel data provides many advantages and can produce more  valid and efficient estimates, drawing causal inferences is still difficult.  Even with control variables and the fixed-effects models there are a  number of threats to the validity of our results. First, although the fixed- effects estimator is robust to the omission of any relevant time-invariant  variables, if there are time-varying differences that have been omitted the  result could be biased. Although the analysis controlled for plan size,  funding level, the performance of asset markets and other key variables,  other unknown, omitted factors could still influence the results of our  analysis or account for the differences in estimated returns. There may be  additional biases resulting from the vector decomposition procedure used  to obtain the fixed-effect estimates. Second, the existence of statistical  relationship is not in and of itself, enough to assert causality. Fixed-effects,  while strengthening the validity of model\u2019s parameters, do not completely  solve the problem of drawing causal inferences. Third, the use of the 5500  data could lead to measurement error in the dependent variable (plan  returns). We assume that any errors are random and therefore do not  impact the validity of the parameter estimates. Similarly, although we were  careful in identifying and reviewing the plans associated with the two  types of pension consultants any error, random or non-random, would  impact the parameter estimates. Moreover, we used a potentially  unrepresentative sample of pension consultants to identify the pension  plans included in our investigation that therefore limits the ability to  generalize the results.
