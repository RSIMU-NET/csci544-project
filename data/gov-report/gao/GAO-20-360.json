FEMA deployed 14,684 and 10,328 personnel at the peak of each of these seasons and reported staffing shortages during the disasters. GAO was asked to review issues related to the federal response to the 2017 disaster season.", "This report addresses (1) how FEMA's disaster workforce is qualified and deployed, (2) how effective FEMA's qualification and deployment processes were during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons in ensuring workforce needs were met in the field, and (3) the extent to which FEMA's disaster workforce receives staff development to enhance skills and competencies. GAO analyzed documentation and data on incident workforce qualification and deployment; conducted 17 focus groups with 129 staff members; and interviewed FEMA officials in headquarters, field, and regional offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established mechanisms to qualify and deploy staff to disasters. For example, the FEMA Qualification System tracks training and task performance requirements for disaster workforce positions and has a process to designate staff as qualified in their positions once they have completed these requirements. FEMA's deployment process uses an automated system to deploy staff members to disasters that match field requests for positions and proficiency levels. The process depends on the agency's qualification and deployment systems to identify staff qualification status and skillsets to meet field needs.", "However, FEMA's qualification and deployment processes did not provide reliable and complete staffing information to field officials to ensure its workforce was effectively deployed and used during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons. Specifically, GAO's focus groups with over 100 incident staff members and interviews with field and regional officials indicate that disaster personnel experienced significant limitations with qualification status matching performance in the field, due in part to challenges with how staff are evaluated through the qualification process. In all focus groups with applicable incident personnel, participants cited issues with staff members who were qualified in the FEMA Qualification System not having the skills or experience to effectively perform their positions. For example, one participant described supervising staff members who were qualified in the system but did not know the eligibility requirements for applicants to receive housing assistance, or what information needed to be included in the applicant's file. In addition, participants in the majority of the focus groups reported challenges with using FEMA's deployment processes to fully identify staff responsibilities, specialized skillsets, and experience. FEMA headquarters officials acknowledged the identified information challenges but said they have not developed a plan to address them in part because of competing priorities. Developing a plan to address identified challenges with providing reliable staffing information to field officials would enhance FEMA's ability to use staff as flexibly and effectively as possible to meet disaster needs.", "Further, FEMA's disaster workforce experienced challenges with receiving staff development through the agency's existing methods to enhance the skills and competencies needed during disaster deployments\u2014challenges FEMA headquarters officials acknowledged. Specifically, GAO's focus groups and interviews indicate that disaster personnel encountered challenges related to the availability of courses, providing and receiving on-the-job training and mentoring, and consistently receiving performance evaluations. For example, in 10 of 17 focus groups, participants cited barriers to taking courses that in their view would help them better perform their jobs. In addition, participants in seven focus groups stated that they did not receive coaching or feedback on the job. Relatedly, FEMA data show that at the start of deployments during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons, 36 percent of staff did not have an official assigned to coach and evaluate task performance\u2014the primary mechanism the agency depends on for coaching. Creating a staff development program would help better ensure FEMA's disaster workforce develops the skills and competencies needed to meet mission needs in the field."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations, including that FEMA develop (1) a plan to address identified challenges that have hindered its ability to provide reliable information to field officials about staff skills and abilities and (2) a staff development program for its disaster workforce that addresses training access, delivery of on-the-job training, and other development methods. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons, several sequential, large- scale disasters created an unprecedented demand for federal resources.  In 2017, weather and climate-related disasters, including hurricanes  Harvey, Irma, and Maria, caused over $300 billion in damages in the  United States. Along with the severe 2017 California wildfires, these  disasters collectively affected 47 million people\u2014nearly 15 percent of the  nation\u2019s population. In 2018, hurricanes Florence and Matthew and  another severe California wildfire season again necessitated a major  federal response. We have previously reported that the rising number and  costs of disasters and the increasing reliance on the federal government  for disaster assistance will likely continue to rise as the climate changes.  Figure 1 shows the time line for key major disasters during the 2017 and  2018 disaster seasons.", "The October 8, 2017 wildfires included the Tubbs, Nuns, Atlas, and Pocket fires, among others.", "The December 4, 2017 wildfires included the Thomas, Creek, and Rye fires, among others.", "The November 8, 2018 wildfires included the Camp, Woolsey, and Hill fires.", "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) coordinated the  federal response to these disasters and relied heavily on its workforce to  meet its mission. The agency deployed 14,684 personnel at the peak of  the 2017 disaster season and 10,328 personnel at the peak of the 2018  season. The numbers for each of these seasons are more than double  the number deployed at the peak of the 2016 disaster season, which was  about 5,000 personnel. The concurrent nature of the disasters in both the  2017 and 2018 disaster seasons highlighted the complex challenges  facing FEMA\u2019s workforce. The 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons required  FEMA management to redeploy response personnel from one disaster to  the next, and the agency reported facing staffing shortfalls throughout the  response to these disasters. Additionally, a large influx of new employees  added to challenges with providing timely, program-specific training.  FEMA\u2019s disaster workforce is expected to be in high demand for the  foreseeable future. According to FEMA, at the end of fiscal year 2019,  there were 64 open presidentially declared disasters that required federal  assistance.", "In recent years, we have reported on long-standing workforce  management challenges within FEMA. For example, in September 2018,  we reported on the workforce capacity and training challenges FEMA  faced in the wake of the 2017 disasters. In November and December  2017, we reported on staffing challenges in FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance  grant program, which provides funding to state and local governments,  among others, to help them respond to and recover from disasters. In  our March 2019 report on the status of recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, we  also reported Puerto Rico officials\u2019 concerns about FEMA staff turnover  and lack of knowledge among FEMA staff about how disaster assistance  grant procedures are to be applied in Puerto Rico. While FEMA has  taken actions to address several of our workforce management-related  recommendations since 2016, a number of recommendations remained  open at the start of the 2019 hurricane season.", "You asked us to review a broad range of issues related to disaster  response and recovery following the 2017 disaster season, including the  response and recovery to hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the  California wildfires. Because of the importance of addressing workforce  issues to meet future disaster response and recovery needs, this report  addresses  1.  how FEMA\u2019s disaster workforce is qualified and deployed, and  workforce staffing levels during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons;  2.  how effective FEMA\u2019s qualification and deployment processes were  during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons in helping ensure  workforce needs were met in the field; and  3.  the extent to which FEMA\u2019s disaster workforce receives staff  development to enhance skills and competencies to support the  agency\u2019s disaster missions.", "To address all three objectives, we focused on FEMA staff members who  deploy to disaster sites. We analyzed documentation and data on disaster  workforce qualification, deployment, staffing levels, and development. For  example, we reviewed FEMA\u2019s 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, 2017 Incident  Management Handbook, 2015 and 2019 FEMA Qualification System  guides, 2019 Deployment Guide, and documentation on FEMA\u2019s staffing  targets. We also analyzed data from FEMA\u2019s Deployment Tracking  System to determine staffing levels and to evaluate efforts FEMA has  taken to develop its staff, and human capital data to determine the  number of new staff FEMA hired. To assess the reliability of the data, we  interviewed officials at FEMA headquarters about their data quality control  procedures and reviewed documentation about these data systems. For  the Deployment Tracking System, we also conducted electronic testing  and reviewed the data for obvious errors and omissions. We found these  data sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "In addition, we conducted focus groups with members of FEMA\u2019s disaster  workforce and interviewed FEMA officials in the agency\u2019s field and  regional offices to obtain perspectives on, and experiences with, the level  of staffing and skillsets of personnel deployed to disasters, FEMA\u2019s  processes to qualify and deploy staff, and how staff were trained and  developed. Specifically, we conducted 17 focus groups with a total of 129  participants at FEMA joint field offices in Florida and Puerto Rico, FEMA\u2019s  regional office in Texas, and headquarters. We selected these locations  based on where staff members who were deployed during the 2017  disaster season were located at the time of our review and to obtain  variation in geographic location to the extent possible, among other  things. Participants were selected using a stratified random sample from  those who had been deployed to a disaster during the 2017 disaster  season. Participants in each focus group were of the same employee  type, and we conducted separate groups with participants in supervisory  and nonsupervisory positions so they could speak more freely. We also  selected participants to obtain a mix of staff from different program areas  and qualification designations.", "For our interviews with FEMA field and regional officials, we spoke with  FEMA leadership and managers who worked in various programmatic  areas in joint field offices in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and  Puerto Rico and regional offices in Colorado, Texas, and Washington.  We selected the joint field offices and regions as locations for interviews  based on our focus group locations and to obtain variation in geographic  location and disaster activity. We evaluated the interviews with field and  regional officials and transcripts from audio-recordings of the focus  groups using systematic content analysis to identify key themes  concerning the topics our report addresses. The results from our analyses  of the focus groups and interviews are not generalizable, but provide  important perspectives on how effectively FEMA qualifies, deploys, and  develops staff for disasters.", "Finally, we interviewed senior officials in FEMA headquarters to obtain  their perspectives on the staffing levels of the disaster workforce and how  the workforce is qualified, deployed, and developed. In addition, we  obtained information from these officials on the actions FEMA has taken  to address the challenges we identified through our focus groups,  interviews with field and regional officials, and data analysis. We  compared the results of our analysis and the information we gathered  with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, The  Standard for Program Management, FEMA strategic documents and  guidance, and our prior reports on strategic human capital  management.

FEMA\u2019s disaster workforce is  organized according to position categories, employee types, functions,  and job titles.", "Every FEMA employee is assigned to one or more of four position  categories. Staff assigned to incident management positions deploy to  disaster sites to administer federal emergency response and recovery  programs. Staff assigned to the other three position categories\u2014incident  support, ancillary support, and mission essential\u2014provide support  services to deployed incident management staff, as well as to FEMA  more generally. For example, incident support staff assist with disaster  operations at the regional or national level, while mission essential staff  maintain basic agency operations, such as payroll and information  technology.", "FEMA has several different employee types that operate out of the  agency\u2019s national headquarters, regional offices, and joint field offices at  specific disaster locations.

These  positions may be renewed if there is ongoing disaster work and  funding is available.", "Incident Management COREs are a type of CORE employee that  maintain a regular state of readiness to provide emergency-state  support and can be deployed up to 300 days a year in mission  areas.", "Incident Management Assistance Teams are rapid-response  teams of CORE employees that deploy to disaster sites with little  to no notice and remain at disaster sites for unspecified amounts  of time, depending on mission needs. Members generally receive  4-year appointments.", "Reservists are on-call employees who work intermittently as required  during incident management operations. Reservists must be available  to deploy as needed on 24 hours\u2019 notice at all times during their 24  month appointment.", "FEMA also has the authority to augment its disaster workforce with  temporary employees. This includes local hires, Surge Capacity Force  volunteers, and FEMA Corps members. FEMA further augments its  workforce with technical assistance contractors, who are specialized contractors hired to perform specific responsibilities.

Each cadre supports at  least one of these missions, and some cadres perform functions across  more than one. Cadres also generally deploy to an incident at varying  points in the response and recovery phases, depending on their  functions. For example, FEMA officials said that the Logistics cadre,  which coordinates and monitors all aspects of resource planning,  movement, and order tracking, typically deploys staff to an incident before  the Hazard Mitigation cadre, which supports risk reduction activities later  during the recovery phase. See figure 4 for an example of peak  deployment by cadre during Hurricane Florence and appendix II for a  description of each cadre and their primary duties.", "FEMA manages the staffing, training, and deployment of its cadres at the  national level.

Demonstrated performance involves validation of the ability to  successfully and independently perform specific tasks. According to  FEMA, employees conduct required training concurrently with  demonstrated performance so that training builds on previous experience  and coursework. After FEMA assigns an incident management position to  staff, they are issued an electronic position task book, which lists and  tracks the training and demonstrated performance requirements for that  position.", "Tasks in the position task book need to be signed off by a coach-and- evaluator\u2014an individual that is trained and designated as a subject  matter expert by their cadre to evaluate one or more FEMA Qualification  System positions.

If there are staffing  shortages among regional full-time equivalent staff members, FEMA  leadership in the region where the disaster occurs may submit a  deployment request for additional incident management staff members  through the Deployment Tracking System. After the Incident  Management Assistance Team stands up a joint field office, the Federal  Coordinating Officer assumes authority over all emergency response and  recovery efforts for the disaster, which includes filling staffing needs.", "To determine the number and type of incident management personnel  needed in each position to meet FEMA requirements for any given  disaster, the Federal Coordinating Officer coordinates with regional  leadership, the joint field office\u2019s Chief of Staff, and cadre management.  The basis of this determination is a variety of factors related to the nature  and scope of the disaster. For example, Individual Assistance and Public  Assistance needs are based in part on preliminary damage assessments  to determine the level of program assistance that may be required. To fill  identified staffing needs, field leadership uses a standard process to  request specific FEMA Qualification System titles and proficiency levels.", "Once a standard deployment request is approved, the Deployment  Tracking System identifies staff members that match the requested  positions, skill sets, and qualification status using a preprogrammed,  automated process. The Deployment Tracking System then notifies staff  members selected in a rotational order based on length of time since their  last deployment, among other things. If an employee declines a  deployment request, the Deployment Tracking System automatically  sends a request to the next staff member with that incident management  position title on the deployment order list. Standard deployment  requests are filled by deploying employee types in the following order:  1.  Incident Management COREs  2.  Reservists  3.  Full-time equivalent employees other than Incident Management  At the incident, the Federal Coordinating Officer and other field leadership  staff are responsible for overseeing coordinating the responders working  for FEMA. Generally, after response operations and programs are  initiated, staffing needs may change. At this point, field leadership may  decide to demobilize some personnel deployed in certain cadres. The  decision to do so is based on workload, complexity of operations, and  disaster needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Faced Staffing Shortages in Key Cadres during the 2017 and 2018 Disaster Seasons", "paragraphs": ["According to FEMA\u2019s 2017 Hurricane Season After-Action Report, FEMA  did not meet its annual staffing target for disaster personnel during the  2017 hurricane season. FEMA uses force structure and force strength  targets to estimate staffing requirements for incidents and analyze the  number of staff the agency has available against these targets. FEMA  establishes a longer-term target for the number of incident management  staff needed to meet mission needs, called force structure, and tracks the  actual number of incident management staff who can deploy at a point in  time, which it calls force strength. FEMA uses its force strength  measure to track progress towards meeting staffing goals set out in the  force structure target and also sets interim targets each fiscal year for  reaching the longer-term force structure target.", "In 2015, FEMA\u2019s Workforce Management Division conducted a review of  FEMA\u2019s workforce in coordination with the 23 cadres and adopted a force  structure target of 16,305. According to FEMA, this target was  established based on a number of considerations, including potential  incident levels and historical staffing data for incident management staff  deployed to different level events. The agency\u2019s force strength at the end  of fiscal year 2017 was 11,656. On average, reservists had the largest  gap between force strength and established annual targets. For example,  at the end of fiscal year 2017, FEMA\u2019s force strength for reservists was  6,793, which was 15 percent short of its target of 7,982 for that year. In  2019, FEMA\u2019s Workforce Management Division completed a similar  review of its incident management workforce and updated its force  structure target to 17,670 incident management personnel, which it aims  to achieve by 2025.

For instance,  according to FEMA\u2019s deployment data, 18 of 23 cadres operated with 25  percent or fewer staff available to deploy when Hurricane Maria made  landfall shortly after Hurricane Irma hit Florida, including the Individual  Assistance, Logistics, and Hazard Mitigation cadres. See figure 7 for  more information on cadre staffing levels at the start of major disasters  during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons.", "In addition, many staff members who showed availability to deploy  declined when requested to do so. For example, according to FEMA  officials, the austere conditions in Puerto Rico and fatigue from previous  deployments to hurricanes Harvey and Irma contributed to the high  declination rate for Hurricane Maria deployment requests. In addition,  FEMA officials stated that permanent full-time employees may not  consistently update their availability or may be unavailable to deploy  because of their steady-state responsibilities. Further, reservists may  decline deployment requests because of the lack of employment  protections, which can create difficulties with leaving their jobs to work  intermittently in disasters. See table 1 for the declination rates for eight  major disasters during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons.", "According to FEMA officials, the agency\u2019s staffing shortages may have  originated in part from policy changes in 2012. Specifically, officials said  that a large number of incident management staff left the agency after  changes were made to the agency\u2019s reservist program and qualification  system for disaster personnel in 2012. For instance, officials told us  many reservists with years of experience and technical skills left FEMA  when the reservist program increased the number of days they were  required to deploy or when many were assigned to positions in the  qualification system with lower levels of responsibility than what they  previously held in order to meet force structure targets.", "FEMA took various actions to address the staffing shortages during the  2017 and 2018 disaster seasons and used new approaches to augment  its workforce. For example, in 2017, FEMA reported that it coordinated  the deployment of 2,740 Surge Capacity Force volunteers from eight DHS  components. DHS also expanded the Surge Capacity Force to other  federal agencies outside DHS for the first time in 2017, including 34  federal departments and agencies in the program, increasing the Surge  Capacity Force by 1,323 employees. Additionally, FEMA used local hires  to augment its workforce and expedited the local hiring process in  response to hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, resulting in the  onboarding of 4,095 local hires from August to November 2017. The  Federal Coordinating Officer who initially managed the Puerto Rico joint  field office instituted a goal of having a staff composed of 90 percent local  hires for recovery efforts. According to the official, investing heavily in  local hires and converting them to COREs will help build FEMA\u2019s disaster  workforce for long-term Puerto Rico recovery efforts and any future  disasters that may occur in the region.", "As mentioned previously, FEMA also conducted a review of its incident  management workforce in 2018 to determine the force structure needed  to effectively respond to disasters moving forward. FEMA officials we  spoke with said the agency has taken several steps to meet its new force  structure, such as establishing a program management office that is dedicated to achieving the agency\u2019s staffing targets.

Very few found that it was a good indicator of  staff abilities. For example, participants in two of 14 focus groups  described positive experiences with qualification status as an indicator of  staff abilities; while, in all 14 groups, participants stated that staff  members who were designated as qualified in the system did not have  the skills or experience to perform effectively in their positions. Officials  in 15 of our 29 field and regional office interviews had similar  experiences. For example, Individual Assistance managers in one of the  joint field offices we visited said that they had 20 staff members who were  designated as qualified but not capable of performing basic tasks, such  as knowing how to access the program\u2019s information system. Hazard  Mitigation managers from the same joint field office said that about half of  their staff who were designated as qualified could not proficiently perform  their job duties.", "Participants in our focus groups and field leadership and managers we  interviewed cited numerous operational challenges that resulted from  qualification status not being an accurate indicator of staff abilities.  Specifically, they stated that (1) staff designated as qualified who lacked  the skills and knowledge to perform their positions negatively affected  disaster assistance delivery, staff workload, and morale and (2) the  unreliability of qualification designations hindered their cadre\u2019s ability to  staff disasters with the right mix of staff at the right time and effectively  assign responsibilities. Table 3 provides examples of the challenges they  experienced.", "Participants in our focus groups also cited a range of challenges with  position task books and the qualification process that in their view  contributed to qualification status not being an accurate indicator of staff  proficiency. For example:  Position task book tasks. In 12 of our 14 focus groups with FEMA  incident management staff, participants said the tasks in the position task  books did not fully reflect the skills or competencies needed to perform  positions. For example, a participant in one focus group said that the  tasks in her book did not incorporate sufficient soft skills, such as the  ability to communicate with sensitivity and empathy and other  interpersonal skills, which are important because staff in her cadre often  interact with disaster survivors who have suffered great losses.", "Coach-and-evaluator process. Participants in 12 of our 14 focus groups  also raised concerns with how coach-and-evaluators endorsed tasks,  such as lack of consistency and objectivity with signing off on tasks.  These issues included coach-and-evaluators signing off on large numbers  of tasks too quickly or easily, which participants in 12 focus groups said  occurred. Some participants who functioned as coach-and-evaluators  said they felt pressure from staff to endorse tasks because reservists  receive salary increases when they get qualified. Participants also told us  that cadre management may push for staff to be qualified to meet  qualification rate targets. A participant in one of our supervisory-level  focus groups said he felt pressure from both these sources and admitted  to signing off on tasks even though he did not feel the staff member could  proficiently perform them. He said that the staff member was qualified in  the FEMA Qualification System and later deployed to a smaller disaster,  where she was the sole person responsible for her functional area and  unable to do the job.", "Difficulties completing position task books. Participants in all 14 of  our focus groups also raised various challenges with completing their task  books. These challenges include a lack of available coach-and-evaluators  to sign-off on tasks; lack of opportunities to deploy or perform certain  tasks; and being unable to complete all the training courses in their task  books because classes were unavailable, full, or conflicted with mission  needs; among others.

For  example:  Position titles not fully reflecting staff abilities. FEMA allows staff to  have one primary position title in which they are qualified or have an open  task book (trainee or candidate status). Officials in 14 of our 29 field and  regional interviews and participants in eight of our 14 focus groups with  incident management staff raised concerns with this policy. Specifically,  officials noted that many employees have experience and expertise in  multiple cadres or programs within a cadre, but their full abilities are not  reflected in FEMA\u2019s qualification and deployment systems. As a result,  field leadership and managers may not be able to fully identify and use  the available skills and experience of FEMA\u2019s workforce during disasters,  which can limit FEMA\u2019s capacity and flexibility to meet disaster needs,  especially when demand is high. For example, one regional official said  the Deployment Tracking System has Operations Section Chief as her  position title but does not capture her ability to deploy as an Individual  Assistance Branch Director, another position in which she has  considerable experience.", "Overly broad position titles and lack of information on specialized  skills. In addition, participants in our focus groups told us that some  cadre position titles are overly broad (five of 14 groups) and that FEMA\u2019s  qualification and deployment systems do not include information on  specialized skillsets and experience that would be useful for making  deployment and staffing decisions (10 of 14 groups). Officials in 14 of our  29 field and regional interviews raised one or more of these same issues.  For example, Logistics managers in one of the joint field offices we visited  said that the Logistics Specialist title is too general and captures the  majority of warehouse personnel without specifying the actual  responsibilities they are able to perform. They noted that, as a result,  management needs to query staff members when they arrive to help  determine their skills and, in many cases, assign responsibilities by trial  and error. According to officials, this can create a safety hazard because  some responsibilities require specific skills, such as the ability to operate  a certain type of forklift. They also noted that while the Deployment  Tracking System allows cadres to input specific skillsets, such as forklift  certification, this field has not been consistently filled in.", "Limitations with fully capturing permanent full-time employee and  CORE qualifications. In seven of our eight focus groups with permanent  full-time employees and COREs, participants stated that it is not a priority  for them to complete their task books because they have little or no  incentives to be designated as qualified in the FEMA Qualification  System. For example, some participants noted that unlike reservists, their  pay and professional development is not directly tied to their qualification  status or position. Another participant said that he has been deployed to  many disasters and does not have any tasks in his task book endorsed  because he is focused on meeting mission needs and does not care  enough about being qualified in the system to take the time to complete  his task book. Some regional and field officials also raised the same  issues. For example, Response Division managers in one of the regions  we selected for interviews said that some of the best talent at FEMA,  such as staff members with years of experience who work full-time in  positions similar to their incident management titles, have never opened  or completed a task book because there is no incentive for them to do so.  As a result, FEMA may not be fully capturing the qualifications and skills  of permanent full-time employees and COREs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Taken Actions to Help Improve Its Qualification and Deployment Processes, but These Actions Do Not Fully Address the Key Challenges Field Officials Identified", "paragraphs": ["FEMA has taken a number of actions intended to help address some of  the challenges with its qualification and deployment processes that  hindered its ability to provide accurate and complete staffing information  to field officials. FEMA headquarters officials acknowledged the  challenges we identified with the FEMA Qualification System and noted  that the system is still evolving. Key efforts to improve the reliability of  qualification designations include:  Qualifying staff members who could proficiently perform their  positions. During the 2017 hurricane season, FEMA took steps to qualify  staff members who were not designated as qualified in the FEMA  Qualification System but could proficiently perform the duties of their  position. For example, according to the agency\u2019s after-action report for  the hurricane season, FEMA temporarily changed qualification  procedures during the season to more rapidly qualify employees who had  demonstrated their skills outside the traditional process. FEMA  headquarters officials stated that this helped qualification designations  better reflect the skills and abilities of these staff members. Other actions  that FEMA has taken to help qualify staff include allowing cadre  management to waive certain tasks or training, allowing specified tasks to  be signed-off on during training exercises, and, as discussed later in this  report, conducting a pilot on deploying staff to specifically serve as coach- and-evaluators during disasters.", "Revising position task books. FEMA headquarters officials said they  began reviewing task books in spring 2017 to help ensure that tasks are  measurable and better align with the knowledge, skills, and abilities  needed to perform positions. Officials said this project was completed in  November 2018 and the revised task books have been implemented.  They noted that this will help streamline the qualification process, allow  for more objective evaluation, and help ensure tasks better reflect the  skills needed on the job. According to FEMA officials, they plan to  continue to work with the cadres to ensure task books align with the skills  and competencies required to complete disaster missions.", "Enhanced coach-and-evaluator training. FEMA revised its training for  coach-and-evaluators to provide more guidance and tools for how to  accurately evaluate staff and improve the integrity of the evaluation  process. Specifically, in October 2017, FEMA updated the coach-and- evaluator training class and added material on, for example, techniques  for evaluating with integrity, types of observation, and documenting task  performance by including comments in the task books. All staff members  must pass the class by performing a capstone exercise and taking a  written exam before being able to serve as a coach-and-evaluator.", "Additional controls in the qualification process. Since 2017, FEMA  has established additional controls to provide more oversight on the  qualification process. For example, headquarters officials said that as part  of the qualification review process, officials may review the qualification  packages to check how many tasks were endorsed during a given period  of time. If the number is unusually large, they may note it for cadre  management to consider when making qualification decisions. This step  was incorporated in the new FEMA Qualification System Guide that was  issued in August 2019. The guide also includes changes to the  Qualification Review Board process, such as requiring candidates for  leadership and upper-level management positions to attend the review in  person and answer questions about their deployments, training history,  and task book completion.", "FEMA has also taken some initial actions and considered options to  better identify and use staff skills and experience in the field. For  example, FEMA headquarters officials said they are aware that limiting  staff to one primary position or one open task book may not fully capture  their experience and abilities and are exploring ways to address it.  However, they stated that this is a complex issue and allowing staff to  hold multiple primary positions could affect the time it takes for staff to  complete task books and, on a broader level, pay scales, career  progression paths, and training budgets. They also noted that this could  create complications with how to deploy staff if multiple cadres need  positions filled during times of scarce resources. FEMA headquarters  officials told us that staff can be deployed in positions other than their  FEMA Qualification System positions but acknowledged that because  these other positions are not systematically recorded in the Deployment  Tracking System, leadership would need to be aware of staff skills and  abilities through informal means. Further, FEMA headquarters officials  said that as part of its review of the incident management workforce, they  have revised the position titles for certain cadres, which they noted could  potentially result in the titles better reflecting staff roles and  responsibilities. Officials added that they need to balance the enhanced  staffing information that more specific titles provide with the flexibility of  broader titles, particularly for entry-level positions. FEMA has also  included information on assigning specialized skills to staff in the  Deployment Tracking System in its new FEMA Qualification System and  deployment guides.", "While FEMA has taken some steps to improve its qualification and  deployment systems, its efforts primarily affect the qualification process  moving forward and do not fully address field officials\u2019 experiences with  not having reliable information on staff qualifications and skills to  effectively use the available workforce to meet mission needs. For  example, the changes to the position task books, coach-and-evaluator  program, and FEMA Qualification System guide do not affect staff  members who have already been qualified in the system but cannot  perform their duties, and as discussed later in this report, FEMA currently  does not have an effective performance evaluation system in place to  identify and address skill deficiencies. In addition, the agency has not  taken actions to address the challenges with identifying staff who can  serve multiple incident management positions and fully capturing the  qualifications of permanent full-time employees and COREs. Also,  headquarters officials stated that FEMA has revised some of its position  titles, but not all the cadres that reported challenges with overly broad  titles had adjustments made to their positions. Further, this initiative is in  the early stages of implementation and it is too soon to assess whether  the revised positions will provide better information to field officials on  staff members\u2019 specific responsibilities.", "Further, the lack of reliability of qualification status as an accurate  indicator of staff skills and abilities has been a persistent issue with the  FEMA Qualification System. For example, we stated in our 2015 report on  FEMA workforce management that in five of 11 focus groups with  permanent full-time employees and COREs, participants cited concerns  about the implementation of the FEMA Qualification System, and some  observed employees whose training and experience did not reflect the  position and qualification level to which they were assigned. Also, in a  2016 report on the reservist workforce, the DHS Office of the Inspector  General stated that in five of the seven disaster deployments included in  their review, joint field office staff encountered problems obtaining  capable reservists with position titles under the FEMA Qualification  System. These officials said that reservists sometimes lacked the  experience and training to perform their duties, and as a result, were  reassigned to positions outside their system titles.", "One of the purposes of the FEMA Qualification System is to ensure  consistency in skill identification and deployable assets for positions  across the agency. In addition, FEMA\u2019s 2018-2022 Strategic Plan states  that the agency should guarantee that the FEMA Qualification System  maximizes the ability of FEMA staff to use their skills and talents to  deliver the best outcomes possible. However, as discussed above, FEMA  experienced challenges with achieving these objectives. In addition,  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government directs  management to use quality information to achieve the agency\u2019s objectives. It states that, as part of designing control activities for human  capital management, management should continually assess the  knowledge, skills, and ability needs of the agency to help achieve  organizational goals. According to the standards, only when the right  personnel for the job are on board and are provided the right  responsibilities, among other things, is operational success possible. In  addition, according to The Standard for Program Management, program  monitoring, reporting, and controls include the development of plans to  respond to identified issues. It also states that program management  should include timeframes and milestones for achieving program benefits  and obtaining feedback from stakeholders to better understand the  concerns related to the program and impact of the program.", "Given the complexity of FEMA\u2019s workforce and the persistent issues with  the reliability of qualification designations and other challenges with  identifying the knowledge, skills, and abilities of its staff, FEMA would  benefit from developing a comprehensive plan\u2014with timeframes and  milestones\u2014to address issues with the quality of information its  qualification and deployment processes and systems provide to field  officials. Such a plan would also benefit from the inclusion of perspectives  from field leadership who depend on the information. FEMA officials  acknowledged the staffing information challenges we identified and noted  that they have not developed a plan to address them because the issues  are multifaceted\u2014changes in policy can potentially affect numerous areas  of the workforce\u2014and they had been focused on other initiatives, such as  revising force structure targets and streamlining the qualification process.  However, they said that such a plan would be useful.

FEMA has measures and collects data related to staffing  levels and availability, such as comparing cadre force strength to annual  targets, comparing staff qualification rates to targets, determining the  percent of staff in each cadre that show availability in the Deployment  Tracking System, and tracking the number of staff deployed to disasters.  However, none of these measures or data directly demonstrate  deployment outcomes or how effectively FEMA deployed available staff to  meet mission needs.", "Headquarters officials said that, among other things, they generally have  looked at the number of staff members that were deployed to disasters,  as well as declinations, to assess the extent to which they were able to  meet staffing needs.

However, our focus  groups and interviews with field officials indicate that this was not  generally the case. For example, in all 17 of our focus groups,  participants experienced challenges with the staffing, skill, or experience  levels of the deployed workforce, such as having too few staff members  with the right technical skills to perform their missions efficiently and  effectively. Further, in 12 of the 17 focus groups we conducted,  participants said that there were challenges with the timing of  deployments, such as staff from certain cadres being deployed too early  or redeploying staff from key positions when the mission need was still  high. In most of our interviews with field leadership and managers,  officials described similar challenges with the number, skill level, or timing  of staff deployments.

In addition, these officials noted that they have not  established other mechanisms to assess deployment outcomes because  this is extremely complex and they are considering how best to do so.  They noted that they have been working with in-house data science  experts to consider what kinds of measures and metrics they could  design to assess deployment outcomes, but they did not have any  concrete proposals or time frames for when this might be completed.  Without mechanisms to assess deployment outcomes, FEMA officials in  headquarters lack critical information to monitor and evaluate the extent  to which its deployment policies and strategies effectively placed staff  with the right skills in the right place at the right time to meet mission  needs in the field.

Officials in 11 of the 29 field and regional interviews we  conducted raised the same issue. FEMA headquarters officials stated that  staff are generally required to obtain cadre management approval before  they can register for incident management-related courses that are not  specifically listed in their position task books, but staff told us it can be  difficult to receive approval because of funding limitations. For example, a  Hazard Mitigation official at one joint field office we visited described a  situation where a staff member wanted to take a course on mitigation and  engineering techniques for coastal construction that would have  benefitted the work the person was doing, but was not able to get  approval.

These participants told us it is  challenging for them to take disaster-related courses while performing  their steady-state work.

However, staff members we spoke with  said they have difficulties developing their skills through the qualification  process. Specifically, in seven of the 17 focus groups, participants told us  they did not get feedback or coaching on the job. According to staff in our  focus groups, the coach-and-evaluator aspect of the qualification system  is not the ideal mechanism to support on-the-job training and  development because it often emphasizes the evaluation role over the  coaching role. In nine of 14 focus groups, participants told us the position  task book process focuses more on completing tasks than on  performance, development, or building competencies. Officials in eight  of our 29 field and regional interviews reported similar experiences.

Officials in 16 of our 29 field and regional interviews raised the same  issue. Participants in our focus groups said they had difficulties finding  available coach-and-evaluators at disaster sites. For example, our  analysis of FEMA data found that 36 percent of FEMA\u2019s incident  management workforce did not have a coach-and-evaluator at the start of  their deployment during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons. In addition,  according to staff in our focus groups and interviews, coach-and- evaluators at the disaster often do not have time to coach staff. For  example, officials at one of the joint field offices we visited said mission  needs always come first and coaching and evaluating responsibilities are  often not anyone\u2019s priority.", "In addition to on-the-job training challenges related to the FEMA  Qualification System, focus group participants also reported more general  challenges with on-the-job training. For instance, multiple supervisors in  the Logistics cadre at one joint field office said that in addition to doing  their own work, experienced staff members need to spend significant time  training others, which competes with performing their mission.  Furthermore, participants in seven of the 17 focus groups said providing  on-the-job training was particularly challenging at the beginning of a  disaster, when the disaster is often hectic and at its busiest. Recovery  Division officials in a FEMA regional office said a challenge at the start of  the disaster is finding staff members who know what to do and have the  time to train those who do not. Staff members also described difficulties  with providing and receiving on-the-job training in later phases of a  disaster. In one focus group with supervisors, a participant said that once  the disaster has reached a pace where they have time to train, staff  members are often redeployed.", "Finally, in 16 of our 29 field and regional interviews, officials said there  was a lack of mentoring and sustained staff development across  disasters. For example, officials at one joint field office told us that once  staff members complete their position task book, they generally do not  receive any additional coaching or mentoring in that position. This official  stated that reservists have a more difficult time identifying mentors than  other employee types because they deploy intermittently and likely have  different supervisors and coach-and-evaluators each time they deploy. In  addition, FEMA officials said coach-and-evaluators are not meant to  serve as mentors. FEMA human capital officials said that different offices  can develop their own mentoring programs but these may not be  available to all employee types. As a result, not all staff members know to  ask for, or expect to receive, mentoring.", "FEMA headquarters officials acknowledged some of these staff  development challenges and described actions they have planned, or are  underway, to help address some of them. Specifically, FEMA revised the  coach-and-evaluator course in 2017 to place a greater emphasis on the  coaching responsibilities of the coach-and-evaluator role. For example,  the revised course teaches effective coaching strategies, including how to  give effective, actionable feedback. Also, in summer 2019, FEMA  conducted a pilot with the National Disaster Recovery Support cadre to  deploy a single coach-and-evaluator solely in that position and  communicated to cadre management that this individual was not to be  used for other disaster-related responsibilities. FEMA officials said this  pilot was a success. In evaluating the pilot, FEMA said the coach-and- evaluator was able to devote time to proper training and answering any  questions presented. Finally, the agency revised the FEMA Qualification  System Guide in August 2019, which included clarifying differences  between coaching and evaluating. The revised guide states that, as part  of the position task book process, a coach explains, demonstrates, trains,  assesses, and documents an individual\u2019s task performance while an  evaluator observes, assesses, documents, and endorses an employee\u2019s  independent performance of specific tasks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Officials Reported Inconsistent Use of Performance Evaluations at Disasters", "paragraphs": ["Headquarters officials told us that during the 2017 and 2018 disaster  seasons, disaster workforce employees inconsistently received  performance evaluations when deployed.

Our analysis of FEMA data shows that from June 1, 2017 to May  31, 2019, the agency hired over 3,200 reservists, which was 40 percent of  the agency\u2019s entire reservist workforce as of June 1, 2019. Creating a  staff development program that systematically and comprehensively  addresses staff development through courses, on-the-job training and  mentoring, performance evaluation, and ongoing developmental  opportunities would provide better assurance that staff develop the skills  and competencies needed to meet mission needs during field operations  and help ensure the best results for disaster survivors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The large-scale and concurrent disasters during the 2017 and 2018  disaster seasons highlighted the complex challenges facing FEMA\u2019s  workforce. The agency deployed 14,684 and 10,328 personnel,  respectively, at the peak of each of these disaster seasons, and the  increased demand for its workforce is expected to continue. Without  accurate and complete information on the knowledge, skills, and abilities  of these staff members, field officials face challenges with efficiently  providing disaster assistance, managing staff workload, and assigning  responsibilities. FEMA has taken some initial actions to improve the  information provided by its qualification and deployment systems, such as  establishing additional controls in its qualification process. However,  developing a plan to address the information challenges experienced  during the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons would be beneficial to  enhance field leadership\u2019s ability to identify and leverage staff skills and,  given the persistence of some of these challenges, help ensure they do  not continue to affect FEMA\u2019s ability to support mission needs in future  disasters. Further, in light of the staffing constraints that FEMA faces, it is  important that the agency be able to assess how effectively it deploys  available staff to disasters to meet field needs. Developing a mechanism  to assess FEMA\u2019s deployment outcomes would provide officials in  headquarters with critical information to monitor and evaluate the extent  to which its deployment policies and strategies effectively place staff with  the right skills in the right place at the right time to meet mission needs  and take corrective actions if needed. Finally, creating a staff  development program for its disaster workforce that addresses access to  training, delivery of on-the-job training and mentoring, use of performance  evaluations, and developmental opportunities when not deployed would  help FEMA ensure more consistent and comprehensive development of  the skills and abilities needed during deployments. Consistent and  effective staff development is particularly important to help build the skills  of staff who are qualified in the FEMA Qualification System but unable to  proficiently perform their duties and develop the large number of staff that  FEMA has recently hired to meet its new disaster workforce targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to FEMA:  The FEMA Administrator should develop a plan\u2014with time frames and  milestones and input from field leadership\u2014to address identified  challenges that have hindered FEMA\u2019s ability to provide reliable and  complete information to field leaders and managers about staff  knowledge, skills, and abilities.

DHS also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "With regard to our first recommendation for FEMA to develop a plan to  address identified challenges with providing reliable and complete staffing  information to the field, DHS reiterated some of the steps described in this  report that FEMA has taken to improve the coach-and-evaluator program.  DHS noted that FEMA plans to engage field leaders on these initiatives to  develop a plan to address identified challenges. DHS also reported that  FEMA plans to increase training offerings and align its curriculum so that  FEMA Qualification System status matches workforce capability. DHS  anticipates these efforts will be completed by March 31, 2021. While  these are positive initial steps, they focus solely on the coach-and- evaluator program and staff training. Our report identified a number of  complex and interrelated challenges with the agency\u2019s qualification and  deployment processes that hindered FEMA\u2019s ability to provide reliable  information to field officials about staff members\u2019 skills and abilities,  including their qualifications, specialized skillsets, and experience within  and across program areas. As such, in developing the plan we  recommended, it will be important for FEMA to take a comprehensive  approach and consider solutions that may cut across multiple systems  and processes.

Our report identified recurrent challenges with FEMA\u2019s efforts to develop  staff through training courses, on-the-job training and mentoring, and  performance evaluations and noted that the agency\u2019s current and planned  efforts do not fully address these challenges. In creating the staff  development program we recommended, it is important for FEMA to  consider how its overall control environment and the initiatives it puts in  place are coordinated to ensure staff receive comprehensive and  consistent development to build the skills needed during disaster field  operations.

We also selected these locations to reflect where the  2017 disasters occurred and to obtain variation in geographic location to  the extent possible. Participants were selected using a stratified random  sample from a universe of incident management staff members who were  deployed to a federally declared disaster during the 2017 hurricane and  wildfire season. For each employee type, we conducted separate focus  groups with participants in supervisory and nonsupervisory positions so  they could speak more freely.

If selected staff members  indicated they could not attend, we replaced them with the next individual  on our randomized list who had similar attributes. There were between  three to 11 participants in each focus group, with an average of eight in  each. These focus group discussions were guided by a moderator who  used a structured list of discussion topics. The topics focused on staff  members\u2019 perspectives on, and experiences with, the level of staffing and  skill sets their team had, how they were trained and developed, and the  FEMA Qualification System and its qualification determinations.
