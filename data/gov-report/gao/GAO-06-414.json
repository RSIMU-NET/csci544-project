States' increased flexibility under TANF as well as the budgetary stresses they experienced after a recession draw attention to the fiscal partnership between the federal government and states. To update GAO's previous work, this report examines (1) changes in the overall level of welfare-related spending; (2) changes in spending priorities for welfare-related nonhealth services; and (3) the contribution of TANF funds to states' spending for welfare-related services.

Health spending, excluding spending for the elderly, outpaced nonhealth spending over the decade and now consumes an even greater share of total spending for low-income people, mirroring a nationwide expansion in health care costs. Spending increases were substantially supported by both federal and state funds in the health and nonhealth areas in each time period, reflecting the important federal-state partnership supporting these low-income programs. Overall, spending increases reflected changes in eligible populations and needs, increasing costs, as well as policy changes. While nonhealth spending increased in real terms, spending priorities shifted away from cash assistance to other forms of aid, particularly work supports, in keeping with welfare reform goals. The largest increases for noncash services occurred from 1995 to 2000, with smaller increases from 2000 to 2004, when some state officials cited challenges in maintaining services. By 2004, states used federal and state TANF funds to support a broad range of services, in contrast to 1995 when spending priorities focused more on cash assistance. However, reporting and oversight mechanisms have not kept pace with the evolving role of TANF funds in state budgets, leaving information gaps at the national level related to numbers served and how states use funds to meet welfare reform goals, hampering oversight. Any efforts to address these gaps should strike an appropriate balance between flexibility for state grantees and accountability for federal funds and goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, the federal government made sweeping changes to national  welfare policy, significantly altering the federal-state partnership in  assisting low-income families as well as setting new goals for states to help  parents become independent of government assistance.  A decade has  passed since then, during which strong economic growth faded into a short  recession and many states faced a period of significant budgetary stress.   This warrants attention to how the 1996 changes have evolved over time.   These changes, enacted through the Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families (TANF) block grant, gave states authority to make key decisions  about how to allocate federal and state funds to assist low-income families.   Since states implemented welfare reforms, they have spent almost   $200 billion in federal and state TANF funds on their programs.  TANF  spending is but a portion of the billions of federal and state dollars that  flow through state budgets for a variety of programs for low-income  working-age adults and children.   These welfare-related programs and  services include ongoing cash assistance, employment services and  training, work and other supports, aid for the at-risk, and health services.", "To provide information on how this welfare-related spending has evolved  over the decade since reform and particularly after the national recession  in 2001, this report responds to your request that we examine (1) changes  in the overall level of welfare-related spending for nonhealth and health  services in the periods before and after the recession and over the decade;  (2) changes in spending priorities for nonhealth services over these same  periods; and (3) the contribution of TANF funds to states\u2019 spending for  welfare-related services.", "To address these questions, we collected state spending data and  conducted site visits in nine states examined in our earlier reports that  represent a diverse set of characteristics, including geographic region,  population size, and experiences with welfare initiatives.  These states are  California, Colorado, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Oregon,  Texas, and Wisconsin.  Together, these states represented about 50 percent  of all federal TANF spending nationwide in 2004.  In each of these states,  we collected budget data and program information for three points in time  based on state fiscal years:  for 1995 before the passage of federal welfare  reform legislation; for 2000; and for 2004, the most recent year for which  data were available.  We focused on spending for working-age adults and  children and excluded spending for the elderly, long-term care, and  institutional care.  We classified spending into five key areas: cash  assistance, employment services and training, work and other supports, aid  for the at-risk, and health care.

PRWORA coupled the block grant with an  MOE provision, which requires states to maintain a significant portion of  their own historic financial commitment to their welfare programs as a  condition of receiving their full TANF allotments.  This helped to ensure  that states remained strong fiscal partners.  PRWORA provided states  greater flexibility and responsibility for administering and implementing  their welfare programs.  Importantly, with the fixed federal funding stream,  states must assume the fiscal risks in the event of a recession or increased  program costs.", "In addition to increased flexibility and the new fiscal structure, PRWORA  charged HHS with oversight of states\u2019 TANF programs and gave HHS new  responsibilities for tracking state performance.  PRWORA also set federal  requirements that states must impose on many families receiving cash or  other ongoing assistance, including time limits and work requirements for  adults.  At the same time, the law restricts HHS\u2019s authority to regulate  states\u2019 programs and reduced the number of federal employees involved in  the program.", "TANF and MOE spending is one component of federal, state, and local  spending on a range of programs aimed at serving low-income and needy  populations, which in this report we will refer to as welfare-related  spending.  In state fiscal year (SFY) 2004, among the nine states in our  study, TANF and MOE spending represented from 12 to 28 percent of all  federal, state, and local spending flowing through the state budgets for  welfare-related services outside of the health spending captured in our  survey.  (See app. II.)  Outside of TANF and MOE, welfare-related spending  provides a wide range of services and comes from a variety of federal,  state, and local sources.  Transportation subsidies, rental assistance, child  care subsidies, heating and energy assistance, and low-income tax  preferences, among others, can all serve low-income and needy  populations and are funded through multiple federal agencies, such as the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, HHS, and the Department  of Transportation, as well as by state and local governments.", "In 2001, we examined welfare-related spending in 10 selected states before  and after the passage of welfare reform, from SFY 1995 to SFY 2000.  We  reported that after welfare reform, since both the amount of flexible  federal TANF funds and required MOE remain fixed regardless of the  number of people served with these funds, and since cash assistance  caseloads declined dramatically since the mid-1990s, states had additional  budgetary resources available for use toward a variety of welfare-related  purposes and spending. From SFY 1995 to SFY 2000, while total spending  levels for all welfare-related services generally increased, states began  using these additional budgetary resources to enhance spending for  noncash services, such as training, education, and a range of other welfare- related spending\u2014an allowable practice under TANF.

From 1995 to 2000, state  government tax collections grew in inflation-adjusted terms, and  unemployment and poverty rates were generally falling, although there was  some variation among the nine states we studied.  Overall, these  circumstances suggest that states were generally faced with declining  spending demands from low-income populations and increasing fiscal  resources to meet those demands.  In 2001, however, the nation  experienced a recession from March through November, and a contrasting  set of economic and fiscal circumstances developed.  A period of rising  unemployment and declining state tax collections ensued.  In seven of the  nine states, poverty rates that fell from 1995 to 2000 increased from 2000 to  2004, as shown in figure 2.

Medicaid is a complex program that serves many  different low-income populations.  Nationwide, children and their families  constitute 75 percent of those served but only account for 30 percent of  expenditures, while those with disabilities represent 16 percent of  beneficiaries and 45 percent of expenditures.  Between 1995 and 1997, the  number of able-bodied adults and children on Medicaid fell, which may be  due in part to changes in the relationship between TANF and Medicaid  triggered by the 1996 welfare legislation.  At the same time, states were  starting to enroll low-income children in SCHIP, a new federal-state  partnership created by Congress in 1997.  It extends health insurance to  low-income children whose families earn too much to be eligible for  Medicaid but are unable to obtain insurance another way, either through an  employer or outright purchase of private insurance.  Nationwide,  enrollments in Medicaid and SCHIP generally increased from 2000 to 2004.   Even so, not all low-income individuals are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP,  and some of those who are eligible are not enrolled for a variety of reasons,  including lack of information about the program or choosing not to enroll.", "Because health spending grew faster than nonhealth spending since 1995, it  now consumes a greater share of welfare-related spending in the state  budgets we examined, as shown in table 2.

(For more details on federal and state spending, see app. III.)  The state  contribution is noteworthy particularly during the second time period  when states experienced declining revenues.  States generally are required  to balance their operating budgets, and may need to raise revenues or  reduce spending to do so.

As shown in table 4, in  2004, the median federal share of health spending totaled 58 percent, which  would correspond to a state share of 42 percent.  The higher federal shares  in some states, such as Louisiana, may be explained in part by the greater  role the federal government plays in funding Medicaid costs in states with  lower per capita incomes.  At the same time, because the health spending  data include services other than Medicaid, the federal share will not  correspond directly to the share under Medicaid.", "In the nonhealth spending area, we also found spending increases generally  supported by both federal and state funds, although the federal share  showed more variation over the two time periods for nonhealth than for  health spending.  As shown in table 5, the median federal share fell in 2000  (from 50 percent to 44 percent), possibly as states responded to higher  state revenues during the late 1990s.

In contrast to the health area where much of federal and state  financial participation is guided by federal Medicaid statute and  regulations, nonhealth spending\u2014comprising numerous federal and state  programs\u2014is guided by an array of different laws and rules about federal  and state financial participation.  Specifically, supports for low-income  people vary in terms of whether they are funded with federal funds, state- local funds, or a combination.

These include  changes in welfare programs; the strong economy of the late 1990s; and  other policy changes, such as expansions of the federal EIC and increased  federal spending for child care subsidies. One state attributed the more  recent caseload increases to the economy.  Many state officials also noted  changes in the characteristics of those who remained on the welfare rolls.

Louisiana increased spending for two  areas in this category, including child care and development, as discussed  below.  However, these increases were more than offset by other spending  areas that decreased, including administrative costs for food stamps,  associated with declining food stamp caseloads in the state.  After 2000,  spending for work and other supports increased as Louisiana invested  TANF funds in additional programs, particularly prekindergarten.  In  contrast, Colorado increased spending on refundable tax credits for  working families during the robust economic growth of the 1995-2000  period, but decreased spending slightly from 2000 to 2004.", "The child care and development area was the main driver of spending  changes in this category in many of these states, with high rates of growth  as shown in table 10.  In five states, more than half of all growth in the  category was due to increased spending for child care and development.   Several states reported that child care continued to be in demand, even as  TANF caseloads fell, because many working parents relied on subsidized  child care to help them keep their jobs.  While most spending in this area is  focused on child care subsidy programs, some states also increased  spending for prekindergarten and other child development programs.  As  part of the 1996 welfare reform, the federal government increased funding  to states through the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) to  subsidize child care assistance for low-income families who were working  or preparing for work through education and training, with a special  emphasis on families working their way off welfare.  In addition to CCDF,  funds allocated by the nine states for child care or development included  TANF, MOE, and other funds.

Four states  (Colorado, Maryland, New York, and Wisconsin) began or expanded state  EIC programs to complement the federal EIC program, which offers work  incentives in the form of a tax credit based on income.

First, many states increased their efforts to engage more  welfare families in work or work-related activities in keeping with key  TANF program requirements.  More specifically, to avoid financial  penalties, states were to meet specified work participation rates by  engaging parents receiving cash assistance in work-related activities.   States generally met these rates, in part because of adjustments made in  the target rates due to the drop in caseloads and other provisions that  allowed states to serve some families without work requirements.  In  strengthening their welfare-to-work programs, states emphasized the  importance of work to TANF recipients and paid more attention to case  management services, child care and transportation assistance, and other  services to help individuals, including those who faced some barriers to  employment, become job ready.", "Second, many states took steps to help parents who had left the welfare  rolls for employment, often by continuing to provide child care assistance,  sometimes using TANF funds to supplement other federal funds used for  child care subsidies for low-income parents.  Our work has shown that  many former welfare recipients work in low-wage jobs with limited  benefits and that continued assistance, such as child care subsidies, can  help them maintain their jobs.", "Third, states also used TANF and MOE funds to provide a range of services  to families that had not previously received cash welfare payments.  These  services can include onetime payments to families in need, such as for rent  payments that might help keep them off the welfare rolls.  Some states  increased efforts to promote healthy marriages and two-parent families.   All of these uses of TANF and MOE funds are generally considered in  keeping with the broad goals established in the legislation.  As specified by  law, the purpose of TANF is to  provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in  their own homes or in the homes of relatives;  end the dependence of needy families on government benefits by  promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;   prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and  encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spending Priorities Shift as Policies and Programs Change", "paragraphs": ["This shift to aid and services other than cash assistance is mirrored in our  analysis of states\u2019 spending patterns for TANF and MOE funds.  Figure 6  shows the percentage of TANF and MOE funds (combined) that each state  spent in each spending category in 1995, 2000, and 2004.  (This figure only  includes TANF and MOE spending, in contrast to figure 4, which showed  the percentage of total federal and state low-income spending that each  state spent in each category.)  For example, figure 6 shows that California  spent more than 90 percent of its federal and state AFDC-related funds on  cash assistance in 1995 compared with 68 percent of its federal and state  TANF-related funds in 2004.  As the share of funds devoted to cash  assistance declined in that state, the portion devoted to employment  services and training, in particular, increased.  In seven of the nine states,  by 2004, cash assistance spending accounted for 40 percent or less of total  TANF and MOE.  States varied in how their TANF and MOE funds were  distributed among the noncash categories.", "This shift to noncash assistance was curtailed somewhat from 2000 to 2004,  when cash assistance caseloads and related spending increased in several  of the states, associated with a contraction of spending for other forms of  aid and services, as shown in figure 6.  During this period, state officials  generally had to make different choices about what services and programs  they could support with TANF and MOE funds to ensure they had enough  funds to support the core cash assistance program.  Some state officials  told us that they drew down their TANF balances or reserves to help them  maintain service levels.  Regarding these TANF balances, most of the nine  states followed a pattern of initially building up their TANF balances and  then drawing them down in the 2000-2004 time period to help them  maintain services, as shown in figure 7.", "Over the decade, we found that the states used their federal and state  TANF-related funds throughout their budgets for low-income individuals,  supporting a wide range of state priorities, such as refundable state EICs  for the working poor, prekindergarten, child welfare services, mental  health, and substance abuse services, among others.  While some of this  spending, such as that for child care assistance, relates directly to helping  cash assistance recipients leave and stay off the welfare rolls, other  spending is directed to a broader population and set of state needs.  The  flexibility afforded states under TANF allows them to use these funds  toward their state priorities.  Some examples include the following:    Oregon\u2014home to a large refugee resettlement population\u2014spent TANF  funds on cash benefits and other refugee services.  Oregon also spent  TANF and MOE funds on emergency assistance for survivors of  domestic abuse.", "New York and Wisconsin use federal TANF or state MOE funds for  refundable tax credits.  New York has increased the extent to which it  counts state spending for the refundable portion of its EIC and  dependent care tax credit to help it meet its MOE requirement.   Wisconsin has used federal TANF funds to finance the refundable  portion of its state EIC that previously had been financed with state  funds, as we reported in our earlier report on these states\u2019 use of funds.", "Michigan uses TANF funds for emergency homeless shelters and  programs for runaways.  TANF funds are also used for individual  development accounts, which provide funds to eligible families to match  their own funds to encourage them to save for educational purposes.", "According to state officials, Texas used MOE funds for prekindergarten  for low-income children with low English proficiency.  Texas also used  TANF funds for an employment retention and advancement program for  working people.", "California counts state funds used for the California Food Assistance  Program toward its MOE requirement and uses TANF funds for juvenile  probation services and fraud prevention incentive grants to counties.", "Maryland spent TANF funds through the state Department of Education  for the Children At Risk program.  According to the Governor\u2019s Budget,  this program provides services for pregnant and parenting teenagers  and provides funds to reduce the number of students who drop out of  school each year, prevent youth suicides, reduce the incidence of child  alcohol and drug abuse, and reduce AIDS among students.", "According to state officials, Louisiana, after initially building up a large  TANF balance, took steps from 2002 to 2004 to spend down these funds,  in some cases through short-term initiatives to be supported only until  funding ran out.  Some of these spending initiatives included  prekindergarten, which state officials noted is a priority of the governor;  funds to address teen pregnancy; and support for child welfare  advocates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Much Remains Unknown about How States Use TANF Funds to Address Federal Welfare Reform Goals", "paragraphs": ["While current mechanisms in place at the federal level to hold states  accountable for their use of federal TANF and state MOE funds provide  useful information, these reporting mechanisms still leave significant gaps  that hamper oversight.  The new federal welfare program goals and fiscal  structure established in 1996 entailed substantial changes in federal  oversight and reporting mechanisms.  At the federal level, HHS is  responsible for oversight of the TANF block grant, and states provide  several types of information for oversight purposes.  Key oversight and  reporting mechanisms are  expenditure reports on the amount and type of federal and state MOE   plans that each state must file with HHS to outline its TANF programs  and goals, among other things, for reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies;   annual reports that each state must file with HHS to supplement its state   aggregate caseload and individual reporting on demographic and  economic circumstances and work activities of individuals receiving  TANF cash assistance;  single audit reports conducted as part of governmentwide audits of  federal aid to nonfederal entities;  performance bonuses related to measures of job entry, job retention,  and wage growth for TANF recipients and also for reducing out-of- wedlock births; and    financial penalties in 14 specified areas, including failure to meet the  state MOE requirement and the minimum work participation rates.", "In addition, HHS funding supports a range of research activities that  provide additional information on TANF recipients and other low-income  populations.", "These reporting mechanisms and information sources generally provide  useful information on states\u2019 use of TANF and MOE funds, although key  information gaps remain.  One such gap exists because the key measure of  the number of people served through the block grant remains focused on  families receiving TANF assistance, defined in TANF regulations as  benefits designed to meet a family\u2019s ongoing basic needs, which most  typically occurs through receipt of monthly cash assistance.  This  measure does not provide a complete picture of the number of people  receiving other forms of aid or services funded with TANF and MOE funds.   In 2002, we estimated that in the 25 states we studied, at least 46 percent  more families than are counted in the TANF caseload are provided aid or  services with TANF and MOE dollars.  In addition, we reported in June  2005 that the lack of information on the numbers of children and families  receiving child care subsidies funded by TANF and the types of care  received leads to an incomplete picture of the federal role in providing  child care subsidies to low-income parents.  We already said in that report  that Congress may wish to require HHS to find cost-effective ways to  address this specific gap to provide additional information of value to  policymakers and program managers in ensuring the efficiency,  effectiveness, and accountability of federal supports for child care.", "Additional information on the full range of people served by TANF and  MOE funds is essential for a better understanding of the true workload of  the grant.  Caseload or workload information is important for oversight and  policy-making purposes, particularly those related to the amount of and  needs associated with the block grant.  For example, as the cash assistance  caseload declined by more than half nationwide, it raised questions as to  whether adjustments were needed to the block grant funding levels.  At the  same time, because the amount of the block grant has not been adjusted for  inflation since its creation in 1996, concerns have been raised about its  declining value and the possible impact on meeting needs.  Better  information could inform these discussions.", "While having more information on the numbers served is important, it is  also critical to make a distinction between those receiving cash assistance  and other types of assistance, because different program requirements  apply to families in different situations.  More specifically, under TANF,  families receiving ongoing cash assistance are generally subject to work  requirements, time limits, and other requirements, in part to emphasize the  transitional nature of assistance and to help ensure that recipients take  steps to prepare for work.  Those receiving other forms of aid outside of a  state\u2019s TANF program through a separate state program, such as working  parents receiving child care subsidies, are not subject to requirements such  as time limits on aid.", "Another information gap relates to what services are funded and how those  services fit into a strategy or approach for meeting TANF goals.  This would  include information about intended target populations and the strategy or  approach for using the funds to further welfare reform goals.  For example,  additional information on the extent to which TANF and MOE funds were  used to support work requirements for cash assistance recipients is  important to understanding the costs of supporting a state\u2019s core TANF  program. It is also important to have additional information to better  understand the costs involved in providing aid to those transitioning off of  welfare and to a more general population, such as for prekindergarten  services or to supplement a state\u2019s refundable EIC program.  Such  information would be useful to congressional policymakers in considering  changes to TANF work requirements and implications for the provisions of  other services, a key issue in TANF reauthorization deliberations.", "In creating the TANF block grant, Congress emphasized the importance of  state flexibility, and to that end, the legislation restricted HHS regulatory  authority over the states except to the extent expressly provided in the law.   Regarding collecting additional information about services beyond cash  assistance, while HHS has acknowledged the value of having additional  information, it has said that it will not collect this information without  legislative changes directing it to do so.", "In any effort to get more information or to increase or revise program and  fiscal reporting requirements, important considerations should be taken  into account.  In our report on the current undercounting of those served  by TANF, some state officials raised concerns about the possibility of  additional TANF reporting requirements being imposed on states to collect  information on families not included in the TANF caseload. These concerns  included that (1) states lack the information systems needed to fulfill  additional requirements, (2) fulfilling additional requirements will increase  administrative costs, (3) additional data collection requirements could  deter states and service providers from offering services because they  would not want the administrative burden associated with them, and   (4) requiring all service recipients to provide personal identifying  information for every service may deter some people from accessing  services because of the stigma associated with welfare.  While many of  these concerns are legitimate, they do not necessarily outweigh the  importance of getting needed information for oversight and policy making  and can be considered in addressing any changes.  In addition, there may  be a variety of ways to get needed information, some more cost-effective  than others, including relying on existing data sources or special studies.   Moreover, opportunities may exist to streamline or eliminate some  reporting requirements to make way for more relevant ones, as determined  by Congress, HHS, and the states.  In the past, Congress has included in  legislation a requirement that HHS cooperate with states\u2014key  stakeholders in welfare reform\u2014in considering aspects of monitoring state  programs and performance.  HHS has worked with state and human  services professional organizations to discuss and receive input on  information requirements and performance standards in the past.", "National-level data show that the trend away from cash assistance  spending has occurred nationwide.  States are using substantial portions of  their block grants and MOE funds as large, flexible funding streams to meet  their priorities in many areas of their budgets for low-income families, yet  much remains unknown at the national level about how these federal TANF  and state MOE funds are used to meet the overall goals of welfare reform."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Ten years after Congress passed sweeping welfare reforms, much has  changed in how federal and state dollars support programs for low-income  and at-risk individuals.  Some trends raise issues for the future.  Overall,  spending is up, but state budgets for low-income individuals are  increasingly dominated by health care spending.  To the extent that this  trend continues or becomes more pronounced, it warrants attention as to  its effect on state spending to meet other needs of low-income individuals.   Another key trend was the shift in nonhealth spending priorities away from  cash assistance to greater emphasis on supporting low-income individuals\u2019  work efforts.  However, the greatest increases came right after welfare  reform during the strong economy, while some contraction in spending was  apparent in the latter period.  This raises questions about the sustainability  of this shift.", "In addition, in the new welfare environment, too much remains unknown  about how TANF block grant funds are spent to meet welfare goals.  A  natural tension exists with block grants that is not easily addressed.  A key  challenge is to strike an appropriate balance between flexibility for states  and accountability for federal goals.  This is particularly important given  the large dollar amount of the TANF block grant\u2014over $16 billion in  federal funds annually.  With the current accountability and reporting  structure for TANF, the information gaps hamper decision makers in  making informed choices about how best to spend federal funds to assist  vulnerable populations cost effectively.

To address  these objectives, we used a survey instrument to collect state spending  data from state budget and program officials in nine states examined in our  prior reports; conducted site visits in these nine states; and reviewed  information available from prior GAO work, relevant federal agencies, and  other organizations.  The nine states in our study\u2014California, Colorado,  Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Oregon, Texas, and  Wisconsin\u2014represent a diverse set of socioeconomic characteristics,  geographic regions, population sizes, and experiences with state welfare  initiatives.  For the purposes of this report, we focused on spending for  working-age adults and children and excluded spending for the elderly,  long-term care, and institutional care.  The term welfare-related refers to  spending for low-income and at-risk individuals, including TANF-eligible  and non-TANF eligible individuals.  Because our focus was on states\u2019  budgetary decisions, we excluded federal program spending about which  states do not make key budget decisions, such as food stamp benefits, the  Earned Income Tax Credit, Supplemental Security Income, and other  programs; as a result, our data do not capture all federal spending for low- income individuals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Welfare-Related Spending Survey", "paragraphs": ["To obtain data on welfare-related spending over the decade since welfare  reform, we asked state budget and program officials from each state\u2019s  central budget office and relevant state agencies to identify welfare-related  spending data using the same survey instrument and criteria used in our  prior report.  (See app. V.)  We worked closely with state officials to  complete the survey during our site visits and through numerous telephone  and e-mail contacts.  Because parts of the survey were completed by  different state officials, we also provided the states with the data we  compiled for their review as well as data summaries of our analysis.  We  collected budget data and program information for three points in time  based on state fiscal years:  for 1995 before the passage of federal welfare  reform legislation; for 2000; and for 2004, the most recent year for which  data were available.  Consistent with our prior methodology, we used the  survey to take a comprehensive look at state social service program  budgets by encouraging states to provide spending data on a broad array of  programs, rather than just those programs that received federal TANF  funding.  Our study includes federal, state, and local spending associated  with Medicaid, TANF, housing assistance, child care and welfare, and a  myriad of other programs aimed at needy populations and for which states  make key budgetary decisions.", "State budget structures differ across states.  Some states in our analysis  used biennial budgets, others used annual budgets.  States can place  employment and training programs primarily in their social services  departments; other states can place these programs in their economic  development departments.  Some states place responsibility for welfare  programs with county governments.  These differences make comparisons  of state budgets and spending difficult.  In asking states to report spending  on individual programs, regardless of which state agency oversaw these  programs, and then aggregating the spending into the same categories for  each state, we were able to compare state spending trends across all of the  states.  As figure 8 shows, we classified spending data in several key ways,  including nonhealth spending\u2014cash assistance (Category 1), employment  services and training (Category 2), work and other supports (Category 3),  and aid for the at-risk (Category 4)\u2014and health spending (Category 5),  which we generally separated from nonhealth spending in our analysis.", "Our first spending category includes state spending for ongoing cash  assistance payments with federal or state moneys under the Aid for  Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), TANF, or other state programs.   This category corresponds most closely with traditional monthly cash  assistance payments under the AFDC program.  Our second spending  category includes spending for job and training programs that seek to  prepare people for employment.  Our third spending category includes  programs that seek to support low-income people with other forms of aid  or services, including helping families move from welfare to work or avoid  welfare altogether.  For example, child care subsidies and rental assistance  payments can help parents remain employed even if they are working in  low-wage jobs.  Our fourth spending category recognizes the range of  programs that states can use to develop strategies to achieve TANF\u2019s goals.   These spending areas include child welfare programs, substance abuse  programs, mental health programs, and programs that help the  developmentally disabled attain a level of self-sufficiency, and exclude  spending for any individuals in institutions.  While many of these state  spending areas may not have income standards to determine eligibility, a  state can claim TANF funds for expenditures in these areas if the state is  able to certify that participants in these programs meet the eligibility  requirements set forth in the state\u2019s TANF plan.  Our fifth spending  category includes spending for health services aimed at low-income people  but excludes spending for the elderly, long-term care, and institutional care.   Analyzing health care spending helps recognize a state\u2019s true and  substantial investment in spending to support these low-income and needy  populations.  In general, our spending categories were designed to cover all  areas of a state\u2019s budget associated with the TANF-eligible population and  allowable expenses under TANF as well as for other low-income children  and individuals of working age.", "We analyzed state spending of both federal and state funds on a wide array  of programs aimed at providing services to the needy and that flowed  through the state budget.  In this analysis, federal spending is not defined  by the level of a federal grant allocated to a state, but rather by how much  of the grant the state chooses\u2014or in some cases is required\u2014to spend on a  particular activity.  For this reason we did not consider a number of 100  percent federally funded programs that do not flow through the state  budget.  For example, the food stamp program is administrated by the state  and the shared administrative costs are included in the survey, but the  value of the food stamp coupons disbursed in the fiscal year, borne 100  percent by the federal government, is not.  Likewise, if a state budget action  prompted local spending in these areas, through incentives like a state- local match, then local spending was included in our analysis.", "We converted state spending data to real 2004 dollars in order to make our  spending more comparable over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Site Visits", "paragraphs": ["To obtain program description and recipient eligibility information on the  spending data we collected, we also spoke with budget and program  officials in these nine states knowledgeable about state TANF programs,  Medicaid programs, and other state programs supporting the spending we  captured in our survey.
