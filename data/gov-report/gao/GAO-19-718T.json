However, when not managed properly, energy production on federal lands can create risks to public health and the environment, such as contaminated surface water. In February 2011, GAO designated Interior's management of federal oil and gas resources as a program at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation. This testimony discusses GAO's work related to ensuring a fair return on resources from federal lands.

Key federal lease terms are the same as they were decades ago, and Interior has not adjusted them for inflation or other factors that may affect the federal government's fair return. In June 2017, GAO reported that raising federal royalty rates\u2014a lease term that defines a percentage of the value of production paid to the government\u2014for onshore oil, gas, and coal resources could decrease production on federal lands by a small amount or not at all but could increase overall federal revenue. Also, preliminary observations from GAO's ongoing work indicate that selected states charge royalty rates for oil and gas produced on state lands at a higher rate than the federal government charges for production on federal lands.", "Oil, Gas, and Coal Bonding. GAO found in September 2019 that oil and gas bonds do not provide sufficient financial assurance because, among other things, most individual, statewide, and nationwide lease bonds are set at regulatory minimum values that have not been adjusted for inflation since the 1950s and 1960s (see figure). Further, GAO reported in March 2018 that coal self-bonding (where an operator promises to pay reclamation costs without providing collateral) poses financial risks to the federal government. Bonds provide funds that can be used to reclaim lands\u2014restore them as close to their original natural states as possible\u2014if an operator or other liable party does not do so.", "Natural Gas Emissions. In October 2010, GAO reported that data collected by Interior likely underestimated venting and flaring because they did not account for all sources of lost gas. GAO reported that economically capturing vented and flared natural gas could increase federal royalty payments by $23 million annually and made recommendations to help Interior better account for and manage emissions. In November 2016, Interior issued regulations consistent with GAO's recommendations, but Interior has since issued revised regulations, which are inconsistent with GAO's recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["For the reports discussed in this testimony, GAO has made 20 recommendations and three matters for congressional consideration.

Federal  oil, gas, and coal are an important source of revenues that are shared  among federal, state, and tribal governments. These revenues consist of,  among other things, a percentage of the value of production paid to the  federal government, or royalties. Based on Interior data, for fiscal year  2018 Interior collected about $4.2 billion associated with onshore oil, gas,  and coal production on federal and Indian lands. Federal lands also  provide an important source of energy for the United States and create  jobs in the oil and gas industry. According to Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land  Management (BLM), in fiscal year 2018, production on federal lands was  responsible for 9 percent of the natural gas, 8 percent of the oil, and  nearly 40 percent of the coal produced in the United States.

This designation was  based on challenges we identified with several aspects of Interior\u2019s  oversight responsibilities, including that Interior lacked reasonable  assurance that it was collecting a fair return from oil and gas produced on  federal lands. Since our 2011 designation, we have made numerous  recommendations to improve Interior\u2019s management of federal oil and gas  resources. Interior has taken some actions to strengthen how it manages  federal oil and gas resources, but it has not met the criteria for removal  from our high-risk list. For example, in December 2013, we  recommended that Interior revise BLM\u2019s regulations to provide flexibility  for the bureau to make changes to onshore oil and gas royalty rates.  Interior agreed with our recommendation and adopted regulations in  November 2016 that provided royalty rate flexibility.", "In addition to reporting in February 2011 on challenges with Interior  collecting a fair return from oil and gas produced on federal lands, we  have recently reported on challenges in several other areas related to  Interior ensuring a fair return, including managing bonds for oil, gas, and coal development to ensure  taxpayers do not have to pay to reclaim lands affected by energy  development; ensuring royalty compliance (Interior\u2019s ability to determine moneys  owed and to collect and account for such amounts); and accounting for and managing natural gas emissions in determining  royalties owed.", "In these reports, we made 20 recommendations and three matters for  congressional consideration.

Annual rental fees are fixed fees paid by lessees until  production begins on the leased land or, when no production occurs, until  the end of the period specified in the lease. For federal oil and gas  leases, generally the rental rate is $1.50 per acre for the first 5 years, and  $2 per acre each year thereafter.

Each month, these oil and gas companies are to self-report data to  ONRR on the amount of oil and gas they produced and sold, the value of  this production, and the amount of royalties that they owe to the federal  government. To ensure that the data provided to ONRR are accurate and  all royalties are being paid, ONRR relies on its compliance program.

Natural gas that is released for  operational or safety procedures is released directly into the atmosphere  (vented) or burned (flared). In addition to gas that is lost during  production, some natural gas may be used to operate equipment on the  lease (lease use). We use the term natural gas emissions to refer to  vented, flared, and lease use gas collectively.

Energy markets have also changed  since federal oil and gas lease terms were established. For example, we  reported in June 2017 that, according to the U.S. Energy Information  Administration, almost all of the recent increase in overall oil and gas  production had centered on oil and gas located in shale and other tight  rock geologic formations, spurred by advances in production technologies  such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In addition, we  estimate that, based on preliminary observations, the rental rate would be  $2.91 per acre if it were adjusted for inflation, which would have  generated about $3.6 million for the first year for new leases issued in  fiscal year 2018, or an additional $1.8 million.", "In June 2017, we reported that raising federal royalty rates for onshore  oil, gas, and coal resources could decrease oil and gas production on  federal lands by either a small amount or not at all but could increase  overall federal revenue, according to studies we reviewed and  stakeholders we interviewed. The two oil and gas studies we reviewed  for that report modeled the effects of different policy scenarios on oil and  gas production on federal lands and estimated that raising the federal  royalty rate could increase net federal revenue from $5 million to $38  million per year. One of the studies stated that net federal revenue would  increase under three scenarios that modeled raising the royalty rate from  the current 12.5 percent to 16.67 percent, 18.75 percent, or 22.5 percent.

These factors may  change over time as the market for oil and gas, the technologies used to  explore and produce oil and gas, or the broader economic climate  changes. In August 2016, in response to our recommendation, Interior  reported that it had developed documented procedures for conducting  assessments of the oil and gas fiscal system, fully implementing our  recommendation. To meet this recommendation, BLM established a fiscal  assessment policy that describes actions it will take every 3 years and  every 10 years. Based on this policy, the next assessment is expected to  be completed in late 2019.

It is difficult to (1) ascertain the financial  health of an operator, in part, because greater financial expertise is often  now needed to evaluate the complex financial structures of large coal  companies as compared to when self-bonding regulations were first  approved in 1983; (2) determine whether an operator qualifies for self- bonding; and (3) secure a replacement for existing self-bonds when an  operator no longer qualifies.", "For example, some stakeholders we interviewed told us that the risk from  self-bonding is greater now than when OSMRE first approved its self- bonding regulations in 1983; at that time, the office noted there were  companies financially sound enough that the probability of bankruptcy  was small. However, according to an August 2016 OSMRE policy  advisory, three of the largest coal companies in the United States  declared bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016, and these companies held  approximately $2 billion in self-bonds at the time. Because SMCRA  explicitly allows states to decide whether to accept self-bonds, eliminating  the risk that self-bonds pose to the federal government and states would  require SMCRA to be amended.

Although BLM does  not estimate reclamation costs for all wells, it has estimated reclamation  costs for thousands of wells whose operators have filed for bankruptcy.  Based on our analysis of these estimates, we identified two cost  scenarios: low-cost wells typically cost about $20,000 to reclaim, and  high-cost wells typically cost about $145,000 to reclaim.", "In our September 2019 report, based on our cost scenarios described  above, we found that most bonds (84 percent) that we were able to link to  wells in BLM data are likely too low to fund reclamation costs for all the  wells they cover. Bonds generally do not reflect reclamation costs  because most bonds are set at regulatory minimum values, and these  minimums have not been adjusted to account for inflation since they were  first set in the 1950s and 1960s, as shown in figure 1. In addition, these  minimums do not account for variables, such as the number of wells they  cover, or other characteristics that affect reclamation costs, such as  increasing well depth.", "In addition to the wells identified by BLM as orphaned over the last  decade, in our September 2019 report we identified inactive wells at  increased risk of becoming orphaned and found their bonds are often not  sufficient to reclaim the wells. Our analysis of BLM bond value data as of  May 2018 and ONRR production data as of June 2017 revealed that a  significant number of inactive wells remain unplugged and could be at  increased risk of becoming orphaned. Specifically, we identified 2,294  wells that may be at increased risk of becoming orphaned because they  have not produced since June 2008 and have not been reclaimed.", "Since these at-risk wells are unlikely to produce again, an operator  bankruptcy could lead to orphaned wells unless bonds are adequate to  reclaim them. In our September 2019 report, we stated that if the number  of at-risk wells is multiplied by our low-cost reclamation scenario of  $20,000, it implies a cost of about $46 million to reclaim these wells. If the  number of these wells is multiplied by our high-cost reclamation scenario  of $145,000, it implies a cost of about $333 million. When we further  analyzed the available bonds for these at-risk wells, we found that most of  these wells (about 77 percent) had bonds that would be too low to fully  reclaim the at-risk wells under our low-cost scenario. More than 97  percent of these at-risk wells have bonds that would not fully reclaim the  wells under our high-cost scenario. Without taking steps to adjust bond  levels to more closely reflect expected reclamation costs, BLM faces  ongoing risks that not all wells will be completely and timely reclaimed, as  required by law. We recommended in our September 2019 report that  BLM take steps to adjust bond levels to more closely reflect expected  reclamation costs. BLM concurred with our recommendation.

In our September 2019 report we described one  way in which BLM may be able to accomplish this is through the  imposition of user fees, such as at the time an operator submits an  application for permit to drill or as an annual fee for inactive wells. Some  states, such as Wyoming, have dedicated funds for reclaiming orphaned  wells. According to one official we interviewed with the Wyoming Oil and  Gas Conservation Commission, the Commission has reclaimed  approximately 2,215 wells since 2014 under its Orphan Well Program,  which is funded through a conservation tax assessed on the sale of oil  and natural gas produced in the state. Developing a mechanism to obtain  funds from operators for such costs could help ensure that BLM can  reclaim wells completely and timely. In commenting on a draft of our  September 2019 report, BLM stated that it does not have the authority to  seek or collect fees from lease operators to reclaim orphaned wells. We  continue to believe a mechanism for BLM to obtain funds from oil and gas  operators to cover the costs of reclamation of orphaned wells could help  ensure BLM can completely and timely reclaim these wells, some of  which have been orphaned for at least 10 years. Accordingly, in our  September 2019 report, we recommended that Congress consider giving  BLM the authority to obtain funds from operators to reclaim orphaned  wells and requiring BLM to implement a mechanism to obtain sufficient  funds from operators for reclaiming orphaned wells."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ONRR Compliance Goals May Not Align with the Agency Mission to Account for Royalty Payments, Despite Agency Efforts to Improve Operations", "paragraphs": ["In May 2019, we found that ONRR had begun implementing several  initiatives to help the agency operate more effectively, according to  ONRR officials. For example, in March 2017, ONRR initiated Boldly Go,  an effort to assess its organizational structure and identify and implement  potential improvements. ONRR was also in the process of implementing  a new electronic compliance case management and work paper tool  referred to as the Operations and Management Tool. According to ONRR  documents, this tool was to combine multiple systems into one and was  intended to serve a variety of functions. ONRR documents stated that the  tool is designed to be a single, standardized system that reduces manual  data entry, creates a single system of record for ONRR case data, offers  checks to eliminate data entry errors, and provides greater transparency  for outside auditors. The agency also introduced a new auditor training  curriculum in April 2018.", "In our May 2019 report, we also found that ONRR reported generally  meeting its annual royalty compliance goals for fiscal years 2010 through  2017. However, we found that while ONRR\u2019s fiscal year 2017  compliance goals could be useful for assessing certain aspects of  ONRR\u2019s performance, they may not have been effectively aligned with  the agency\u2019s statutory requirements or its mission to account for all  royalty payments. For example, ONRR\u2019s fiscal year 2017 compliance  goals did not sufficiently address its mission to collect, account for, and  verify revenues, in part, because its goals did not address accuracy, such  as a coverage goal (e.g., identifying the number of companies or  percentage of royalties subject to compliance activities over a set period).", "We stated that by establishing a coverage goal that aligns with the  agency\u2019s mission, ONRR could have additional assurance that its  compliance program was assessing the extent to which oil and gas  royalty payments were accurate. Overall, we made seven  recommendations, including that ONRR establish an accuracy goal that  addresses coverage that aligns with its mission. Interior concurred with  our recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations Exist in Interior\u2019s Accounting and Management of Natural Gas Emissions", "paragraphs": ["We issued reports in October 2010 and July 2016 that included several  recommendations regarding steps Interior should take to better account  for and manage natural gas emissions associated with oil and gas  development. In October 2010, we reported that data collected by  Interior to track venting and flaring on federal leases likely underestimated  venting and flaring because they do not account for all sources of lost  gas. For onshore federal leases, operators reported to Interior that about  0.13 percent of produced gas was vented or flared. Estimates from the  Environmental Protection Agency and the Western Regional Air  Partnership showed volumes as high as 30 times higher. We reported  that economically capturing onshore vented and flared natural gas with  then-available control technologies could increase federal royalty  payments by $23 million annually. We also found limitations in how  Interior was overseeing venting and flaring on federal leases, and made  five recommendations geared toward ensuring that Interior had a  complete picture of venting and flaring and took steps to reduce this lost  gas where economic to do so. Interior generally concurred with our  recommendations.", "In July 2016, we found that limitations in Interior\u2019s guidance for oil and  gas operators regarding their reporting requirements could hinder the  extent to which the agency can account for natural gas emissions on  federal lands. Without such data, Interior could not ensure that operators  were minimizing waste and that BLM was collecting all royalties that were  owed to the federal government. We recommended, among other things,  that BLM provide additional guidance for operators on how to estimate  natural gas emissions from oil and gas produced on federal leases. BLM  concurred with the recommendation.", "Interior has taken steps to implement our past recommendations  regarding the control of natural gas. Accounting for natural gas is  important for ensuring that the federal government receives all royalties it  is due and because methane\u2014which comprises approximately 80  percent of natural gas emissions\u2014is a potent greenhouse gas that has  the ability to warm the atmosphere. In addition, we reported in July 2016  that increased oil production in recent years has resulted in an increase in  flared gas in certain regions where there is limited infrastructure to  transport or process gas associated with oil production. In November  2016, Interior issued regulations intended to reduce wasteful emissions  from onshore oil and gas production that were consistent with our  recommendations. In June 2017, however, Interior postponed the  compliance dates for relevant sections of the new regulations and then  suspended certain requirements in December 2017. Interior subsequently  issued revised regulations in September 2018 that are not consistent with  the findings and recommendations in our prior work.", "In our prior work and preliminary observations in our ongoing work, we  have found that some states have requirements that are more stringent  than BLM\u2019s regarding accounting for and managing natural gas  emissions. For example, we reported in July 2016 that North Dakota  targeted the amount of gas flared from two geologic formations in the  state by imposing restrictions on the amount of gas operators may flare  from existing and new sources. We also reported that North Dakota  requires operators to include a gas capture plan when they apply to drill a  new oil well. According to state officials we interviewed for our report, gas  capture plans help facilitate discussions between oil producers and firms  that process and transport gas and have improved the speed at which  new wells are connected to gas gathering infrastructure. In the course of  our ongoing work, we obtained documents indicating that per its  regulations, North Dakota requires all gas produced and used on a lease  for fuel purposes or that is flared must be measured or estimated and  reported monthly, and that all vented gas be burned and the volume  reported.", "In addition, based on preliminary observations in our ongoing work,  Colorado and Texas both charge royalties on vented and flared gas  volumes. In the course of our ongoing work, we obtained documents  indicating that the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission,  which regulates oil and gas activity in the state, addresses both venting  and flaring as well as leaks. Colorado officials we interviewed with the  State Land Board told us in September 2019 that, since 2018, the state  charges royalties on all vented and flared gas volumes, with certain  exceptions. These officials told us that prior to 2018, vented and flared  gas could be exempt from royalties, but that it was uncommon. In  addition, in Texas, a state official we interviewed told us that vented or  flared volumes must be reported monthly and that charging royalties on  these volumes increases revenues.", "Chairman Lowenthal, Ranking Member Gosar, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared testimony.
