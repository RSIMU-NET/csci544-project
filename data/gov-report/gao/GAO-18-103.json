State and federal Medicaid HCBS spending was about $87 billion in 2015. Effective needs assessments help states ensure appropriate access to, and manage utilization of, services and therefore costs. States' processes vary, and challenges include the potential for assessors to have conflicts of interest leading to over- or under-estimating of beneficiaries' needs for HCBS.", "GAO was asked to examine states' needs assessment processes for provision of long-term services and supports. This report addresses (1) how selected states assess needs for HCBS, and (2) steps CMS has taken to improve coordination and effectiveness of needs assessments, among other objectives. GAO studied six states that varied in terms of assessment tools in use, participation in federal initiatives, HCBS delivery systems, and geographic location; reviewed federal requirements and documents; and interviewed CMS officials and stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The six selected states that GAO reviewed used multiple approaches to assess individuals' needs for Medicaid home- and community-based services (HCBS). Each state may have multiple HCBS programs authorized under different sections of the Social Security Act. These programs serve beneficiaries who generally need assistance with daily activities, such as bathing or dressing. States establish needs assessment processes to collect data on functional needs, health status, and other areas that they use to determine individuals' eligibility for HCBS and to plan services, such as the amount of services needed. The selected states varied in the extent to which they used different assessments across HCBS programs and used multiple types of entities\u2014such as state or government agencies, contractors, or providers\u2014to conduct them.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken steps to improve needs assessments but concerns about conflict of interest remain in regard to HCBS providers and managed care plans. HCBS providers may have a financial interest in the outcome of needs assessments, which could lead to overstating needs and overprovision of services. CMS has addressed risks associated with HCBS provider conflicts, such as by requiring states to establish standards for conducting certain needs assessments, but these requirements do not cover all types of HCBS programs. For example, specific conflict of interest requirements are generally not in place for needs assessments that are used to inform HCBS eligibility determinations. In addition, requirements for states to establish standards to address HCBS providers' potential for conflict of interest in conducting needs assessments that are used for service planning do not apply across all programs.", "Similarly, managed care plans may have a financial interest in the outcome of HCBS assessments used for both determining eligibility and service amounts. Managed care plans could have an incentive to enroll beneficiaries with few needs, as plans typically receive a fixed payment per enrollee. For example, a plan in one state admitted in a settlement with the federal government to enrolling 1,740 individuals, from 2011 through 2013, whose needs did not qualify them. In 2013, CMS issued guidance that managed care plans may not be involved in assessments used to determine eligibility for HCBS, but CMS has not consistently required states to prevent this involvement. Among three states GAO reviewed with managed care HCBS programs, CMS required one to stop allowing plans to conduct such assessments but allowed plan involvement in two states. The absence of conflict-of-interest requirements across all types of HCBS programs and states is not consistent with federal internal control standards, which require agencies to respond to risks to program objectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS ensure that all Medicaid HCBS programs have requirements for states to address both service providers' and managed care plans' potential for conflicts of interest in conducting assessments.

In recent years, the majority of Medicaid spending on long- term services and supports has been for home- and community-based  services (HCBS)\u2014that is, services that are provided to beneficiaries in  their homes or in other settings that are integrated into their communities  rather than in institutional settings such as nursing homes. In fiscal year  2015, federal and state Medicaid spending for HCBS was estimated at  $87 billion, or 55 percent of total Medicaid spending on long-term services  and supports. HCBS can enable beneficiaries who are limited in their  ability to care for themselves to remain in their homes, maintain their  independence, and participate in community life to the fullest extent  possible. In administering their Medicaid programs, states have  considerable flexibility to establish multiple HCBS programs authorized  under different provisions of federal law, which offer states different  options for serving beneficiaries. For example, some types of Medicaid  HCBS program authorities limit services only to beneficiaries who need a  level of care typically provided in an institutional setting.", "To receive Medicaid HCBS, beneficiaries generally must meet functional  eligibility criteria\u2014which are typically based on factors such as physical  and cognitive abilities indicative of a specified level of need for services\u2014 as well as financial eligibility criteria. States establish HCBS needs  assessment processes that they use to determine whether individuals are  functionally eligible for Medicaid HCBS and to develop service plans that  specify the scope and amount of services beneficiaries may receive  based on their needs. These processes must be consistent with  applicable federal requirements, which may vary across HCBS programs.  HCBS needs assessments directly affect the efficiency of and access to  the Medicaid program, given their key role in informing both states\u2019  determination of functional eligibility for HCBS and the development of  service plans that reflect the amount of services to be provided. These  assessments are conducted using questionnaires or interview guides  referred to as assessment tools, and individual states may use different  assessment tools. A state may also use different assessment tools for  different HCBS programs within the state or for different purposes such  as establishing functional eligibility or developing service plans. The  Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) found  at least 124 distinct HCBS needs assessment tools in use nationwide in  2015.", "Given the variation in needs assessment tools across and within states,  stakeholders have noted potential benefits of moving toward more  uniform HCBS needs assessments\u2014either by assessing all individuals  with the same assessment tool, or by assessing individuals in specific  populations or HCBS programs with distinct tools that gather similar  information on a core set of topics for all individuals. For example, the U.S. Senate Commission on Long Term Care recommended the  development and implementation of a single needs assessment tool that  could be used across states, programs, and care settings. In addition,  MACPAC noted potential benefits of moving to a uniform needs  assessment tool, but also challenges such as differing and changing  program needs across states and recent state investments in a variety of  different tools. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an  agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is  responsible for federal oversight of Medicaid. Recent CMS initiatives  related to HCBS needs assessments were intended to help states collect  uniform information across HCBS assessment tools and improve the  effectiveness of needs assessments by addressing potential conflicts of  interest, which may occur when entities with financial incentives that are  tied to the outcomes of needs assessments conduct such assessments.", "Given the critical role that needs assessments play in determining  Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 access to long term services and supports and  states\u2019 broad flexibility to structure needs assessments, you asked that  we provide information related to the use of needs assessments across  states.", "In this report, we:  1.  describe the needs assessment processes that selected state  Medicaid programs used to determine functional eligibility for HCBS  and to plan the provision of services, such as the amount of services  to provide;  2.  describe steps selected states have taken to improve needs  assessment processes for HCBS; and  3.  evaluate steps CMS has taken to improve the coordination and  effectiveness of needs assessment processes for HCBS.", "To describe states\u2019 HCBS needs assessment processes and the steps  states have taken to improve these processes, we conducted case  studies of six states.

For  example, some types of Medicaid HCBS programs only serve  beneficiaries who are functionally eligible for an institutional level of care;  that is, beneficiaries must have needs that rise to the level of care usually  provided in a nursing facility, hospital, or other institution.", "Under some types of HCBS programs, states can tailor their programs to  the needs of specific beneficiary populations they choose to target.  Common populations that states target with their HCBS programs  include: older adults and people with physical disabilities, people with intellectual or developmental disabilities, people with addictions or mental illness, and other populations with specific conditions such as traumatic brain  injury or Alzheimer\u2019s disease.", "States use different delivery systems to provide Medicaid HCBS, and  these may vary across distinct HCBS programs within a state.  Historically, states have predominantly provided HCBS using fee-for- service delivery systems in which states pay providers for HCBS  rendered to beneficiaries and billed to the state. Alternatively, under  managed care long-term services and supports delivery systems, states  contract with managed care plans to provide HCBS to beneficiaries and  typically reimburse the plans through capitation payments, which are  periodic payments for each beneficiary enrolled under the contract.  Managed care plans may contract with HCBS providers to provide  services to beneficiaries or may provide services directly. A state may use  a combination of fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems  within or among its HCBS programs.

Effective needs  assessments can help beneficiaries to receive appropriate services to  help them live independently and help states manage utilization of  services, and therefore costs. An effective assessment process would  facilitate efficient use of services and beneficiaries\u2019 access to available  services appropriate to their needs by accurately and consistently  estimating beneficiaries\u2019 needs. Assessment processes that overestimate  needs, underestimate needs, or both, may result in HCBS programs that  offer more services than needed or deny eligible beneficiaries access to  needed services.

HCBS needs  assessments cover complex subject matter and may require assessors to  make observations and judgments about beneficiaries\u2019 needs. For  example, needs assessments typically address numerous and varied  tasks necessary for a beneficiary to live independently, which can be  difficult to measure and subject to interpretation\u2014such as a beneficiary\u2019s  ability to manage finances. Furthermore, CMS has stated that assessors\u2019  conflicts of interest can influence decisions even without individual  assessors realizing this. Conflicts of interest can arise when an assessor  has an incentive for a beneficiary to either over- or under-utilize HCBS, or  an incentive to put the needs of assessors ahead of program goals, such  as promoting certain HCBS when others may be more beneficial or cost  effective. As examples to further illustrate these points, incentives that  could result in over- or under-utilization of HCBS include the following,  respectively. On one hand, an assessor may be a provider of the services  for which the beneficiary may be eligible or a managed care plan that  covers these services, and thus have an incentive to find that individuals  need the services or coverage they offer. Conversely, a managed care  plan may have incentives to reduce enrollees\u2019 service utilization in order  to reduce costs below the capitation payments that the plan receives to  provide care to its enrollees and thus to maximize its profits, which could  influence needs assessments used for service planning."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected States Used Multiple Tools and Entities to Conduct Needs Assessments across Distinct HCBS Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected States Varied in the Extent to Which Needs Assessment Tools Were Tailored to Distinct HCBS Programs and Assessment Purposes", "paragraphs": ["Each of the six selected states we reviewed used varied needs  assessment tools across their distinct Medicaid HCBS programs, for  which both functional eligibility criteria and amount of services available to  beneficiaries can differ widely.

For example, officials from Washington reported that after  implementing a formula to generate an overall classification of need, the  amount of service hours authorized for beneficiaries was distributed more  equitably and evenly across a continuum from minimum to maximum,  rather than beneficiaries mainly always receiving the maximum number of  hours allowed under program limits. This could allow for limited resources  to be allocated more consistently across beneficiaries with similar levels  of need.

The different  approaches of relying on a formula or relying on the judgement of  individual entities each presented its own challenges:  In two states where there was a formula to specify or guide the  amount of services to provide, advocates raised concerns that the  indicated amount did not adequately address needs for some  individuals. For example, advocates noted that the results of a lengthy  and nuanced assessment tool were ultimately reduced to a single  score in order to inform a particular budget for services. While this  score might reflect the average needs of beneficiaries with similar  assessment results, it did not adequately convey individualized needs  of some beneficiaries, according to the advocates.", "On the other hand, there were concerns that relying on entities\u2019  judgment resulted in inconsistency across beneficiaries.

To the extent  that a given HCBS program has limited resources for providing services,  assessment results may be used to allocate resources within those  limitations rather than to estimate the amount of services that would fully  meet needs. For example, an assessment formula in Washington is  designed to specify service amounts based on beneficiaries\u2019 identified  levels of need and the amounts that are available for particular levels of  need may increase or decrease based on the state budget. State officials  in Connecticut also said that because funding can vary for different HCBS  programs within a single state, moving to a consistent formula for  analyzing assessment results may shed light on the extent that  beneficiaries with similar levels of need receive different levels of services  depending on available program resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Taken Steps to Make HCBS Needs Assessment Processes More Effective, Uniform, and Free from Conflict of Interest, but Some Concerns Remain Unaddressed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Two CMS Programs Have Sought to Make Assessment Processes More Effective and Uniform within and across States", "paragraphs": ["CMS has implemented two key programs that facilitate state efforts to  make their HCBS needs assessment processes more uniform, among  other goals. One of these is called Testing Experience and Functional  Tools (TEFT) and is designed, in part, to test the effectiveness of a set of  specific questions that states can use to conduct needs assessments.  CMS designed the TEFT assessment questions for use across multiple  HCBS beneficiary populations, including beneficiaries (1) of advanced  age, or with (2) intellectual or developmental disabilities, (3) physical  disabilities, (4) serious mental illnesses, or (5) traumatic brain injuries.  The assessment questions being tested are limited to needs that may be  relevant among these populations and do not assess needs that may  apply to only certain populations; for example, questions to assess  cognitive status that may apply to those with intellectual or developmental  disabilities or other conditions but that do not apply to those with physical  disabilities only. CMS announced TEFT in 2012 and six states received  grants to test needs assessment questions for their effectiveness, which  includes their validity (defined as accuracy in measuring individuals\u2019  functional abilities) and reliability (defined as the consistency of results  across assessors). Three of these six states were among those we  selected for this review: Connecticut, Kentucky, and Minnesota. Officials  in these states told us that they had not completed field testing the TEFT  questions, and officials in two of these states (Connecticut and  Minnesota) said they would consider the option of using TEFT questions  in their assessments in the future. CMS officials told us that CMS plans to  make the assessment questions they determine to be valid and reliable  available to all states in the spring of 2018.", "Another key program that CMS has implemented is the Balancing  Incentive Program, which was authorized by the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act in 2010, to provide incentives for eligible states to  rebalance their long-term services and supports systems towards more  home- and community-based care. Among other things, this program  required participating states to collect information on specific topics  related to beneficiaries\u2019 needs, but allowed states to choose the needs  assessment questions. Under this program, states could use different  assessment tools to gather information for HCBS programs serving  different populations as long as the states used tools that collected  information on 26 key topics that spanned five broad areas, or domains.  The five domains were (1) activities of daily living, (2) instrumental  activities of daily living, (3) medical conditions/diagnoses, (4) cognitive  functioning, memory, and learning, and (5) behavior concerns (e.g.,  injurious, uncooperative, or destructive behavior). The requirement to  collect information from these five domains for each beneficiary  population was designed to promote consistency in determining  beneficiaries\u2019 needs across HCBS programs, while allowing states to  tailor their assessment processes to specific beneficiary populations,  according to CMS officials. For example, New York reported collecting  information on the required topics using a suite of six assessment tools  that varied to reflect differences in beneficiaries\u2019 age, population, and  other factors.", "The Balancing Incentive Program ended in 2015, although some states  were provided extensions to carry out planned activities. Of 20  participating states evaluated, 18 successfully carried out the requirement  to incorporate the 26 key topics in their needs assessments, according to  a program evaluation prepared for the HHS Assistant Secretary for  Planning and Evaluation. In addition, CMS has provided information and  lessons learned from the Balancing Incentive Program to all states via its  website and, according to CMS officials, has done several related  presentations.

In addition, CMS implemented regulations requiring all  states to establish standards for conducting needs assessments that  address certain potential conflicts for particular types of HCBS programs.  The specific requirements may differ by program and whether the  assessment is used to determine functional eligibility or develop service  plans:", "For example, for State Plan HCBS\u2014a relatively small program that  accounted for less than 1 percent of estimated Medicaid HCBS  expenditures in fiscal year 2015\u2014states are required to establish  conflict-of-interest standards that address both (1) evaluation of  eligibility, and (2) needs assessments used to develop service plans.

For example, several  types of HCBS programs have specific requirements for states to  establish standards to address potential conflicts of interest when HCBS  providers conduct needs assessments that are used for service planning,  but there are no equivalent requirements for State Plan Personal Care  Services programs. (See table 4). In addition, HCBS providers may  conduct certain needs assessments that inform HCBS functional eligibility  determinations, but specific conflict of interest requirements are generally  not in place for such assessments. With respect to gaps in requirements  specific to needs assessments that are used to inform functional eligibility  determinations, CMS officials suggested that state agencies\u2019  responsibility for making final eligibility determinations addresses conflict- of-interest concerns. Specifically, officials noted that CMS regulations  require state agencies to determine eligibility, and that, in doing so, states  may consider needs assessments conducted by assessor entities as well  as information from other sources. However, states may vary in the  extent to which they consider information from other sources. In addition,  it is unclear how the requirement that the state maintain responsibility for  eligibility determinations addresses potential conflicts of interest when an  HCBS provider conducts a needs assessment upon which a  determination of eligibility for HCBS may be based.", "Gaps in requirements to address the potential for conflicts of interest  when HCBS needs assessments are conducted by HCBS providers are  not consistent with federal internal control standards, which require  federal agencies to identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to  achieving defined objectives. While CMS has a goal of achieving an  effective long-term services and supports system that provides  appropriate services to beneficiaries, because the agency does not  require states to address the potential for HCBS providers\u2019 conflicts of  interest in conducting needs assessments under all HCBS authorities,  there is a risk that some states may rely on HCBS providers to conduct  assessments without addressing HCBS providers\u2019 financial incentives,  which can lead to over-utilization of HCBS. Examples among our case  study states include:", "North Carolina: A program integrity review conducted by CMS in  North Carolina found that the state\u2019s transition to the use of an  independent entity to conduct needs assessments for the State Plan  Personal Care Services Program\u2014rather than relying on HCBS  providers to assess beneficiary needs\u2014was followed by a reduction in  both the number of beneficiaries using the program and a 30 percent  reduction in average monthly expenditures. This suggests the  program may have been over-utilized before the independent entity  was used to conduct needs assessments. CMS highlighted this use of  an independent entity as a practice that merits consideration from  other states.", "Kentucky: State officials told us that when they transitioned to the  use of independent assessors they also identified apparent instances  of over-utilization that were occurring before they implemented  independent assessments and other program changes. For example,  officials said that when testing a new assessment tool using  independent assessors, they identified individuals who had a low level  of needs, and who did not appear to require an institutional level of  care, as required for program eligibility, but who had been assessed  at that level in the past."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addressing Managed Care Plans\u2019 Potential for Conflicts of Interest", "paragraphs": ["Conflict-of-interest concerns also exist for states with managed care  HCBS programs where managed care plans conduct assessments.

The guidance  stated that managed care plans may not be involved in any HCBS  functional eligibility determinations or needs assessment processes prior  to a beneficiary\u2019s enrollment in the plan. CMS officials told us that  allowing managed care plans to assess individuals before enrollment  without proper oversight by the state may provide an opportunity for plans  to selectively enroll individuals who require less HCBS. Despite this risk,  we found that CMS does not always take steps to ensure that states have  procedures in place to guard against this practice prior to approving their  programs. CMS officials told us that they evaluate state programs  individually and may not apply all of the detailed concepts in its guidance  when developing state-specific requirements for managed care HCBS  programs. CMS\u2019s application of the guidance in the three states selected  for this review varied across types of HCBS programs. Examples from  1115 Demonstration and HCBS Waiver programs for our case study  states include the following:", "1115 Demonstration programs: Of the six states we selected for this  review, one\u2014New York\u2014operated a managed care HCBS program  authorized by an 1115 demonstration. Prior to July 2015, New York  used managed care plans to assess and determine individuals\u2019  functional eligibility for certain HCBS programs. One managed care  plan admitted to enrolling 1,740 individuals in managed care HCBS  whose needs did not qualify them for the program from January 2011  to September 2013, and it resolved allegations that it had submitted  false claims for Medicaid HCBS in a $35 million settlement with the  U.S. Department of Justice. In 2013, CMS amended the terms and  conditions of New York\u2019s demonstration to require the state to use an  independent assessor entity to both conduct needs assessments and  determine eligibility for managed care HCBS, and New York has  contracted with an independent assessor to carry out these functions.  While this requirement applied specifically to New York, it does not  necessarily apply to other states, as CMS\u2019s terms and conditions for  1115 demonstrations can vary across states. According to CMS, an  additional 11 states had managed care HCBS programs approved  under 1115 demonstrations as of July 2017. However, CMS officials  told us that they did not have information on whether or not these 11  states were using managed care plans to conduct needs  assessments for the purpose of determining individuals\u2019 functional  eligibility.", "HCBS Waiver programs: Two of our six selected states\u2014Minnesota  and North Carolina\u2014used managed care plans to deliver services for  HCBS Waiver programs. In these states, CMS approved HCBS  Waiver applications that proposed to use managed care plans to  conduct or evaluate needs assessments used to determine functional  eligibility for the programs, contrary to CMS\u2019s May 2013 guidance.  CMS officials said that when states allow managed care plans to be  involved in these assessments, CMS would expect states to provide  oversight as part of their quality improvement strategies required  under HCBS Waivers. However, CMS does not require states to  provide assurances or evidence of oversight directly related to  managed care plans\u2019 potential for conflicts of interest when plans are  involved in needs assessments that states use to determine functional  eligibility.", "CMS officials told us that states that do allow managed care plans to  conduct assessments used to determine eligibility for HCBS should be  aware of the potential for conflicts of interest in order to provide adequate  oversight. CMS officials also told us that they engage in a conversation  with states related to oversight of the assessment process when CMS  learns of such states. However, CMS does not collect complete  information on which states use managed care plans for needs  assessments prior to enrollment, and states may not implement  precautions absent a specific CMS requirement to address the potential  for these conflicts of interest. The absence of requirements for states to address acknowledged risks is not consistent with federal internal control  standards that require federal agencies to identify, analyze, and respond  to risks related to achieving defined objectives.", "Developing Service Plans and Determining the Amount of HCBS to  Provide  Separate concerns pertain to managed care plans\u2019 involvement in HCBS  needs assessments for service planning purposes that are conducted by  plans after enrollment. Advocates in two of the three selected states with  managed care HCBS programs, New York and North Carolina, expressed  concerns about managed care plans\u2019 incentives to reduce their costs by  reducing enrollees\u2019 HCBS service levels, leading to reduced access to  needed HCBS. For example, advocates in New York highlighted the  growth in fair hearings that enrollees initiated to dispute reductions in  HCBS they receive, which can result from inaccurate needs  assessments. In May 2016, in the preamble to a final rule that amended  managed care regulations, CMS responded to concerns from  commenters about managed care plans\u2019 involvement in the needs  assessments used to develop service plans by stating that managed care  plans\u2019 HCBS needs assessments of enrollees are a critical component of  the plans\u2019 efforts to manage enrollees\u2019 care. CMS also noted that existing  appeals processes, which are similar to fair hearings, provide adequate  safeguards to address instances when enrollees believe their needs  assessments do not reflect their true needs. However, according to  CMS, beneficiaries enrolled in managed long-term services and supports  are among the most vulnerable and often require enhanced protections to  assure their health and welfare.", "To implement additional beneficiary protections, the May 2016 managed  care regulations require states with managed care HCBS programs to  implement a beneficiary support system. A beneficiary support system  generally provides individuals with education and assistance related to  appeals, grievances, and fair hearings, and assists states with the  identification and resolution of systemic issues through review and  oversight of program data. These regulations also require states to report  annually on the activities and performance of these systems in order to  drive continual improvements. CMS stated that reporting requirements of  this nature would help the agency address fragmented program  information about state managed care programs and help improve  oversight efforts. However, as of September 2017, CMS had not issued  guidance to states on the content and form of this reporting, and under  the regulations, states are not required to submit reports until CMS issues  such guidance. CMS officials told us they were unsure whether they  would issue this guidance, and thus it is unclear whether and when the  reporting requirement will take effect.", "We previously made a recommendation to CMS that pertains to this  issue.

We found that existing state reporting did not always  include key elements necessary for CMS to monitor certain key aspects  of beneficiaries\u2019 access and quality of care, including data related to  appeals and grievances. We recommended that CMS improve its  oversight of managed long-term services and supports by taking steps to  identify and obtain key information needed to oversee states\u2019 efforts to  monitor beneficiary access to quality services.
