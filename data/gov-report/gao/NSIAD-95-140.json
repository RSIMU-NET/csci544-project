When incorporated into advanced weapon systems, stealth technology greatly improves the effectiveness of forces. The United States is the world leader in stealth technology, and this lead has given U.S. forces a clear battlefield advantage as was demonstrated in Operation Desert Storm. Stealth-related commodities are sensitive from an export control perspective because some of the materials and processes involved have civil applications that make it difficult to control the commodities\u2019 dissemination and retain U.S. leadership in stealth technology.", "Stealth designs incorporate materials, shapes, and structures in a functional system that can meet mission requirements. Stealth techniques fall into two general groups. First, a material may deflect an incoming radar signal into neutral space thereby preventing the source radar from picking up the radar reflection and \u201cseeing\u201d the object. Second, a material may simply absorb an incoming radar signal, not allowing the signal to reflect back to its source. In addition to materials, measurement gear used to test radar-absorbing properties and technologies and software related to manufacturing and application techniques are also considered sensitive from an export control perspective.", "DOD\u2019s policy on the commercial export of stealth technology recognizes its military significance and sensitivity while acknowledging that some items with stealth properties have been developed for commercial purposes, are widely available, and are not militarily significant. DOD\u2019s policy states that commercial marketing of unclassified, non-DOD funded stealth technology may be permitted on a case-by-case basis after review by appropriate offices and agencies and approval of the required export license.", "The U.S. export control system is divided into two regimes, one for munitions items under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and one for dual-use items (items with both civil and military uses) under the Export Administration Act (EAA). The Department of State controls munitions items through its Office of Defense Trade Controls and establishes the USML, with input from DOD. The Department of Commerce, through its Bureau of Export Administration, controls dual-use commodities (e.g., machine tools) and establishes the CCL. In general, export controls under the EAA are less restrictive than the controls under the AECA.", "Exporters must determine whether the item they wish to export is on the CCL or the USML and then apply to the appropriate agency for an export license. When there is confusion over which agency controls a commodity, an exporter may ask State to make a commodity jurisdiction determination. State, in consultation with the exporter, DOD, Commerce, and other agencies, reviews the characteristics of the commodity and determines whether the item is controlled under the USML or the CCL. Since 1992, the majority of all commodity jurisdiction determinations ruled that the commodity belonged on the CCL and not the USML."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stealth-Related Commodities Are Controlled by State and Commerce", "paragraphs": ["On the USML, stealth-related commodities are primarily controlled in two general categories. Stealth-related items are controlled under several other categories when the technology is incorporated as part of a system or end item. For example, fighter aircraft that incorporate stealth features are controlled under the category for aircraft. In general, the USML relies on functional descriptions of the items being controlled. Table 1 shows that the USML controls stealth-related exports as parts of several control categories.", "The CCL, as shown in table 2, controls stealth-related exports under seven export commodity control numbers. In general, the CCL uses more detailed language (often with technical performance criteria) than the USML to describe what is controlled. Because some export control classification numbers cover a broad array of items, some of the exports classified under these numbers are not related to stealth.", "State and DOD officials acknowledge that the descriptions in the CCL and the USML covering stealth-related items and technology do not clearly define which stealth-related exports are controlled by which agency. State and DOD officials also agree that the lines of jurisdiction should be clarified. DOD officials noted that they are only concerned about militarily significant items or items in the grey area that are potentially militarily significant.", "A Commerce official noted that overlapping jurisdiction is confusing for exporters and said commodities that fall in the grey area between Commerce and State should be placed on the USML. The Commerce official said that putting grey area cases on the USML would help exporters avoid the (1) confusion of determining where to go for a license and (2) possibility of having their exports seized by a Customs agent who believes the items belong on the USML. The Commerce official cautioned, however, that in moving items to the USML, consideration should be given to whether comparable items are readily available from other countries. State noted in its comments to this report that, under the AECA, foreign availability is not a factor in determining whether an item warrants the national security and foreign policy controls of the USML.", "Commerce noted in its comments that it does not agree that there is overlapping or unclear jurisdiction over stealth-related commodities and technology between the CCL and the USML. We disagree. As noted in the report, officials from both DOD and State told us that the lines of jurisdiction are unclear and should be clarified.

The details of one of the applications was reported in a major trade publication. As reported, the export application described the high-performance claims for the product and indicated that 200 gallons of the material would be used for a cruise missile project headed by a German company. Commerce also granted a license to export the same commodity to another country for use on a commercial satellite. Commerce approved both of these applications in fewer than 10 days and, in accordance with referral procedures, did not refer these applications to either DOD or State.", "The article reporting Commerce\u2019s approval of this material for export noted that the radar frequencies this stealth coating seeks to defend against include those employed by the Patriot antimissile system. In response to that report and subsequent concerns raised by DOD, State performed a commodity jurisdiction review to determine whether the stealth coatings actually belonged under the USML. At this time, the coatings had not yet been shipped overseas. On the basis of State\u2019s review that included consultation with both DOD and Commerce, State ruled that the radar-absorbing coating was under the jurisdiction of the USML.", "After State\u2019s ruling, Commerce suspended the export licenses it had approved and the exporter submitted new export applications to State.

In essence, these controls are targeted to specific items, end uses, and/or countries. Consequently, items controlled for missile technology reasons (e.g., most stealth-related commodities), as a practical matter, are not restricted if they are destined for other end uses (e.g., ship applications and aircraft) or for a country not considered to be a missile proliferation threat (e.g., any member of the Missile Technology Control Regime).", "In contrast, under the AECA, commodities on the USML are controlled to all destinations, and authority to regulate exports is not limited by end use or country.

In addition, State, in its comments to this report, concurs with our recommendation to clarify which stealth-related items should be controlled under the USML and the CCL. Commerce also disagreed with our second recommendation indicating that the executive branch has drafted an executive order that would give the relevant agencies authority to review all dual-use license applications. If implemented, this draft executive order may help improve the review of sensitive exports by DOD and State.

We agree that the two systems are different. However, as discussed in the report, Commerce\u2019s system is less restrictive than State\u2019s system. This difference, as Commerce notes, is due to Commerce being responsible for regulating dual-use commodities and State regulating more sensitive military commodities. 2. The rationalization exercise was initiated in 1990 by President Bush to move dual-use items on the USML to the Commerce Control List (CCL), not to examine both control lists for problems of unclear or overlapping jurisdiction. Though some stealth-related commodities were examined during the course of this exercise in 1991, problems of overlapping jurisdiction remain. In addition, as noted in our report, the Department of Defense (DOD) and State officials agree that jurisdiction over stealth-related technology and commodities is ill defined and should be clarified. 3. We do not have responsibility for determining where the lines of jurisdiction between the control lists should be drawn. As we stated in our recommendation, this is the role of the Department of State in consultation with DOD and the Department of Commerce. 4. We made changes to the report to more accurately reflect Commerce\u2019s position. 5. We do not suggest that new International Traffic in Arms Regulations controls over dual-use items be implemented. 6. Our draft report acknowledged the role of DOD in establishing referral procedures. We made changes to the final report to further clarify DOD\u2019s role. Moreover, in comments on our draft report, State indicated that it would be preferable for Commerce to refer to State all export licenses for Missile Technology Control Regime Annex items regardless of destination. 7. We clarified our use of the term \u201cstealth\u201d in the final report to explain that our review focused primarily on radar cross-section reduction. Consequently, any possible overlap in export controls for other aspects of stealth technology (e.g., technologies and materials related to reducing infrared, acoustic, electromagnetic and visual signatures, and counter low-observables technologies) was not addressed in our report. 8. We made changes to the report to comply with the confidentiality concerns raised by Commerce. 9. Our draft report acknowledges that because some export control classification numbers cover a broad array of items, some of the exports classified under these numbers are not related to stealth. We made changes to the final report to make this point more clearly. We would have preferred to review these applications with technical experts from DOD to determine which applications involved stealth technology. However, in our review examining missile related exports to China, we were prevented from sharing license information with DOD for the purposes of assessing the technology in a sample of Commerce export licenses. Due to Commerce\u2019s lengthy administrative requirements for requesting permission to share license information with DOD, we were unable to perform this detailed analysis in the timeframes of our assignment. 10. Commerce states that it has sufficient authority to deny validated license applications for products the U.S. government does not want to export. It points to regional stability controls reached with interagency consensus as examples of its use of such authority. While Commerce could take a more expansive view of its statutory charter, in practice, it has been more restrained. For example, Commerce officials told us they could not have prevented the export of radar-absorbing coatings to Germany for use on a cruise missile. 11. We made changes to the report to clarify our point that items controlled for missile technology reasons are, as a practical matter, not restricted if they are destined for other uses or for a country not considered a missile proliferation threat. 12. The report does not state that Commerce violated its referral procedures for exports going to China that are controlled for missile-technology reasons. Our point is that current referral practices preclude State and DOD from seeing most Commerce license applications for export commodity classification numbers controlled for missile technology reasons. 13. The examples in the table are valid. The license that was returned without action was held by Commerce for 44 days before it was returned. This provided Commerce ample time to refer the case to DOD for review.
