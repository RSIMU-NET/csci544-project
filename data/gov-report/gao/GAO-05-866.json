While the agencies responsible for these five efforts took many of the key steps required by federal law and executive branch guidance for the protection of personal information, they did not comply with all related laws and guidance. Specifically, most agencies notified the general public that they were collecting and using personal information and provided opportunities for individuals to review personal information when required by the Privacy Act. However, agencies are also required to provide notice to individual respondents explaining why the information is being collected; two agencies provided this notice, one did not provide it, and two claimed an allowable exemption from this requirement because the systems were used for law enforcement. In addition, agency compliance with key security requirements was inconsistent. Finally, three of the five agencies completed privacy impact assessments--important for analyzing the privacy implications of a system or data collection--but none of the assessments fully complied with Office of Management and Budget guidance.

These  efforts were selected for review because they met several criteria,  including the use of personal information and data obtained from another  agency or a private sector source, and because they were used for one of several specific purposes. To address both objectives, we reviewed  agency-provided documents and interviewed agency officials. To evaluate  the agencies\u2019 implementation of key privacy protections, we also reviewed  related notices, reports, and other documents. Our scope and methodology  are discussed in more detail in appendix I.", "We performed our work from May 2004 to June 2005 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In our May 2004 report on federal data mining efforts, we defined data  mining as the application of database technology and techniques\u2014such as  statistical analysis and modeling\u2014to uncover hidden patterns and subtle  relationships in data and to infer rules that allow for the prediction of  future results. We based this definition on the most commonly used terms  found in a survey of the technical literature. For the purposes of this report,  we are using the same definition.", "Data mining has been used successfully for a number of years in the private  and public sectors in a broad range of applications. In the private sector,  these applications include customer relationship management, market  research, retail and supply chain analysis, medical analysis and diagnostics,  financial analysis, and fraud detection. In the government, data mining was  initially used to detect financial fraud and abuse. For example, we used  data mining techniques in our prior reviews of federal government  purchase and credit card programs.", "Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, data mining has been  used increasingly as a tool to help detect terrorist threats through the  collection and analysis of public and private sector data. Its use has also  expanded to other purposes. In our May 2004 report, we identified several  uses of federal data mining efforts. The most common were  improving service or performance;  detecting fraud, waste, and abuse;  analyzing scientific and research information;  detecting criminal activities or patterns; and  analyzing intelligence and detecting terrorist activities.", "While the characteristics of each data mining effort can vary greatly, data  mining generally incorporates three processes: data input, data analysis,  and results output. In data input, data are collected in a central data  warehouse, validated, and formatted for use in data mining. In the data  analysis phase, data are typically searched through a query. The two most  common types of queries are pattern-based queries and subject-based  queries.", "Pattern-based queries search for data elements that match or depart  from a predetermined pattern (e.g., unusual claim patterns in an  insurance program).", "Subject-based queries search for any available information on a  predetermined subject using a specific identifier. This could be personal  information such as an individual identifier (e.g., a Social Security  number or the name of a person) or the identifier of a specific thing. For  example, the Navy uses subject-based data mining to identify trends in  the failure rate of parts used in its ships.", "The data analysis phase can be iterative, with the results of one query being  used to define criteria for a subsequent query. The output phase can  produce results in printed or electronic format. These reports can be  accessed by agency personnel, and can also be shared with other personnel  from other agencies. Figure 1 depicts a generic data mining process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Mining Poses Privacy Challenge", "paragraphs": ["The impact of computer systems on the ability of organizations to protect  personal information was recognized as early as 1973, when a federal  advisory committee on automated personal data systems observed that  \u201cThe computer enables organizations to enlarge their data processing  capacity substantially, while greatly facilitating access to recorded data,  both within organizations and across boundaries that separate them.\u201d In  addition, the committee concluded that \u201cThe net effect of computerization  is that it is becoming much easier for record-keeping systems to affect  people than for people to affect record-keeping systems.\u201d", "More recently, the federal government\u2019s increased use of data mining has  raised public and congressional concerns. A December 2003 report by a  task force on information sharing and analysis in homeland security noted  that agencies at all levels of government are now interested in collecting  and mining large amounts of data from commercial sources. The report  noted that agencies may use such data not only for investigations of  specific individuals, but also to perform large-scale data analysis and  pattern discovery in order to discern potential terrorist activity by  unknown individuals.", "As we noted in our May 2004 report, mining government and private  databases containing personal information creates a range of privacy  concerns. Through data mining, agencies can quickly and efficiently obtain  information on individuals or groups by exploiting large databases  containing personal information aggregated from public and private  records. Information can be developed about a specific individual or a  group of individuals whose behavior or characteristics fit a specific  pattern. The ease with which organizations can use automated systems to  gather and analyze large amounts of previously isolated information raises  concerns about the impact on personal privacy.

The act  describes \u201crecords\u201d as any item, collection, or grouping of information  about an individual that is maintained by an agency and contains his name  or another personal identifier. It also describes systems of records as a  group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual identifier. The  Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a  system of records, they must notify the public by a notice in the Federal  Register identifying the type of data collected, the types of individuals that  information is collected about, the intended routine uses of the data, and  procedures that individuals can use to review personal information.", "The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) also  addresses the protection of personal information. FISMA defines federal  requirements for securing information and information systems that  support federal agency operations and assets; it requires agencies to  develop agencywide information security programs that extend to  contractors and other providers of federal data and systems. Under  FISMA, information security includes protecting information and  information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,  modification, or destruction, including controls for confidentiality\u2014that is,  those controls necessary to preserve authorized restrictions on access and  disclosure to protect personal privacy. \u201can analysis of how information is handled: (i) to ensure handling conforms to applicable  legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy; (ii) to determine the risks and  effects of collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form in an  electronic information system; and (iii) to examine and evaluate protections and alternative  processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.\u201d", "Agencies must conduct a privacy assessment (1) before developing or  procuring information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates  information that is in a personally identifiable form or (2) before initiating  any new electronic data collections containing personal information on 10  or more individuals.

For example, records compiled for criminal law enforcement purposes can  be exempt from a number of provisions of the Privacy Act, including the  requirement to notify individuals of the purposes and uses of the  information at the time of collection and the requirement to ensure the  accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of records. A broader  category of investigative records compiled for criminal or civil law  enforcement purposes can also be exempted from a somewhat smaller  number of Privacy Act provisions, including the requirement to provide  individuals with access to their records and to inform the public of the  categories of sources of records. In general, the exemptions for law  enforcement purposes are intended to prevent the disclosure of  information collected as part of an ongoing investigation that could impair  the investigation or allow those under investigation to change their  behavior or take other actions to escape prosecution.", "The Privacy Act allows, but does not require, agencies to claim an  exemption for certain designated purposes. If the agency decides to claim  an exemption, the act requires the agencies to do so through a rule that  provides the reason behind its decision. Table 2 shows provisions of the  Privacy Act from which systems of records used for law enforcement may  be exempt.", "Similarly, the requirement to conduct a privacy impact assessment does not  apply to all systems. For example, no assessment is required when the  information collected relates to internal government operations, the  information has been previously assessed under an evaluation similar to a  privacy impact assessment, or when privacy issues are unchanged.  Nonetheless, OMB encourages agencies to conduct privacy impact  assessments on systems that contain personal information in identifiable  form about government personnel, when appropriate. In addition,  individual agencies have adopted policies that require assessments for all  systems, including those used for government operations.", "In June 2003, we reported on our assessment of agencies\u2019 compliance with  the Privacy Act and related OMB guidance. At that time, we determined  that the agencies\u2019 compliance was high in many areas, but uneven across  the federal government. Agency officials attributed the areas of  noncompliance in part to a need for more leadership and guidance from  OMB. In our report, we recommended that the Director, OMB, take a  number of steps aimed at improving agencies\u2019 compliance with the Privacy  Act, including overseeing and monitoring agencies\u2019 actions, assessing the  need for additional guidance to agencies, and raising agency awareness of  the importance of the act. In response, OMB established an Interagency  Privacy Committee to discuss privacy issues and issued updated guidance.  However, it has not addressed our other recommendations: to work with  agencies to ensure that they address the areas of noncompliance we  identified; institute a governmentwide effort to determine the level of  resources needed to fully implement the Privacy Act; and develop a plan to  address identified gaps in resources devoted to protecting privacy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data Mining Efforts Have a Variety of Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["The data mining efforts that we reviewed have a variety of purposes, uses,  and outputs.

The purchase card program is a  governmentwide program run by the General Services Administration  (GSA). Agencies like State use GSA\u2019s master contract to provide their  employees with charge cards from an approved vendor. Citibank, the  vendor chosen by State, provides its customers with a custom reporting  system, which includes several tools that can be used for managing card  accounts. State uses the system to analyze government charge card  spending patterns by its employees.

However, none  of these assessments adequately addressed all the statutory requirements.  Table 8 summarizes agency actions to assess the privacy impacts of their  data mining efforts.", "Three agencies conducted assessments that partially addressed the  requirements. For example, while RMA\u2019s plan addressed the information to  be collected and how it was to be used, it did not receive the required  review by the agency chief information officer or designee. In addition,  RMA\u2019s assessment was not made publicly available, even though the  document did not include any sensitive information. IRS\u2019s notice stated  that it would use the information for queries, but did not analyze the  purpose for collecting the information or its intended uses, as required. For  instance, IRS\u2019s privacy impact assessment states that the system \u201cis used to  identify potential criminal investigations of individuals or groups\u201d in  \u201csupport of the overall IRS mission.\u201d While this describes the purpose for  collecting the information and its intended uses, it does not analyze how  the agency reached these decisions. RMA and IRS did not fully address  these steps because they used a prior version of guidance that did not  address all the current requirements when conducting their assessments.  SBA conducted an assessment of a previous loan monitoring effort that  addressed several aspects of their current data mining effort. This  assessment included general descriptions of what information was to be  collected, why the information was to be collected, the intended use of the  information, and how the information was to be secured. However, the  assessment did not analyze these decisions, as required by OMB\u2019s guidance.  According to SBA officials, the privacy assessment was not more specific  because at the time it was completed, the possible uses of the system and  the format it would take were not certain. SBA officials added that a more  specific privacy assessment of the data mining effort has been drafted and  is expected to be published later in the current fiscal year.", "FBI has not conducted a privacy impact assessment for its data mining  effort. FBI is not required by statute to conduct assessments on these  systems because they are classified as national security systems. However,  under FBI regulations, assessments are required for these systems.  According to agency officials, FBI is in the process of preparing privacy  assessments for the two systems that make up its data mining effort, but  these assessments were delayed due to competing priorities for its  operational support team. The officials said that the agency does not have a  target date for completing the assessments.", "The lack of comprehensive assessments is a missed opportunity for  agencies to ensure that the data mining efforts we reviewed are subject to  the most appropriate privacy protections. Because the assessments did not  address all the required subjects, including those related to several Privacy  Act provisions, agencies were sometimes unaware that they were not  following all the requirements of the act. Further, without analyses  regarding their approaches to privacy protection, agencies have little  assurance that their approaches reflect the appropriate balance between  individual privacy rights and the operational needs of the government.", "GSA, the contracting agency for the governmentwide purchase card  program, did not conduct a privacy assessment because OMB guidance  does not require them for internal government programs.
