Security clearances may be suspended if DOE believes an employee may pose a threat to national defense and security. Because of concerns that the DOE security clearance program could adversely affect employees from minority groups, you asked us to review DOE\u2019s program for suspending security clearances. Specifically, you asked us to determine (1) if there are statistical disparities in the number of employees from racial/ethnic minorities whose clearances have been suspended at DOE\u2019s facilities and (2) what action DOE is taking to identify such statistical disparities. We reviewed DOE\u2019s suspensions of contractor employees\u2019 security clearances at DOE\u2019s Albuquerque, Savannah River, and Oak Ridge operations offices because contractors at these locations account for more than one-half of the employees holding security clearances.", "Although the number of security clearances suspended for any particular group is relatively small, statistical disparities can be identified with the appropriate test.

In the operation of these facilities, contractor employees may handle materials, documents, and information that are classified. An employee working in such an environment is investigated and granted a security clearance if one is warranted. To ensure that personnel with access to classified information do not compromise national defense and security, DOE\u2019s operations offices may suspend security clearances. A clearance may be suspended as a result of an employee\u2019s use of illegal drugs, alcohol abuse, mental illness, falsification of information on security statements, sabotage or treason, membership in an organization that advocates the overthrow of the government or association with people who are members of such organizations, failure to protect classified data, unusual conduct or dishonesty, and having relatives living in a country whose interests are hostile to those of the United States.", "Information leading to the suspension of an employee\u2019s clearance can come from many sources, including routine security reinvestigations, random drug testing, and allegations from other people. If DOE believes that national security could potentially be compromised, it begins a multilayered review process that can result in the suspension\u2014and ultimately revocation\u2014of an employee\u2019s security clearance. More than a year may pass before DOE makes a final determination. The employee is entitled to a formal hearing by a hearing officer and attorneys, a review of the hearing transcript by a personnel security review examiner, and a final resolution by the Security Affairs Director. DOE may also have an employee undergo a psychiatric evaluation to examine the employee\u2019s judgment or reliability if information reveals mental illness, alcohol abuse, or drug use.", "The facilities operated by DOE\u2019s Albuquerque, Savannah River, and Oak Ridge operations offices employ the Department\u2019s largest numbers of employees holding clearances\u2014more than 84,000.
