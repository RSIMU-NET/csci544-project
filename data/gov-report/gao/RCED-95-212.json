Our first report, issued in March 1994, discussed the program\u2019s implementation and progress after the first 2 years. Shortly after the issuance of our first report, the Congress decided not to fund TAPP beyond fiscal year 1995, its fourth year.", "This second and final report on TAPP discusses the status of the TAPP centers in the fourth and final year of federal funding as well as our observations on lessons learned during the pilot. We believe these observations could be beneficial if the Congress reconsiders such a program in the future. Details on our objectives, scope, and methodology; a summary of federal funding for TAPP; a discussion of evaluation concerns raised in our interim report; and detailed descriptions of each of the TAPP centers are included as appendixes to this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["TAPP was established originally by section 232 of the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-574). In October 1991, Congress repealed the earlier authorization in section 609 of Public Law 102-140 and replaced it with the current program. Intended from the start to be a pilot program, the law authorized funding for 4 years, not to exceed $5 million a year. In mid-1994, the Congress decided that it would not reauthorize TAPP beyond fiscal year 1995.", "TAPP was modeled after Minnesota Project Outreach, a state program that provided small businesses with access to computerized databases and technical experts. Services for Project Outreach were provided under contract by Teltech Resource Network Corporation (Teltech), a Minnesota-based, national supplier of technical and business knowledge. The Minnesota program was regarded as a success in providing user-friendly services to small businesses that would not otherwise have the means or the ability to obtain needed technical information. Its success provided the stimulus for the TAPP legislation.", "The law made three agencies responsible for administering TAPP. The Small Business Administration (SBA) was authorized to make grants to competing Small Business Development Centers (SBDC), which had to obtain matching contributions at least equal to the awards. SBA was to coordinate with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Technical Information Service in establishing and managing the program. According to NIST officials, only SBA and NIST took an active role in program administration because the National Technical Information Service is an agency whose primary role is to collect and disseminate scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information generated by other federal agencies and foreign sources. In early 1991, NIST and SBA signed a memorandum of understanding that resulted in NIST\u2019s implementing TAPP on behalf of and in close cooperation with SBA.", "SBA administers TAPP through its Office of Small Business Development Centers, which is responsible for setting policies, developing new approaches, monitoring compliance, and improving operations for the SBDCs. NIST manages and monitors TAPP through its Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), a network of organizations to help American manufacturers increase their competitiveness nationally and internationally through ongoing technological deployment.", "The SBDCs, which provide counseling and training to existing and prospective small businesses, were chosen as the local level through which TAPP services would be provided. As of July 1994, there were SBDCs and subcenters at 750 geographically dispersed locations nationwide, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Counselors at the SBDCs are knowledgeable in the needs of small businesses and are experienced in working with them.", "The first TAPP grants were made for fiscal year 1992 and went to SBDCs in Maryland, Missouri, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. Oregon dropped out of TAPP after fiscal year 1993 when it was not able to obtain matching funds; however, it has continued to operate without federal funding on a reduced scale. The remaining five centers continued to receive TAPP funds through fiscal year 1995. As shown in appendix II, federal grants to the six TAPP centers for the 4 years of the program totaled $3,537,000.", "While the centers have differed somewhat in the way they chose to deliver services, the basic model for each center is the same. First, the center offers its clients access to a variety of on-line databases. These databases cover technical areas such as product development, patents, and manufacturing processes as well as nontechnical areas, such as market research and vendor listings. Secondly, the center links the clients with experts who can provide specific assistance. Typically, services are provided for free or at a nominal charge and may be augmented by other SBDC programs and services. Appendixes IV through IX describe each of the current and former TAPP centers.", "In our first report on TAPP, we raised concerns about the evaluation methodology for measuring the program\u2019s impact.

While the centers differ in some important respects, in many ways they have become more nearly alike in the types of services offered and the methods of delivering them.", "SBA and NIST have not evaluated the impact on small business productivity and innovation either nationwide or within the individual states where TAPP centers were located. According to the limited responses to client satisfaction surveys, however, the businesses that used TAPP services were pleased with the services they received. Also, TAPP center officials were pleased with the way their individual programs had developed and provided examples of projects that had been successful.", "At the time of our review, each of the TAPP centers planned to continue its program beyond fiscal year 1995.

Overall, the five TAPP centers still in the pilot program served approximately 1,840 clients in fiscal year 1994, ranging from 230 in Missouri to 445 in Wisconsin. According to Nexus Associates, a NIST consultant, 59 percent were manufacturers, 21 percent were service companies, 14 percent were wholesale and retail companies, and 7 percent represented other segments of the small business community. Forty percent of the clients had not yet established a business, and another 26 percent were involved in new ventures. While there were some \u201crepeat\u201d clients, 89 percent undertook only one project during the period.", "The five centers responded to 2,843 information requests during fiscal year 1994, ranging from 283 in Missouri to 847 in Pennsylvania. According to Nexus Associates and as shown in table 1, these projects were evenly divided between technical and nontechnical information, although there were differences among the centers. A more detailed breakdown of the services showed an emphasis on product or process information and market research.", "Database searches, rather than the use of technical experts, represent the primary type of service provided by the TAPP centers.

Moreover, because NIST cancelled its plans for evaluating the program\u2019s impact after funding was discontinued, no such determination will likely be made. NIST continues to collect data on client satisfaction; however, the surveys are of limited value because of the low response rate. For example, in fiscal year 1994 the response rate of the clients surveyed ranged from a low of 9 percent in Pennsylvania to a high of 46 percent in Wisconsin.", "According to an analysis by Nexus Associates, those clients that did respond to the satisfaction survey for fiscal year 1994 indicated a high degree of satisfaction with TAPP services. The vast majority of those responding ranked the services they received as \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cexcellent\u201d and would recommend TAPP to other companies. Similarly, more than 90 percent of the respondents said that their requests for assistance received prompt attention. More than 80 percent said that the representatives who assisted them possessed the necessary skills.

The median value, according to the clients\u2019 estimates in their survey responses, ranged from $101 to $150 among the centers; however, 19 percent of the clients responding to the survey placed a value of more than $500 on the services they received. Those clients valuing the services at more than $500 tended to (1) be new businesses, (2) focus on expert searches rather than vendor searches, and (3) request market research information rather than management or vendor information.", "Two-thirds of the clients responding said that they were unlikely to have been able to obtain the information they received without TAPP. However, the level of satisfaction depended on the type of information requested. For example, while the majority of companies receiving patent information believed they could have received the information elsewhere, the majority of companies receiving management or vendor information believed it was unlikely they could have found this information elsewhere."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TAPP Center Officials Are Pleased With Their Progress", "paragraphs": ["Officials at the five centers still participating in TAPP told us they were satisfied with the programs they had developed and believed that they were providing valuable services to their client businesses.

As part of an overall action plan, the TAPP center conducted a search of the technology that predated the patent. The company resolved the issue and was able to continue to market its services to test for leaks from storage tanks. TAPP center personnel also referred the company to other SBDC personnel who were able to assist it in preparing three Small Business Innovation Research project proposals to SBA.", "A Wisconsin manufacturer risked losing a major customer because the liquid crystal displays it was making were breaking too easily. Through a literature search by the TAPP center, the manufacturer identified a number of new databases and obtained information that it subsequently incorporated into its product improvement process. The company believes that the information helped it save an account worth approximately $2 million over a 2-year period.", "A Maryland software company specializing in adaptive network systems wanted to expand into markets beyond the airline industry it originally had targeted. The TAPP center performed a literature search for firms that were purchasing or producing financial yield predictive software. The company was then able to identify and begin to market its products to two financial services companies that had advertised in trade journals their need to obtain revenue management tools.", "According to TAPP center officials, there was a learning curve associated with developing their individual programs. They provided the following examples of some of the factors with which they had to deal:", "Technology must be \u201cpulled by\u201d rather than \u201cpushed upon\u201d the clients.", "Unlike large corporations, small business owners typically have limited budgets, time, and expertise. Technology is of little benefit to them in the abstract and must have practical applications that can be adapted to the marketplace. Thus, technology is best integrated when a center can provide assistance throughout the various stages of a product\u2019s development or delivery.", "Promotion is essential because small business owners may not know that they need or can use the technology available. The centers must promote their services through such methods as advertisements in trade publications and seminars.", "A center\u2019s services must be integrated into those of the SBDC. One of the challenges facing the TAPP centers has been internal promotion (i.e., getting other SBDC staff\u2014whose focus has been toward business planning\u2014to see the advantages of TAPP\u2019s technical assistance services so that they can encourage small business owners to use them).", "Because officials at each of the five TAPP centers still in the program believed their services were a valuable addition to the types of assistance the SBDCs provide, they said they planned to continue them after federal funding ends in fiscal year 1995.

Thus, it is possible that the Congress may reconsider the need for similar types of federal programs in the future. If so, the lessons learned under the pilot program could be useful. From analyzing 4 years of TAPP funding and operations, we believe the following questions need to be considered prior to funding any future program:", "What are the program\u2019s specific objectives?", "Is a separate and distinct federal program necessary to achieve these objectives?", "How should the program be financed?"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives Need to Be Clear and Specific", "paragraphs": ["While the authorizing legislation stated an ultimate goal for TAPP\u2014increasing the innovativeness and competitiveness of small businesses through improved technology\u2014it did not specify what level of increase was desired or how results could be measured.

As noted in our earlier report, NIST was concerned that the services provided had too much of a marketing, rather than a technical, orientation and that many TAPP clients were small, local, retail businesses rather than technical or manufacturing concerns. NIST officials had hoped that, while there was no such requirement in the law, eventually 50 percent of the information provided by TAPP centers would be technical in nature.", "Taking a broader view of technology in the context of TAPP, SBDC officials said that an underlying objective always must be the continued viability of the firms seeking assistance. These officials maintain that it is important not just to disseminate pure technology but also to encourage all businesses to take advantage of whatever technical information is available. This may mean using TAPP databases to obtain marketing information heretofore unavailable to them.", "The issue seems to have resolved itself within the current program. Projects during fiscal year 1994 were evenly divided between technical and nontechnical information, according to Nexus Associates. NIST officials said they were pleased with the progress the centers had made toward giving TAPP a more technical focus."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Separate Federal Program May Not Be Necessary", "paragraphs": ["TAPP was not a new idea; technology assistance programs for small businesses have been available for some time. For example, both the Missouri and Pennsylvania SBDCs already had limited programs that were similar to TAPP in place when they received TAPP grants. Other states, such as New Mexico and North Carolina, have developed \u201ctechnical\u201d SBDCs on their own to promote and enhance technology transfer. Minnesota\u2019s Project Outreach, which was the model for TAPP, has never received federal funding. Teltech is a private company that has provided technical services under contract to other organizations\u2014including Project Outreach and TAPP centers\u2014on a fee-for-service basis.", "Generally, the SBDCs appear to agree that they should offer technical assistance to their clients and have begun to establish programs. In a 1991 survey of 56 state SBDC directors conducted by the Association of Small Business Development Centers, 42 directors (75 percent) said they were providing \u201cclient-assisted access to databases.\u201d About 60 percent of the SBDCs were providing this service themselves, while the rest were referring their clients to some other organization on an informal or contractual relationship.", "Eighty-eight percent of the SBDC directors responding to the survey said they were assisting clients in identifying experts who could respond to technical questions. However, only 23 percent of the SBDCs were providing this service on their own; the remainder referred clients to other organizations on an informal or contractual relationship.", "The survey respondents also noted that they had made a long-term commitment to technical assistance programs. Thirty-three states or areas planned to expand their technology transfer and/or development services, including enhanced access to technical databases. Thirty-six states made capital available for research and development, new product development, and access to technology.", "Technology assistance is also being provided to small businesses under federally sponsored programs other than those administered by the SBDCs. One example is the Manufacturing Technology Centers (MTC) NIST helped establish as a part of its MEP network. MTCs are regionally located and managed centers for transferring manufacturing technology to small and midsized manufacturing companies. MTCs use a wide variety of technology sources, including commercial firms, federal research and development laboratories, universities, and other research-oriented organizations. MTCs differ from the current TAPP centers in that they are regional in nature, focus solely on pure technology, serve only manufacturers, and work with the same clients on an ongoing basis. However, an MTC can provide the same services to a manufacturing client that a TAPP center can provide. In fact, Minnesota\u2019s Project Outreach, which was the model for TAPP, is now a part of an MTC in the state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Options May Be Available", "paragraphs": ["Federal appropriations for the TAPP program over its 4 years totaled $3.5 million\u2014far less than the $20 million authorized. As shown in appendix II, none of the centers received more than $200,000 in any one year. Actual budgets were larger, of course, because the law required matching funds.", "SBDC officials agreed with our observation that the TAPP funding allowed them to create and operate dedicated technology-assistance programs that might not have been possible otherwise. One advantage was that the funding covered the start-up costs of the centers. During the first 2 years of the program, there was a considerable learning curve as the centers established their programs, developed a service mix, and promoted themselves to potential users. Another advantage was that the funding allowed the centers to provide services at little or no cost to prospective clients. The SBDC officials believed that this gave the centers the capability to offer a wider range of services and to serve more businesses.", "The TAPP law envisioned technology-assistance centers within the SBDCs that eventually would be at least partially self-sustaining. For example, the law gave as one of the selection criteria \u201cthe ability of the applicant to continue providing technology access after the termination of this pilot program.\u201d The law also encouraged the TAPP centers to try to obtain funds from other federal and nonfederal sources. In practice, most of the support came from the TAPP funding itself, the SBDCs, the states, or the educational institutions with which the centers were affiliated.", "One option for funding a technology-assistance program is for the program to charge businesses a fee for the services they use. This is one reason the Oregon center has been able to operate after TAPP funding ended. During the program\u2019s first 2 years, the Oregon center received a total of $325,000 in TAPP funds plus matching state funds. Since the end of fiscal year 1993, however, the center has relied on donations and client fees to operate. Currently, clients are charged $30 an hour plus on-line expenses. According to Oregon center officials, clients pay an average of approximately $114 per search. During the TAPP years, client fees averaged about $10 per search.", "In 1994, fees totaled about $7,500, or 19 percent, of the Oregon center\u2019s budget of $40,000. Its director believed that, in some ways, the center improved after it began to be self-supporting because clients took them more seriously and were more cautious about the services they requested when they had to pay for them. At the same time, the Oregon center has had to scale down its operations now that it no longer receives federal grants and matching state funds.", "While Minnesota\u2019s Project Outreach receives the bulk of its funding from state appropriations, it also charges a fee for services. For example, \u201cclient companies,\u201d which can access services directly, must pay an annual fee based on sales as well as a fee for certain services. An expert consultation, literature search, or vendor search costs a client company $35 per use. There is no annual fee for \u201cpublic access users,\u201d who can obtain services through remote terminals across the state. However, there is a higher charge for services, such as $50 for a consultation, an interactive literature search, or a vendor search. In some cases, such as gaining access to certain information on the University of Minnesota\u2019s databases, there is no charge to either type of user.", "The five TAPP centers still receiving federal grants in fiscal year 1995 had not generated any significant revenues by charging fees for services. Generally, the services were either offered to clients for free or for a fee well below what they would have cost if purchased from a private vendor. This was intentional because the centers used their free and low-cost services to attract clients who might benefit from their technical assistance.

However, the states are not certain how the centers will be organized, what services will be provided, or where funding will be obtained.", "NIST officials are no longer concerned that the TAPP centers are focusing on marketing rather than technical services. Data from fiscal year 1994 indicate that about half the services being provided were of a technical nature, which is the ratio NIST envisioned at the program\u2019s inception. Moreover, 59 percent of the users were manufacturing companies. Generally, both the users and the SBDCs were pleased with the services being provided and the results achieved.", "Because the Congress has decided not to extend TAPP funding past fiscal year 1995, we identified no issues that need to be addressed on the current program. If the Congress decides to fund a program similar to TAPP in the future, it may wish to consider some of the lessons learned, or issues that emerged during the pilot program. These include (1) adding more specificity to the objectives and goals of the program; (2) determining whether a separate and distinct federal program is needed and, if so, what type of organization is best suited to manage it; and (3) deciding how the program should be funded, including charging user fees for the services provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["A draft of this report was sent to both SBA and the Department of Commerce for comment. In its written comments, SBA generally concurred with the findings and conclusions in our draft report. (See app. X.)

Specific issues related to Commerce\u2019s two concerns are discussed below.", "Commerce disagreed first with our characterization of the emphasis NIST placed on the technical orientation of the TAPP centers. For example, Commerce disagreed with our use of the term \u201cscientific information\u201d in describing the types of services NIST wanted to emphasize under TAPP and asked that we use the broader description \u201ctechnology and technical information.\u201d Commerce also said that NIST officials had never set a 50-percent goal for such services but rather had sought a \u201cbalance\u201d in technical and nontechnical services compared to marketing services.", "We agree with Commerce\u2019s clarification that NIST wanted a technical, and not just scientific, orientation for TAPP and have revised our report accordingly. We disagree, however, that NIST did not set a 50-percent goal for such services, as NIST and TAPP center officials discussed this goal with us during our work on both the interim and current reports.", "Secondly, Commerce believed the report mischaracterized NIST\u2019s evaluation efforts regarding TAPP. For example, Commerce disagreed that NIST had \u201ccancelled\u201d its evaluation plans, as we had noted in our report. Instead, Commerce asserted that NIST had revised its evaluation methodology. Commerce also said the report improperly characterized Nexus Associates as a NIST consultant on TAPP when Nexus actually was a subcontractor to the University of Houston\u2019s SBDC.", "Commerce also believed that the report did not elaborate sufficiently on the problems associated with evaluating TAPP. Commerce pointed out that there are no models that could be used to establish a clear correlation between the information provided by a TAPP center and increased productivity and innovation as well as other positive economic indicators. According to Commerce, the key determinant is not the information provided but what is done with that information. Developing proper models would require follow-up over a period of years with clients who are willing to share continuing and potentially sensitive feedback on how the information is being used and what changes it has generated in the clients\u2019 operations. Furthermore, Commerce said that we had previously agreed to fund and develop a survey that met our impact evaluation needs, as well as those of NIST and the TAPP centers.", "We disagree with Commerce\u2019s assertion that NIST did not cancel its evaluation plans for TAPP. The discussion of this issue in our report focused on the evaluation of program impact. While NIST has continued to evaluate the program by collecting data from client surveys, we do not believe that these surveys address program impact. We have clarified this issue in our report. We also disagree that we mischaracterized the role of Nexus Associates. While Nexus was funded through the University of Houston\u2019s SBDC, it performed analyses of programwide information, was referred to as a TAPP evaluation consultant by NIST officials, and presented its analyses to NIST.", "We agree with Commerce\u2019s comments on the problems inherent in evaluating TAPP. We made this point in the interim report when we stated that \u201cthe data needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the program are not yet available and may not be available for some time.\u201d We also stressed this point in November 1994 correspondence with the congressional committees when we agreed that the focus of this report should be on the lessons learned from TAPP. Contrary to Commerce\u2019s comments, we did not agree to fund and develop the survey instrument.", "As a third concern, Commerce said that the report needed to provide a better context for how the lessons learned under TAPP fit into the overall concept of technical assistance. Commerce believed that the most important question that we raised in considering future needs is whether a separate and distinct federal program, such as TAPP, is necessary. Commerce said that the types of services provided by TAPP are not \u201cstand-alone\u201d services and that they must be considered within the broader context of services available under MEP. While we agree with Commerce on this point, such an analysis was beyond the scope of this report.", "Finally Commerce questioned the report\u2019s characterization of MEP. Commerce noted that MEP supports American manufacturers nationally and internationally through ongoing technological deployment, not through technological development as stated in the report. Similarly, Commerce believed the report did not go far enough when it said that an MTC can provide the same types of services to manufacturers that a TAPP center could provide to SBDC clients. Commerce said that MEP\u2019s manufacturing extension center organizations, of which the MTC is one type, actually can provide more such services.", "We agree with Commerce\u2019s comments on the role of MEP and revised the report to say that MEP supports manufacturers through technological deployment. Also, we do not question that MEP may be able to provide more services to its clients than a TAPP center. We made no revisions to the report, however, as our point was to show that there are other organizations providing the same types of services as TAPP, rather than to compare the quality or quantity of the services provided.", "We conducted our work between August 1994 and June 1995 in accordance with generally accepted governmental auditing standards.

In March 1993, during the second year, NIST asked the centers to conduct a postcard survey similar to one used by the Maryland center. This survey asked clients using TAPP services (1) if they had received the information they needed, (2) if they had used the information for making business decisions, (3) what type of information was most useful, (4) if they would use the program in the absence of a subsidy, and (5) what prices they would consider paying for TAPP services. However, this attempt at evaluation had little effect because (1) only 60 clients were surveyed in Maryland and only 47 responded; (2) only three other centers conducted surveys; and (3) the other surveys did not ask the same questions, making comparisons among the centers impossible.", "As a part of the fiscal year 1994 proposal process, NIST encouraged the centers to develop a standard client evaluation methodology. This would include three survey questionnaires of clients. The first would be a questionnaire on client satisfaction that would be distributed to clients immediately after a service was provided. The second questionnaire would ask about the impact of the service 6 months later. The third would ask clients how the service had affected the client\u2019s competitive position in the market place a year after receiving the service.", "In our first report, we raised questions about the reliability of the data that would be obtained through the use of these questionnaires. We said that the questions were not clear or precise, did not make a connection between program impact and increased productivity, and failed to ask basic questions regarding client satisfaction with the program. We concluded that we had little confidence the questionnaires in their current form could be used to measure a center\u2019s effectiveness, particularly considering the anticipated low response rate.", "In response to our first report, the Secretary of Commerce informed us in May 1994 that NIST planned to change its approach with the evaluation questionnaires. The changes would consist of (1) improving the initial client-satisfaction questionnaire; (2) eliminating the other two questionnaires to reduce the burden on TAPP clients; (3) replacing the two questionnaires that were dropped with a new survey instrument that better suited the requirements of GAO, NIST, and the TAPP centers; and (4) developing an analytic report of the data already being generated by the program. TAPP funds would be used to hire a consultant to develop the analytic report.", "After learning that TAPP was not going to be funded past fiscal year 1995, NIST officials decided against pursuing most of the evaluation plans it had set out. Instead, the TAPP centers were instructed to use only the initial client-satisfaction questionnaire. Also, NIST provided the University of Houston with funding for a contract with Nexus Associates, Inc., to develop an analytic report using data the program generated. Nexus Associates already has prepared a presentation using statistics from reports the centers submitted and the results of the client evaluation survey for fiscal year 1994.

Seventy-three percent of these requests were of a technical nature.", "Legal (patents and/or regulations)", "WisTAP attributes the decline in information requests to two factors. First, WisTAP changed its reporting practices from 1993 to 1994. The 1993 figures represent projects. A solution to a project may require several database interactions, thus having an inflationary effect on the 1993 figures. Secondly, a database vendor offered unlimited and free usage for the first quarter of fiscal year 1993. According to WisTAP officials, WisTAP increased their use of the service for its clients during this period.", "WisTAP uses a client satisfaction survey to measure the effectiveness of its services. Each quarter, WisTAP mails the survey to clients that had received services during the previous quarter. The survey asks questions concerning the quality of the services, the perceived value of the information, and the likelihood of obtaining similar information elsewhere.", "The response rate for the fiscal year 1994 client satisfaction survey was 46 percent. Eighty-eight percent of the respondents rated the overall quality of the information provided as good to excellent. Sixty-four percent rated their ability to access the information without WisTAP from somewhat unlikely to extremely unlikely. Sixty-two percent rated the financial value of the information received at more than $100.", "The Wisconsin SBDC plans to offer its clients WisTAP services after federal funding ends in 1995; however, the level of service will probably be cut in half. To prepare for the end of federal funding for TAPP, the Wisconsin SBDC has been focusing on developing relationships with new and existing network partners. For example, WisTAP has developed relationships with the staff of several University of Wisconsin technical and engineering departments. SBDC officials hope that, as more network partners gain experience working with small businesses, technical information will be accessible independent of WisTAP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Description of TAPP Center in Oregon", "paragraphs": ["The Oregon SBDC participated in TAPP during fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Through a contract agreement with the Oregon Innovation Center (OIC), the SBDC offered small business clients both on-line and off-line services in the form of literature searches, patent searches, expert consultations, and document location. Because of the loss of matching state funds for fiscal year 1994, the Oregon SBDC dropped out of TAPP. The OIC, however, has continued to provide TAPP-like services in the absence of state and federal financial support.", "The current program is managed and operated by the OIC, which assists businesses in accessing technical information. The OIC continues to offer TAPP-like services to its own clients and clients referred to them by the SBDCs, government agencies, and industry associations.", "The OIC serves primarily small manufacturers and technology-oriented service companies. OIC services are not limited to Oregon businesses; however, the majority of OIC clients are located in Oregon. When part of TAPP, the OIC informed potential clients of its services through SBDC marketing efforts, including seminars, pamphlets, and media publications. Now that the OIC is no longer directly affiliated with the SBDC, all marketing efforts have been eliminated because of funding constraints. The OIC relies entirely on word-of-mouth to attract new clients.", "One information specialist at the OIC devotes three-fourths time to the program. Staff of the SBDCs, state economic development agencies, and industry associations also assist by informing clients of OIC services through their own counseling activities. Because the OIC no longer participates in TAPP, it receives fewer referrals from the SBDCs. However, the clients that contact the OIC are more likely to represent technology-oriented industries, according to OIC officials.", "The OIC provides a range of business services including the development of marketing plans and information research. OIC clients have access to hundreds of on-line and off-line databases, including Dialog, Data-Star, CompuServe, Orbit, NASA, and the Federal Register. At the beginning of the program, OIC also provided access to Teltech. However, because of high costs and low demand to access Teltech experts, the OIC did not renew Teltech\u2019s contract in July 1993.", "The OIC serves its clients primarily through remote database searches. Upon receipt of a request, the information specialist conducts the search and sends the results to the client. OIC staff rarely meet face-to-face with the client. Nearly all services are provided via telephone, facsimile machine, or computer. According to an OIC information specialist, the OIC has also developed the ability to conduct real-time, screen-to-screen searching. Also, client access is offered through a menu-driven bulletin board system.", "The OIC received $325,000 in federal funding during the 2 years it was in the program. This included $200,000 in fiscal year 1992 and $125,000 in fiscal year 1993. The OIC also received state matching funds for each of these years, resulting in a total state and federal funding of $650,000 over the life of the program. The OIC has not received any state or federal funding since the end of fiscal year 1993.", "In the spring of 1996, the OIC will occupy a new facility to be constructed as a joint project with the Central Oregon Community College. This project will be funded by the OIC\u2019s state economic development appropriation that was committed in 1992. The OIC currently relies on donations and client fees to operate. According to OIC officials, client fees averaged $114 per search during 1994. During the TAPP years, clients were charged only about $10 per search although the total cost of the searches averaged $161.", "As shown in table IX.1, the OIC\u2019s client base was dominated by manufacturing and service concerns in fiscal years 1993 and 1994. In 1994, service and manufacturing businesses accounted for 73 percent of the clients served overall. Because of increased client fees and the elimination of marketing outreach efforts, the number of clients served declined sharply\u2014from 191 to 33\u2014between 1993 and 1994.", "As shown in table IX.2, the OIC responded to a total of 99 information requests during fiscal year 1994\u2014the first year in which the OIC did not participate in TAPP. This figure represents a decrease of 79 percent from fiscal year 1993. Twenty-three percent of these projects were of a technical nature.", "Legal (patents and/or regulations)", "During fiscal year 1993, the OIC conducted three focus group sessions in various locations to determine the informational needs of small businesses. Questions were asked to determine what types of information were the most difficult for small businesses to obtain, what sources small businesses typically use to obtain information, and what improvements they would suggest to provide them with business information. A recurring response from the participants was that marketing information was a primary concern and difficult to obtain. The OIC used the focus group results to gain a better understanding of the information needs of businesses.", "The OIC plans to continue providing TAPP-like services on a cost-recovery basis as it has been since the end of fiscal year 1993. The OIC hopes to supplement its budget through corporate donations. MCI Telecommunications Corporation, for example, recently donated $10,000 to the OIC. OIC officials said that a self-sufficient program has some advantages. One of these is that because a client makes a larger investment, it is more serious about its request for assistance. Also, the OIC has been able to provide services beyond the small business community, which has both expanded services and generated more funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division", "paragraphs": ["John P.
