Over the lifetime of AGOA, 13 countries have lost AGOA eligibility, although 7 eventually had it restored (see figure). To encourage reforms, the U.S. government will engage with countries experiencing difficulty meeting eligibility criteria and may specify measures a country can take.

However, Swaziland did not make the necessary reforms and lost eligibility effective in January 2015.", "GAO analyzed data on economic development indicators for sub-Saharan African countries that were eligible and ineligible for AGOA in 2012; the results showed that eligible countries fared better than ineligible countries on some economic measures since the enactment of AGOA. The extent to which this outcome is attributable to AGOA, however, is difficult to isolate after additional factors are taken into consideration. Other factors, such as the small share of AGOA exports in the overall exports of many AGOA-eligible countries, the role of petroleum exports in recent income growth, the quality of government institutions, and differences in levels of foreign aid and investment, make it difficult to isolate AGOA's contribution to overall economic development. For example, AGOA exports are a small share of overall exports for the majority of AGOA-eligible countries. GAO found evidence that increasing energy prices may also have contributed to income growth within AGOA-eligible petroleum-exporting countries. GAO also found that AGOA-eligible countries on average had higher governance scores and received more foreign aid and investment compared with ineligible countries.

Subcommittee agencies  frequently provide in-depth information related to the AGOA eligibility  criteria that are most pertinent to their specific mission but may also  provide input related to other eligibility criteria. For example, while the  Department of Labor\u2019s reports primarily focus on labor issues, its reports  on each country may also include information related to other eligibility  criteria, such as human rights and the rule of law.

The  duration of this phase varies depending on how quickly the agencies can  reach consensus. Any differences in perspective regarding countries\u2019  progress are discussed and consensus-based recommendations are  reached.

The United States allocated an  estimated $7.04 billion in U.S. bilateral aid to Africa in fiscal year 2014.  The aid was intended to help SSA countries in areas including health;  climate change; food security; and, more recently, power. From 2000 to  2012, AGOA-eligible countries received more than twice as much aid per  person on average than ineligible countries (see fig. 9).", "AGOA-eligible countries on average also received more FDI than  ineligible countries. According to a 2014 U.S. International Trade  Commission report, global inflows from FDI into SSA countries increased  almost sixfold between 2000 and 2012. We analyzed FDI as a share of  a country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) to take into consideration the  size of the country\u2019s economy. From 2001 to 2013, the amount of FDI  each SSA country received relative to the size of its overall economy  varied considerably. For example, among SSA countries that were net  recipients of FDI in 2013, Burundi received FDI amounting to less than  half a percent of its GDP (the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa), while Liberia  received FDI amounting to about 57 percent of its GDP (the highest in  sub-Saharan Africa). From 2001 through 2013, AGOA-eligible countries  received FDI that on average amounted to about 5.6 percent of GDP,  while ineligible countries averaged about 2.7 percent. (See fig. 10.)", "Being eligible for AGOA may help a country attract aid and investment.  For example, AGOA eligibility can be seen as a signal of a relatively  stable political environment as well as advantages in tariff treatment for  certain products. According to a recent report by the U.S. International  Trade Commission, AGOA has signaled improvements in the business  and investment climate in SSA countries, and has contributed to  increasing FDI flows to these countries. Additionally, the International  Monetary Fund reported in June 2014 that in Swaziland uncertain  prospects for AGOA eligibility could affect investment and employment in  the textile sector. Similarly, Ethiopian government officials in the Ministry  of Trade said that AGOA has helped to attract foreign direct investment to  Ethiopia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AGOA\u2019s Impact on Economic Development Is Difficult to Isolate", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of factors contributing to economic development in SSA  countries and review of academic literature suggest that isolating AGOA\u2019s  impact on overall economic development is difficult.

For example, our review of academic literature  indicated that increased FDI could enhance countries\u2019 economic growth,  and our analysis demonstrated that on average AGOA-eligible countries  receive more FDI inflows relative to the size of their economies."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making any recommendations in this report.

We analyzed the AGOA eligibility status of SSA  countries and the implementation of AGOA Forum activities since  AGOA\u2019s original enactment to identify changes in eligibility from 2000  through January 2015. We also attended and observed 2014 AGOA  Forum events.", "To address both objectives, we interviewed officials from the Departments  of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State, and the Treasury; the U.S.  Agency for International Development; and the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR), all of which are the members of the Trade Policy  Staff Committee\u2019s AGOA Implementation Subcommittee that generally  prepare the sub-Saharan Africa country reports for the annual eligibility  review.", "To examine the relationship between AGOA eligibility and economic  development in sub-Saharan Africa, we analyzed data on gross domestic  product (GDP) per capita and total population from the World Bank World  Development Indicators. We used data from the April 2014 version of the  World Development Indicators. We compared population-weighted  average GDP per capita at the end of 2012 for AGOA-eligible countries  versus ineligible countries, as well as for the top three AGOA-eligible  petroleum exporting countries versus other AGOA-eligible countries. We  also compared average annual growth rates in annual income per person  from 2000 to 2012 for AGOA-eligible versus ineligible countries, as well  as for the top three AGOA-eligible petroleum exporting countries versus  other AGOA-eligible countries. To study sub-Saharan African countries\u2019  exports under AGOA as a share of total exports as well as the value of  petroleum exports to the United States under AGOA, we used U.S.  Census trade data on imports by trading partners and imports by product  from 2013. We used data on countries\u2019 total exports from the International  Monetary Fund\u2019s Direction of Trade Statistics and International Financial  Statistics databases. We calculated AGOA-eligible countries\u2019 shares of  AGOA and Generalized System of Preference (GSP) exports in their  overall exports to study how the value of exports under these trade  preference systems compared with the value of overall exports for AGOA- eligible countries in 2013. To study differences in the quality of  governance institutions between AGOA-eligible and ineligible countries,  we analyzed data on governance from the World Bank Worldwide  Governance Indicators, comparing average scores for Political Stability  and Rule of Law in 2000 and 2012 between AGOA-eligible and ineligible  countries. To describe the differences in the amount of foreign  development assistance and foreign direct investment received by  AGOA-eligible and ineligible countries, we used data on country  programmable aid from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) and foreign direct investment (FDI) as a  percentage of GDP from the World Development Indicators. We  compared yearly averages of aid per capita (from 2000 to 2012) and net  FDI inflows as a percentage of GDP (from 2001 to 2013) between AGOA- eligible and ineligible countries. To assess the reliability of these data, we  reviewed publicly available documents on these databases and  conducted electronic testing for missing values and outliers. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also reviewed a judgmental sample of peer-reviewed academic literature  related to economic development, foreign direct investment, foreign aid,  and the impact of trade preference programs.", "Country classifications. For most of the analysis, we defined AGOA- eligible countries as the 40 SSA countries that were deemed eligible for  AGOA benefits as of the end of 2012. Nine SSA countries were ineligible  for AGOA benefits as of the end of 2012. We chose 2012 as the base  year for this classification because it was the latest year for which data on  GDP per capita were available for the SSA countries in the April 2014  version of the World Bank World Development Indicators. The only  exception is that for the analysis of the exports under AGOA as a share of  total exports from AGOA-eligible countries, we defined AGOA-eligible  countries as the 39 countries that were deemed eligible for AGOA  benefits as of 2013 because we analyzed 2013 trade statistics.", "GDP per capita. To study differences and depict trends in income per  person between selected groupings of countries, we used the World  Development Indicators annual GDP per capita series, expressed in year  2005 U.S. dollars. Thirty-seven out of 40 countries eligible for AGOA  benefits in 2012, and 8 out of 9 ineligible countries, reported complete  GDP per capita data from 2000 and through 2012. Djibouti, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9  and Principe, and South Sudan were excluded from the AGOA-eligible  group because of missing data. Somalia was excluded from the ineligible  group due to missing data. Within each country grouping, we took the  weighted average of countries\u2019 GDP per capita, where the weights are  given by the share of a country\u2019s population in the overall group\u2019s  population. The weighted average GDP per capita is a measure of the  yearly income of the average individual in the country group. Equation (1)  shows that the weighted average GDP per capita is equivalent to  summing up the GDP of every country in the group and dividing by the  total group population:  Where \ud835\udc5b denotes the number of countries in the group, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56 refers to gross  domestic product of country i, and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56 refers to the population of country i. (1)", "AGOA export share. To examine the magnitude of AGOA exports  relative to the total exports of each AGOA-eligible country, we used U.S.  Census data on imports by trading partners. We calculated the value of  imports under AGOA (i.e., imports that received duty-free access claiming  AGOA preference benefits) and imports that received duty-free access  under GSP. Since AGOA was established as a program for SSA  countries that builds on GSP, we analyzed exports from AGOA-eligible  countries to the United States under both programs together. AGOA  countries continue to have duty-free access to the commodities covered  under the GSP although that program expired in 2013. We computed the  AGOA (including GSP) share of exports relative to total exports for each  AGOA-eligible country in 2013, and graphically tabulated countries  according to their AGOA export share. In this analysis, both the exports  data and the definition of AGOA eligibility are from 2013. We used data  from two International Monetary Fund databases, Direction of Trade and  International Financial Statistics, to determine total exports for each  country.", "Top three AGOA-eligible petroleum exporters. The top three AGOA- eligible petroleum exporters were Nigeria, Angola, and Chad, which  collectively accounted for 90 percent of all petroleum exports to the U.S.  under AGOA in 2013, based on U.S. Census data on AGOA imports by  product. Since AGOA was established as a program for SSA countries  that builds on GSP, the 90 percent statistic refers to exports of petroleum  from AGOA-eligible countries to the United States under both programs  together. AGOA countries continue to have duty-free access to the  commodities covered under the GSP although that program expired in  2013. AGOA-eligible countries minus the top petroleum exporters refer to  the remaining 34 AGOA-eligible countries.", "Governance. To examine differences in the quality of governance (also  known as \u201cinstitutions\u201d) between AGOA-eligible and ineligible countries,  we reviewed a judgmental sample of empirical academic literature that  provided evidence that property rights and political stability can promote  economic growth. We judgmentally identified two measures of  institutional quality from the Worldwide Governance Indicators that may  capture aspects of the security of private property, namely scores for the  rule of law and political stability. We compared the simple average of  scores in 2000 and 2012 for AGOA-eligible countries versus ineligible  countries. We rescaled the indicators to range from 0 to 5, with higher  scores indicating better perceptions of governance.", "Aid and foreign direct investment. To examine differences in the  amount of development assistance received by AGOA-eligible versus  ineligible countries, we used annual data from the OECD on country  programmable aid. According to the OECD, country programmable aid  (CPA) is the proportion of aid that is subjected to multiyear programming  at the country level, and hence represents a subset of official  development assistance (ODA) flows. CPA is equivalent to gross ODA  disbursements by recipient but excludes spending that is (1) inherently  unpredictable (humanitarian aid and debt relief); or (2) entails no flows to  the recipient country (administration costs, student costs, development  awareness and research, and refugee spending in donor countries); or (3)  is usually not discussed between the main donor agency and recipient  governments (food aid, aid from local governments, core funding to  nongovernmental organizations, aid through secondary agencies, ODA  equity investments, and aid that is not allocable by country). CPA counts  loan repayments among the aid transferred from donor countries to  developing countries. We represented country programmable aid in per  person units by dividing the program aid total by the total population of  the country. Data on population were from the World Development  Indicators. We computed the simple average of aid per person in each  year from 2005 to 2012 for AGOA-eligible countries and AGOA ineligible  countries.", "To examine differences in the amount of foreign direct investment  received by AGOA-eligible versus ineligible countries, we used annual  data on net inflows of foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP  from the World Bank World Development Indicators. We computed the  simple average of these series in each year from 2001 to 2013 for AGOA- eligible countries and AGOA ineligible countries. In using the FDI data,  we checked for outliers and missing values and identified Equatorial  Guinea as an outlier based on comparisons with data from other sources;  values for Equatorial Guinea\u2019s net FDI inflows as a percentage of GDP  were omitted from the calculation of the average.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 to February 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
