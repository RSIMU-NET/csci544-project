In January 2009, HHS awarded a contract to the National Quality Forum (NQF), a nonprofit organization that endorses health care quality measures\u0097that is, recognizes certain ones as national standards. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established additional duties for NQF. This is the second of two reports MIPPA required GAO to submit on NQF\u0092s contract with HHS. In this report\u0097which covers NQF\u0092s performance under the contract from January 14, 2010, through August 31, 2011\u0097GAO examines (1) the status of projects under NQF\u0092s required contract activities and (2) the extent to which HHS used or planned to use the measures it has received from NQF under the contract to meet its quality measurement needs, as of August 2011. GAO interviewed NQF and HHS officials, reviewed relevant laws, and reviewed HHS and NQF documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NQF has made progress on projects under its contract activities, as of August 2011. Specifically, NQF has completed or made progress on 60 of 63 projects. For example, NQF has completed projects to endorse measures related to various topics, including nursing homes. However, for more than half of the projects, NQF did not meet or did not expect to meet the initial time frames approved by HHS. For example, NQF completed one project to retool measures\u0097that is, convert previously endorsed quality measures to an electronic format. While the retooling project was expected to be completed by September 2010, its completion was delayed by 3 months. NQF and HHS officials identified various reasons that contributed to this delay, including an expansion of the project\u0092s scope and complexity. As a result of the delay, HHS did not have all the retooled measures it expected to include in its Electronic Health Records (EHR) Incentive Program. The delay of this project was also a contributing factor to NQF exceeding its estimated cost for its entire contract activity related to EHR by about $560,000 in the second contract year\u0097 January 14, 2010, through January 13, 2011. While HHS monitored NQF\u0092s progress through monthly progress reports and approved changes to time frames and costs, HHS did not use all of the tools for monitoring that are required under the contract. Specifically, HHS did not conduct an annual performance evaluation to assess timeliness and cost issues that could have helped to inform NQF\u0092s future scope of work. Until August 2011, HHS did not enforce the provision for NQF to submit a financial graph to compare monthly costs for each contract activity with cost estimates, which is information not included in monthly progress reports. These tools could have provided additional, more detailed information to help identify instances in which NQF might have been at risk of not meeting time frames or exceeding cost estimates, which could have provided HHS an opportunity to make any appropriate changes to NQF\u0092s activities.", "HHS had used or planned to use about half of the measures\u0097164 of 344\u0097that it received from NQF under the contract, as of August 2011. For example, HHS used 44 measures that NQF retooled under the contract in its EHR Incentive Program. HHS officials stated that the 44 measures used in the program contained errors, which required corrections. HHS officials also have not yet tested the retooled measures to assess the feasibility of implementing them in the electronic format; therefore, HHS runs the risk that some of these measures may not work as intended when implemented. HHS officials told GAO they expect to evaluate if and how they could use all of the remaining measures HHS received under the contract. However, HHS has not determined how PPACA requirements for quality measurement may have changed its needs for endorsed quality measures. As a result, HHS has not established a comprehensive plan that identifies its measurement needs and time frames for obtaining endorsed measures and that accounts for relevant PPACA requirements. Without such a plan, HHS may be limited in its efforts to prioritize which specific measures it needs to develop and to have endorsed by NQF during the remainder of the NQF contract. As a result, HHS may be unable to ensure that the agency receives the quality measures needed to meet PPACA requirements, including time frames for implementing quality measurement programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends HHS: (1) use all monitoring tools required under the contract to help address NQF\u0092s performance, (2) complete testing of retooled measures, and (3) comprehensively plan for its quality measurement needs. HHS neither agreed nor disagreed with these recommendations. NQF concurred with many of the findings in the report and provided additional context."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation\u2019s health care spending was about $2.5 trillion in 2009. Health  care spending has been increasing in recent years by an average of  nearly 7 percent per year since 2000, and is projected to reach over   $4.5 trillion by 2020. However, higher levels of spending, such as  spending more to increase the number or technical complexity of  treatments, do not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in the  quality of care. To better align quality and health care spending, the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has developed various  programs and initiatives to measure health care quality and to provide  financial incentives to health care providers to improve quality and to  reduce the use of unnecessary and costly services. These programs and  initiatives include, for example, pay-for-performance programs that rely on  information collected on various health care quality measures. Health  care quality measures are used to evaluate how health care is delivered,  and information obtained from such measures can promote accountability  among health care providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act (PPACA), enacted in March 2010, directed HHS to expand its current  programs and initiatives, such as pay-for-performance programs, and to  implement new ones that will use health care quality measures. PPACA  establishes specific time frames for HHS to implement these programs  and initiatives that rely on various health care quality measures over the  next several years. For example, PPACA requires HHS to establish a  hospital value-based purchasing program. HHS estimates that in fiscal  year 2013 its Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program will provide  $850 million in Medicare incentive payments to hospitals that meet certain  performance measures. Additionally, HHS is required under PPACA to  establish value-based payments for physicians, develop a plan for value- based purchasing programs for skilled nursing home facilities and home  health agencies, and create pilot programs that test the implementation of  a value-based purchasing program for other providers\u2014psychiatric, long- term care, inpatient rehabilitation, and cancer hospitals as well as hospice  programs.", "For many of HHS\u2019s health care quality measurement programs and  initiatives, HHS is required to give consideration to the quality measures  endorsed by a consensus-based entity, such as the National Quality  Forum (NQF). NQF is the entity in the United States with the lead  responsibility for endorsing health care quality measures\u2014that is,  determining which measures should be recognized as national standards.  The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008  (MIPPA) directed the agency to enter into a 4-year contract with an entity  to endorse health care quality measures and conduct other activities, and  HHS contracted with NQF in January 2009. NQF is a nonprofit organization established in 1999 in order to foster agreement on national  standards for measurement and public reporting of health care  performance data. MIPPA provided $10 million per year for each of fiscal  years 2009 through 2012\u2014$40 million in total\u2014from the Medicare Trust  Funds for this 4-year contract, which covers the period from January 14,  2009, through January 13, 2013. PPACA provided an additional   $100 million\u2014$20 million per year for each of fiscal years 2010 through  2014\u2014for additional health care quality measurement work to be  conducted by NQF and HHS through fiscal year 2014. Because PPACA  does not specify the proportion of this amount for NQF activities, HHS  officials told us that they plan to obligate approximately $10 million per  year for the NQF contract, beginning in 2011, and that they may extend  the contract through fiscal year 2014.", "MIPPA also directed us to submit two reports on the performance of and  costs incurred by NQF under its 4-year contract with HHS. 2010, we issued the first report, which contained information about NQF\u2019s  performance and costs during the first contract year, which began  January 14, 2009, and ended January 13, 2010. This second report  covers NQF\u2019s performance and costs for the second contract year\u2014 January 14, 2010, through January 13, 2011\u2014and part of the third  contract year\u2014January 14, 2011, through August 31, 2011. Specifically,  this report examines (1) the status of projects under the activities NQF is  required to complete under its contract with HHS, (2) the costs and fixed  fees NQF reported under the contract from January 2010 through August  2011, and (3) the extent to which HHS used or planned to use the  measures it receives from NQF under the contract to meet its quality  measurement needs, as of August 31, 2011. In addition, appendix I of this  report provides information about a framework for the various stages of a  health care quality measure, including measure endorsement, as  described by HHS and NQF officials and others.", "MIPPA states that GAO\u2019s reports shall be submitted no later than 18 months and   36 months, respectively, after the effective date of the contract. contract activities in response to MIPPA, NQF\u2019s 2011 technical proposal  for the contract activities in response to PPACA, and NQF\u2019s monthly  progress and monthly internal evaluation plan reports that NQF is  required to submit to HHS. For purposes of our work, we categorized  the 16 tasks that NQF is required to perform under the contract from  January 2010 through August 2011 into 9 contract activities. (See app. II  for more detailed information on how we categorized these contract  activities.) In addition, we identified the various projects NQF is required  to perform under the 9 contract activities we identified. Specifically, for the  purposes of our work, we identified 63 projects NQF is required to  perform under the 9 contract activities, as shown in appendix III. We then  compared the information we obtained from NQF on its progress on the  63 projects under the 9 activities to the requirements for NQF\u2019s  performance under the contract with HHS and the expected time frames  and cost estimates initially established by HHS and NQF in the final  annual MIPPA work plans and other NQF documents for completing the  work. We also interviewed NQF officials responsible for implementing the  contract and HHS officials responsible for managing the contract and  overseeing NQF\u2019s performance. We also compared evidence from HHS  and NQF documents with evidence from discussions with HHS and NQF  officials to corroborate any issues or challenges with NQF\u2019s performance.  Based on our comparison and interviews with officials, we identified any  changes to the work NQF is required to perform and changes to the time  frames or cost estimates established in the final work plans developed  annually to respond to MIPPA and a budget developed as part of NQF\u2019s  technical proposal to respond to PPACA.", "To assess the costs and fixed fees NQF reported under the contract from  January 2010 through August 2011, we reviewed NQF documents that  include financial information related to the contract, such as NQF\u2019s final  work plans developed in 2010 and 2011 to respond to MIPPA and a  budget developed as part of NQF\u2019s technical proposal to respond to  PPACA that describe NQF\u2019s estimated costs for each of the nine activities  we identified under the contract. We obtained and summarized  information from NQF monthly invoices submitted to HHS from January  14, 2010, through August 31, 2011, for direct and indirect costs  incurred by NQF under the contract and fixed fees. We compared  NQF\u2019s reported costs with its cost estimates for the activities in NQF\u2019s  2010 final annual work plan and determined whether or to what extent  NQF\u2019s reported costs exceeded its cost estimates. We did not assess the  accuracy of NQF\u2019s reported costs. We also reviewed the HHS contract  with NQF and any contract modification since January 14, 2010. We also  interviewed NQF and HHS officials responsible for reviewing and  approving the costs and fixed fees submitted under the contract. Based  on our review of documents and interviews with NQF and HHS officials,  we determined that the reported costs and fixed-fee data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To examine the extent to which HHS used or planned to use measures it  receives from NQF under the contract to meet its quality measurement  needs, as of August 2011, we reviewed statutory requirements and  documents related to HHS health care quality measurement efforts. We  relied on HHS to identify programs and initiatives that use or will use  health care quality measures, such as programs or initiatives established  by MIPPA, PPACA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic  and Clinical Health Act. As a result, the health care quality programs  and initiatives mentioned in our report may not represent a  comprehensive list of all those that use or plan to use measures received  from NQF under the contract. We interviewed officials from various  divisions within HHS that may use measures that were nationally  recognized\u2014or NQF-endorsed\u2014in their various programs and initiatives  related to health care quality measurement in order to corroborate the  information we obtained from documentation. We obtained information  about how HHS selects measures for its programs and initiatives from our  interviews with HHS officials and reviews of HHS documents.

NQF\u2019s  mission focuses on three core areas: (1) building consensus on national  priorities and goals for performance improvement and working in  partnership to achieve them, (2) endorsing national consensus standards  for measuring and publicly reporting on performance, and (3) promoting  the attainment of national goals through education and outreach  programs.", "Its membership includes  Prior to its contract with HHS, NQF established a consensus development  process (CDP) to evaluate available health care quality measures to  determine which ones are qualified to be endorsed\u2014that is, recognized\u2014 as national standards. Under this process, organizations that develop  quality measures submit them to NQF for consideration, in response to  specific solicitations by NQF. NQF forms a committee of experts from its  member organizations as well as other organizations and agencies to  conduct an objective and transparent review of these quality measures  against four standardized criteria established by NQF, such as whether  the measures are scientifically acceptable. After this committee  evaluates the measures against these criteria, NQF\u2019s process allows for a  period during which its member organizations and the public may  comment on the committee\u2019s recommendation for each measure. The  process also provides for a period for its member organizations to vote on  whether the measures should be endorsed by NQF as a national  standard.

The work plans developed annually to respond to MIPPA  and NQF\u2019s technical proposal to respond to PPACA delineate the projects  NQF is required to conduct under the nine contract activities, as well as  expected time frames and cost estimates for the projects for each year.  Table 1 provides more detailed information on the nine contract activities.  Some of these activities are required by either MIPPA or PPACA, while  others are quality measurement activities established by HHS or  administrative activities.", "To help determine the activities and the projects under the nine contract  activities that NQF is expected to perform during each contract year, HHS  has established an interagency workgroup that comprises officials from  multiple divisions within HHS, including the Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information  Technology. The workgroup is responsible for prioritizing and selecting  the activities and projects under each activity that NQF is expected to  perform during each contract year.

The activities and  projects selected by the interagency workgroup become part of NQF\u2019s  scope of work under the contract. Some of the projects under the  contract activities that NQF is expected to perform during the year will be  ongoing from the previous contract year while new work will be  incorporated into the work plan as necessary.", "For the NQF contract, HHS selected a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, under  which HHS reimburses NQF for actual costs incurred under the contract  in addition to a fixed fee that is unrelated to costs. Cost-plus-fixed-fee  contracts are used for efforts such as research, design, or study efforts  where costs and technical uncertainties exist and it is desirable to retain  as much flexibility as possible in order to accommodate change.  However, this type of contract provides only a minimum incentive to the  contractor to control costs. As we reported in 2009, these contracts are  suitable when the cost of work to be done is difficult to estimate and the  level of effort required is unknown. This cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is  NQF\u2019s first cost-reimbursement contract. For cost-reimbursement  contracts, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires  appropriate government surveillance during performance to provide  reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls  are used. Under the FAR, contracts are to contain a provision for agency  approval of a contractor\u2019s subcontracts. HHS\u2019s contract with NQF  contains this provision and also requires the approval of consultants  engaged under the contract.

NQF has made progress on three projects related  to retooling\u2014that is, converting previously endorsed quality measures  to an electronic format that is compatible with electronic health  records (EHR). First, NQF completed initial retooling of 113  measures. This work is intended to allow data from EHRs to be used  for quality measurement, which is a part of HHS\u2019s long-term goal to  use health information technology to exchange information and  improve quality of care. Second, as of August 2011, NQF convened  an expert review panel to review the retooled measures to ensure that  each retooled measure is properly formatted, the logic is correctly  stated, and the intent of the measures is maintained in the electronic  format that will use data obtained from EHRs, instead of from claims  as originally formatted. Third, as of August 2011, NQF was expected  to complete another project to provide an updated list of the 113  retooled measures to HHS by December 2011, which would  incorporate any revisions identified by the expert review panel and  others involved in the retooling process. After these updated  measures are completed, HHS officials told us that they will contract  with other entities to conduct testing of some of the 113 retooled  measures to assess the feasibility of implementing the measures in  the electronic format. Although NQF\u2019s endorsement process requires  that measure developers submit data on validity and reliability testing  of measures they submit for endorsement, this testing does not  include feasibility testing for implementing the measures in an  electronic format for performance measurement. As of December  2011, HHS officials did not provide an expected date of completion for  this feasibility testing but told us that they have awarded two contracts  that include this in their scope of work. In addition to the retooling  projects, NQF is developing a software tool\u2014the Measure Authoring  Tool\u2014to allow measure developers to create standardized electronic  measures that help capture information in EHRs so that less retooling  would be needed in the future.

In addition, NQF was expected to complete the project to convene an  expert panel to review the 113 retooled measures by January 2011.  However, the panel did not complete its review of the 113 measures  until June 2011.", "According to HHS and NQF officials, several factors contributed to  NQF exceeding expected time frames for the retooling project under  the EHR contract activity. HHS officials stated that the first set of 44  retooled measures submitted had errors that required correction. For  example, HHS officials stated that they found errors in the electronic  coding of these 44 retooled measures requiring NQF and its  subcontractors who retooled the measures to make corrections. In  addition, HHS and NQF officials stated that after starting the retooling  project, they quickly learned that the estimated time frames for the  retooling project, as well as other projects related to the EHR activity,  were overly ambitious, given the scope and complexity of the work.  For example, HHS officials noted that retooling of quality measures  into electronic format had never been attempted before and the  technical complexity and labor required to complete the project were  greater than anticipated. NQF officials also told us that HHS\u2019s  requests to modify the scope of work for this project often required  changing the time frame for completing the retooled measures. These  factors resulted in an extension of the project that delayed the final  delivery of the 113 retooled measures as well as contributed to the  need for additional staff at NQF.", "Other Health Care Quality Measurement Activity. NQF was  expected to complete two projects under the other health care quality  measurement activity related to efficiency and resource use\u2014one  white paper on resource use and another on geographic-level  efficiency by July 2010. These white papers were intended to  provide information for an endorsement project on resource-use  measures that began in January 2011. However, as of August 2011,  the resource-use paper was still under review by HHS, and NQF  officials stated they expected to receive comments in September  2011. The geographic-level efficiency paper was canceled in June  2010 at the request of HHS. NQF initially intended to subcontract the  work on these two projects, but officials told us that they were unable  to identify a subcontractor at the level of funding approved for this  project. As a result, HHS approved NQF\u2019s proposal to complete this  work internally. HHS officials stated that the drafts NQF submitted on  both topics were poor in quality and did not meet its needs, resulting  in HHS requesting additional revisions for the resource-use white  paper that delayed its completion, and requesting the cancellation of  the geographic-level efficiency white paper.", "Administrative Activity. NQF did not meet the expected time frames  for completing one of the required projects under the administrative  activity\u2014finalizing its annual work plan. Specifically, the NQF contract  requires NQF to develop an annual work plan and to receive final  approval from HHS within the first 4 weeks of each contract year;  however, NQF did not meet this requirement in 2010 or 2011. For  example, the final 2011 MIPPA annual work plan was not developed  by NQF and approved by HHS until April 1, 2011. According to NQF  and HHS officials, the 2011 MIPPA work plan was not developed and  approved on time due to extended discussions on the scope and cost  estimates of NQF\u2019s EHR activities. HHS officials told us that the  primary reason for the extended discussions was that they expected  the costs to reflect all the work needed to complete the Measure  Authoring Tool (MAT) by the end of the second contract year.  However, they said that NQF only submitted a beta version of the tool  by the end of the second contract year, which was not the version  expected by HHS. NQF officials told us that the version was never  intended to be final but rather a beta version, consistent with their  understanding of HHS\u2019s expectations. As a result, HHS and NQF  officials needed to evaluate the scope of work and cost estimates for  this and other projects. Further, NQF officials told us the delay in  completing the 2011 MIPPA annual work plan resulted in the  interruption of NQF\u2019s ongoing work related to the MAT under the EHR  contract activity. The delay also delayed its receipt of funding for  some new or ongoing work under the contract. In some instances,  NQF chose to start new or continue ongoing work with its own  funding. For example, NQF officials stated that NQF began work  related to the MAP using its own funds until HHS authorized the work.  In addition, the delay in completing the 2011 MIPPA work plan  resulted in the need to set the start date for fall 2011 rather than  earlier in the contract year for some of the projects under the  maintenance activity.", "NQF also exceeded its cost estimates for projects under three of the  contract activities. HHS officials told us they approved the changes to the  cost estimates and in some cases modified NQF\u2019s scope of work to help  ensure that NQF\u2019s costs did not exceed the amount HHS had obligated  for the contract activities. NQF officials stated that in certain cases, not  meeting expected time frames contributed to NQF exceeding these cost  estimates. For example, the delays in projects related to the EHR contract  activity, including expanding the scope of the retooling project,  contributed to NQF exceeding its cost estimate of about $3.8 million for  the entire EHR contract activity by about $560,000 in the second contract  year. In another example, the delays in finalizing the 2010 and 2011  MIPPA work plans contributed in part to NQF exceeding its cost estimate  for developing and finalizing these plans, which is a project under the  administrative contract activity. Specifically, while NQF estimated that  completion of the annual work plan would cost approximately $77,000,  NQF reported an actual cost of $176,590. In addition, NQF also exceeded  its cost estimate for the endorsement contract activity during the second  contract year for various reasons, including a need for additional technical  experts for review panels. Specifically, NQF exceeded estimated costs of  about $3.1 million for the entire endorsement activity by about $146,000   While HHS officials told us they approved  in the second contract year.all changes to the cost estimates, in certain cases they reduced the scope  of NQF\u2019s work in 2011 to ensure that total available funding for the  contract year was not exceeded and that sufficient funding was available  for ongoing projects. For example, HHS officials told us that they had  hoped to start several new endorsement projects beginning in 2011;  however, these projects were not included in the 2011 final annual MIPPA  work plan so that funding would be available for NQF to complete its  ongoing projects, including work that was delayed under the EHR  contract activity. In addition, HHS requested that NQF discontinue its  work on one project related to the development of a public website for  2011, which is associated with the administrative contract activity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Did Not Use All Monitoring Tools Required under the NQF Contract", "paragraphs": ["HHS officials told us that to help monitor NQF\u2019s performance on the  projects under the contract activities, they rely on NQF to report any  issues, including those related to time frames or cost estimates, in the  monthly progress reports that NQF is required to submit to HHS or during  phone calls held at least monthly. While HHS monitored NQF\u2019s progress  and approved changes to the time frames and cost estimates for the  projects under the contract activities, HHS did not use available tools for  monitoring that are required under NQF\u2019s contract. These tools could  have helped to provide an opportunity for HHS to make any appropriate  changes to NQF\u2019s projects. For example, HHS did not conduct an annual  performance evaluation required by the contract that would assess  timeliness and cost control issues, among other things, for the previous  contract year. The results of such an evaluation could help HHS officials  to consider potential timeliness and cost issues when determining NQF\u2019s  scope of work for the next year. Further, while monthly progress reports  and invoices include information on NQF\u2019s costs, these documents do not  compare reported costs to initial cost estimates. HHS officials told us that,  prior to August 2011, they had not enforced a contractual requirement for  NQF to submit\u2014nor had it received from NQF\u2014a financial graph in its  monthly progress reports that provides information comparing NQF\u2019s  monthly incurred costs for each of the contract activities with initial cost  estimates. Instead, HHS officials informally requested that NQF provide  them with the financial status of the contract activities in midyear 2010,  which helped them to plan for NQF\u2019s work under the contract for 2011.  Having a financial graph in the monthly progress report could have helped  HHS officials to identify instances where any contract activity was  approaching or exceeding NQF\u2019s initial cost estimates prior to HHS\u2019s  midyear review. This, in turn, could have provided HHS and NQF an  opportunity to adjust estimates of future costs for these or related  activities earlier in the contract year.

For example, of the 164  measures used or planned for use, 44 were used in CMS\u2019s Medicare and  Medicaid EHR Incentive Program after being retooled\u2014that is, converted  to an electronic format that is compatible with EHRs\u2014under the NQF  contract. Although these 44 retooled measures were used in the EHR  Incentive Program, HHS officials stated that NQF and HHS detected  coding and other errors in the versions of the 44 retooled measures that  were published in the program\u2019s final rule in July 2010 that required NQF  to make corrections to them after publication of the final rule. NQF did not  submit the revised versions of the 44 retooled measures published in the  final rule to HHS until December 2010. HHS officials stated that because  the final rule had already been published prior to receiving the final  formatted measures, CMS listed general guidance on its website to  address the errors. HHS officials told us that these 44 measures are  being used but have not yet been tested to assess the feasibility of  implementing them in the electronic format. Until the testing is complete,  HHS runs the risk that some of these measures may not work as intended  when implemented in electronic format for performance measurement. As  a result, the agency does not have reasonable assurance that the  retooled versions of the measures will correctly capture information from  EHRs. In addition to the 44 retooled measures used in the EHR Incentive  Program, HHS also has used or planned to use 120 measures that it  received from endorsement and maintenance projects under the NQF  contract for various HHS programs and initiatives. (See table 2 for details  on specific programs in which HHS has used or planned to use health  care quality measures received from NQF under the contract.)", "HHS officials told us that they expect to evaluate if and how they could  use all of the remaining 180 of the 344 quality measures that were  endorsed, maintained, or retooled under the NQF contract that are not  currently in use or planned for use in HHS programs or initiatives.  According to HHS officials, any measure developer can submit a measure  to be considered for NQF endorsement. Therefore, all the measures  received under the contract may not be applicable to a particular HHS  health care quality program or initiative. HHS officials told us that they will  review the remaining 180 measures to determine if they are applicable to  their health care quality programs or initiatives. The officials expect that  many of these measures will be used in HHS programs or initiatives  required by PPACA. For example, HHS officials told us that they will  consider implementation of most of the retooled measures in future  stages of the EHR Incentive Program. In addition, PPACA directed HHS  to establish a hospital value-based purchasing program, as well as to  make plans or begin pilot programs for value-based purchasing in other  settings of care. The hospital value-based purchasing program will use  various quality measures and depend on the information collected on  them to determine payments to providers. PPACA also required the  development of no less than 10 provider-level outcome measures for  hospitals and physicians by March 2012. Further, PPACA directed HHS  to identify quality measures that could be used to evaluate hospice  programs and publish these measures by October 1, 2012. HHS officials  told us that they are in the process of determining whether or to what  extent the remaining 180 measures HHS has received under the NQF  contract can be used to address the new measurement needs and  priorities established by PPACA. HHS officials told us that they prefer to  use NQF-endorsed measures to meet HHS\u2019s measurement needs  because these quality measures are nationally recognized standards and  in some cases HHS is required to use them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Does Not Have a Comprehensive Plan for Determining How It Will Use NQF\u2019s Work under the Contract to Implement PPACA Requirements Related to Quality Measurement", "paragraphs": ["Although HHS has taken steps to determine how it can use the measures  received under the contract with NQF, the agency does not have a  comprehensive plan for determining how it will use the remainder of the  work conducted under NQF\u2019s contract to implement PPACA  requirements, including plans for additional quality measures that need to  be endorsed during the remaining contract years. HHS officials told us  that HHS determines on an annual basis which activities\u2014including work  on quality measures\u2014NQF is to perform under the contract through the  interagency workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of representatives  from various HHS agencies and allows them to provide input on their  needs, including quality measures that need endorsement from NQF, for  their respective programs. However, HHS officials told us that each HHS  program assesses its quality measurement needs separately and  provides varying levels of detail about its needs. Therefore, it is unclear  the extent to which all programs consistently incorporate PPACA\u2019s quality  measurement requirements and deadlines into these assessments. The  NPP\u2019s September 2011 report noted the importance of greater alignment  of national quality measurement efforts, including the establishment of a  comprehensive measurement strategy that identifies core measure sets,  among other things. In addition, the report noted that all federal programs  should work toward the establishment of a common platform for  measurement and reporting. Without a comprehensive plan that  delineates HHS\u2019s quality measurement needs, and given that each  program assesses its quality measurement needs separately, the  interagency workgroup may not be able to systematically ensure that all  of HHS\u2019s quality measurement needs that implement PPACA  requirements align with the selection and prioritization of activities for  NQF to complete under the contract.", "While HHS has begun various efforts to assess its quality measurement  needs, the lack of a plan that comprehensively determines the impact of  PPACA on its needs could affect the agency\u2019s progress on its quality  measurement efforts as well as how it selects and prioritizes NQF\u2019s  contract activities. Officials told us that prior to PPACA\u2019s enactment, CMS  maintained a 5-year plan that listed its measurement needs based on  agency priorities and the priorities established by the NPP for some of its  programs.to reflect the requirements related to quality measurement and time  frames established by PPACA. In March 2011, HHS published the  National Quality Strategy as required by PPACA, which included six  priority areas of focus. The report was required by PPACA to include  agency-specific plans, goals, benchmarks, and standardized quality  metrics for each priority area, but did not do so. HHS officials stated that  this document describes HHS\u2019s initial plan for these elements and that  they may be included in future versions of the strategy. In June 2011,  HHS officials told us that they plan to convene a Quality Measurement  Task Force within CMS with a goal to comprehensively align, coordinate,  and approve the development, maintenance, and implementation of  health care quality measures for use in various CMS programs. As of  August 2011, the task force was in an early stage of development, and  therefore it is too early to determine whether it will accomplish its goal.  Although these various HHS efforts are key steps toward helping the  agency meet its quality measurement needs, they are not guided by a  comprehensive plan that synthesizes key priority areas identified in  various sources, such as those reported by the NPP or in the National  Quality Strategy, for which measures may be needed. Without such a  plan, HHS may be limited in its efforts to prioritize which specific  measures it needs to develop and have endorsed by NQF for its health  care quality programs and initiatives established by PPACA. As a result,  HHS may be unable to ensure that the agency receives the quality  measures needed to meet PPACA requirements and specified time  frames related to quality measurement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Health care quality measures are increasingly important to HHS as it uses  and will continue to use them in its existing and forthcoming programs  and initiatives to evaluate health care delivery. For example, HHS\u2019s value- based purchasing programs are pay-for-performance programs that will  require providers to collect and report information on health care quality  measures and adjust payment levels based on providers\u2019 performance  against the measures. PPACA has increased HHS\u2019s quality measurement  needs, and the time frames specified in the law have also increased the  urgency of obtaining endorsed quality measures\u2014which are nationally  recognized standards and in some cases are required by statute\u2014to  meet these needs. Given that NQF is the entity in the United States with  lead responsibility for endorsing health care quality measures, NQF\u2019s  endorsement activities under the contract are of key importance to help  meet HHS\u2019s quality measurement needs.", "However, NQF\u2019s endorsement process takes time. For more than half of  the projects, including all five projects in the endorsement activity, NQF  did not meet or did not expect to meet the initial time frames approved by  HHS. In addition, projects under three of the contract activities have  exceeded initial cost estimates, which resulted in HHS\u2019s modification of  NQF\u2019s scope of work in some instances to help ensure that NQF\u2019s costs  did not exceed the funding allocated for the contract activities. While HHS  received information in monthly progress reports to help monitor NQF\u2019s  performance under the contract, the agency did not use all of the  monitoring tools required under the contract to help address issues  related to time lines and cost estimates. These monitoring tools included  an annual performance evaluation that could help HHS officials consider  potential issues related to NQF\u2019s time frames and cost estimates when  planning work for the next year and a financial graph to be included in  NQF\u2019s monthly progress reports. The graph would have compared  reported costs to initial cost estimates, which is something that monthly  progress reports do not do. Although HHS officials reported that they  recently began in August 2011 to enforce the contractual requirement for  NQF to submit the graph, they have not implemented the required annual  performance evaluation. By not taking advantage of these tools, HHS  runs the risk of not having detailed and timely information that could help  identify instances in which NQF might be at risk of not meeting time  frames or exceeding estimated costs. Identifying such instances could  provide an opportunity for HHS to make any appropriate changes to  NQF\u2019s scope of work, including setting priorities to ensure that HHS  receives the quality measures it needs in a timely manner.", "With the time remaining under the contract, HHS has an opportunity to  ensure that the work performed under NQF\u2019s contract better meets the  agency\u2019s needs for its programs and initiatives. However, HHS has not  developed a plan that comprehensively identifies its quality measurement  needs for its programs and initiatives in light of PPACA\u2019s requirements or  determines how it will use the work conducted during the remaining years  of the NQF contract to help it meet these needs. In addition, critical tasks  may need to be completed outside of the NQF contract. For example,  HHS requested that NQF retool 113 measures under the contract and  used 44 of the 113 measures that included errors in its EHR Incentive  Program. As of November 2011, feasibility testing related to  implementation of the retooled measures had not been completed, and  HHS expected to perform this work outside of the NQF contract. Until the  testing is completed, HHS runs the risk that some of the retooled  measures may not work as intended when implemented in electronic  format for performance measurement, which is a concern because use of  these measures is an important component of HHS\u2019s long-term goal for  providers to use health information technology (IT) to exchange  information and improve the quality of care.", "Without a comprehensive plan, HHS lacks assurance that its selection of  the work to be performed by NQF\u2014and the approximately $55.2 million  that the agency expects to spend for remaining work under the NQF  contract\u2014will be prioritized in the most effective way possible. Given that  PPACA includes time frames for the implementation of quality  measurement programs, NQF\u2019s pace in completing some of the work  under the contract\u2014particularly the endorsement activity\u2014raises  concerns. If the endorsement projects continue to require extended  completion times, HHS runs the risk of not having all the endorsed  measures it needs for implementing its programs and initiatives.

It did not indicate any plans to  conduct the annual performance evaluation for the third contract year\u2014 January 14, 2011, through January 13, 2012\u2014which would be consistent  with the contract\u2019s requirements. With respect to our second  recommendation, ASPE provided technical comments and also told us  that CMS issued a contract solicitation to test the retooled measures, but  CMS did not receive any bids. Instead, ASPE noted in its comments that  two of CMS\u2019s current contractors will conduct feasibility testing on 69 of  the 113 retooled measures that are planned for use in HHS\u2019s EHR  Incentive programs. CMS does not plan to issue a solicitation for a new  contract to test the feasibility of the remaining 44 retooled measures,  which are currently being used in HHS\u2019s EHR Incentive Program.

As noted in the draft report, the contract type used for this work  is used for efforts such as research, design, or study efforts where costs  and technical uncertainties exist and it is desirable to retain as much  flexibility as possible in order to accommodate change. However, the draft  report also noted that this type of contract provides only a minimum  incentive to the contractor to control costs. Given the risk associated with  this type of contract, the fact that NQF has not met expected time frames  on about half of its projects as of August 2011, and that NQF exceeded  its initial cost estimates for some of its projects under its contract  activities, it is especially important that HHS obtain detailed and timely  information on NQF\u2019s performance and use that information to inform any  appropriate changes to time frames, projects, and cost estimates for the  remaining contract years, as noted in our recommendations. NQF\u2019s  comments also state that time frames and costs for the work performed  under the contract were initial estimates based on an early understanding  of the work, that HHS and NQF understood that there would likely be  changes to them as a result of the complexity and novelty of the work,  and that they have worked collaboratively throughout the contract period  to address these and other factors. As noted in the draft report, the final  work plans, the technical proposal, and other documents that we  reviewed included initial time frames for all projects and costs for the work  performed during the contract year that were approved by HHS in  collaboration with NQF. The draft report also notes several examples of  reasons why the time frames and costs were modified over time.  Contributing factors include the high volume of measures submitted,  changes to the scope of work, and the novelty and complexity of the  work.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services and other interested parties.

The Measures  Management System requires the convening of a technical expert panel  in the initial planning stage. Once convened, the technical expert panel is  expected to work with measure developers who will gather information  that will help the panel determine whether measures need to be  developed for a program or initiative. During this stage, measure  developers may conduct environmental scans or literature reviews, to  determine the existence of measures that could be used for a program or  initiative. If a measure does not exist, then the developer will work with  CMS to develop the needed measures for the program or initiative,  including measure testing. Upon development of the measures, the  technical expert panel will evaluate them based on (1) importance to  making significant gains in health care quality and improving health  outcomes, (2) scientific acceptability of the measure properties including  tests of reliability and validity, (3) usability, and (4) feasibility. Measures  recommended by the panel are generally submitted for NQF  endorsement.", "In contrast, CMS\u2019s Center for Medicaid, Children\u2019s Health Insurance  Program (CHIP), and Survey & Certification Office\u2014the CMS center  which implements CHIP\u2014uses a measure identification process that  relies on existing measures rather than development of new measures,  according to officials. This office worked with a technical advisory group,  the Subcommittee on Children\u2019s Healthcare Quality Measures for  Medicaid and CHIP, to recommend an initial core set of measures for the  CHIP. With assistance from CMS, the subcommittee evaluated measures  based on importance, validity, and feasibility. CMS officials told us that  they considered existing NQF-endorsed and non-NQF-endorsed  measures based on the measurement needs of the program, and relied  on measure testing conducted by the measure developers. Officials  stated that they have also relied on the subcommittee to evaluate  candidate measures for Medicaid child health programs.

For  purposes of our work, we categorized these tasks into nine contract  activities. Specifically, in certain cases, we grouped activities that covered  related areas of work into a single contract activity. For example, we  consolidated the six administrative activities NQF is required to perform  into a single contract activity. (See table 3 that shows how we  consolidated these contract activities.)", "NQF was required to perform specific projects under the nine contract  activities we identified. For example, under the endorsement contract  activity, NQF was required to complete an endorsement project related to  patient outcome measures. For purposes of our work, we identified and  reviewed 63 projects NQF is required to perform under the nine contract  activities, as shown in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Status of NQF\u2019s Nine Contract Activities and the Projects under Each Activity GAO Identified", "paragraphs": ["The tables below provide a status update on the projects that the National  Quality Forum (NQF) is required to complete under the nine contract  activities we identified (see app. II). The contract activities and the  projects under the activities NQF is expected to perform are determined  on an annual basis by the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) and NQF. As a result, the number of projects under the contract  activities varies by contract year. For our reporting period\u2014January 2010  through August 2011\u2014we determined that NQF was required to conduct  work on 63 projects under the contract activities we reviewed. To  determine initial time frames for each project, we calculated the  approximate time between expected start and end dates established in  NQF\u2019s 2009, 2010, and 2011 final annual Medicare Improvements for  Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) work plans, the 2011 Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) technical proposal, and  other NQF documents. Actual time frames were determined by  calculating the approximate time between the actual start date and the  actual date of completion. For projects that were not yet complete as of  August 2011, we included an expected time frame based on the  approximate difference between the actual start date and the expected  date of completion.

To complete this project, the National Quality Forum (NQF)  subcontracted with Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (Mathematica), to  conduct a review of NQF\u2019s endorsement process, as requested by HHS.  HHS officials stated that, given the importance of the endorsement  process as part of the health care quality measurement framework, they  requested that an objective and thorough review of NQF\u2019s endorsement  process that focused on timeliness, efficiency, and effectiveness should  be conducted. For example, they stated that they were interested in  whether there were any efficiencies that could be implemented to shorten  the process while maintaining an objective review of the health care  quality measures that were evaluated under the process. Mathematica  initiated its review of NQF\u2019s endorsement process in October 2009 and  completed the work in December 2010.", "In December 2010, Mathematica submitted a final report to NQF and  recommended eight areas where improvements could be made and  inefficiencies could be addressed in the endorsement process. In the final  report, Mathematica noted that the current process is lengthy and the  timeliness of the endorsement projects varies substantially. The report  further noted that the length of the endorsement process affects the  availability of endorsed measures for end users, such as HHS. To help  reduce the time required to complete projects, Mathematica  recommended that NQF create a schedule for its endorsement process  for measure developers and develop feasible time lines that include clear  goals for each endorsement project.", "As of May 2011, NQF officials stated that NQF has taken steps or plans  to take steps in its future projects to address the eight areas for  improvement Mathematica identified. For example, as of May 2011, NQF  has solicited measures earlier based on a tentative annual project  schedule to reduce the time lines of its endorsement process and  reduced the period for voting by NQF member organizations from 30 to  15 days. NQF officials stated that they believe their efforts to implement  the recommendations will shorten the time lines for the endorsement  projects by 3 to 4 months without compromising the integrity of the  endorsement process and measures to be evaluated under the process.  HHS officials stated Mathematica\u2019s recommendations were valuable  because much of the work under the NQF contract needs to be  completed in an accelerated time line to help fill critical measurement  gaps associated with HHS\u2019s health care quality programs and initiatives.  They noted that it is too soon to tell the effects of these changes on the  endorsement process, but they plan to monitor implementation of the  changes in NQF\u2019s 2011 endorsement projects under the contract. In  addition, as of September 2011, HHS approved a new project under the  contract to identify how the endorsement process can best align with  HHS\u2019s time frame for needed measures. As part of this project, NQF is  expected to work with a consulting group to identify key performance  metrics and define milestones and time lines to help streamline its  endorsement process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the National Quality Forum", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Will Simerl, Assistant Director;   La Sherri Bush; Krister Friday; Amy Leone; Carla Lewis; John Lopez;  Elizabeth Martinez; Lisa Motley; Teresa Tucker; Carla Willis; and William  T.
