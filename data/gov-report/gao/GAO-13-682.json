In 2012, FHA insured about $227 billion in single-family mortgages, and its overall insurance portfolio was about $1.1 trillion. Its market presence expanded during the recent housing crisis as the conventional market contracted and Congress increased the limit on the size of loans FHA may insure. But FHA's financial condition has weakened, and FHA has not met its 2 percent statutory minimum capital ratio since 2009. In its most recent budget, the agency stated that its capital reserve account might require an infusion of federal funds.", "FHA, industry participants, and researchers have suggested a number of options for improving FHA's long-term viability or for limiting FHA's market presence. These options have potential implications for taxpayers, borrowers, and others. This report discusses the options--which fall into three broad categories: (1) changes to product terms and conditions, (2) changes that would restrict FHA's market presence, and (3) changes to FHA's operations and powers--and their implications. It also describes the possible effects of broader housing finance reform on FHA.", "GAO interviewed a variety of industry stakeholders and researchers and reviewed studies and other documents to identify options for reforming FHA and their implications."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified a number of proposed options for adjusting product terms and conditions to help improve the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) long-term viability. FHA has raised the premiums that it charges borrowers several times in recent years and has taken steps to tighten its underwriting standards--for example, by setting a minimum required credit score. Some mortgage market observers have argued that further changes such as revising underwriting standards to focus on borrowers' residual income, requiring higher down payments, or reducing seller concessions (that is, funds sellers provide to buyers to help pay for closing costs) could help FHA better manage credit risk. However, such changes would entail trade-offs. For instance, some said that raising down-payment requirements would improve loan performance, but others said that this move would delay homeownership for many borrowers. Similarly, raising premiums could potentially increase revenue, but this potential would be constrained if it caused volume to decline. Further, low-risk borrowers with fewer down-payment constraints could choose less costly loans from other sources, leaving FHA with more high-risk borrowers. These changes could have a direct effect on the availability of credit for borrowers.", "GAO also identified options that could either directly or indirectly change FHA's market presence, which increased after the housing crisis, or address its financial viability. Among the proposals that would have a direct effect are those limiting FHA insurance to loans below a lowered ceiling or to borrowers who met new income guidelines. Many stakeholders and FHA itself view FHA's current loan limits, which range from $271,050 to $729,750 for one-unit properties in the contiguous United States, as too high. Some note that the agency may insure larger loans than the housing enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The current FHA limits were put in place in response to declines in mortgage lending during the housing crisis, when the private sector's role in financing mortgages shrank. However, as the market has improved, some have noted that lowering loan limits would allow private capital to return to the market and focus FHA on low- and moderate-income and first-time home buyers, a shift that many observers consider appropriate. Other proposed changes, such as reducing insurance coverage to less than 100 percent of the loan amount or entering into risk-sharing agreements with private partners, may indirectly reduce FHA's market presence. However, applying a partial coverage model would limit availability of credit to some borrowers. For some lenders, the additional exposure might prompt the purchase of additional insurance coverage from third parties, the cost of which would be passed on to borrowers. Some argue that under a risk-sharing structure private partners would assume and better manage credit risk. But creating such a structure would require careful consideration of how risks are borne, how pricing is determined, how incentives are aligned between FHA and its partners, and how FHA's role in stabilizing mortgage markets would be impacted. Others point to the additional counterparty risk posed by risk-sharing arrangements, which would necessitate greater federal oversight. Finally, these options might also affect FHA's ability to respond to changing market conditions.", "FHA and industry observers have also suggested changes to FHA\u0092s structure and powers that could enhance its flexibility and capacity to manage risk. Some of these changes would bring FHA\u0092s corporate powers more in line with those of other government corporations and increase its autonomy, providing it with enhanced enforcement powers and greater authority to change program requirements and invest in staff and technology. FHA has already requested additional enforcement authority. FHA and other observers have also argued that FHA needs greater power to change loan products or loan features without a lengthy rulemaking process and additional information technology resources\u0097resources for which FHA must currently compete within HUD. Expanding FHA\u0092s operational and managerial powers would give the agency more flexibility, and increasing its enforcement powers would allow it to more effectively oversee lenders. But any expansion of FHA\u0092s authority may need to be limited and transparency requirements heightened, including for the rulemaking process. Even with no changes to its existing organizational structure and authorities, FHA can do more to enhance program efficiency and effectiveness and protect taxpayers. GAO has made a number of recommendations aimed at improving FHA\u0092s loss mitigation efforts, management of real-estate owned inventories, risk assessment, human capital management, and information technology systems. In response to these recommendations, FHA has taken steps, such as developing a plan for conducting an inaugural risk assessment and a workforce analysis and succession plan.", "Finally, efforts to further regulate housing finance and the continuing uncertainty over resolution of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac present challenges to any efforts to reform FHA. Following the collapse of the mortgage market, Congress passed a number of mortgage reforms that could impact FHA\u0092s market share and role because they could affect the price at which the conventional market will be able to serve future home buyers of varying credit risk profiles. Similarly, the administration has put forth several options for reforming the federal role in the mortgage market, including reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Each of these options could have an impact on FHA\u0092s role in the mortgage market. Partly for this reason, GAO identified modernization of the federal role in housing finance as a high-risk area in early 2013. Any changes to the federal tools that support housing finance should be made in concert and with full recognition of the interdependence among FHA, the enterprises, and federal regulation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Federal  Housing Administration (FHA) has helped millions of families purchase  homes through its single-family mortgage insurance programs, which  insure private lenders against losses on mortgages that finance  purchases of properties or that refinance existing FHA mortgages.

The agency has played a particularly large role among minority,  lower-income, and first-time homebuyers. In 2012, about 78 percent of  FHA-insured loans went to first-time homebuyers, about 32 percent of  whom were minorities. FHA is generally thought to promote stability in the  market by ensuring the availability of mortgage credit in areas that may  be underserved by the private sector or that are experiencing economic  downturns. As the recent housing crisis and economic recession set in,  the contraction of other segments of the mortgage market and legislated  increases in the loan amounts eligible for FHA insurance resulted in  higher demand for FHA-insured mortgages.

Credit  subsidy costs represent the net present value of expected lifetime cash  flows, excluding administrative costs.

Generally, agencies must produce annual updates of their subsidy  estimates\u2014reestimates\u2014on the basis of information about actual  performance and estimated changes in future loan performance.

FHA annually estimates the subsidy costs  of new activity for its loan insurance program and also reestimates, or  annually updates, prior subsidy cost estimates. Historically, FHA  estimated that its loan insurance program had a negative subsidy cost.  On the basis of these estimates, FHA accumulated substantial balances  in a capital reserve account, which represents amounts in excess of those  needed for estimated claims or other costs and was used to cover  reestimates reflecting unanticipated increases to those costs (such as  higher-than-expected claims).

For example, the guideline for a family of two  living in the midwest with a loan of $80,000 or more is a minimum of $738  in residual income.

Because of similar  concerns, FHA revised its original proposal for reducing seller  concessions. In its revised proposed rule, FHA noted that an across-the- board reduction to 3 percent would have had a disproportionately  negative impact on borrowers with low and moderate incomes who were  purchasing modestly priced homes.

In this case,  an increase in premiums can result in both lower premium revenue as  low-risk borrowers no longer purchase FHA insurance, and an increased  claim rate among the remaining higher-risk borrowers.", "Further, others have noted that increased premiums could price some  borrowers out of the market. As previously discussed, some mortgage  industry observers have noted that many FHA borrowers have limited  cash assets to pay for down-payment and closing costs. According to  FHA, nearly all FHA-insured borrowers finance the up-front premium, so  the net effect of increasing it would likely be to raise the borrowers\u2019  mortgage payments.", "FHA officials said that the agency was unlikely to implement further  increases in annual premiums in the near future. They said that FHA  loans could become unaffordable to some borrowers when interest rates  increase. We also found that FHA\u2019s recently announced policy  lengthening the duration of premium assessments might have an adverse  impact on borrowers. Mortgagee Letter 2013-04, implemented on June 3,  2013, mandates that the monthly mortgage insurance premium on FHA  loans with LTV ratios exceeding 90 percent apply for the life of the loan,  rather than terminating after the first 5 years once the principal amount  declines to 78 percent LTV. FHA has acknowledged that this policy  change will increase the annual percentage rate (APR) on FHA  mortgages and may result in mortgages whose interest rates qualify them  as higher-priced mortgage loans (HPML). Under Regulation Z, HPMLs  must meet certain requirements, including those related to repayment   After consulting with the  ability, prepayment penalties, and escrows.Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (also known as CFPB), FHA  issued guidance to lenders that explained their responsibilities for  meeting both HPML and FHA requirements.", "Some of the literature we reviewed and mortgage industry observers we  spoke to suggested that FHA assess premiums using \u201crisk-based pricing.\u201d  Risk-based pricing takes into account borrowers\u2019 risk attributes such as  credit score, DTI ratio, product type, and LTV ratio. As described earlier,  FHA\u2019s current premiums are based on the size and term of the loan and  the LTV ratio and do not consider credit score and other risk factors, a  practice FHA refers to as \u201caverage pricing.\u201d Using this method, low-risk  borrowers pay the same actual price for insurance coverage as high-risk  borrowers. For example, all FHA borrowers with loans at or below  $625,500, LTV ratios less than or equal to 95 percent, and terms of  greater than 15 years pay the same premiums, even though other  measures of risk, such as credit scores, indicate that they represent a  variety of risks. Risk-based pricing could address the adverse selection  problem that is a possibility under average pricing (that is, when  premiums charged do not align with the actual risks of borrowers so that  low-risk borrowers are charged too much for insurance and thus seek it  elsewhere). One mortgage industry observer also noted that it would  more accurately align FHA\u2019s revenues with its potential claims.", "Conversely, others have argued that risk-based pricing would place FHA  in the position of having to raise the mortgage financing costs of  borrowers with weaker credit. To the extent that relatively low-risk  borrowers might face lower premiums, they likely would not leave FHA.  But other borrowers could face higher premiums, and those who could  not qualify either for an FHA or conventional mortgage could be priced  out of the market. For example, in 2007 we found that an FHA proposal to  implement risk-based pricing would have affected the availability of FHA  insurance for about 20 percent of the home purchase borrowers that FHA  insured in 2005. This group would not have qualified for mortgage  insurance under the parameters of the proposal because of high LTV  ratios and low credit scores. FHA officials said that they are aware that  the agency risks losing some lower-risk borrowers under its current  pricing scheme. Therefore, they said that the agency has set pricing so  that it covers the expected losses of the highest risk loans that its  underwriting permits, with the idea that if FHA were to face increasing  competition for its lower-risk borrowers, it would be charging a sufficiently  high premium to cover expected losses on all newly insured loans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Proposed Changes That Restrict the Borrowers FHA Serves Would Affect the Agency\u2019s Role in the Mortgage Market", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, FHA\u2019s share of loan originations has increased in recent  years.

Observers also noted that loan limits act as a proxy for income, with lower  limits focusing FHA\u2019s efforts on low-wealth borrowers.

They argue that a lower level of insurance  coverage would reduce FHA\u2019s liability for defaulted loans by reducing the  severity of the agency\u2019s loss. We have also found that a reduction in  insurance coverage could have a beneficial effect on the Fund. In May  1997, we examined the potential effects of reducing FHA\u2019s insurance  coverage and found that lower coverage would reduce both the volume of  FHA-insured loans and income from premiums but would also reduce  FHA\u2019s losses and ultimately have a beneficial effect on the Fund. Others  have noted that a reduction in loan coverage could provide lenders an  incentive to improve underwriting quality, thus reducing the risk of default.  Some have cited the relatively superior delinquency and default rates in  the VA program as evidence of careful origination by lenders that must  assume some credit risk for VA-guaranteed loans. Nonetheless, it is  important to note that VA limits its eligibility to veterans who have served  in a branch of the armed services and received an honorable discharge,  certain currently serving members of the Reserves or National Guard,  and spouses of veterans under certain circumstances. It therefore starts  with a universe of eligible borrowers that are different from the population  that might seek an FHA-insured mortgage. Also, as mentioned in the  previous section, VA underwriting differs somewhat from that of FHA, with  greater attention given to the veteran\u2019s residual income. Further, the VA  program provides supplemental servicing to borrowers that face difficulty  making mortgage payments. These and other differences need to be  considered before it can be concluded that differences in insurance  coverage explain the differences between VA and FHA default rates.", "Industry observers also discussed the impact of a reduction in insurance  coverage on borrowers\u2019 access to credit. Because lenders would be  exposed to additional risk, they could increase fees and interest rates,  which some industry observers noted in testimonies to Congress. Also,  for some lenders the additional exposure might prompt the purchase of  additional insurance coverage from third parties, the cost of which could  be passed on to borrowers.

Ginnie Mae officials noted that issuers  would likely seek additional third-party assurance, most likely through  additional mortgage insurance, to manage the additional risks they might  face. As a result, borrowers could face further costs. Issuers could also  take other steps, such as limiting the amount of FHA-insured lending they  would permit or overlaying additional credit requirements, which would  limit their participation in the program.

To protect  the taxpayer by sharing risk with the private market, various industry  observers have suggested that the agency explore this option.

The  report also stated that while FHA could absorb risk better than private  lenders, potential partners could have superior risk assessment and  management systems and might be able to provide access to new  products and delivery systems targeting communities with underserved  borrowers that FHA did not yet reach. In 2007, we found that a public- private risk-sharing arrangement would recognize the government\u2019s ability  to spread risk. We also found that private mortgage industry participants  generally were more flexible and responsive to market pressures and  better able to innovate and adopt new technologies quickly.

This approach would create agreements between FHA  and private mortgage insurers. The private mortgage insurer would  conduct an independent underwriting of the borrower and the  mortgage being sought. If the borrower and the mortgage underwriting  terms met the conditions that both FHA and the private insurer agreed  on, the private insurer would take the first loss on the loan, and FHA  would cover the remaining loss. One industry observer suggested that  the agency should reduce taxpayer risk by assuming losses only after  private partners absorbed first losses of 25 to 35 percent. Another  risk-sharing arrangement between FHA and other partners could be a  model similar to FHA\u2019s Multifamily Risk-Sharing Programs through  which the agency shares proportional risk at varying levels between  10 and 90 percent with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and housing  finance agencies among others.", "Reinsurance. Large portfolio lenders and the enterprises will at times  enter into reinsurance contracts with approved counterparties to sell  portions of credit risk in their loan portfolios. According to a private  mortgage insurer testifying before a congressional committee, this  approach has the benefit of minimizing impacts on lenders and the  potential to be implemented more quickly than a coinsurance  arrangement. The representative noted that FHA should have the  flexibility to selectively test such arrangements.", "Risk sharing could affect taxpayers\u2019 risk, according to industry observers.  It could protect the taxpayer, not only because private partners would  assume some of the risk but also because the quality of the underwriting  might improve because private partners would want to minimize the  likelihood of loss. However, to the extent that FHA would offer both full  mortgage insurance and engage in risk sharing, it could be subject to  adverse selection. That is, private partners could seek relatively low-risk  borrowers for the shared-risk product, leaving FHA with the riskiest  borrowers. One report notes that under risk-sharing agreements, private  partners may act in other ways that are contrary to FHA\u2019s interest. For  example, according to this report, if FHA takes only a catastrophic loss  position, the partner may have little incentive to minimize FHA\u2019s losses  once the partner\u2019s maximum exposure level has been reached. Sharing  risk on a pro rata basis, starting with the first dollar of loss and ending  with the last dollar of loss, creates stronger incentives for FHA\u2019s risk- sharing partners to use sound underwriting terms and service their loans  diligently. We have found that this is particularly true when there is a more  equal division of risk. If FHA agrees to assume the first portion of loss  on default, the partner may not feel the need to protect against a high  incidence of claims as long as the loss severity is not expected to reach  its maximum level of exposure. The partner would also need to be  sufficiently capitalized or otherwise protected to withstand its portion of  the loss. Also, one observer warned that FHA would be at risk because it  lacked the capacity to analyze risk-sharing proposals, which could place it  in a weak position with partners. Consistent with this, FHA officials told us  that FHA would need to increase its staff and analytic capacity to safely  implement risk-sharing agreements.", "Risk sharing would also affect the role that Ginnie Mae plays in  guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on mortgage- backed securities. That is, like reducing FHA\u2019s loan guarantee coverage  below 100 percent, risk sharing changes the nature of Ginnie Mae\u2019s  exposure to counterparty risk, according to observers. Ginnie Mae would  need to undertake assessment of a new class of counterparties\u2014the  private partner providing the insurance coverage\u2014while continuing to  assess the counterparty risk of its issuers, one observer noted. Ginnie  Mae officials confirmed that any FHA risk-sharing agreements would  increase the agency\u2019s counterparty risk and noted that they would  probably require issuers to hold more capital to mitigate this risk. One  paper emphasized that risk sharing would also require FHA to monitor counterparty risk and provided a number of approaches for doing so.", "Ultimately, any risk-sharing arrangement would need to carefully consider  the structure of premiums and the way they were shared between parties.  Identifying the type and level of premium needed by the federal  government requires considering not only expected losses from loans that  default and losses exceeding a predetermined level, but also unexpected  losses from infrequent but costly adverse market conditions on both the  national and regional level. Some argue that the federal government  would still absorb catastrophic risk regardless of how risk sharing and  premiums are structured. In this case, FHA would need to receive  premiums across a broad spectrum of the market.", "In addition, like other options for improving FHA\u2019s viability, risk sharing  could impact other mortgage market participants and reduce borrowers\u2019  access to credit, according to observers. Depending on how FHA  structured risk sharing, including how widely it would be applied to FHA\u2019s  future endorsements, this option could reduce participation by smaller  mortgage lenders, particularly community banks, which might have  difficulty meeting the eligibility criteria for such a program, according to  some industry observers. Others have expressed concern that risk  sharing could raise the cost of the mortgage credit, as private investors  would demand a market rate of return. While this trade-off might be  viewed as acceptable in terms of improved underwriting, in times of  market contraction risk sharing could significantly raise the cost and limit  the availability of credit to borrowers, according to one observer. That is,  FHA\u2019s role in stabilizing mortgage markets could be affected by its  partners\u2019 willingness to continue underwriting during market contractions.  This may limit FHA\u2019s ability to serve as a countercyclical force during  such national or regional housing downturns.", "Some of the literature we read stressed the importance of FHA serving a  countercyclical role, as it has in the past, including by mitigating the effect  of the 2007-2009 financial crisis on the housing market. One observer  cautioned that broad changes, such as risk sharing, applied to FHA\u2019s  entire portfolio, or too quickly implemented without a full understanding of  the potential effects of the change, could reduce its flexibility to adjust to  larger housing market shifts. Others have stated that risk sharing might  constrain the agency\u2019s countercyclical flexibility because FHA and its  private partners might not have the same incentives. During a downturn,  private partners in risk-sharing arrangements would likely lack the  incentive to serve deteriorating markets. Further, if FHA could endorse  only loans that involved a private partner, a contraction of private credit  could prevent it from expanding when such action was needed most.  Another observer encouraged a small, discretionary or piloted approach  to any risk-sharing program, suggesting that it was not necessary to make  this option mandatory for each new endorsement.

The report  recommended that Congress transfer the corporate powers of FHA from  the HUD secretary to the corporation, permitting it to function with greater  operational autonomy within HUD. It also recommended that Congress  vest management of FHA in a single administrator appointed by the  President, with Senate confirmation for a 6-year term of office. Under this  proposal, the administrator would be compensated at the same level as  the chief executive officer of comparable government corporations. In  2002, the Millennial Housing Commission made a similar proposal, but its  proposal would combine FHA and Ginnie Mae and establish a corporate  board of directors.structures.", "Recently, some observers have suggested similar  Other observers have suggested moving FHA outside of HUD. For  example, one paper suggested organizing FHA as an independent  government agency, a government-sponsored enterprise, or even a  privatized entity structured as an assigned risk pool that would spread risk  for otherwise uninsurable borrowers across insurance carriers in  proportion to the size of their portfolios. According to the author, any of  these structures could make underwriting, pricing, and administration  more efficient while achieving what he viewed as the agency\u2019s social  objectives of providing credit enhancements through insurance to serve  otherwise marginal low-income, first-time, and often minority homebuyers.  He further stated that the FHA commissioner should have an appointment  independent of HUD and for a term that would extend beyond a single  administration term. Another observer testified that setting up FHA  outside of HUD would reduce incentives for future administrations to  impose policies on FHA that limited its flexibility and increased risks.  However, two observers we interviewed said that making FHA an  independent corporation outside of HUD would make it more difficult for  Congress to hold it accountable. FHA, which was created in 1934,  operated outside of a cabinet department for decades before becoming  part of HUD, which was created in 1965. In addition, some people we  interviewed said that FHA should remain affiliated with HUD so that it  could collaborate closely with other department offices on housing policy  and remain part of a cabinet-level agency.", "According to the literature, making FHA more autonomous could provide  it the flexibility to determine the best way to meet policy goals set by  Congress or HUD and mitigate risk. For example, in a congressional  testimony an observer suggested that FHA be provided the authority,  without further congressional action, to create or alter specific insurance  programs. Such authority, the observer argued, would enable FHA to  react promptly to changes in market and other conditions. In addition, the  observer stated that hiring, salaries, personnel management, and  procurement could be freed from federal government constraints in order  to be more consistent and competitive with the private sector. Some of  the literature we reviewed noted that FHA had exercised greater control  over its resources when it was independent of HUD.", "However in June 2007, we found that making FHA an independent  government corporation could have budgetary and oversight implications  that would need to be considered. For example, Congress would have  to determine the extent to which (1) the corporation\u2019s earnings in excess  of those needed for operations and reserves would be available for other  government activities and (2) the corporation would be subject to federal  budget requirements. Also, if the corporation were created outside of  HUD, Congress would have to consider whether oversight of the  corporation would require a new institution or could be done by an  existing organization. In addition, an observer said that making FHA an  independent government corporation or providing it with certain  flexibilities, such as powers to change its products, could make FHA  loans more attractive to borrowers who should be served by the private  sector. Although such autonomy would also permit FHA greater capacity  to manage risk, two observers we interviewed suggested that any  additional autonomy or flexibility should be accompanied by clear  direction on FHA\u2019s mission to serve borrowers not otherwise served by  the private sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHA Could Gain Greater Flexibility without Changing Its Organizational Structure", "paragraphs": ["FHA and others have said that although making the agency an  independent government corporation could increase the agency\u2019s  flexibility, the agency could be given increased flexibility without such  changes. For example, mortgage industry observers have suggested  giving FHA enhanced enforcement powers, greater authority to make  changes to program requirements, and additional authorities to invest in  technology and staff. Many of these options would require congressional  action to implement. Notwithstanding the potential benefit and costs of  these options, there are a number of steps that FHA could undertake  under its existing authority, including actions we have previously  recommended.", "In order to originate FHA-insured loans, lenders must be approved by  FHA to participate in its mortgage insurance programs. Virtually all of the  lending institutions approved to participate in FHA\u2019s single-family  mortgage insurance programs have direct endorsement authority,  meaning that they can underwrite loans and determine their eligibility for  FHA mortgage insurance without HUD\u2019s prior review. Direct endorsement  lenders can apply to participate in the Lender Insurance Program, which  enables high-performing lenders to approve mortgages for FHA insurance  without a pre-endorsement review by HUD. To hold lenders accountable  for program violations or poor performance, FHA may (1) suspend their  direct endorsement authority, (2) terminate their loan origination or  underwriting authority through its Credit Watch program, or (3) take  enforcement action through the Mortgagee Review Board.", "In its proposed budget for fiscal year 2014, FHA requested a number of  additional enforcement powers.

Currently, FHA has authority to require  indemnification only for lenders that participate in FHA\u2019s Lender  Insurance Program. According to FHA, granting the agency this  authority would enable it to obtain indemnification from all of its  approved lenders for loans that do not comply with its guidelines.

However, FHA is also seeking authority to  terminate origination and underwriting approval on a broader  geographic basis, stating that such authority would enhance its ability  to review lender performance. If a lender was found to have an  excessive rate of early defaults or claims, FHA would have greater  flexibility in terminating the lender\u2019s ability to originate or underwrite  single-family mortgages for FHA insurance. FHA has been seeking  this authority since 2010.

According to FHA, such  authority would permit the agency to better avoid losses from poor  servicing of FHA-insured loans, yielding better results for borrowers  and FHA.", "Specifically, this authority would", "Finally, FHA is seeking greater flexibility in establishing the metrics it  uses to compare lender performance so that it can more effectively  assess lender performance during all market conditions. As discussed  previously, FHA is currently required by statute to compare lenders\u2019  default and claim rates by geographic area. With enhanced authority  to set alternative performance metrics, FHA said it would be able to  compare a lender\u2019s rate of early defaults and claims (for insured  single-family mortgage loans) with the rates of other lenders on any  basis determined appropriate. Examples of metrics include  geographic area, varying underwriting standards, or populations  served.", "The majority of the observers we interviewed said that FHA needed  authority for enhanced enforcement actions. For example, some said that  FHA needed these additional powers to more effectively manage risk and  avoid unnecessary losses. Others suggested additional options\u2014for  example, requiring lenders to take back loans that defaulted within the  first 6 months. However, one observer said that the prospect of tough  administrative and legal actions already provided strong incentives for  lenders to carefully follow FHA program guidelines. Two stakeholders we  interviewed stated that increased scrutiny of lenders by FHA and others  had increased concern among lenders about the risks of litigation. As a  result, lenders have moved to further restrict credit in recent years. Many  FHA lenders have taken the step of imposing additional requirements  (known as credit overlays) on FHA loans, potentially making it more  difficult for borrowers to obtain FHA loans.", "FHA and some mortgage industry observers have suggested that the  agency should have more authority to make changes to program  requirements, including emergency powers. Currently, FHA must go  through the rulemaking process or seek legislative authority to make  major changes to its programs. For example, after problems with loans  with seller-funded down-payment assistance were identified, it was  several years before these loans were disallowed. HUD\u2019s latest annual  report on the Fund noted that the effect of loans with seller-funded down- payment assistance on the Fund was expected to be more than $15  billion in losses. Problems associated with these loans are well  documented. A March 2005 HUD contractor study found that property  sellers who provided down-payment assistance through nonprofits often  raised sale prices of the homes involved to recover the required  payments that went to the organizations. As noted previously, in  November 2005, we also found that loans with this type of assistance had  inflated prices and defaulted more often than loans without such  assistance.funded down-payment assistance. Subsequently, the rule was struck  down by the courts on procedural grounds. Congress ultimately prohibited  the use of this assistance in January 2009.", "In October 2007, FHA published a rule that prohibited seller- FHA is currently trying to address losses from its HECM program (reverse  mortgages that permit persons 62 years and older to convert their home  equity into cash advances), but has not been able to make programmatic  changes that it has determined might stem them. In a testimony on HUD\u2019s  fiscal year 2014 proposed budget, the Secretary attributed the potential  need for $943 million in permanent and indefinite budget authority for the  Fund in fiscal year 2013 to losses in the HECM program. FHA has  proposed a number of changes to the HECM program, such as  mandating the use of escrow accounts to ensure continued and timely  payment of property charges, including taxes and insurance. However,  FHA officials said that the average time for a rulemaking of this type was  about 18 months\u2014a length of time that exposed the agency and the Fund  to risks that could be avoided if, for example, it could make changes  through a mortgagee letter. Recently, FHA was provided authority to  establish through mortgagee letters any requirements that HUD  \u201cdetermines are necessary to improve the fiscal safety and soundness\u201d of  the HECM program. FHA officials told us that a mortgagee letter could  be issued within 30 to 60 days. Another approach to dealing with the  issue would be to limit the ability of borrowers to withdraw up-front the  maximum amount allowable under the program. HUD noted that the vast  majority of borrowers in the HECM program take out 80 percent or more  of the maximum amount possible in one initial cash draw, and that this  increases the likelihood that they have insufficient funds to pay items  such as property taxes. In its November 2012 annual report to Congress,  FHA announced that it would take immediate action to reduce the amount  borrowers are permitted to draw out at the time of origination of their  HECM loan. The report notes that the change would protect FHA from  losses and reduce the likelihood of borrower default due to nonpayment  of taxes and insurance. Although FHA points to other actions that will be  needed to reform the HECM program, this example demonstrates the  importance of FHA exercising the authority it already has.", "Several proposals have been put forward that would increase FHA\u2019s  ability to make changes to its programs. One observer has recommended  that Congress give the HUD secretary special emergency powers to  suspend FHA insurance programs or make emergency modifications to a  program when the HUD secretary finds that current program terms  expose the taxpayers to an elevated risk of loss and fail to serve the  public interest. In addition, a paper that lays out the current  administration\u2019s plan to reform the nation\u2019s housing finance market stated  that the administration should work with Congress to give FHA more  flexibility to respond to stress in the housing market and manage its risk  more effectively. It added that doing so would mean giving FHA  flexibility to adjust fees and programmatic parameters more quickly than it  can today. Regardless, two observers pointed to the need for offsetting  any additional flexibility that might be afforded to FHA with clear limits to  this authority, such as limits on the duration of such changes absent a  formal rulemaking process.", "Two observers we interviewed expressed concern about giving FHA  greater authority to make significant program changes, stating that such  authority should be reserved for Congress. One noted that during the  recent housing crisis Congress showed that it was able to act quickly to  change FHA program requirements when needed by increasing the loan  limit requirements. Also, he told us that FHA did not need congressional  action to change its programs. For instance, FHA could create an interim  rule to quickly handle a problem while going through the official  rulemaking process to make a permanent change. Similarly, the other observer said that FHA could make some changes through mortgagee  letters and the rulemaking process. However, according to FHA, HUD\u2019s  Office of General Counsel has advised that not all procedures or policies  may be changed by interim rule and interim rules can be particularly  sensitive to litigation and a legal stay. Thus it is the General Counsel\u2019s  opinion that statutory authority is often the safest and fastest route to  make changes.", "FHA has reported that the more than 40 information systems its single- family programs use are outdated, unable to sustain the increasing  volume of insurance applications, and costly to maintain. In addition,  recent increases in FHA\u2019s business volume have exacerbated its  information technology (IT) constraints. A consultant FHA hired to  examine technology constraints and identify risks related to processing  workloads (for single-family programs) reported in 2009 that critical  elements of IT infrastructure were at capacity, causing work slowdowns  and poor customer service. For example, network overloads slowed  systems in the afternoon, when work hours overlapped at the  homeownership centers (which are in different time zones). To partially  address these issues, HUD upgraded the mainframe\u2019s system capacity  and made changes to certain applications to improve response time.  Nevertheless, during a period in which transaction levels continued to  increase, FHA had reached the limit of hardware and software capacity  on IT systems.", "Moreover, the audit of FHA\u2019s 2011 and 2012 financial statements  identified a significant deficiency related to IT systems and stated that  FHA management and the HUD Office of the Chief Information Officer  should mitigate persistent IT control deficiencies. The audit report noted  that expensive and manual compensating controls, including monthly  reconciliations of data among the interfaced systems, were needed to  manage the numerous systems and that security and access controls had  weaknesses. We found in November 2011 that the large number of  systems resulted in hundreds of interfaces, which meant that changing  one system required extensive effort to maintain the interfaces across  systems. The multiple systems and interfaces also presented  challenges for maintaining appropriate accessibility levels, security  controls, and privacy standards.", "To address system constraints, FHA has initiated the FHA Transformation  Initiative to improve FHA\u2019s management of insurance programs through  the development and implementation of a modern financial services  information technology environment that is expected to improve loan  endorsement processes, collateral risk capabilities, and fraud  prevention. For fiscal years 2010 and 2011, HUD reported that the Transformation Initiative funding made available was $58.5 million.  According to FHA, the agency maintains an aggressive, robust, and  varied project management and applications development portfolio aimed  at deploying new and modernizing existing mortgage insurance  capabilities and business processes. In June 2013, we found that HUD  had not yet fully implemented key project management practices in  executing and managing the IT projects associated with the FHA  Transformation Initiative. Specifically, while the department had  developed project management documents such as charters and  requirements management plans, none of these documents included all  of the key details that could facilitate effective management of its projects  such as full descriptions of the work necessary to complete the projects,  cost and schedule baselines, or prioritized requirements, among other  things. A lack of project management expertise along with HUD\u2019s  inadequate development and use of a project management framework  and governance structure contributed to these deficiencies. Therefore, we  recommended that HUD establish a plan of action to fully implement best  practices, provide needed project management expertise, and improve  the development and use of its project management framework and  governance structure. HUD agreed with our recommendations to improve  its framework and governance, but did not agree with the entirety of the  recommendation to develop a plan of action or the need for providing  project management expertise. The department described actions it  would take to improve its project management practices in order to  address the deficiencies identified.", "However, some mortgage industry observers said FHA should be  provided with additional funding to enhance its information technology.  The congressionally appointed Millennial Housing Commission found that  FHA\u2019s dependence on the appropriations process for budgetary  resources and competition for funds within HUD had led to  underinvestment in technology, increasing the agency\u2019s operational risk  and making it difficult for FHA to work efficiently with lenders and other  industry partners. Some observers we spoke with also cited competition for funds within HUD, and most supported providing FHA additional  funding for these enhancements. One benefit of this option is that the  technology enhancements could improve FHA\u2019s operations. For example,  an observer said that it supported the recent efforts that FHA had taken to  improve its risk management and protect the safety and soundness of the  agency, but added that these efforts could not be sustained without,  among other things, state-of-the-art technology.", "FHA officials also told us that the agency\u2019s limited resources meant  implementing technology improvements using a piecemeal approach,  although it would be better if FHA could upgrade and integrate all of its  systems at the same time. Specifically, the agency stated that sustained  and timely funding through using receipts or direct appropriation would  enable FHA to budget and procure support and services more  strategically, systematically, and consistently.", "In the current budget environment, funding for technology enhancement  is limited. FHA technology investments must compete with other HUD  technology investments. Some observers argue that FHA should be  granted the authority to use a portion of its insurance premiums for  technology enhancement. In a June 2007 report on FHA modernization,  we found that Congress could grant FHA specific authority to invest a  portion of the Fund\u2019s current resources\u2014that is, negative subsidies that  accrue in the Fund\u2019s reserves\u2014in technology enhancement. However,  FHA has not met its statutory capital ratio requirement since 2009 and  using premium income for technology enhancement would further reduce  the ratio. Even in more prosperous times, using the Fund\u2019s current  resources would have implications. Specifically, in our June 2007 report  we found that using the Fund\u2019s current resources for information  technology would diminish its ability to withstand severe economic  conditions and would also increase the federal government\u2019s budget  deficit, all other things being equal. Further, requiring FHA to use program  revenue to pay for administrative costs could require it to increase the  premiums charged to borrowers. To the extent that having greater control  over resources might improve agency efficiency and effectiveness, FHA  may limit any potential premium increases needed to cover administrative  expenses.", "Congress also could consider allowing FHA to compensate its employees  outside of federal pay scales. In November 2011, we reported that from  2006 to 2010, Single Family Housing field staffing levels remained  relatively constant, while key workload items, such as volume-driven loan  reviews and the management of foreclosed homes, grew considerably.  As a result, it may be difficult for FHA staff to mitigate risk. Some federal  agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation, and FHFA, are permitted to pay salaries  above normal federal pay scales in recognition of the special skills  demanded by sophisticated financial market operations. FHA and some  mortgage industry observers have suggested that FHA be given similar  authority. FHA officials told us that in order to appropriately manage the  Fund, FHA needs a mix of staff with industry expertise, including those  with strong operations management, and that flexibility in compensation  would help FHA accomplish the right balance. An observer suggested  that giving the HUD secretary authority to hire risk management, analytic,  and technological system staff on a more generous pay scale could close  some of the gap between private market participants and those charged  with protecting taxpayers from economic harm. In addition, another  observer recommended that FHA have the ability to more broadly use  retention allowances and recruitment bonuses. This option could help  FHA to recruit experienced staff to help the agency adapt to changes.  Some suggest that, as with investments in technological enhancements,  enhancements in compensation could be funded with the Fund\u2019s premium  income. The effect would be to provide FHA greater flexibility, but also  would require program participants to absorb administrative costs that are  currently borne by direct federal appropriation or would reduce resources  available to pay claims and reduce the capital ratio.", "Some mortgage industry observers have suggested that Congress give  FHA authority to implement pilot programs. For example, one noted that  too often the statutory and regulatory environment for FHA leads to \u201call or  nothing\u201d policy changes, although private mortgage industry participants  frequently tested new strategies before applying them to an entire  portfolio. She recommended that FHA be given authority to implement  pilot programs quickly with the goal of better understanding, measuring,  and mitigating risk. In addition, the Millennial Housing Commission found  that the statutes and regulations to which FHA was subject dramatically  increased the time necessary to develop and implement new products. It  recommended that Congress expressly authorize FHA to introduce new  products without requiring a new statute for each. In a June 2007 report,  we found that such authority would offer FHA greater flexibility to keep  pace with the rapidly changing mortgage market.determined that Congress would have less control over FHA\u2019s product  offerings and that in some cases it might take years before a new  product\u2019s risks were well understood.", "In a February 2005 report, we recommended that FHA consider using  pilots for new products and for any planned significant changes to its  existing products. Because FHA officials had questioned the  circumstances under which they could use pilots when not required to do  so by Congress, we also recommended that FHA seek the authority to  offer new products on a limited basis, such as through pilots, if the  agency determined that it lacked sufficient authority. In comments on the  report, HUD did not specifically state whether it agreed with the  recommendations. Rather, it stated that it was in basic agreement with  GAO that all policy options, implications, and implementation methods  should be evaluated when considering or proposing a new FHA product.  For this review, however, FHA officials told us that FHA had the  appropriate level of authority to pilot programs and had successfully  piloted several. For example, FHA piloted a program that allowed lenders  to sell foreclosure properties securing nonperforming FHA-insured loans  to third parties at a reserve price slightly below the property value without  conveying the properties to FHA. According to FHA, the agency plans to  expand the program after finding that this method of disposing of  properties yields lower losses for the Fund than FHA\u2019s normal disposition  process.", "Even with no changes to its existing organizational structure and  authorities, FHA can do more to enhance program efficiency and  effectiveness and protect taxpayers. We have made a number of  recommendations aimed at improving FHA\u2019s information technology, loss  mitigation efforts, management of real-estate owned inventories, risk  assessment, and human capital management. As previously mentioned,  we recommended in June 2013 that HUD establish a plan of action to  fully implement best practices in management of information technology,  provide needed project management expertise, and improve the  development and use of its project management framework and  governance structure. In addition, in June 2012 we recommended that  FHA periodically analyze the effectiveness and the long-term costs and  benefits of its loss mitigation strategies and actions to more fully  understand their strengths and risks and protect taxpayers from  absorbing avoidable losses to the maximum extent possible. This report  found that several agencies, including FHA, were not conducting  analyses to determine the effectiveness of their loss mitigation actions.  The experiences of Treasury, the enterprises, and our econometric  analysis strongly suggested that such analyses could improve outcomes  and cut program costs. In November 2012, FHA announced revisions that  were designed to reduce the number of full claims against the Fund.  Specifically, FHA changed the steps that loan servicers must take to  assist home buyers in bringing their mortgage payments current. We  requested and plan to assess the analysis HUD completed as the basis  for this change in FHA\u2019s loss mitigation strategies to determine whether it  fully responds to our recommendation. And as noted previously, FHA has  proposed additional revisions to its loss mitigation and foreclosure  processes that would require congressional action.", "FHA could also mitigate losses on mortgages that it insures by improving  its recovery rate for foreclosures by, for example, improving the  foreclosure process itself and the process for selling its inventory of  foreclosed properties. In 2002, we found that FHA\u2019s existing procedures  could delay the start of critical steps necessary to preserve the value of  foreclosed properties and sell them quickly. We pointed to the fact that  FHA divided custody of foreclosed properties between servicers and  contractors, which could prevent the initiation of critical maintenance  necessary to make properties attractive to potential buyers. We  recommended that HUD make establishing unified property custody a  priority. In 2012, FHA announced that it was expanding a pilot that would  permit such unified custody. Under the expanded pilot, FHA permitted  loan servicers to maintain custody of properties from foreclosure sales  through final disposition, relieving FHA of the responsibility for managing  and selling these properties. Because this program is a pilot, FHA  continues to take into its inventory foreclosed properties. According to  FHA, it has taken steps to improve recovery through techniques such as  using best execution modeling to ensure an optimal asset disposition  approach. In June 2013, we recommended a number of ways that FHA  could improve on the performance of these properties\u2014for instance, by  ensuring that price reductions were based on an evaluation of market  conditions rather than on standardized schedules. FHA agreed with  these recommendations and identified actions that it had taken or  planned to take in response to them.", "In a November 2011 report, we recommended specific improvements that  FHA could make to its risk assessment processes and human capital  management. We recommended that FHA (1) integrate two ongoing  efforts to assess risk, (2) conduct an annual risk assessment, and (3)  establish ongoing mechanisms to anticipate and address risks that might  be caused by changing conditions. To improve human capital  management, we recommended that FHA develop workforce and  succession plans for the Office of Single Family Housing. Since our  report, FHA has taken several actions, including developing a plan for  conducting an inaugural risk assessment and a workforce analysis and  succession plan.", "Finally, we previously reported on opportunities to increase collaboration  among the agencies responsible for overlapping and fragmented housing  programs and activities, including those that support homeownership,  with the potential for realizing efficiencies. In 2000, we suggested that  Congress consider requiring RHS and HUD to examine the benefits and  costs of merging programs serving similar markets and providing similar  products. In 2012, we found that the administration had formed a task  force to evaluate the potential for coordinating or consolidating loan   However, we found that the task  programs at HUD, RHS, and VA.force\u2019s efforts had not yet incorporated key collaborative practices. We  therefore recommended that HUD, USDA, and VA, and the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) take steps to establish a more  rigorous approach to collaboration. In addition, we recommended that  officials from HUD, Treasury, USDA, and VA evaluate and report on the  specific opportunities for consolidating similar housing programs,  including those that would require statutory changes. HUD and OMB  expressed concern about implementing the recommendations while HUD  was focused on the ongoing housing recovery. As we stated in the report,  in addition to focusing on the ongoing housing crisis and government  support for the housing market, focusing on achieving efficiencies and  cost savings and the delivery of government support for housing is  important.

The administration  has put forth several options for reforming the federal role in the mortgage  market, including reforming the enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac). Each of these options has potential implications for FHA. Some of  our recent work\u2014a 2009 report on options for resolving the enterprises  and our 2013 high-risk series\u2014discussed the trade-offs associated with  options for resolving the enterprises, as well as how these efforts could  affect FHA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Statutory and Regulatory Changes Could Affect FHA\u2019s Market Share", "paragraphs": ["Recent statutory and regulatory changes related to qualified mortgages  (QM) and qualified residential mortgages (QRM) have the potential to  affect FHA\u2019s market share. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) required lenders to make a  reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and  documented information, that borrowers seeking residential mortgages  have a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. The  Dodd-Frank Act also established a presumption of compliance with the  ability-to-repay requirements for a certain category of mortgages called  QM. The ability to repay provisions are similar to those implemented by  the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve  Board) in 2008 but cover all mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act shifted  rulemaking authority for these provisions and QM from the Federal  Reserve Board to the CFPB. On January 30, 2013, CFPB published its  final rule on ability to repay and QMs (effective January 10, 2014).", "Among other things, CFPB\u2019s final rule establishes general underwriting  criteria for QMs, including that the borrower have a DTI ratio of less than  or equal to 43 percent. As previously discussed, FHA underwriting  standards allow some borrowers to have DTI ratios that are greater than  43 percent. While acknowledging that many borrowers with high DTI  ratios likely could afford mortgages, CFPB was concerned that lenders  would not make loans to these consumers in light of the current economic  conditions. As a result, CFPB expanded the definition of a QM to include  any loan that is eligible to be purchased, guaranteed, or insured by  various federal agencies, including FHA, VA, USDA, and USDA\u2019s RHS, or  by the enterprises while they are operating under conservatorship. This  rule is temporary and in general will remain in effect until these agencies  finalize their own QM regulations. According to FHA, the agency is  currently developing its QM regulations.", "The Dodd-Frank Act also requires mortgage securitizers to retain a  financial exposure of no less than 5 percent of the credit risk of any  securitized residential mortgage that does not meet a separate set of  criteria (to be defined by regulators) that are associated with a lower risk  of default. Securitized mortgages that meet these criteria are exempt  from this risk retention requirement and are considered QRM. All FHA- insured mortgages are exempt from the risk-retention requirement, and  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages are exempt as long as the  agencies are in conservatorship. Federal regulators published a proposed  QRM rule on April 29, 2011, that included a 20 percent down-payment  requirement. However, federal regulators issued another proposed rule  on August 28, 2013. The new proposed rule offers two approaches.  The first approach would define a QRM to have the same meaning as the  term QM defined by the CFPB and, thus, would not include a down- payment requirement. The alternative approach, which according to the  regulators \u201cwas not selected as the preferred approach,\u201d would require  lenders to retain risk in any loan with a down payment of less than 30  percent.", "Because the QM and QRM regulations will affect whether and at what  price the conventional market will be willing to serve higher-risk  borrowers, some have suggested that they could push these borrowers to  FHA. For example, a recent HUD paper outlined several factors that may  make higher-risk borrowers migrate to FHA: (1) conventional lenders are  unlikely to originate non-QM loans (which by definition are also non-QRM  loans, as QRM is a subset of QM) because they will face significantly  higher capital retention requirements; (2) lenders that are willing to  originate non-QM loans will do so only at a higher cost to the borrower;  and (3) the April 2011 QRM proposal is quite narrow, requiring for  example, that borrowers make a 20 percent down payment, which may  be a difficult threshold for first-time borrowers to meet. Another paper  we reviewed concurred, positing that the April 2011 proposed QRM rule  could make it extremely difficult to securitize high-LTV loans made to first- time home buyers and other borrowers who could prudently manage low  down-payment mortgages, resulting in a flood of loans to the enterprises  and FHA.most of these loans could flow to FHA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Resolution of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Could Impact FHA\u2019s Role", "paragraphs": ["On September 6, 2008, FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into  conservatorship because of concern that their deteriorating financial  condition threatened the stability of the financial markets. According to  FHFA, the two enterprises had a worldwide debt and other financial  obligations totaling $5.4 trillion at the time they were placed in  conservatorship. Defaulting on those obligations would have significantly  disrupted the U.S. financial system. While the conservatorships can  remain in place indefinitely as efforts are undertaken to stabilize Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac and restore confidence in financial markets, FHFA  has said that the conservatorships were not intended to be permanent.  Recent policy changes and proposals on how to restructure or wind down  the two enterprises are likely to have an impact on FHA\u2019s role in the  mortgage market.", "In August 2012, FHFA directed the enterprises to increase their  guarantee fees on single-family mortgages by an average of 10 basis  points. According to FHFA, the increase represented a step toward  encouraging greater participation in the mortgage market by private firms.  One impact of this change could be to push business to FHA.", "In addition, in February 2011, Treasury and HUD jointly issued a proposal  for reforming the federal role in housing finance. The proposal would  make private markets the primary source of mortgage credit and would  place the burden of losses on the private market. In addition, banks would  be required to adhere to underwriting standards that were more  conservative than those currently in place and that would require  homeowners to hold more equity in their homes. The plan also includes  proposals for reducing the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and  ultimately winding down both institutions, while at the same time ensuring  access to quality, affordable housing. To this end, the report presents  several proposals for structuring the government\u2019s long-term role in a  housing finance system in which the private sector is the dominant  provider of mortgage credit:", "Option 1. A privatized system of housing finance with the government  insurance role limited to FHA, USDA, and VA assistance for narrowly  targeted groups of borrowers.", "Option 2. A privatized system of housing finance with assistance from  FHA, USDA, and VA for narrowly targeted groups of borrowers and a  guarantee mechanism that could be scaled up during times of crisis.", "Option 3. A privatized system of housing finance with FHA, USDA,   and VA assistance for low- and moderate-income borrowers and  catastrophic reinsurance behind significant private capital.", "Under each of these options, FHA would continue to play a central role in  providing mortgage credit to low- and moderate-income borrowers.", "In a 2009 report, we also identified several options for revising the  structure of the enterprises and outlined a framework for identifying the  trade-offs associated with them:  reconstitute the enterprises as for-profit corporations with government  sponsorship but place additional restrictions on them, establish the enterprises as government corporations or agencies, or privatize or terminate the enterprises.", "In evaluating the trade-offs associated with these options, we noted that  the credit needs of certain groups no longer served by the enterprises  could be met by FHA. However, we also pointed out that some have  questioned FHA\u2019s capacity to manage large increases in its business,  which could raise taxpayer risks. In addition, we previously had identified  \u201cmodernizing the U.S. financial regulatory system\u201d as a high-risk area.  Because of continuing uncertainty over the resolution of Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac, the potential impact of their resolution on FHA, and  concerns about FHA\u2019s financial condition, in February 2013 we included  FHA in this high-risk area, now called \u201cmodernizing the U.S. financial  regulatory system and the federal role in housing finance.\u201d", "As of March 31, 2013, over 90 percent of new mortgage volume had  federal backing, either through FHA and Ginnie Mae or the enterprises.  The heightened federal role in mortgage lending and the increased  reliance on FHA insurance highlights the need for policymakers to ensure  that changes made to FHA and the enterprises recognize the  interdependence of these entities and that changes to federal regulations  governing the mortgage market consider the interaction between public  and private capital and reflect the roles and capacities of the agencies.  Ultimately, FHA\u2019s place in the housing finance system will depend on how  the private market reacts to new regulations and how the federal  government resolves Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It will also depend on  which, if any, of the options outlined in this report policymakers pursue  and how they are implemented."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft report to HUD for review and comment, and HUD  had no comments.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We reviewed and summarized the  literature identifying options for change at FHA, including congressional  testimonies and other documents from mortgage market participants  (such as the Mortgage Bankers Association) and researchers (such as  the Urban Institute, Cato Institute, and others). As noted above, we sorted  these options into three categories: changes related to product terms and  conditions, changes that could affect the market FHA serves, and  changes related to FHA\u2019s organizational structure or powers. We also  reviewed and summarized the literature for implications associated with  the proposed options (including the effects on the cost or risk to the  taxpayer, borrowers\u2019 access to credit, FHA\u2019s role and the market it  serves, and other mortgage market participants). Finally, we reviewed  these materials for information on broader housing refinance issues that  may affect FHA, including mortgage reforms and proposals for reform of  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises.  We assessed the reliability of the key studies we used and determined  them to be reliable for our purposes.

To determine the  reliability of this information, we reviewed information on the data and  queried FHA officials about how its data are collected, verified, and  maintained to identify potential data limitations. The FHA officials agreed  these data were generally accurate and complete. Based on this work, we  concluded that the data we received from FHA were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. We also used data published by Inside Mortgage  Finance on mortgage originations for the first quarter of 2013. To  determine the reliability of these data, we reviewed information on the  data source and queried a knowledgeable official about the accuracy of  the data.
