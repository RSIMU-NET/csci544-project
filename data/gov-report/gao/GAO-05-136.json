Subsequently, the department issued a management directive and drafted guidance for using other transactions, loosely modeled on the practices of the Department of Defense (DOD), one of several other agencies with other transactions authority and the one with the most experience with using these agreements. Unlike DOD, however, DHS has not specified in its policies or guidance when its contracting staff should consider the use of independent audits to help ensure, for example, that payments to contractors are accurate. Similarly, DHS has not established training requirements to aid staff in understanding and leveraging the benefits of other transactions. The DHS contracting workforce is limited in size and capacity, which could impede the department's ability to manage a potential increase in its other transactions workload. DHS is taking steps to enhance the capacity of its contracting workforce. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate included nontraditional government contractors in its first two other transactions projects. The Directorate engaged in extensive outreach efforts, such as conducting briefings on its mission and research needs to industry and academic institutions and using a number of Web-based tools to publicize its solicitations.

We also reviewed other S&T Directorate solicitations  that could result in other transactions agreements, but which had not yet  resulted in awards as of the completion of our audit work. We analyzed  information obtained from our interviews and file reviews using criteria  that we found are generally important to federal acquisitions, namely,  planning, reviews and approvals, market knowledge, and monitoring of  contractor performance.

Other transactions authority is one of the  acquisition tools\u2014in addition to standard FAR contracts, grants, and  cooperative agreements\u2014available to DHS to help support its mission.  Other transactions were created to enhance the federal government\u2019s  ability to acquire cutting-edge science and technology. They help agencies  accomplish this, in part, through attracting nontraditional contractors  from the private sector and other areas that typically have stayed away  from pursuing government contracts. There are two types of other  transactions authorities\u2014(1) research and (2) prototype. Other  transactions for research are used to perform basic, applied, or advanced  research. Other transactions for prototypes are used to carry out projects  to develop  prototypes used to evaluate the technical or manufacturing  feasibility of a particular technology, process, or system. A single S&T  program could result in multiple awards using other transactions.", "Because they are exempt from certain statutes, other transactions permit  considerable latitude by agencies and contractors in negotiating  agreement terms. For example, other transactions allow the federal  government flexibility in negotiating intellectual property and data rights,  which stipulate whether the government or the contractor will own the  rights to technology developed under the other transactions agreement.  Table 1 shows the statutes that DHS has determined are generally  inapplicable to its other transactions agreements.", "Because other transactions agreements do not have a standard structure  based on regulatory guidelines, they can be challenging to create and  administer. Experts on other transactions and industry officials who have  used these procurement arrangements told us that other transactions  agreement terms are significantly different from FAR contracts and more  closely resemble procurement agreements between private-sector firms.  According to DHS, the unique nature of other transactions agreements  means that federal government acquisition staff who work with other  transactions agreements should have experience in planning and  conducting research and development acquisitions, strong business  acumen, and sound judgment to enable them to operate in a relatively  unstructured business environment.", "DHS views the use of other transactions as key to attracting nontraditional  government contractors\u2014typically high-technology firms that do not work  with the government\u2014that can offer solutions to meet agency needs.

For example, in  October 2003, the S&T Directorate held an industry day session for its  Counter-MANPADS project. The session provided participants with  background on the project, the structure of the DHS organization that  would manage it, the program\u2019s goals and schedule, and an overview of  other transactions for prototypes. DHS presented detailed information on  the nature and requirements of other transactions agreements, firms that  may qualify as a nontraditional contractor, and laws that would not apply  to other transactions. In addition, the S&T Directorate gave an overview of  the other transactions solicitation process to be used for the project,  which covered topics such as the white paper process, oral presentations,  and the proposed other transactions agreement. DHS attracted almost  200 participants to this event\u2014approximately 85 percent of whom were  from industry.", "Also, in September 2003, DHS held a bidders conference for its Chem-Bio  project where it described its technical requirements and the solicitation  process for this project. According to an agency official, the conference  gave DHS the opportunity to obtain input from the private sector on the  technical aspects of its solicitation and to answer participants\u2019 questions  about the solicitation. Similarly, DHS held technical workshops for  projects that may result in other transactions awards, such as those  intended to counter threats from truck, suicide, and public transportation  bombs and to design cyber security systems.", "DHS also created and used Web sites to publicize its activities and  procurement needs. For example, DHS created the \u201cDHS\u2014Open for  Business\u201d site, which centralizes information on its contracts, grants, small  business opportunities, and R&D efforts. According to DHS, this site is  intended to complement governmentwide portals such as Federal  Business Opportunities, known as FedBizOpps. In addition, HSARPA  created a solicitation and teaming portal Web site to help attract firms  (www.hsarpabaa.com). On this site, HSARPA announces its current  project solicitations and offers a teaming portal where contractors can  learn about possible partners to bid on DHS work. This site also contains  links to other DHS programs to facilitate industry participation in its  projects, such as its Small Business Innovation Research program, which  DHS established in December 2003 to increase the participation of  innovative and creative small businesses in its R&D programs. Also, the  site has a mailing list function where contractors can register to receive  electronic e-mail notices of upcoming HSARPA solicitations.", "We found that industry\u2019s views vary on the effectiveness of DHS\u2019s  outreach efforts. Some contractors and industry associations we  interviewed said these outreach efforts are having a positive impact on the  procurement process. For example, an industry association head in the  technology field told us that DHS\u2019s use of Broad Agency Announcements  and other flexible solicitation methods to publicize its technology and  research needs may help to attract nontraditional contractors. Officials  from two technology associations told us commercial firms that  traditionally do not work with the federal government believe that  government officials have preconceived ideas of exactly what technology  they need and which contractors they want to work with. However, one of  the officials stated that DHS\u2019s use of the BAA process demonstrates to  industry that the agency desires to hear all the possible technology  solutions that may meet its needs.", "Other industry officials believed that DHS\u2019s outreach actions could be  improved, for example, if DHS took additional actions to inform industry  that it has other transactions authority and developed a more user-friendly  process to attract broader interest in its projects. Representatives of a  large industry association we interviewed were not aware that DHS  possesses other transactions authority and said if this fact were more  widely known, it could increase industry\u2019s interest in working with DHS.  In addition, representatives of some small companies told us that the fee  DHS charges to attend its outreach events could pose a barrier to  attending them. Also, several contractors we interviewed told us that  DHS\u2019s teaming portal site is a good idea in concept but found it  cumbersome to maneuver in the automated system. However, two of the  nontraditional contractors we interviewed that received a DHS other  transactions award used this site to help identify industry partners for  their team."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Systematic Assessment of Acquisition Activities Involving Other Transactions Impairs Ability to Capture and Use Knowledge", "paragraphs": ["The S&T Directorate\u2019s capacity to build and sustain knowledge for use in  its future acquisitions involving other transactions is in the early stages of  development but the Directorate has not yet developed policies or  procedures to ensure that program and portfolio managers are capturing  and assessing critical information and knowledge gained from its  acquisition activities, including the use of other transactions, for use in  future projects.", "Knowledge gained from prior other transactions acquisitions on issues  ranging from seeking nontraditional government contractors to assessing  project outcomes is key to planning future projects. A knowledge base of  important lessons learned from outreach to private-sector firms, the  acquisition process, and the design and execution of projects can facilitate  the work of program and acquisition staff in planning future acquisitions  using other transactions authority. DHS\u2019s draft guidebook on other  transactions for prototypes acknowledges the importance of documenting  knowledge gained during the acquisition process for planning future other  transactions acquisitions. We have also reported on the benefits of  agencies using systematic methods to collect, verify, store, and  disseminate information for use by their current and future employees.  Our previous work has identified the importance of setting goals and  identifying performance indicators that will inform federal agencies of  whether they have achieved the performance they expected.  S&T  Directorate officials acknowledge the need to create a \u201ccorporate  memory\u201d function to provide future staff with access to information and  knowledge obtained from its current projects and to incorporate such  knowledge into its training efforts.", "The S&T Directorate\u2019s workforce-staffing strategy necessitates that it have  a policy and procedure in place to capture employees\u2019 knowledge. Under  its current workforce strategy, the S&T Directorate\u2019s technical staff serves  regularly rotating term appointments that typically do not exceed 4 years.  This approach, according to S&T Directorate officials, is designed to  promote the influx of leading-edge science and technology skills to DHS.", "S&T Directorate officials recognize that these rotations can place a burden  on its contracting staff that plan, conduct, and manage highly specialized  other transactions programs by having to continually guide new technical  staff on the workings of the process. However, these officials have told us  that there is no policy or process yet in place to ensure that the capturing  and sharing of such knowledge occur.", "The S&T Directorate\u2019s current practices for capturing knowledge gained  from its acquisition efforts vary. In establishing its structure the S&T  Directorate drew its technical staff from a variety of organizations, each of  which used different acquisition approaches. Consequently, portfolio  managers and program managers we spoke with did not consistently  capture knowledge acquired. In addition, the S&T Directorate\u2019s efforts to  assess the effectiveness of its industry outreach activities involving the use  of other transactions authority are not rigorous enough to capture  information needed in planning future outreach. By not assessing its  activities, S&T cannot be assured that it is reaching the broadest base of  firms to provide technological solutions for the S&T Directorate\u2019s needs.", "Without policies and a supporting process to capture the experiences and  knowledge gained from its acquisition efforts, DHS may not capitalize on  lessons learned from its early use other transactions. Given the S&T  Directorate\u2019s planned rotations of its key technical staff, building and  maintaining institutional knowledge are critical to ensuring that new S&T  Directorate staff have the ability to quickly learn about previous other  transactions acquisitions when designing future projects. For example, the  S&T Directorate invests funding and staff resources to advertise its  organization and projects to help attract firms but does not fully assess  the effectiveness of these activities for use in planning future projects.

In doing so it signaled its seriousness about  using other transactions authority to advance its strategic objectives.  However, to sustain its progress made to date DHS needs to take  additional actions, such as completing the necessary foundation of  policies and procedures, including guidance on audit provisions, and  ensuring that it has an adequately trained and staffed acquisition function.  Furthermore, given its strategy of using regularly rotating term  appointments in staffing its S&T programs, long-term success will depend  on the department\u2019s ability to harness its institutional knowledge on other  transactions. DHS\u2019s ability to identify, prioritize, and access the most  promising research and technologies in the future will depend, in part, on  its ability to capture and make accessible critical knowledge on the  agency\u2019s use of other transactions authority to ensure that it is accessing  the broadest and most appropriate technologies in the marketplace.

Regarding our recommendation that DHS capture knowledge obtained  during the acquisition process for use in planning and implementing future  projects that could use other transactions, DHS agreed with the utility of  retaining such historical information and \u201clessons learned\u201d about its  procurement activities, acquisition planning, execution, and program  management activities.  DHS stated that while no formal system for  assembling such information is in place within the organization, this  information is being monitored.  However, DHS sought further clarity  about the types of information we recommend it retain and to what end it  is to be used.", "Based on our review of DHS\u2019s early use of its other transactions authority,  we believe that systematically capturing, analyzing, and making readily  available knowledge about using this authority is needed.  We recognize  that the S&T Directorate\u2019s work and focus cuts across various technology  areas, which are continuously evolving, making each solicitation\u2019s  requirements unique.  We also recognize and appreciate DHS\u2019s concern  over the administrative aspects of collecting, maintaining, and monitoring  this information over time.  We believe, however, that DHS can build upon  its current informal system of monitoring acquisition information.   Specifically, we think DHS could collect and disseminate information on  what has worked and not worked in areas such as outreach efforts. This  information could be useful for future other transactions projects. For  example, if DHS wants to ensure that its outreach attracts firms who have  a recognized core competency desired by S&T, including nontraditional  government contractors, it may want to use forms of outreach that have  been used successfully in the past.  We believe this information could be  particularly important given the S&T Directorate\u2019s workforce-staffing  strategies, under which its technical staff serves regularly rotating term  appointments.", "DHS also provided technical revisions to our draft report, which we  incorporated as appropriate.
