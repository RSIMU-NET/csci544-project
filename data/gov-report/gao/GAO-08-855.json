This report discusses (1) the extent to which selected agencies have information on the post-government employment activities of former senior federal employees who represent foreign principals and (2) the challenges the agencies face in enforcing these requirements. We reviewed federal ethics guidance, laws, and other documents, and interviewed officials at the Departments of State and the Treasury, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Trade Representative."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Executive branch agencies are not required to and do not collect and maintain information on the post-government employment activities of former senior federal employees who represent foreign principals. Post-government employment restrictions prohibit former senior federal employees from engaging in certain activities, such as lobbying or other advocacy communications, for a specified period of time after leaving federal service. The agencies we reviewed undertake a variety of activities, including providing training and advice, to promote compliance with the restrictions. The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) requires that all persons in the United States working as agents of a foreign government, foreign political party, or other foreign principal disclose to the Department of Justice (Justice) such connections as well as the activities they perform on behalf of such principals in the United States. Justice provides information on FARA registration requirements to the public. It also collects information on all entities that register with Justice as foreign agents. However, the registration information does not identify individuals who are former senior federal employees. Nevertheless, of the nearly 8,000 senior federal employees who left government service between calendar years 2000 and 2007, we identified 29 who registered as foreign agents and engaged in activities that ranged from promoting tourism to lobbying on behalf of foreign principals such as the governments of Argentina and Saudi Arabia. This number may not include all former senior federal employees who represent foreign entities because individuals engaged in exempted activities under FARA, such as diplomatic, commercial, and legal activities, and those registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, are not required to register. The agencies we reviewed face information, legal, and resource challenges in promoting compliance with the post-government employment restrictions and monitoring FARA. One challenge is inconsistent documentation of advice provided to senior federal employees on post-government employment restrictions. While agencies document information such as ethics training courses given, subject matters covered, and counseling services offered, they do not consistently keep records of what advice was given to specific employees. The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) has encouraged the executive branch agencies to document such advice. For example, a 2005 OGE memorandum to all designated agency ethics officials discussed the advantages of documenting advice and offered suggestions on when to document ethics advice. Documentation of advice is useful for proving intent, which can help to prosecute violations of the restrictions. In addition, a lack of clear legal authority and a lack of resources have been cited by Justice as barriers to increased monitoring of FARA compliance. For example, Justice officials said the department does not have clear legal authority to inspect the records of persons that it believes should be registered and that the department does not have the authority to require advance written notification from persons claiming to be exempt from FARA requirements. Without advance written notification, Justice has no way of knowing whether persons exempting themselves should in fact be registered."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Congress has enacted specific post-government employment restrictions  designed to protect the U.S. government from the improper use of  government information or other undue influence by former government  employees. The restrictions prohibit federal employees from engaging in  certain activities, such as lobbying or other advocacy communications, for  a specified period of time after leaving federal service. For example, the  restrictions include a ban, for 1 year, on all senior and very senior  employees of federal agencies, Members of Congress, and congressional  staff from performing certain representational or advocacy activities on  behalf of a foreign government, before any U.S. government official, with  the intent to influence a decision of the government official.

FARA requires anyone\u2014including all individuals, not just former federal  employees\u2014representing foreign principals in certain activities to register  with the Department of Justice (Justice) and file forms outlining their  agreements with, income from, and expenditures on behalf of the foreign  principal. FARA provides certain exemptions to registration, such as for  diplomatic or humanitarian activities. Persons who engage in such  activities on behalf of a foreign principal are not required to notify Justice  they are claiming an exemption.", "Our past work has found problems with the U.S. government\u2019s  implementation of these laws. For example, in 1980 Justice officials stated  that as a result of improperly taken exemptions, Justice believed that there  were more active agents than those registered. Also, according to Justice  then and now, exemptions, such as those allowed for commercial and  legal activities, were broadly written and fostered differing interpretations.  In addition, Justice stated that some changes could be made to improve  enforcement of FARA, such as providing Justice with subpoena power for  use in cases of suspected unregistered agents. In 1990, we reported that  Justice had not implemented a 1980 GAO recommendation to seek  authority to (1) give the Justice Department additional enforcement  measures, including administrative subpoena powers, and (2) require  individuals to submit written notification of all exemption claims prior to  engaging in the representation of a foreign principal. In 1991, Justice  sought to obtain such authority; however, the l991 legislation was not  passed.", "In response to your request, we examined efforts by OGE, Justice, and  four agencies involved in international activities to enforce post- government employment restrictions on former senior federal employees  who represent foreign principals.

We  also interviewed officials at selected executive branch agencies that work  on issues directly related to bilateral relations, including the Departments  of State (State) and the Treasury (Treasury), the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID), and the Office of United States Trade  Representative (USTR), and analyzed documents at those agencies to  understand how the agencies notify employees of post-government  employment restrictions. We also reviewed the procedures used by  Justice\u2019s Registration Unit to identify and address unregistered agents. To  identify the number of senior-level federal officials who registered as  foreign agents after leaving government service between calendar years  2000 and 2007, we obtained a list from Justice of all individuals registered  as foreign agents during those years, and provided these names to the  Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to match against all executive  branch senior federal employees in its Central Personnel Data File  (CPDF). To accomplish the second objective, we reviewed past and  proposed legislation and other documents describing agency regulations,  policies, and procedures and interviewed OGE, Justice, State, Treasury,  USAID, and USTR officials.

Among other requirements, the post-government  employment restrictions permanently prohibit former federal employees  from representing a private company or organization before any federal  agency on particular matters involving specific parties, which they  personally and substantially handled while working for the federal  government. The law also restricts former federal employees from  representing anyone before the official\u2019s former agency for defined  cooling-off periods that vary according to the former official\u2019s involvement  and seniority.

We initially included State, Treasury, USAID, and  USTR in our scope because these agencies work on issues directly related  to country bilateral relations and were thus likely to have former senior  employees registered as foreign agents. We subsequently analyzed  employment information on the 29 foreign agents that we identified who  were former senior federal employees to determine if any additional  executive branch agencies had large numbers of former employees  registered as foreign agents.

We provided these names to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  to match against all executive branch senior federal employees in its  Central Personnel Data File (CPDF). As computerized name matching can  be difficult because of inconsistent use or spelling of titles, first names,  middle names and initials, hyphenated names, and suffixes between  different data sets, we asked OPM to make their initial match as broad as  possible, so that we could manually check a broad range of potential or  near matches. OPM provided us with a list of 183 individuals (of the nearly  8,000 senior employees who left government service between 2000 and  2007) containing both exact and near matches. In addition, we received  descriptive information on each of the 183 individuals, including date of  birth, year of departure from federal service, and former federal agency.", "We manually reviewed the 183 names and eliminated 139 of them that  clearly were not matches, for example, ones where the last name was spelt  differently, or the first name was completely different. This procedure  narrowed the list to 44 individuals. Finally, we obtained the registration  statements for all 44 individuals from the FARA Registration Unit and  matched birth dates. From this process, we identified 29 former senior  federal officials that registered as foreign agents between calendar years  2000 and 2007. In addition, we compared the dates the former senior level  officials had registered with FARA against the dates on which they had  officially separated from the federal government, and identified those  officials whose registrations occurred less than 1 year after their  separations. The scope of our review did not include assessing compliance  with the post-government employment restrictions by any of the former 29  former senior federal level employees who registered as foreign agents.", "We defined former senior federal officials as (1) federal employees paid on  the Executive Schedule and (2) federal employees whose pay was 86.5  percent of level II of the Executive Schedule.", "To identify the key challenges the U.S. government faces in enforcing post- government employment restrictions and FARA requirements, we  reviewed past GAO reports and analyzed past legislation and other  documents on the issue. We also interviewed OGE, State, Treasury,  USAID, and USTR ethics officials; State, Treasury, and USAID Inspector  General officials; and officials of Justice\u2019s FARA Registration Unit and its  Criminal Division to obtain their views on the challenges. We conducted  our work from September 2007 to June 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: FARA Exemptions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Activities Performed by Former Senior Federal Employees on Behalf of Foreign Entities", "paragraphs": ["Engaged in political activities, as well as  monitoring and advising foreign principals  on U.S. policy-making process with regard  to the Republic of China, government of  India, state of Qatar and the Kurdish  Democratic Party of Iraq.
