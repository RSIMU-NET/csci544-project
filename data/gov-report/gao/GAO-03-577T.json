In today\u2019s health care sector, there are few  incentives for providers and consumers to be prudent in their ordering and  use of health care services, too little transparency with regard to the value  and costs of care, and inadequate accountability to ensure that health care  plans and providers meet standards for appropriate use and quality.", "These problems cannot be solved overnight.

From 1990 through 2000, spending nearly doubled from  about $696 billion to about $1.3 trillion (see fig. 1). From 2000 through  2010, the rate of spending growth is expected to accelerate somewhat,  resulting in an estimated $2.7 trillion in total annual health care spending  by the end of the period. Increases in medical prices account for a little  more than half of the 20-year spending increase, while increases in the use  of services\u2014owing to population growth and rise in the number of  services used per person\u2014and more expensive services account for the  rest.", "The rapid growth in health care spending means that an increasing share  of the nation\u2019s output, as measured by GDP, will be devoted to the  production of health care services and goods.

HI, which pays  for inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing care, hospice, and certain home  health services, is financed by a payroll tax. Like Social Security, HI has  always been largely a pay-as-you-go system. SMI, which pays for physician  and outpatient hospital services, diagnostic tests, and certain other  medical services, is financed by a combination of general revenues and  beneficiary premiums. Beneficiary premiums pay for about one-fourth of  SMI benefits, with the remainder financed by general revenues. These  complex financing arrangements mean that current workers\u2019 taxes  primarily pay for current retirees\u2019 benefits except for those financed by  SMI premiums.", "As a result, the relative numbers of workers and beneficiaries have a major  impact on Medicare\u2019s financing. The ratio, however, is changing. In the  future, relatively fewer workers will be available to shoulder Medicare\u2019s  financial burden. In 2002 there were 4.9 working-age persons (18 to 64  years) per elderly person, but by 2030, this ratio is projected to decline to  2.8. For the HI portion of Medicare, in 2002 there were nearly 4 covered  workers per HI beneficiary. Under the Trustees\u2019 intermediate 2003  estimates, the Medicare Trustees project that by 2030 there will be only 2.4  covered workers per HI beneficiary. (See fig. 4.)", "The demographic challenge facing the system has several causes. People  are retiring early and living longer. As the baby boom generation ages, the  share of the population age 65 and over will escalate rapidly. A falling  fertility rate is the other principal factor underlying the growth in the  elderly\u2019s share of the population. In the 1960s, the fertility rate was an  average of 3 children per woman. Today it is a little over 2, and by 2030 it  is expected to fall to 1.95\u2014a rate that is below replacement. The  combination of the aging of the baby boom generation, increased  longevity, and a lower fertility rate will drive the elderly as a share of total  population from today\u2019s 12 percent to almost 20 percent in 2030.", "Taken together, these trends threaten both the financial solvency and  sustainability of this important program. Labor force growth will continue  to decline and by 2025 is expected to be less than a third of what it is  today. (See fig. 5.) Relatively fewer workers will be available to produce  the goods and services that all will consume. Without a major increase in  productivity, low labor force growth will lead to slower growth in the  economy and slower growth of federal revenues. This in turn will only  accentuate the overall pressure on the federal budget. This slowing labor  force growth is not always recognized as part of the Medicare debate, but  it is expected to affect the ability of the federal budget and the economy to  sustain Medicare\u2019s projected spending in the coming years.", "The demographic trends I have described will affect both Medicare and  Social Security, but Medicare presents a much greater, more complex, and  more urgent challenge. Unlike Social Security, Medicare spending growth  rates reflect not only a burgeoning beneficiary population, but also the  escalation of health care costs at rates well exceeding general rates of  inflation. The growth of medical technology has contributed to increases  in the number and quality of health care services. Moreover, the actual  costs of health care consumption are not transparent. Third-party payers  largely insulate covered consumers from the cost of health care decisions.  These factors and others contribute to making Medicare a greater and  more complex fiscal challenge than even Social Security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HI\u2019s Trust Fund Faces Cash Flow Problems Long before the HI Trust Fund Is Projected to Be Insolvent", "paragraphs": ["Current projections of future HI income and outlays illustrate the timing  and severity of Medicare\u2019s fiscal challenge. Today, the HI Trust Fund takes  in more in taxes than it spends. Largely because of the known  demographic trends I have described, this situation will change. Under the  Trustees\u2019 2003 intermediate assumptions, program outlays are expected to  begin to exceed program tax revenues in 2013 (see fig. 6). To finance these  cash deficits, HI will need to draw on the special-issue Treasury securities  acquired during the years of cash surpluses. For HI to \u201credeem\u201d its  securities, the government will need to obtain cash through some  combination of increased taxes, spending cuts, and/or increased  borrowing from the public (or, if the unified budget is in surplus, less debt  reduction than would otherwise have been the case). Neither the decline  in the cash surpluses nor the cash deficits will affect the payment of  benefits, but the negative cash flow will place increased pressure on the  federal budget to raise the resources necessary to meet the program\u2019s  ongoing costs. This pressure will only increase when Social Security also  experiences negative cash flow and joins HI as a net claimant on the rest  of the budget.", "The gap between HI income and costs shows the severity of HI\u2019s financing  problem over the longer term. This gap can also be expressed relative to  taxable payroll (the HI Trust Fund\u2019s funding base) over a 75-year period.  This year, under the Trustees 2003 intermediate estimates, the 75-year  actuarial deficit is projected to be 2.40 percent of taxable payroll\u2014a  significant increase from last year\u2019s projected deficit of 2.02 percent. This  means that to bring the HI Trust Fund into balance over the 75-year  period, either program outlays would have to be immediately reduced by  42 percent or program income immediately increased by 71 percent, or  some combination of the two. These estimates of what it would take to  achieve 75-year trust fund solvency understate the extent of the problem  because the program\u2019s financial imbalance gets worse in the 76th and  subsequent years. Every year that passes we drop a positive year and add a  much bigger deficit year.", "The projected exhaustion date of the HI Trust Fund is a commonly used  indicator of HI\u2019s financial condition. Under the Trustees 2003 intermediate  estimates, the HI Trust Fund is projected to exhaust its assets in 2026. This  solvency indicator provides information about HI\u2019s financial condition, but  it is not an adequate measure of Medicare\u2019s sustainability for several  reasons. HI Trust Fund balances do not provide meaningful information on  the government\u2019s fiscal capacity to pay benefits when program cash  inflows fall below program outlays. As I have described, the government  would need to come up with cash from other sources to pay for benefits  once outlays exceeded program tax income.", "In addition, the HI Trust Fund measure provides no information on SMI.  SMI\u2019s expenditures, which account for about 43 percent of total Medicare  spending, are projected to grow even faster than those of HI in the near  future. Moreover, Medicare\u2019s complex structure and financing  arrangements mean that a shift of expenditures from HI to SMI can extend  the solvency of the HI Trust Fund, creating the appearance of an  improvement in program\u2019s financial condition. For example, the Balanced  Budget Act of 1997 modified the home health benefit, which resulted in  shifting a portion of home health spending from the HI Trust Fund to SMI.  Although this shift extended HI Trust Fund solvency, it increased the draw  on general revenues and beneficiary SMI premiums while generating little  net savings.", "Ultimately, the critical question is not how much a trust fund has in assets,  but whether the government as a whole and the economy can afford the  promised benefits now and in the future and at what cost to other claims  on scarce resources. To better monitor and communicate changes in  future total program spending, new measures of Medicare\u2019s sustainability  are needed. As program changes are made, a continued need will exist for  measures of program sustainability that can signal potential future fiscal  imbalance. Such measures might include the percentage of program  funding provided by general revenues, the percentage of total federal  revenues or gross domestic product devoted to Medicare, or program  spending per enrollee. As such measures are developed, questions would  need to be asked about actions to be taken if projections showed that  program expenditures would exceed the chosen level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Absent Reform of Medicare and Other Entitlements for the Elderly, Budgetary Flexibility Will Disappear", "paragraphs": ["Taken together, Medicare\u2019s HI and SMI expenditures are expected to  increase dramatically, rising from about 12 percent of federal revenues in  2002 to more than one-quarter by midcentury. The budgetary challenge  posed by the growth in Medicare becomes even more significant in  combination with the expected growth in Medicaid and Social Security  spending. This growth in spending on federal entitlements for retirees will  become increasingly unsustainable over the longer term, compounding an  ongoing decline in budgetary flexibility. Over the past few decades,  spending on mandatory programs has consumed an ever-increasing share  of the federal budget.  In 1962, prior to the creation of the Medicare and  Medicaid programs, spending for mandatory programs plus net interest  accounted for about 32 percent of total federal spending. By 2002, this  share had almost doubled to approximately 63 percent of the budget.

These simulations continue to show that to move  into the future with no changes in federal retirement and health programs  is to envision a very different role for the federal government. Assuming,  for example, that the tax reductions enacted in 2001 do not sunset and  discretionary spending keeps pace with the economy, by midcentury  federal revenues may be inadequate to pay Social Security and interest on  the federal debt. Spending for the current Medicare program\u2014without any  additional new benefits\u2014is projected to account for more than one- quarter of all federal revenues. To obtain budget balance, massive  spending cuts, tax increases, or some combination of the two would be  necessary. (See fig.8). Neither slowing the growth of discretionary  spending nor allowing the tax reductions to sunset eliminates the  imbalance. In addition, while additional economic growth would help ease  our burden, the projected fiscal gap is too great for us to grow our way out  of the problem.", "Indeed, long-term budgetary flexibility is about more than Social Security  and Medicare. While these programs dominate the long-term outlook, they  are not the only federal programs or activities that bind the future. The  federal government undertakes a wide range of programs, responsibilities,  and activities that obligate it to future spending or create an expectation  for spending. Our recent report describes the range and measurement of  such fiscal exposures\u2014from explicit liabilities such as environmental  cleanup requirements to the more implicit obligations presented by life- cycle costs of capital acquisition or disaster assistance. Making  government fit the challenges of the future will require not only dealing  with the drivers\u2014entitlements for the elderly\u2014but also looking at the  range of other federal activities.

At the same time,  the demographic trends and projected rates of growth in health care  spending I have described will mean rapid growth in entitlement spending.  Taken together, these projections raise serious questions about the  capacity of the relatively smaller number of future workers to absorb the  rapidly escalating costs of these programs.", "As HI trust fund assets are redeemed to pay Medicare benefits and SMI  expenditures continue to grow, the program will constitute a claim on real  resources in the future. As a result, taking action now to increase the  future pool of resources is important. To echo Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan, the crucial issue of saving in our economy relates to our  ability to build an adequate capital stock to produce enough goods and  services in the future to accommodate both retirees and workers in the  future. The most direct way the federal government can raise national  saving is by increasing government saving, that is, as the economy returns  to a higher growth path, a balanced fiscal policy that recognizes our long- term challenges can help provide a strong foundation for economic growth  and can enhance our future budgetary flexibility. It is my hope that we will  think about the unprecedented challenge facing future generations in our  aging society. Putting Medicare on a sustainable path for the future would  help fulfill this generation\u2019s stewardship responsibility to succeeding  generations. It would also help to preserve some capacity for future  generations to make their own choices for what role they want the federal  government to play.", "As with Social Security, both sustainability and solvency considerations  drive us to address Medicare\u2019s fiscal challenges sooner rather than later.  HI Trust Fund exhaustion may be more than 20 years away, but the  squeeze on the federal budget will begin as the baby boom generation  begins to retire. This will begin as early as 2008, when the leading edge of  the baby boom generation becomes eligible for early retirement. CBO\u2019s  current 10-year budget and economic outlook reflects this. CBO projects  that economic growth will slow from an average of 3.2 percent a year from  2005 through 2008 to 2.7 percent from 2009 through 2013 reflecting slower  labor force growth. At the same time, annual rates of growth in entitlement  spending will begin to rise. Annual growth in Social Security outlays is  projected to accelerate from 5.2 percent in 2007 to 6.6 percent in 2013.  Annual growth in Medicare enrollees is expected to accelerate from 1.1  percent today to 2.9 percent in 2013.

Under the  Trustees 2003 intermediate assumptions, the present value of HI\u2019s  actuarial deficit is $6.2 trillion. This difficult situation argues for tackling  the greatest needs first and for making any benefit additions part of a  larger structural reform effort.", "The Medicare benefit package, largely designed in 1965, provides virtually  no outpatient drug coverage. Beneficiaries may fill this coverage gap in  various ways. All beneficiaries have the option to purchase supplemental  policies\u2014Medigap\u2014when they first become eligible for Medicare at age  65. Those policies that include drug coverage tend to be expensive and  provide only limited benefits. Some beneficiaries have access to coverage  through employer-sponsored policies or private health plans that contract  to serve Medicare beneficiaries. In recent years, coverage through these  sources has become more expensive and less widely available.  Beneficiaries whose income falls below certain thresholds may qualify for  Medicaid or other public programs. According to one survey, in the fall of  1999, more than one-third of beneficiaries reported that they lacked drug  coverage altogether.", "Medicare also does not limit beneficiaries\u2019 cost-sharing liability.

The burden can, however, be much higher for  beneficiaries with extensive health care needs. In 1999, about 1 million  beneficiaries were liable for more than $5,000, and about 260,000 were  liable for more than $10,000 for covered services. In contrast, employer- sponsored health plans for active workers typically limited maximum  annual out-of-pocket costs for covered services to less than $2,000 per  year for single coverage.", "Modernizing Medicare\u2019s benefit package will require balancing competing  concerns about program sustainability, federal obligations, and the  hardship faced by some beneficiaries. In particular, the addition of a  benefit that has the potential to be extremely expensive\u2014such as  prescription drug coverage\u2014should be focused on meeting the needs  deemed to be of the highest priority. This would entail targeting financial  help to beneficiaries most in need\u2014those with catastrophic drug costs or  low incomes\u2014and, to the extent possible, avoiding the substitution of  public for private insurance coverage.

Health insurers today commonly  design cost-sharing requirements\u2014in the form of deductibles,  coinsurance, and copayments\u2014to ensure that enrollees are aware that  there is a cost associated with the provision of services and to use them  prudently. Ideally, cost-sharing should encourage beneficiaries to evaluate  the need for discretionary care but not discourage necessary care.  Coinsurance or copayments would be required generally for services  considered to be discretionary and potentially overused and would aim to  steer patients to lower cost or better treatment options. Care must be  taken, however, to avoid setting cost-sharing requirements so high as to  create financial barriers to care.", "Medicare fee-for-service cost-sharing rules diverge from these common  insurance industry practices in important ways. For example, Medicare  imposes a relatively high deductible of $840 for hospital admissions, which  are rarely optional. In contrast, Medicare has not increased the part B  deductible since 1991. For the last 12 years, the deductible has remained  constant at $100 and has thus steadily declined as a proportion of  beneficiaries\u2019 real incomes.

Instead, plans  receive a fixed payment from Medicare as prescribed by statute and in  return must provide all Medicare-covered services with the exception of  hospice. Efficient health plans are better able to afford to provide extra  benefits, such as outpatient prescription drug benefits; charge a lower  monthly premium; or both and may do so to attract beneficiaries and  increase market share. Until recently, however, these efficiency and  market share gains were advantageous to beneficiaries and health plans  but generated no savings for Medicare. Even today, the opportunity for the  program to realize savings from competition among Medicare+Choice  health plans remains extremely limited. This experience has shown that  savings are not automatic from simply enrolling beneficiaries in private  health plans.", "The Medicare+Choice experience offers another lesson about private  plans and program savings. That is, as we recommended in 1998, payments  to health plans must be adequately risk-adjusted for the expected health  care costs of the beneficiaries they enroll. Otherwise, the government can  inadequately compensate health plans that enroll less healthy beneficiaries  with higher expected health care costs or will overpay health plans that  enroll relatively healthy beneficiaries with low expected health care costs.  Moreover, health plans will have an incentive to avoid enrolling less  healthy beneficiaries with higher expected health care costs. In 2000, we  reported that the failure to adequately adjust Medicare\u2019s payments to  private health plans for beneficiaries\u2019 expected health care costs  unnecessarily increased Medicare spending by $3.2 billion in 1998.", "A third lesson is that the use of private plans to serve Medicare  beneficiaries may not be feasible in all locations nationwide. In  Medicare+Choice, it has been difficult and expensive to encourage private  health plans to serve rural areas. Payment rates have been substantially  raised in rural areas since 1997, yet by 2003 nearly 40 percent of  beneficiaries living in rural areas lack access to a private health plan; in  contrast, 15 percent of beneficiaries in urban areas lack access to a plan.  Finally, the Medicare+Choice experience underscores the importance of  beneficiaries having user-friendly, accurate information to compare their  health plan options and of holding private health plans appropriately  accountable for the services they have promised to deliver."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fixing Flaws In Traditional Medicare Essential to Alter Program\u2019s Fiscal Course", "paragraphs": ["Leading Medicare reform proposals have included traditional Medicare as  a component in their design.

Medigap offers beneficiaries stop-loss  protections that are lacking in traditional Medicare, but these policies  diminish important program protections by covering required deductibles  and coinsurance. The most popular Medigap plans are fundamentally  different from employer-sponsored health insurance policies for retirees in  that they do not require individuals to pay deductibles, coinsurance, and  copayments. Such cost-sharing requirements are intended to make  beneficiaries aware of the costs associated with the use of services and  encourage them to use these services prudently. In contrast, Medigap\u2019s  first-dollar coverage\u2014the elimination of deductibles or coinsurance  associated with the use of covered services\u2014undermines this objective.

For example, for certain services, our work has shown  substantially higher Medicare payments relative to providers\u2019 costs\u201435  percent higher for home health care in the first six months of 2001 and 19  percent higher for skilled nursing facility care in 2000. Similarly,  Medicare has overpaid for various medical products. Last year, we  reported that, in 2000, Medicare paid over $1 billion more than other  purchasers for certain outpatient drugs that the program covers. Earlier  findings that have since been addressed by the Congress following our  recommendations showed Medicare paying over $500 million more than  another public payer for home oxygen equipment. Excessive payments  hurt not only the taxpayers but also the program\u2019s beneficiaries or their  supplemental insurers, as beneficiaries are liable for copayments equal to  20 percent of Medicare\u2019s approved fee. For certain outpatient drugs,  Medicare\u2019s payments to providers were so high that the beneficiaries\u2019  copayments exceeded the price at which providers could buy the drugs. In  2001, we recommended that, for covered outpatient prescription drugs,  Medicare establish payment levels more closely related to actual market  transaction costs, using information available to other public programs  that pay at lower rates.", "Over the past two decades, at the Congress\u2019 direction, Medicare has  implemented a series of payment reforms designed to promote the  efficient delivery of services and control program spending. Some reforms  required establishing set fees for individual services; others required  paying a fixed amount for a bundle of services. The payment methods  introduced during this time were designed to include\u2014in addition to  incentives for efficiencies\u2014a means to calibrate payments to ensure  beneficiary access and fairness to providers.", "A major challenge in administering these methods\u2014whether based on fee  schedules or prospective payment systems using bundled payments\u2014 involves adjusting the payments to better account for differences in  patients\u2019 needs and providers\u2019 local markets to ensure that the program is  paying appropriately and adequately. Payment rates that are too low can  impair beneficiary access to services and products, while rates that are too  high add unnecessary financial burdens to the program. As a practical  matter, Medicare is often precluded from using market forces\u2014that is,  competition\u2014to determine appropriate rates. In many cases, Medicare\u2019s  size and potential to distort market prices makes it necessary to use means  other than competition to set a price on services and products.", "Most of Medicare\u2019s rate-setting methods are based on formulas that use  historical data on providers\u2019 costs and charges. Too often, these data are  not recent or comprehensive enough to measure the costs incurred by  efficient providers. At the same time, data reflecting beneficiaries\u2019 access  to services are also lacking. When providers contend that payments are  not adequate, typically information is not readily available to provide the  analytical support needed to determine whether these claims are valid. I  have noted in the past the essential need to monitor the impact of program  policy changes so that distinguishing between desirable and undesirable  consequences can be done systematically and in a timely manner. To that  end, I have also noted the importance of investing adequate resources in  the agency that runs Medicare to ensure that the capacity exists to carry  out these policy-monitoring activities.", "Under some circumstances, competition may be feasible and practical for  setting more appropriate rates. Medicare has pilot tested \u201ccompetitive  bidding\u201d in a few small markets. According to program officials, these test  projects have shown that, for selected medical products, Medicare has  saved money on items priced competitively. As part of these competitive  bidding tests, steps were taken to monitor beneficiary access and product  quality. To use competitive bidding on a broader scale, Medicare would  require not only new authority but would need to make substantial  administrative preparations, as competing with a larger number of  products nationally would entail bidding in multiple markets and  monitoring access and quality once prices had been set."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Medicare\u2019s financial challenge is very real.

I  feel the greatest risk lies in doing nothing to improve Medicare\u2019s long-term  sustainability.

Engaging in a  comprehensive effort to reform the program and put it on a sustainable  path for the future would help fulfill this generation\u2019s stewardship  responsibility to succeeding generations.", "Medicare reform would be done best with considerable lead time to phase  in changes and before the changes that are needed become dramatic and  disruptive. Given the size of Medicare\u2019s financial challenge, it is only  realistic to expect that reforms intended to bring down future costs will  have to proceed incrementally.

Some tax preferences mask the full cost of  providing health benefits and can work at cross-purposes to the goal of  moderating health care spending. Therefore, it may be important to  reexamine the incentives contained in current tax policy and consider  potential reforms. Advances in medical technology are also likely to keep  raising the price tag of providing care, regardless of the payer. Although  technological advances unquestionably provide medical benefits, judging  the value of those benefits\u2014and weighing them against the additional  costs\u2014is more difficult. Consumers are not as informed about the cost of  health care and its quality as they may be about other goods and services.  Thus, while the greater use of market forces may help to control cost  growth, it will undoubtedly be necessary to employ other cost control  methods as well.", "We must also be mindful that health care costs compete with other  legitimate priorities in the federal budget, and their projected growth  threatens to crowd out future generations\u2019 flexibility to decide which  competing priorities will be met. In making important fiscal decisions for  our nation, policymakers need to consider the fundamental differences  between wants, needs, and what both individuals and our nation can  afford. This concept applies to all major aspects of government, from  major weapons system acquisitions to issues affecting domestic programs.  It also points to the fiduciary and stewardship responsibility that we all  share to ensure the sustainability of Medicare for current and future  generations within a broader context of providing for other important  national needs and economic growth.", "A major challenge policymakers face in considering health care reforms is  the dearth of timely, accurate information with which to make decisions.  Medicare\u2019s size and impact on the nation\u2019s health care economy means  that its payment methods and rate adjustments, no matter how reasonable,  often produce opposition. Recent experience with the payment reforms  established in the BBA illustrates this point. In essence, these reforms  changed Medicare\u2019s payment methods to establish incentives for providers  to deliver care efficiently. BBA\u2019s changes were enacted in response to  continuing rapid growth in Medicare spending that was neither sustainable  nor readily linked to demonstrated changes in beneficiary needs.  Nonetheless, affected provider groups conducted a swift, intense  campaign to roll back the BBA changes. In the absence of solid, data- driven analyses, affected providers\u2019 anecdotes were used to support  contentions that Medicare payment changes were extreme and threatened  their financial viability. This and similar reactions to mandated Medicare  payment reforms underscore how difficult it is, without prompt and  credible data, to defend against claims that payments changes have  resulted in insufficient compensation that could lead to access problems.", "The public sector can play an important role in educating the nation about  the limits of public support. Currently, there is a wide gap between what  patients and providers expect and what public programs are able to  deliver. Moreover, there is insufficient understanding about the terms and  conditions under which health care coverage is actually provided by the  nation\u2019s public and private payers. In this regard, GAO is preparing a  health care framework that includes a set of principles to help  policymakers in their efforts to assess various health financing reform  options. This framework will examine health care issues systemwide and  identify the interconnections between public programs that finance health  care and the private insurance market. The framework can serve as a tool  for defining policy goals and ensuring the use of consistent criteria for  evaluating changes. By facilitating debate, the framework can encourage  acceptance of changes necessary to put us on a path to fiscal  sustainability. I fear that if we do not make such changes and adopt  meaningful reforms, future generations will enjoy little flexibility to fund  discretionary programs or make other valuable policy choices.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
