Recent data also show that about half of private sector workers who participated in DB plans had a lump sum option at retirement, and over a third of their counterparts in DC plans had an annuity option. Plan sponsors GAO spoke with provide retiring participants with applicable notices about their benefit payout options available under the plan. Additional information provided by plan sponsors GAO spoke with primarily focused on saving for retirement. Risks that can affect retirement income, or other considerations relevant to managing pension assets at and during retirement were generally not discussed. According to GAO's analysis, while 60 percent of recent retirees received annuities, an increasing percentage from 1992 to 2000 directly rolled over lump sum benefits into an individual retirement account or deferred their receipt by leaving these assets in the plan, a trend in part explained by the shift toward retirees with DC plan benefits. Additionally, GAO found that a growing percentage of those retirees who reported having a choice of benefit payouts chose to directly roll over their lump sum benefits or leave benefits in the plan rather than receive annuities. Actions available to help retiring participants preserve their pension and retirement savings plan assets range from options that would encourage the receipt of annuities to providing information to help participants make better decisions about managing their pension assets at and during retirement. According to an expert panel GAO used as part of this study, retirees need to be aware of the risk of outliving one's assets in retirement and the financial risks individuals face in retirement. Over 90 percent of GAO's panelists rated providing information on such risks as very or extremely effective in helping retiring participants make decisions about managing their pension assets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The decisions that retiring workers make about how and when to draw  down their pension and retirement savings plan assets determine in part  whether they will have pension income that lasts throughout retirement.  Individuals are living longer on average once they retire and will need  pension and other retirement income to sustain them over a longer period  of time than in the past. Moreover, the continuing trend away from  traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plans that can guarantee a stated  level of income for life towards defined contribution (DC) plans with  individual accounts has made participants more responsible for managing  their pension assets during retirement. Increasingly, retirees have access  to their pension and retirement savings plan assets and the flexibility to  choose how and when to invest and draw down these assets.", "The type of pension or retirement savings plan workers participate in  could influence the benefit payment options they have available. Private  employers may sponsor DB and/or DC pension plans for their employees.  DB plans must make available a joint and survivor life annuity to retiring  participants\u2014a series of periodic payments that begin at retirement and  continue through the life of the participant (or other specified period) and  at the death of the participant, to the surviving spouse. These plans may  also offer a lump sum\u2014a cash amount\u2014as an alternative payout option to  the annuity. While some DC plans are required to make available a joint  and survivor annuity, DC plans typically make benefits available as a lump  sum (i.e., the participant\u2019s account balance) or installment payments\u2014 periodic withdrawals paid until account balances are exhausted. DC plans  may offer to purchase an annuity.", "Pension plan sponsors must provide certain disclosures and notices to  retiring participants about their pension benefit payment options. These  requirements vary based on type of plan and benefit options available  under the plan. For all DB plans as well as those DC plans subject to the  joint and survivor annuity requirement, plans must provide, among other  information, a written explanation of the terms and conditions of the joint  and survivor annuity, including information about other payout options  made available under the plan and the rights of the participant\u2019s spouse.", "Annuities and lump sums present different advantages and risks to  retirees. A life annuity, whether received from a plan or purchased,  generally provides insurance that a retiree will not run out of income no  matter how long he or she lives. However, if a retiree dies soon after  choosing or purchasing an annuity, he or she would likely receive  considerably less than if he or she had taken a lump sum and will be  unable to leave that asset as a bequest. Also, income from fixed annuities  may not be adequate to pay for unexpected large expenses or provide  protection against inflation.", "Retiring participants who receive lump sums have the flexibility to  preserve or draw down these assets as they wish, but could risk running  out of pension assets if they live longer than expected, draw down assets  too rapidly, or suffer poor investment returns on their assets. A retiree  may choose to receive a lump sum directly from the plan as a cash  settlement and then invest or spend some of or the entire amount.  Alternatively, retirees who receive lump sums may preserve these assets  by purchasing an annuity with some or all of the proceeds to provide a  stream of income throughout retirement.", "Because of concerns about whether retirees will preserve their pension  assets you asked us to determine: (1) what benefit payout options and  accompanying information pension plans make available to participants at  retirement; (2) what benefit payouts plan participants receive at  retirement; and (3) the actions available to help retiring participants  preserve their pension and retirement savings plan assets.", "To determine what benefit payout options and accompanying information  DB and DC plans make available to participants at retirement, we  reviewed applicable laws and regulations to identify benefit payout  options plan sponsors must and may provide at retirement and the types of  accompanying information they must furnish to participants. We obtained  data on the types of payout options available to participants from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) National Compensation Survey for 2000.  We interviewed pension experts and convened a Web-based expert panel  to identify factors that may affect the benefit payout options plans make  available. To examine how retiring plan participants receive their pension  benefits, we used publicly available data from the University of Michigan\u2019s  Health and Retirement Study (HRS), covering the period from 1992 to  2000. In addition, we interviewed plan sponsors and practitioners to obtain  information and views on the benefit payouts retirees choose when they  have payout options and reasons why retirees prefer (or do not prefer)  different benefit payouts. To identify actions that could help retiring  participants preserve their pension and retirement savings plan assets and  obtain expert opinions and views, we interviewed pension experts and  surveyed our Web-based expert panel.

While Social Security provides a foundation  for retirement income, savings through pension and retirement savings  plans, as well as by individuals on their own behalf, can contribute  substantially to ensuring a secure retirement. For example, the Social  Security Administration reports that while 39 percent of income for  persons 65 and over came from Social Security income in 2001, 18 percent  of their income came from pensions (see fig. 1).", "To encourage employers to establish and maintain pension plans for their  employees, the federal government provides preferential tax treatment  under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for plans that meet certain  requirements. A purpose of tax preferences for employer-sponsored  pensions is to encourage savings for workers\u2019 retirement. Pension tax  preferences are structured to strike a balance between providing  incentives for employers to start and maintain voluntary, tax-qualified  pension plans and ensuring participants receive an equitable share of the  tax-favored benefits.", "A qualified pension plan is a retirement plan that satisfies certain  requirements set forth in the Internal Revenue Code. In order to be tax- qualified, private pension plans must satisfy a number of requirements,  including minimum requirements on coverage and benefits. Private  pension plans must also generally meet the requirements of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Title I of ERISA, among  other requirements, contains requirements regarding information that plan  sponsors must provide to participants and defines the obligations of the  individuals who administer employer-sponsored plans.", "There has been a continuing trend from DB to DC plans over the last   2 decades. DOL reports that private sector employers sponsored over  56,000 tax-qualified DB plans in 1998 down from over 139,000 in 1979,  while the number of tax-qualified DC plans sponsored by private  employers more than doubled from over 331,000 to approximately 674,000  during this same period. Along with this continuing trend to sponsoring  DC plans, there has also been a shift in the type of plans that private sector  workers participate in. DOL reports that the percentage of private sector  workers who participated in a primary DB plan has decreased from 37  percent in 1979 to 21 percent by 1998, while the percentage of such  workers who participated in a primary DC plan has increased from 7 to 27  percent during this same period. Moreover, these same data show that, by  1998, the majority of active participants (workers participating in their  employer\u2019s plan) were in DC plans, whereas nearly   20 years earlier most of them were in DB plans.", "Employers who sponsor DB plans are responsible for making  contributions that are sufficient for funding the promised benefit,  investing and managing the plan assets, and bearing the investment risk  because the employer, as plan sponsor, agrees to make future payments  during retirement. However, under DC plans, workers bear the investment  risk because there is no promise made by the employer that money will be  available during retirement. Thus, as a result of this shift from DB to DC  plans, an increasing share of the responsibility for providing for one\u2019s  retirement income has shifted from the employer to the employee.", "DB plans sponsored by private employers are required to offer joint and  survivor annuities to married participants beginning at the plan\u2019s normal  retirement age. These annuity payouts, called qualified joint and survivor  annuities (QJSA), guarantee a benefit for the life of the participant and the  participant\u2019s surviving spouse. DB plans may also offer a single-life annuity  to unmarried participants. With respect to DC plans, there is no uniform  requirement regarding benefit payouts they must offer. Rather, certain DC  plans must adhere to the QJSA requirements because, similar to DB plans,  they are subject to minimum funding standards. Other DC plans are not  subject to the QJSA requirements if the plan provides for payment in full  of the participant\u2019s accrued benefit under the plan to the spouse on the  death of the participant and the participant has not elected to receive a life  annuity.", "Plans subject to the QJSA requirements must provide participants with a  written explanation of the terms and conditions of the QJSA. As part of  this notice, participants must be furnished with a description of other  benefit payouts that the plan offers as options to the QJSA\u2014including  information on their features and value of a participant\u2019s benefits under  such options. In addition, the plan must provide participants with an  explanation of the participant\u2019s right to make, and the effect of, an election  to waive the QJSA form of benefit, the rights of the participant\u2019s spouse,  and the right to revoke an election to waive the QJSA form of benefit.", "Because of concerns that participants who are offered QJSA benefits do  not have adequate information to compare these benefits with other  optional payouts, IRS has proposed regulations to strengthen the  requirements regarding the written explanation of a QJSA that plans must  provide. Specifically, the proposed regulations provide additional guidance  regarding information that plans furnish to describe the value of a  participant\u2019s benefits under optional payouts compared with the value of a  participant\u2019s QJSA benefits. The comparison must show what the  participant would receive under each optional payout relative to the QJSA  (including for those benefit payouts that are subsidized) in a way that is  meaningful. Additionally, this comparison must include information that is  more readily understandable to participants.", "There is also required information that plans must provide retiring  participants about lump sum payouts. Plans that offer a lump sum payout  must provide a rollover notice to retiring participants. The rollover notice  must discuss the participant\u2019s ability to have such payouts directly  transferred by the plan to another eligible retirement plan. Rollover  notices must also include information about the tax consequences of  choosing various payout options, such as rolling the assets to another  account or taking a lump sum directly as a cash settlement.", "Retiring participants who have the option to receive benefits as a lump  sum amount (i.e., cash settlement) may also choose to directly \u201croll over\u201d  their assets to another qualified retirement plan, such as an IRA. DB plans  that permit lump sums must adhere to certain rules regarding the  calculation of lump sum amounts. Lump sums must be at least as large as  the actuarial equivalent (i.e., present value) of a participant\u2019s accrued  benefit (i.e., the value of the deferred annuity that the participant is  entitled to receive or at the plan\u2019s normal retirement age).", "DC plan participants also have the option to defer receipt of benefits by  leaving assets in their individual accounts. Both directly rolling over  assets into another qualified retirement plan and leaving benefits in the  plan preserve pension assets at the point of retirement. Also, DC plan  participants may have the option to receive their benefits as a series of  installment payments at retirement that he or she may spend or save as  desired. However, unlike a DB plan, a DC plan cannot itself provide a life  annuity, but can offer to purchase an annuity from an insurance company.  Retirees that do not choose or purchase annuities at the point of  retirement assume personal responsibility for managing their pension and  retirement savings plan assets to provide retirement income. In particular,  these retirees must decide how pension assets are saved or invested and  determine the timing and amount of withdrawals.", "Increasingly, retirees will\u2014on average\u2014need to balance income and  expenditures over a longer period of time than in the past. This is in part  due to the long-term trend towards earlier retirement throughout most of  the twentieth century. Nearly half of all men now leave the labor force by  age 62 and almost half of all women are out of the workforce by age 60.  Moreover, the decline in the average retirement age has occurred in an  environment of rising longevity for the elderly. Falling mortality rates have  added almost 4 years to the expected life span of a 65-year-old man and  more than 5 years to the life expectancy of a 65-year-old woman since  1940.", "Individuals face a variety of risks in managing their assets, income, and  expenditures at and during retirement. For example, retirees may outlive  their pension or retirement savings plan assets. In addition, inflation may  erode the purchasing power of their income, investments may yield  returns that are less than expected or decline in value, and large  unplanned expenses, such as those to cover long-term care, may occur at  some point during retirement.", "Annuities offer a means to mitigate much of the financial uncertainty that  accompanies living to very old ages, but may not necessarily be the best  approach for all retirees. For example, an individual with a life shortening  illness might not be concerned about the financial needs that accompany  living to a very old age. Also, some individuals may want to continue to  accumulate assets during retirement and could invest their pension assets  in IRAs or financial products, in which such assets could be more heavily  invested in equities. Strategies to manage risk during retirement, when  most are decumulating rather than accumulating assets will necessarily be  highly individualized.", "The Internal Revenue Service, DOL\u2019s Employee Benefits Security  Administration (EBSA), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation are  primarily responsible for enforcing laws that govern private pension plans.

In part, plan sponsors offer lump sums in response to  employee demand for this option and choose not to offer annuities absent  employee demand for them. Also, pension experts and plan sponsors we  spoke with agreed that plans offer lump sums because workers generally  prefer them to annuities.

About 77 percent of retirees with DB plan  benefits received an annuity from those plans (see fig. 4), while only   8 percent of retirees with DC plan benefits received or purchased  annuities with their benefits (see fig. 5). Conversely, over three-quarters of  retirees with DC plan benefits directly rolled over assets into an IRA or  deferred receipt of benefits by leaving assets in their plan.", "The growing trend towards payouts other than annuities may reflect, at  least in part, the continuing trend in coverage towards DC plans. Among  all retiring participants who received pension benefits, the percentage who  had participated in DC plans increased considerably over time, while the  percentage who had participated in DB plans decreased somewhat after  peaking in 1994. Also, little change occurred in the types of payouts  received by those with benefits from either DB or DC plans. For example,  about 90 percent of retirees with DC plan benefits received payouts other  than annuities over the entire period we examined. Similarly, during this  same period, retirees with DB plan benefits received their payouts largely  through annuities, with little change.", "One likely reason why many retirees with DB plans receive annuities is  that many DB retirees do not have other payout options available. About  38 percent of the DB retirees we analyzed reported having a choice of  receiving a payout other than an annuity. We narrowed our analysis to  examine the payout choices made by retirees, eliminating from our  analysis DB retirees with no payout choice other than an annuity. Thus, in  addition to examining how all retirees receive their pensions, we also  analyzed only retirees who report having a choice of receiving benefits as  an annuity or as a lump sum amount. Over the period, the percentage of  retirees who chose to directly roll over their lump sum benefits to an IRA  or to defer receipt of benefits rose substantially, from around 44 percent of  retirees to about 66 percent (see table 2 in app. II). The percentage  choosing annuities and cash settlements, however, remained flat,  indicating that more retirees chose multiple payouts. Additionally, we  found that 64 percent of DB retirees with a choice still choose annuities  over other options. As with the full sample of retirees, the changes over  time among those with a choice of payout appears to be attributable  largely to the trend toward participation in DC plans, as we do not observe  many changes in payout choices within either plan type.", "Currently, pension experts and plan sponsors we spoke with told us that  most retirees do not choose annuities when they have a choice of payout  options. For example, one plan administrator we spoke with indicated that  about two-thirds of retirees in the DB plans they administer choose  payouts other than an annuity when a choice of payout options is offered.  Additionally, a funding provider for DC plans reports that the percentage  of their participants who chose an annuity (single or joint life) as their  initial income selection fell from 78 percent to 45 percent from 1995 to  2001. Nevertheless, our analysis is not necessarily inconsistent with this  information. Although we found that most retirees with pension benefits  received an annuity, we also found that a growing percentage of all  retirees with a choice of payout options received benefit payouts other  than an annuity. Moreover, the majority of those retirees who received DC  plan benefits and who had a choice of payout options choose to receive  payouts other than an annuity (see table 2 in app. II).", "It is also possible that the receipt of lump sums from DB plans, whether as  cash settlements or through directly rolling over lump sum benefits to an  IRA, has increased since 2000. Recently, 30-year Treasury bond rates,  which DB plan sponsors must use to determine lump-sum amounts, have  fallen from their overall 1990\u2019s levels. As a result, lump sums from DB  plans have increased in value relative to participants\u2019 annuity benefits, and  retiring participants may find lump sums more attractive when they are  available under their plan.", "We further analyzed retirees with a choice of payouts to determine  statistically which factors may influence retirees to choose annuities. Not  unexpectedly, participation in a DB plan was the strongest predictor of  annuity choice. Also, retirees with lower total household assets (excluding  pensions and other retirement assets) and retirees with more years in the  workforce were more likely to choose an annuity, all else being equal. In  addition, different factors seemed to influence payout choices for retirees  with DC benefits as compared with those with DB benefits. For example,  retirees with DC plan benefits were more likely to be influenced by the  price of an annuity and by their perceived health status (with those  reporting they were in better health more likely to choose an annuity),  while these factors did not appear to affect retirees with DB plan  benefits.", "Pension experts we spoke with suggested that annuities may appeal to  individuals with certain characteristics or preferences, while others prefer  to have control of their assets. Annuities may appeal to individuals who  expect to live long, are concerned about outliving their resources in  retirement, value a predictable, guaranteed income stream, or do not wish  or expect to leave a bequest. However, some retirees may decline to  consider annuities because such payouts are generally irrevocable, instead  preferring the flexibility that other payouts offer. Such retirees may  believe they can receive more income and better protect themselves  against inflation by investing assets on their own. Also, some retirees may  want to manage their pension assets because they have difficulty  comparing the value of a lump sum amount to its equivalent annuity  income stream. As such, retirees may believe lump sum amounts are  worth more than income payments from annuities.", "Although not all retirees have the option to receive their pension as an  annuity, they may purchase individual annuities to pay income during  retirement directly from insurance companies. However, few retirees use  their pension benefits or other assets to purchase individual life annuities.  Some retirees may choose not to purchase an individual life annuity  because the availability of these annuities is limited, individual life  annuities have associated administrative and other expenses, and such  annuities generally do not provide protection against inflation.  Additionally, one individual annuity provider told us that the average  premium, or one-time payment an individual makes, to purchase an  individual life annuity is approximately $130,000.", "The demand for individual annuities may grow as the market continues to  develop innovative annuity products that appeal to consumer preferences.

At present,  public education focuses primarily on saving for retirement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Actions Available to Increase or Encourage Receipt of Annuities", "paragraphs": ["Some actions that could help retiring participants preserve their pension  and retirement savings plan assets include options intended to increase or  encourage the receipt of annuities. While annuities are not the only way  plan participants can preserve their pension assets at retirement, they can  provide guaranteed income throughout retirement. Thus, we asked an  expert panel to identify options that could encourage more annuitization  of pension and retirement savings plan assets at retirement.", "Some options are intended to increase the number of retiring participants  who receive annuities by imposing new requirements on plan sponsors.  One option is to require that all pension and retirement savings plans pay  life annuities to retiring participants. Such a mandate would ensure all  retiring participants have pension income for their remaining lifetimes. A  variation on mandatory annuitization would make life annuities the default  payout option in all DC plans. This could be achieved by requiring all tax- qualified DC plans to offer a life annuity at retirement and retiring  participants to actively choose to receive some other payout (e.g., a cash  settlement) instead of an annuity. While annuities would not be  compulsory, it is likely that more retiring participants would choose  annuities because choosing to receive some other payout would require an  affirmative choice. This is because some retiring participants may not take  the necessary steps to choose another type of payout available under their  plan.", "Another somewhat less stringent option than mandatory annuitization is to  require tax-qualified DC plans to offer annuities to retiring participants  like DB plans are required to do. This option would provide more retirees  with the opportunity to preserve retirement savings by choosing an  annuity from their plan without requiring that they do so. Also, concerns  that some participants might have about the expense of purchasing an  individual annuity and potential difficulty in searching for an annuity  product could be mitigated if annuities were available under their plan.", "Although these actions would increase the number of retirees who receive  annuities thus ensuring retirement income throughout their lives, they also  have drawbacks. For example, requiring that pension plans provide life  annuities to retiring participants would reduce people\u2019s ability to tailor the  receipt of benefits to their particular circumstances. Depending on one\u2019s  individual circumstances and preferences, an annuity may not be the best  payout option for managing pension assets during retirement. A retiring  participant who is in poor health or needs cash to cover certain expenses  may not want to receive an annuity. Also, some retirees might increase  their income by rolling over benefits directly to an IRA, thus enabling them  to invest and draw down their pension assets during retirement.", "Requiring all tax-qualified DC plans to offer annuities to retiring  participants\u2014as the default payout option or not\u2014might not substantially  increase the number of retirees who choose annuities. Our analysis shows  that recent experience with retiring participants who have a choice of  payout options indicates that these retirees increasingly choose to directly  roll over their lump sum benefits into an IRA or defer the receipt of  benefits. Also, some plan sponsors and pension experts we spoke with  indicated that retiring participants generally do not choose annuities when  they have other payout options available.", "A common drawback of such requirements on plans to offer annuities at  retirement is that they could increase the administrative and regulatory  burdens plan sponsors face. DC plans would have to comply with  applicable laws and regulations that must be satisfied when annuities are  provided, such as offering annuities that provide income for the life of the  participant and spouse or beneficiary. And those plans that do not  currently offer an annuity payout option at retirement would have to  contract with an annuity provider. Imposing new requirements on plans to  pay or offer annuities at retirement represent prescriptive approaches that  do not necessarily help retiring participants understand their pension  payout options or make decisions suited to their individual needs or  preferences.", "While requiring plan sponsors to pay or offer annuities represents one set  of options for increasing annuitization, other options involve modifying  certain requirements to make it easier for qualified plans to offer annuities.  One such modification could be providing regulatory relief to plan  sponsors from potential fiduciary liability they assume in selecting an  annuity provider. Because plan sponsors must generally select the safest  available annuity for participants, those that do not offer annuities may be  concerned about being held liable for any losses to participants in the  event the annuity provider cannot meet its financial obligations. Another  modification could be exempting DC plans that are not required to offer an  annuity but choose to do so from having to make a joint and survivor  annuity the default payout or from satisfying associated spousal consent  requirements. These modifications could encourage more DC plans to  offer annuities to the extent they reduce administrative or regulatory  burdens that plans would incur otherwise. However, these modifications  could lessen certain protections available to plan participants that receive  or choose annuities.", "In addition to options that focus on plan sponsors, our expert panel  identified other policy options that focus on encouraging more retiring  participants to choose annuities or purchase them with their pension  assets. For example, lowering taxes on annuity income from qualified  plans could encourage some retiring participants, who would not  otherwise do so, to choose or purchase an annuity. Such an incentive  would not involve any new requirements on plan sponsors to payout or  offer annuities at retirement.  Nor does it constrain an individual\u2019s choice  because retiring participants who receive lump sum benefits could  partially annuitize their pension assets and maintain some assets they  could more easily access to cover immediate and/or large expenses. Also,  a tax incentive for qualified plan annuities could potentially help to reduce  the long-term burden on government assistance programs, such as the  Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid programs, to the extent that  fewer retirees deplete their assets during retirement.", "However, a tax incentive for income provided by qualified plan annuities  could also have drawbacks. For example, such an incentive might be  limited to only those assets held in qualified retirement plans. Also,  annuities could be made more attractive to some retiring participants for  whom another payout option might be more advantageous, such as those  in ill health who need large sums of cash to cover medical expenses.  Moreover, some participants, who would elect an annuity from their plan  even in the absence of such an incentive, would benefit. To the extent this  option encourages more retirees to choose or purchase annuities, it would  result in the federal government forgoing some amount of revenue.", "Another option that could encourage more retiring participants to choose  annuities would involve modifying the mandatory interest rate that DB  plan sponsors must use to calculate lump sums. By law, DB plans must use  the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds, which some pension experts  and plan sponsors consider to be low and thus inflate the value of lump  sums relative to annuities. A higher mandatory interest rate would  generally decrease and potentially equalize the value of lump sums from  DB plans relative to participants\u2019 annuity benefits. As a result, smaller  lump sums may not be as economically attractive to some retirees.  However, the extent to which more retiring participants with DB benefits  would choose annuities instead of lump sums when they are both offered  is uncertain.", "Alternatively, the taxes that apply to lump sums (i.e., cash settlements)  received directly by individuals prior to retirement could also be applied to  cash settlements received by retiring participants. Currently, lump sums  that are received directly by participants as cash settlements (prior to  attaining age 59-\u00bd) are subject to certain taxes. Less favorable tax  treatment of cash settlements, while not requiring retiring participants to  take an annuity or any other type of payout, could encourage retirees to  preserve their pension benefits. However, this option could be  disadvantageous for some retiring participants. For example, those  participants who are in poor health and need cash to pay for medical  expenses may want the access to large sums of cash and flexibility that a  cash settlement provides. Moreover, to the extent retiring participants  have difficulty comparing the value of annuity income payments with lump  sum amounts, options that seek to influence the payouts chosen by  retiring participants might have limited impact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Information and Education Could Help Participants Make More Informed Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Beyond options focusing exclusively on annuities, pension experts we  spoke with generally agreed that retiring participants need information  and education to help them make decisions about how to manage their  pension assets during retirement.

These risks include outliving one\u2019s assets during retirement  (i.e., longevity risk) and financial risks, such as declining purchasing  power of retirement income (i.e., inflation risk) that affect how retirees  balance income and expenses. Almost all of the respondents from our  expert panel rated information on the financial risks individuals face in  retirement (96 percent) and the risk of outliving one\u2019s assets in retirement  (91 percent) as very or extremely effective in helping retiring participants  make decisions about how to manage pension assets. Furthermore, a  recent study by the Society of Actuaries on retirement risks indicates that  both retirees and individuals approaching retirement age tend to  underestimate the average life expectancy of individuals at age 65. This  study also reports that 63 percent of pre-retirees and 55 percent of retirees  surveyed are somewhat or very concerned about not being able to keep  the value of their savings and investments growing faster than inflation.", "Our expert panel also noted the importance of information and education  on other considerations relevant to managing pension and retirement  savings plan assets during retirement. Such considerations include how to  assess needs in retirement, how to compare annuity and lump sum  amounts, the value of expected benefit from DB and DC plans, how  annuities provide retirement income, and strategies for drawing down  pension assets during retirement. At least 60 percent of our expert panel  participants rated such considerations as very or extremely effective in  helping retiring participants make decisions about managing their  pensions during retirement.", "Overall, federal efforts to provide information and education on retirement  planning have focused on accumulating pension assets and not on how to  manage these assets to provide income throughout retirement.
