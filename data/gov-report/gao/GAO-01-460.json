GAO's and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) analysis show that the Fund had an economic value of $15.8 billion (3.20 percent) and $16.6 billion (3.66 percent), respectively. Given the economic value of the Fund and the state of the economy at the end of fiscal year 1999, a two-percent capital ratio appears sufficient to withstand moderately severe economic downturns that could lead to worse-than-expected loan performance. However, under more severe economic conditions, the economic value of two percent of insurance-in-force would not be adequate. Because of the uncertainty and professional judgment associated with this type of economic analysis, GAO cautions against relying on one estimate or even a group of estimates to determine the adequacy of the Fund's reserves over the longer term. HUD could exercise several options under current legislative authority to reduce the capital ratio for the Fund. It is difficult, however, to reliably measure the impact of policy changes on the Fund's capital ratio and Federal Housing Administration borrowers without using tools designed to estimate the multiple impacts that policy changes often have. Nonetheless, any option that reduces the Fund's reserve, if not accompanied by a similar reduction in other government spending, would result in a budget surplus reduction or a deficit increase."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),  the economic value of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (Fund) grew  by about $5 billion in 1999, apparently reaching its highest level in at least  the last 20 years. Under this Fund, HUD's Federal Housing Administration  (FHA) provides insurance for private lenders against losses on home  mortgages. Borrowers who obtain FHA-insured mortgages pay insurance  premiums, which are deposited into the Fund. Although the Fund has been  financially self-sufficient for most of its history, it experienced substantial  losses during the 1980s, primarily because foreclosure rates on single- family homes supported by the Fund were high in economically stressed  regions. To help place the Fund on a financially sound basis, the Congress  enacted legislation in November 1990 that required the Secretary of HUD  to, among other things, take steps to ensure that the Fund achieves and  maintains an economic value of at least 2 percent of the Fund's insurance- in-force. The 1990 reforms also required that an independent actuarial  study be conducted annually to measure this capital ratio. In January 2000,  HUD reported that, according to an independent study by Deloitte &  Touche, the estimated capital ratio was 3.66 percent at the end of fiscal  year 1999. With the Fund's capital ratio now substantially above the  minimum required level, proposals have surfaced to reduce the ratio either  by spending some of the Fund's current resources or by reducing the net  cash flows into the Fund.", "Concerned about the adequacy of the minimum 2-percent requirement and  about proposals to spend what some were calling excess reserves, you  asked us to determine the conditions under which an estimated capital  ratio of 2 percent would be adequate to maintain the actuarial soundness of  the Fund. Specifically, you asked us to (1) estimate the value of the Fund at  the end of fiscal year 1999, given expected economic conditions, and  compare our estimate to the estimate of the value of the Fund reported by  HUD for that year; (2) determine the extent to which a 2-percent capital  ratio would allow the Fund to withstand worse-than-expected loan  performance due to economic and other factors; and (3) describe some  options for adjusting the size of the Fund if the estimated capital ratio is  different than the amount needed, and describe the impact that these  options might have on the Fund, FHA mortgagors, and the federal budget.", "To meet these objectives, we reviewed the laws and regulations governing  FHA's insurance program. In addition, to estimate the value of the Fund  and determine the extent to which a 2-percent reserve would allow the  Fund to withstand worse-than-expected loan performance, we developed  economic models. We also met with HUD officials who administer FHA's  single-family insurance program, the independent contractors that have  analyzed the Fund throughout the 1990s, and other experts to better  understand methodologies used to estimate the value of the Fund. In  addition, we met with officials at the Office of Management and Budget and  the Congressional Budget Office who are building economic models of  FHA's insurance program to provide better information about the Fund's  impact on the federal budget. To explore options for changing the size of  the Fund, we met with HUD officials and other interested parties. To  determine the impact of these changes on the Federal budget, we relied on  our own experts as well as budget experts familiar with FHA's program and  mortgage models at the Office of Management and Budget and the  Congressional Budget Office.", "We conducted our work between December 1999 and February 2001 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. See  appendix I for a further discussion of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FHA was established in 1934 under the National Housing Act (P.L. 73-479)  to broaden homeownership, shore up and protect lending institutions, and  stimulate employment in the building industry. FHA insures private lenders  against losses on mortgages that finance purchases of properties with one  to four housing units. Many FHA-insured loans are made to low-income,  minority, and first-time homebuyers.", "Generally, borrowers are required to purchase single-family mortgage  insurance when the value of the mortgage is large relative to the price of  the house. FHA, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and private mortgage  insurers provide virtually all of this insurance. In recent years private  mortgage insurers and conventional mortgage lenders have begun to offer  alternatives to borrowers who want to make little or no down payment.  FHA provides most of its single-family insurance through a program  supported by the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. The Fund is organized  as a mutual insurance fund in that any income received in excess of the  amounts required to cover initial insuring costs, operating expenses, and  losses due to claims may be paid to borrowers in the form of distributive  shares after they pay their mortgages in full or voluntarily terminate their  FHA insurance. The economic value of the Fund depends on the relative  sizes of cash outflows and inflows over time. Cash flows out of the Fund  from payments associated with claims on foreclosed properties, refunds of  up-front premiums on mortgages that are prepaid, and administrative  expenses for management of the program (see fig. 1). To cover these  outflows, FHA deposits cash inflows\u2014up-front and annual insurance  premiums from participating homebuyers and net proceeds from the sale  of foreclosed properties\u2014into the Fund. If the Fund were to be exhausted,  the U.S. Treasury would have to cover lenders' claims and administrative  costs directly.", "The Fund remained relatively healthy from its inception until the 1980s  when losses were substantial, primarily because of high foreclosure rates  in regions experiencing economic stress, particularly the oil-producing  states in the west south central section of the United States. These losses  prompted the reforms that were first enacted in November 1990 as part of  the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-508). The reforms  that were designed to place the Fund on an actuarially sound basis required   the Secretary of HUD to take steps to ensure that the Fund attains a  capital ratio of 2 percent of the insurance-in-force by November 2000  and maintains that ratio at a minimum at all times thereafter;   an independent contractor to conduct an annual actuarial review of the   the Secretary of HUD to suspend the payment of distributive shares,  which had been paid continuously from 1943 to 1990, until the Fund is  actuarially sound; and   FHA borrowers to pay more in insurance premiums over the life of their  loans by adding a risk-adjusted annual premium to the one time, up- front premium.", "The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, enacted as part of the Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, also reformed budgeting methods for  federal credit programs including FHA's mutual insurance program. The  1990 credit reforms were intended to ensure that the full cost of credit  activities for the current budget year would be reflected in the federal  budget so that the executive branch and the Congress could consider these  costs when making annual budget decisions. As a result, FHA's budget is  required to reflect the subsidy cost to the government\u2014the estimated long- term cost calculated on a net present value basis\u2014of FHA's loan insurance  activities for that year. During the 1990s, the estimated economic value of  the Fund\u2014comprised of capital resources and the net present value of  future cash flows\u2014grew substantially. As figure 2 shows, by the end of  fiscal year 1995, the Fund had attained an estimated economic value that  slightly exceeded the amount required for a 2-percent capital ratio. Since  that time, the estimated economic value of the Fund has continued to grow  and has always exceeded the amount required for a 2-percent capital ratio.", "As a result of the 1990 housing reforms, the Fund must not only meet  capital ratio requirements, but it must also achieve actuarial soundness;  that is, the Fund must contain sufficient reserves and funding to cover  estimated future losses resulting from the payment of claims on foreclosed  mortgages and administrative costs. However, neither the legislation nor  the actuarial profession defines actuarial soundness. Price Waterhouse  (now PricewaterhouseCoopers) in 1989 concluded that for the Fund to be  actuarially sound, it should have capital resources that could withstand  losses from reasonably adverse, but not catastrophic, economic  downturns. The Price Waterhouse report did not clearly distinguish  adverse from catastrophic downturns; however, they said that private  mortgage insurers are required to hold contingency reserves to protect  against catastrophic losses. In turn, rating agencies require that private  mortgage insurers have enough capital on hand to withstand severe losses  that would occur if loans they insure across the entire nation had losses  similar to those experienced in the west south central states in the 1980s.", "Because economic downturns put downward pressure on house prices and  incomes, they can stress FHA's ability to meet its obligations. Thus, it is  reasonable that measures of the financial soundness of the Fund would be  based on tests of the Fund's ability to withstand recent recessions or  regional economic downturns. In the last 25 years, we have experienced a  national recession and regional economic declines that did or could have  placed stress on FHA. For example, the nation experienced a recession in  1981 and 1982 that strained mortgage markets. Regionally, states in the  west south central portion of the nation experienced an economic decline  in 1986 through 1989 precipitated by a sharp drop in the price of crude oil.  Similarly, the economic decline experienced by California from 1992  through 1995 placed stress on FHA. Because FHA does substantial  business in these regions of the country, these experiences led to  substantial losses for FHA. In contrast, the economic decline experienced  by the New England states from 1989 through 1991 placed little strain on  FHA because insured mortgages in this region do not make up a large  portion of FHA's total portfolio. However, experiences similar to the New  England downturn, during which the unemployment rate increased by  almost 140 percent and house prices decreased by 5.5 percent, could place  stress on FHA if they occurred in other regions or the nation as a whole."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Fund's Estimated Economic Value Exceeds 3 Percent of Insurance-in-Force", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of our economic model of FHA's home loan program and  forecasts of several key economic factors, we estimate that at the end of  fiscal year 1999, the Fund had an economic value of about $15.8 billion.

In comparison, Deloitte & Touche estimated that the Fund's  1999 economic value was over $800 million larger than our estimate\u2014or  about 3.66 percent of its estimate of FHA's unamortized insurance-in-force.  Although we did not evaluate the quality of Deloitte's estimates, we believe  that Deloitte's and our estimates are comparable because of the  uncertainty inherent in forecasting and the professional judgments made in  this type of analysis. However, Deloitte's analysis and ours differ in several  ways, including the time when the analyses were performed and some of  the assumptions made."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Estimated Economic Value of the Fund Reflects the Robust Economy and Increased Premium Rates", "paragraphs": ["Using conservative assumptions, we estimate that at the end of fiscal year  1999, the Fund had an economic value of about $15.8 billion. The economic  value of the Fund consists of the capital resources on hand and the net  present value of future cash flows. Documents used to prepare FHA's 1999  financial statements show that the Fund had capital resources of about  $14.3 billion at the end of that fiscal year. We estimated the relationship  between historical FHA foreclosures and prepayments and certain key  economic factors to forecast foreclosures and prepayments and the  resulting cash flows over the next 30-year period for mortgages insured by  FHA before the end of fiscal 1999. As a result of this analysis, we estimate  that at the end of 1999 the net present value of future cash flows was about  $1.5 billion. Summing the capital resources and future cash flows gives us  an economic value of about $15.8 billion. See appendix II for a detailed  discussion of the forecasting and cash flow models used to estimate the  economic value of the Fund.", "We also estimate that the Fund's capital ratio\u2014the Fund's economic value  divided by its insurance-in-force\u2014exceeded 3-percent at the end of fiscal  year 1999. From the individual loan data provided by HUD, we calculated  that the unamortized insurance-in-force at the end of fiscal year 1999 was  about $494 billion and that the amortized value of that insurance, an  estimate of the outstanding balance of the loans and thus FHA's insurance  liability, was about $455.8 billion. Therefore, the economic value of the  Fund represented 3.20 percent of the unamortized insurance-in-force and  about 3.47 percent of the amortized insurance-in-force on September 30,  1999.", "The robust economy and the increased premium rates established by the  1990 legislation contributed to the strength of the Fund at the end of fiscal  year 1999. The Fund's economic value principally reflects the large amount  of capital resources that the Fund has accrued. Because current capital  resources are the result of previous cash flows, the robustness of the  economy and the higher premium rates throughout most of the 1990s  accounted for the accumulation of these substantial capital resources.  Good economic times that are accompanied by relatively low interest rates  and relatively high levels of employment are usually associated with high  levels of mortgage activity and relatively low levels of foreclosure;  therefore, cash inflows have been high relative to outflows during this  period.", "The estimated value of future cash flows also contributed to the strength of  the Fund at the end of fiscal 1999. As a result of relatively low interest rates  and the robust economy, FHA insured a relatively large number of  mortgages in fiscal years 1998 and 1999. These loans make up a large  portion of FHA's insurance-in-force, because many borrowers refinanced  their FHA-insured mortgages originated in earlier years, probably as a  result of interest rates having fallen to relatively low levels in 1998 and  1999. Because these recent loans have low interest rates and because  forecasts of economic variables for the near future show house prices  rising while unemployment and interest rates remain fairly stable, our  models predict that these new loans will have low levels of foreclosure and  prepayment. As a result, our models predict that future cash flows out of  the Fund will be relatively small. At the same time, we assume that FHA- insured homebuyers will continue to pay the annual premiums that were  reinstituted in 1991. Thus, our models predict that cash flowing into the  Fund from mortgages already in FHA's portfolio at the end of fiscal year  1999 will be more than sufficient to cover the cash outflows associated  with these loans. As a result, the estimated economic value of the Fund is  even higher than the level of its current capital resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deloitte's Estimates Are Comparable to Ours, but the Analyses Differ in Several Ways", "paragraphs": ["As table 1 shows, Deloitte's independent actuarial analysis of the Fund for  fiscal year 1999 estimated a capital ratio that was somewhat higher than  ours, 3.66 percent rather than 3.20 percent of unamortized insurance-in- force. Although we did not evaluate the quality of Deloitte's estimates, we  did identify some reasons that its estimate of the capital ratio was higher  than ours. The ratio is higher because Deloitte estimates both a higher  economic value of the Fund and a lower amount of insurance-in-force.  Deloitte's higher estimated economic value of the Fund includes a higher  estimated value for capital resources on hand that is somewhat offset by a  lower estimate of the net present value of future cash flows.", "Our estimate and that of Deloitte rely on forecasts of foreclosures and  prepayments over the next 30 years, and, in turn, these forecasts  necessarily rest on forecasts of certain economic factors. In addition, the  estimates depend on the choices made concerning a variety of other  assumptions. As a result of the inherent uncertainty and the need for  professional judgment in this type of analysis, we believe that our estimates  and Deloitte's estimates of the Fund's economic value and capital ratio are  comparable.", "Although the estimates are comparable, Deloitte's estimates of capital  resources and insurance-in-force differ from ours primarily because the  analyses were conducted at different times. Because Deloitte performed its  analysis before the end of 1999, it had to estimate some data for which we  had year-end values. In particular, Deloitte overestimated the 1999 value of  capital resources by extrapolating from the 1998 value. In contrast, we used  values developed for FHA's 1999 financial statements that were about $1  billion lower than Deloitte's estimate. Using our value for capital resources,  Deloitte's estimated capital ratio would be 3.44 percent rather than 3.66  percent of insurance-in-force. Similarly, Deloitte underestimated the  number of loans that FHA insured in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999  and, thus, underestimated the value of loans insured for all of fiscal year  1999 by about $33 billion, though this appears to have had little effect on  the estimated capital ratio.", "Our analysis of the net present value of future cash flows and that of  Deloitte also differ in several respects. Both our estimates and Deloitte's  rely on forecasts of future foreclosures and prepayments. In turn, these  forecasts are generated from models that are based on estimated  relationships between the probability of loan foreclosure and prepayment  and key explanatory factors, such as borrowers' home equity and interest  and unemployment rates. Our model differs from Deloitte's in the way that  it specifies these relationships. For example, Deloitte specified changes in  household income as one of the key explanatory factors, while we did not.", "The analyses also differ in the assumptions made about some future  economic values and costs associated with FHA's insurance program. For  example, we assumed lower house price appreciation rates and higher  discount rates for calculating net present values than did Deloitte. In  addition, the analyses differ in the way that they use HUD's data. We used a  sample of individual loans while Deloitte grouped loans into categories to  do its analysis. Although these factors could be important in identifying  why the two estimates differ, we could not quantify their impact because  we did not have access to Deloitte's models."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A 2-percent Capital Ratio Appears Sufficient to Withstand Some Worse-Than- Expected Loan Performance", "paragraphs": ["According to our estimates, worse-than-expected loan performance that  could be brought on by moderately severe economic conditions would not  cause the estimated value of the fund at the end of fiscal year 1999 to  decline by more than 2 percent of insurance-in-force. However, a few more  severe economic scenarios that we examined could result in such poor  loan performance that the estimated value of the fund at the end of fiscal  year 1999 could decline by more than 2 percent of insurance-in-force. Two  of the three scenarios that showed such a large decline extended adverse  conditions more widely than the moderately severe scenarios and,  therefore, are less likely to occur. While these estimates suggest that the  capital ratios are more than sufficient to protect the Fund at this time from  many worse-than-expected loan performance scenarios, factors not fully  captured in our models could affect the Fund's ability to withstand worse- than-expected experiences over time. These factors include recent changes  in FHA's insurance program and the conventional mortgage market that  could affect the likelihood of poor loan performance and the ability of the  Fund to withstand that performance. For example, conventional mortgage  lenders and private mortgage insurers have recently lowered the required  down payment on loans. Such actions may have attracted some lower risk  borrowers who would otherwise have insured their loans with FHA. As a  result, the overall riskiness of FHA's portfolio may be greater than we have  estimated, making a given amount of capital less likely to withstand future  economic downturns than we have predicted."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "At This Time, the Capital Ratio Appears Sufficient to Withstand Moderately Severe Economic Scenarios That Are Based on Recent Historical Experience", "paragraphs": ["Beginning with the robust economy and the value of the Fund in 1999, our  analysis shows that a 2-percent capital ratio appears sufficient to withstand  worse-than-expected loan performance that results from moderately  severe economic scenarios similar to those experienced over the last 25  years. Our model and others that are based on historical experience  suggest that falling house prices and high levels of unemployment are likely  to produce poor mortgage performance. Thus, to test the Fund's ability to  withstand worse-than-expected loan performance, we developed economic  scenarios that are based on certain regional downturns and the 1981-82  national recession.", "We tested the adequacy of the capital ratio using economic scenarios that  were based on three recent regional economic downturns\u2014one in the west  south central region of the United States that began in 1986, one in New  England that began in 1989, and one in California that began in 1992\u2014that  produced high mortgage foreclosure rates in those regions. The degree to  which these downturns affected the Fund depended on their severity as  well as on the volume of mortgages insured by FHA in that region. Thus,  while New England suffered a severe downturn in the late 1980s and early  1990s, the Fund did not suffer significantly because the volume of loans  that FHA insures in New England represents a small share of FHA's total  volume of insured loans. Because regional averages diminish the impact of  the adverse economic experience, from each region we selected a state  with particularly poor experience as the basis for our scenarios. We also  adjusted the scenarios to recognize that the forecasts start from the  economic conditions that existed at the end of 1999. See appendix III for  further discussion of the scenarios that we used to test the adequacy of  FHA's capital ratio.", "As can be seen in table 2, neither the scenarios that are based on regional  downturns nor the scenario that is based on the 1981-82 national recession  had much of an effect on the value of the Fund. More specifically, in these  worse-than-expected scenarios that are based on specific historical  experiences, the estimated capital ratio never falls below 2.8 percent,  which is only 0.4 percentage points below our estimated capital ratio using  expected economic conditions. However, the national recession had the  greatest impact because it affected FHA's entire portfolio."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Under More Severe Economic Scenarios, the Capital Ratio Could Fall by More Than 2 Percentage Points", "paragraphs": ["Although the Fund's estimated capital ratio at the end of fiscal year 1999  fell by considerably less than 2 percentage points under economic  scenarios that are based on recent regional experiences and the 1981-82  national recession, our model suggests that extensions of some historical  regional scenarios to broader regions of the country could cause the capital  ratio to fall by more than 2 percentage points. Specifically, to test whether a  2-percent capital ratio could withstand more severe economic conditions,  we extended the regional scenarios to two regions and then to the nation as  a whole. However, we recognize that these extensions are less likely to  occur than the historical scenarios that affected a single region. As table 3  shows, if any of these downturns simultaneously hit two regions where  FHA has significant business\u2014the west south central and Pacific regions\u2014 the estimated capital ratio would be less than 2 percentage points lower  than it would be with expected loan performance. In addition, even if the  entire nation experienced a downturn similar to two of the three regional  downturns that we analyzed, the estimated capital ratio would still fall by  less than 2 percentage points. However, a national downturn as severe as  that experienced by Massachusetts from 1989 through 1992 would cause  our estimate of the 1999 capital ratio to fall by more than 2 percentage  points.", "Because we were concerned that the historical scenarios we were  considering might not be adequate to test the effect of changes in interest  rates, we developed two additional scenarios: one in which mortgage  interest rates fall and then a recession sets in and one in which mortgage  and other interest rates rise to levels that are higher than those in the  expected economic conditions scenario. The first scenario is more likely to  exhaust a 2-percent capital ratio.", "Under a scenario in which mortgage interest rates fall and then a recession  sets in, the drop in interest rates might induce some homeowners to  refinance their mortgages. For those homeowners who refinance outside of  FHA, the fund would no longer be accumulating revenue in the form of  annual premiums; if the homeowners have not had their mortgages for  long, they would receive some premium refunds. Moreover, those  borrowers who use FHA's streamline refinance provision that allows  borrowers to refinance their mortgages without a new appraisal of their  home will likely pay annual premiums for fewer years than if they had not  refinanced. So, cash outflows would have increased and cash inflows  would have decreased before the recession hits. When the recession hits,  cash outflows would increase further because of increased foreclosures  among the remaining borrowers. As table 3 shows, our model predicts that  the capital ratio would fall substantially\u2014by almost 2 percentage points\u2014 under this scenario.", "A scenario with rising mortgage interest rates will affect various loan types  differently. Because the payments on adjustable rate mortgages increase as  interest rates rise, there is an increased likelihood that borrowers with  these types of mortgages will default. However, since FHA-insured  mortgages are assumable, rising interest rates make fixed-rate mortgages  more valuable to those borrowers holding them. This decreases the  likelihood that borrowers with these types of mortgages will default.  Insurance on loans originated in 1998 and 1999 make up 42 percent of  FHA's portfolio at the end of fiscal year 1999, and the insured loans are  predominately fixed rate mortgages. Consequently, it is not surprising that  a rising interest rate scenario leads to an increase in the value of the Fund.", "Because our economic model did not predict regional or national  foreclosure rates as high as those experienced during the 1980s in any of  our scenarios, we estimated cash flows using foreclosure rates that more  closely matched regional experience during the 1980s. Specifically, we  assumed that for mortgages originated from 1989 through 1999, foreclosure  rates in 2000 through 2004 would equal those experienced from 1986  through 1990 by FHA-insured loans that originated between 1975 and 1985  in a given region. As table 3 shows, the capital ratio fell to 0.92 percent  under this scenario. To test an even more severe scenario, one similar to  that used by rating agencies for private mortgage insurers, we also  calculated future cash flows assuming that foreclosure rates in 2000  through 2004 extended the very poor performance of the west south central  mortgages in the 1980s to ever larger portions of FHA's insurance portfolio.  As figure 3 shows, we found that if 36.5 percent of FHA-insured mortgages  experienced these high default rates, the estimated capital ratio for fiscal  year 1999 would fall by 2 percentage points.

In particular, by  lowering the required down payment, conventional mortgage lenders and  private mortgage insurers may have attracted some borrowers who might  otherwise have insured their mortgages with FHA. If, by selectively offering  these low down payment loans, conventional mortgage lenders and private  mortgage insurers were able to attract FHA's lower-risk borrowers, recent  FHA loans with down payments of less than 5 percent may be more risky  on average than they have been historically. If this effect, known as adverse  selection, has been substantial, the economic value of the Fund may be  lower than we estimate, and it may be more difficult for the Fund to  withstand worse-than-expected loan performance than our estimates  suggest. In addition, should these competitive pressures persist, newly  insured loans are likely to perform worse than prior experience would  suggest, and then any given capital ratio would be less able to withstand  such performance. FHA is taking some action to more effectively compete.  For example, FHA is attempting to implement an automated underwriting  system that could enhance the ability of lenders underwriting FHA-insured  mortgages to distinguish better credit risks from poorer ones. Although this  effort is likely to increase the speed with which lenders process FHA- insured loans, it may not improve the risk profile of FHA borrowers unless  lenders can lower the price of insurance for better credit risks."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The Impacts of Options for Reducing FHA's Capital Ratio Are Difficult to Predict", "paragraphs": ["Several options are available to the Secretary of HUD under current  legislative authority that could result in reducing FHA's capital ratio.

Implementing these options could affect both the volume and the average  riskiness of loans made, which, in turn, could affect any future estimate of  the Fund's economic value. As a result of this complexity, obtaining a  reliable estimate would likely require that economic models be used to  estimate the indirect effects of policy changes. In 1990, the Congress  enacted legislation designed to provide better information on the Fund's  financial condition. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act requires  annual independent actuarial reviews of the Fund and includes credit  reforms that require HUD to estimate, for loans originated in a given year,  the net present value of the anticipated cash flows over all the years that  the loans will be in existence. The models developed by HUD to comply  with these requirements are based on detailed analyses of the Fund's  historical claim and loss rates and have improved HUD's ability to monitor  the financial condition of the Fund.

If no change in the volume of loans FHA insures  is considered, then the effect of lowering premiums, for example, clearly  would be to lower the economic value of the Fund. However, for two  reasons, this price reduction is likely to increase the volume of FHA loans  originated, which would increase both premium income and claims against  the Fund when some of these new loans default. First, by lowering the  price of FHA insurance relative to the price of private mortgage insurance,  this premium reduction would likely induce some borrowers who  otherwise would have obtained private mortgage insurance to obtain FHA  insurance instead, thereby increasing FHA's market share. Second, people  who were deferring home purchases because of the high price of FHA  insurance might buy homes with FHA insurance once the price is lower.  Without a complete analysis of the impact on the volume of loans, reliably  estimating the effect of lowering the premiums on the Fund's economic  value is difficult.", "Furthermore, the economic value of the Fund is influenced not only by the  volume of loans FHA insures, but also by the riskiness of those loans.  Therefore, determining the effect a policy change will have on the  economic value of the Fund requires determining how the policy will affect  the riskiness of FHA-insured loans. In the case of lowering up-front  premiums, for example, the new FHA-insured loans could be less risky than  FHA's existing loans. As a result, the new loans would be profitable and  offset the direct impact of lower premiums. Generally, private mortgage  insurers require that borrowers meet higher credit standards than does  FHA. So, to the extent that these new FHA borrowers would have obtained  private mortgage insurance without the lower premiums, they are likely to  have lower risk profiles than the average for all current FHA borrowers. At  the same time, lowering up-front premiums is not likely to attract many  additional higher-risk borrowers who would previously not have qualified  for FHA-insured loans.", "Because HUD does not have adequate tools to handle the complexities of  estimating the ultimate impact of policy changes on the volume of FHA- insured loans and the riskiness of those loans, these factors are not always  considered in assessing the impact of policy changes. For example,  assuming that the volume and riskiness of FHA-insured loans will not  change, HUD estimates that the recent reductions in up-front premiums  combined with the introduction of mortgage insurance cancellation  policies will lower the estimated value of the Fund by almost $6 billion over  the next 6 years. Because this estimate does not consider the possible  changes in the volume of loans that will be insured and the riskiness of  those loans, it is an estimate only of the direct impact rather than the full  impact of policy changes. Similarly, a recent study presents estimates that  lowering up-front premiums to 1.5 percent would result in an almost  fivefold increase in the likelihood that cash inflows would be less than  outflows over a random 10-year period. However, this study notes that it  did not look at how these changes would affect the riskiness of new loans.  The complexity of estimating the impact of policy changes on the Fund  implies that economic models would be needed to reliably estimate the  likely outcomes. The most likely sources for such models would be the  studies that compute the economic value of the Fund; however, the models  HUD and others have been using to assess the financial health of the Fund  do not explicitly recognize the impact of policy changes on the economic  value of the Fund.

One interpretation of  the higher premiums that borrowers paid during the period in which the  economic value of the fund has been rising is that borrowers during the  1990s \u201coverpaid\u201d for their insurance. Some options for reducing the capital  ratio, such as reinstituting distributive shares, would be more likely to  compensate these borrowers. Paying distributive shares would benefit  certain existing borrowers who voluntarily terminate their mortgages. If  these policies continued into the future, they would also benefit future  policyholders. Alternatively, reducing up-front premiums, reducing the  number of years over which annual insurance premiums must be paid, or  relaxing underwriting standards would tend to benefit only future  borrowers. Policy options that propose to use some of FHA's capital  resources for spending on other programs would benefit neither existing  nor future FHA-insured borrowers, but would instead benefit the recipients  of those programs receiving the new expenditures. For example, reducing  the capital ratio by shifting funds from the Fund to subsidize multifamily  housing may primarily benefit renters rather than single-family  homeowners.

Our results show that as of the end of fiscal year 1999,  only the most severe circumstances that we analyzed would cause the  current economic value of the Fund to fall below 0.", "One method of determining actuarial soundness would be to estimate the  value of the Fund under various economic and other scenarios. In our  analysis, the required minimum capital ratio of 2 percent appears sufficient  to cover most of the adverse economic scenarios we tested, although it  would not be possible to maintain the minimum under all scenarios.  Nonetheless, we urge caution in concluding that the estimated value of the  Fund today implies that the Fund could withstand the specified economic  scenarios regardless of the future activities of FHA or the market. Our  estimates and those of others are valid only under a certain set of  conditions, including that loans FHA recently insured respond to economic  conditions similarly to those it insured in the more distant past, and that  cash inflows associated with future loans at least offset outflows  associated with those loans. However, HUD is changing several policies  that may affect the volume and quality of its future business. Further,  adverse economic events cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, we  cannot attach a likelihood to any of the scenarios that we tested (even  though we recognize that it is less likely that a severe economic downturn  will affect the whole nation than one or two regions). It is instructive to  remember in considering the uncertainty of the future, that the Fund had  an even higher capital ratio in 1979 when the economic value of the Fund  equaled 5.3 percent of insurance-in-force, but in little more than a decade\u2014 after a national recession, the substitution of an up-front premium for  annual insurance premiums, and regional real estate declines\u2014the  economic value of the Fund was negative. Thus, it is important to  periodically reevaluate the actuarial soundness of the Fund.", "Today, FHA knows more about the condition of the Fund but could still  improve its evaluation of the impact that unexpected economic downturns  and policy changes may have on the Fund. HUD has already taken some  action that it estimates will lower the value of the Fund, including reducing  up-front insurance premiums on newly insured mortgages. HUD has done  so without the tools necessary to reliably measure the multiple impacts  that these policies are likely to have.

In  developing the earlier models, we examined existing studies of the single- family housing programs of both the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA);  academic literature on the modeling of mortgage foreclosures and  prepayments; and previous work that Price Waterhouse (now  PricewaterhouseCoopers), HUD, VA, ourselves, and others had performed  on modeling government mortgage programs.  For our current analysis, we  modified our previous models on the basis of our examination of work  performed recently by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte & Touche, and  others; discussions we held with analysts familiar with modeling mortgage  foreclosures and prepayments; and program changes made by FHA since  our previous work was performed.  For these models, we used data  supplied by FHA and Standard & Poor\u2019s DRI, a private economic  forecasting company.  We also used information from FHA\u2019s independent  actuarial reviews in our analysis.", "Our econometric analysis estimated the historical relationships between  the probability of loan foreclosure and prepayment and key explanatory  factors, such as the borrower's equity and the interest rate.

To test the validity of our  econometric models, we examined how well the models predicted the  actual rates of FHA's loan foreclosures and prepayments through fiscal  year 1999.  We found that our predicted rates closely resembled the actual  rates.  Next, we used our estimates of these relationships and forecasts of  future economic conditions provided by Standard & Poor\u2019s DRI to develop  a baseline forecast of future loan foreclosures and prepayments for loans  that were active at the end of fiscal year 1999.", "To estimate the net present value of future cash flows of the Fund under  expected economic conditions, we used our forecast of future loan  foreclosures and prepayments in conjunction with a cash flow model that  we developed to measure the primary sources and uses of cash for loans  that originated from fiscal years 1975 through 1999.  Our cash flow model  was constructed to estimate cash flows for each policy year through the life  of a mortgage.  An important component of the model was the conversion  of all income and expense streams\u2014regardless of the period in which they  are actually forecasted to occur\u2014into their 1999 present value equivalents.   We then added the forecasted 1999 present values of the future cash flows  to the current cash available to the Fund, which we obtained from  documents used to prepare FHA's 1999 audited financial statements, to  estimate the Fund's economic value and resulting capital ratio.  A detailed  discussion of our models and methodology for estimating the economic  value and capital ratio of the Fund appears in appendix II.", "To compare our estimates of the Fund's economic value and capital ratio  with the estimates prepared for FHA by Deloitte & Touche, we reviewed  Deloitte's report and met with its analysts and HUD officials to learn more  about that study's methodology, data, and assumptions.", "To determine the extent to which a capital ratio of 2 percent would allow  the Fund to withstand worse-than-expected loan performance, we  developed various scenarios for future economic conditions that we  anticipated would result in substantially worse loan performance than we  forecasted in our scenario using expected economic conditions.  We based  these scenarios on the economic conditions that led to episodes of  relatively high foreclosure rates for FHA single-family loans in certain  regions of the country at different times during the 1975 through 1999  period and on those experienced nationally during the 1981-82 recession.   We developed additional scenarios that extended the adverse regional  economic conditions to larger sections of the country to analyze how well  the Fund could withstand conditions even worse than what we had  experienced in the past 25 years.  We also developed some additional  scenarios with even higher foreclosure rates to further analyze the Fund's  ability to withstand adverse conditions.", "Under each of the scenarios that we developed, we used our estimated  relationships between foreclosure and prepayment rates and various  explanatory factors, and the future economic conditions implied by the  scenarios, to forecast future foreclosures and prepayments for loans that  were active at the end of fiscal year 1999.  We then used these forecasts, in  conjunction with our cash flow model, to estimate the economic value and  capital ratio of the Fund under each scenario.  The difference between  these estimates and our estimate under expected economic conditions  shows whether each scenario is likely to result in a reduction of the Fund's  economic value of more than 2 percent and, therefore, whether a 2-percent  capital ratio is likely to be sufficient to allow the Fund to withstand the  worse-than-expected loan performance associated with such a scenario.", "Our analysis of the adequacy of FHA\u2019s capital ratio is limited to the  performance of loans in FHA's portfolio as of the end of fiscal year 1999.   That is, our analysis assesses the likelihood that an economic value of 2  percent of the unamortized insurance-in-force would be sufficient to cover  the excess of future payments over future cash inflows (on a net present  value basis) on those loans if they perform worse than expected.  Our  analysis of the ability of the Fund to withstand various adverse economic  conditions requires making the assumption that the adverse conditions  would not also cause loans insured by FHA after fiscal year 1999 to be an  economic drain on the Fund.  Since the 1990 reforms, the cash flows  associated with each year\u2019s loans have been estimated to have a positive  economic value, thereby adding to the economic value of the entire Fund.   However, during adverse economic times, new loans might perform worse  than loans that were insured by FHA during the 1990s.  If the newly insured  loans perform so poorly that they have a negative economic value, then the  loss to the Fund in any of the adverse economic scenarios that we have  considered would be greater than what we have estimated.  Alternatively, if  the newly insured loans have positive economic values, then the Fund  would continue to grow.", "To identify other factors, such as recent program and market changes, that  could cause worse-than-expected loan performance, we reviewed the laws  and regulations governing FHA\u2019s insurance program, studied recent  actuarial reviews of the Fund, and interviewed experts.

A negative relationship might also exist if a borrower\u2019s passing  up one profitable refinancing opportunity reflected a lack of financial  sophistication that, in turn, would be associated with passing up additional  opportunities.  However, a borrower who anticipated moving soon might  pass up an apparently profitable refinancing opportunity to avoid the  transaction costs associated with refinancing.

Instead, we defined four variables, CHANGEPOS,  CHANGENEG, CAPPEDPOS, and CAPPEDNEG, to capture the  relationship between current interest rates and the interest rate paid on  each mortgage.  CHANGEPOS measures how far the interest rate on the  mortgage has increased since origination, with a minimum of 0, while  CHANGENEG measures how far the rate has decreased, with a maximum  of 0.  CAPPEDPOS measures how much farther the interest rate on the  mortgage would rise, if prevailing interest rates in the market did not  change, while CAPPEDNEG measures how much farther the mortgage\u2019s  rate would fall, if prevailing interest rates did not change.  For example, if  an ARM was originated at 7 percent and interest rates increased by 250  basis points 1 year later, CHANGEPOS would equal 100 because FHA\u2019s  ARMs can increase by no more than 100 basis points in a year.   CAPPEDPOS would equal 150 basis points, since the mortgage rate would  eventually increase by another 150 basis points if market interest rates did  not change, and CHANGENEG and CAPPEDNEG would equal 0.

In other words, on average, there is a \u00bd of a 1-percent  chance for a loan of this type to result in a claim payment in any particular  year.  By holding other predictor variables at their mean values, we can  describe the effect on the conditional foreclosure probability of changes in  the values of predictor variables of interest.  For example, if the average  value of the unemployment rate were to increase by 1 percentage point  from its mean value (in our sample) of about 6 percent to about 7 percent,  the conditional foreclosure probability would increase by about 20 percent  (from 0.5 percent to about 0.6 percent).

We  designed the historical scenarios to test the ability of the Fund to withstand  adverse economic conditions similar to those that adversely affected the  Fund in the 1980s and 1990s.  Because some of these adverse conditions  affected only certain regions, in some scenarios we expanded our analysis  to include estimates of the capital ratio when the historical conditions were  assumed to affect a larger share of FHA's business, including when they  were assumed to affect the entire nation.  In contrast, the judgmental  scenarios that we developed are not based on historical experience.   Instead, they represent conditions that we believe might place stress on the  Fund.", "The key economic variables for which we forecast different values in the  different scenarios are the rate of house price appreciation; the  unemployment rate; and, in some instances, certain interest rates,  especially the mortgage interest rate.  In addition, we assumed that FHA's  loss per claim (the loss rate), expressed as a percentage of the claim  amount, was greater than the loss rate that we used in our base case  analysis under expected economic conditions.  We assumed that FHA  would experience higher loss rates when foreclosures were substantially  higher because of the difficulty of managing and disposing of a large  number of properties at the same time.  In addition, the demand for housing  would be likely to fall during an economic downturn, making it more  difficult to dispose of properties than in the base case."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Historical Scenarios", "paragraphs": ["Three regional economic downturns and the 1981-82 national recession  form the bases of our historical scenarios.  Each regional downturn was  associated with a regional decline in house prices.  Declining house prices  represent a particularly adverse condition for the Fund because of the  strong negative relationship between borrowers' equity and the probability  of defaults leading to foreclosures.  The three regional economic  downturns, and associated housing price declines, that we used were (1)  the late 1980s' decline in the oil-producing states of the west south central  region; (2) the late 1980s' and early 1990s' decline in New England; and (3)  the early to mid-1990s' decline in the Pacific region, particularly in  California.", "For each scenario that is based on a regional downturn, we assumed that  for 4 years the rate of house price change for the part of the nation assumed  to be affected by the downturn equaled the rate of house price change in  the state in that region that we selected to represent the regional  experience.  We selected the experiences of (1) Louisiana, beginning in  1986, to represent the oil price downturn; (2) Massachusetts, beginning in  1988, to represent the New England economic downturn; and (3)  California, beginning in 1991, to represent the California housing market  downturn.  Table 13 shows the median house prices for existing houses in  these states during their economic downturns. In calculating homeowner's  equity, we made the same adjustment to annual changes in median house  prices that we did in our base case, as described in appendix II. Similarly, in  our scenarios that are based on regional downturns, we assumed that  unemployment rates would change in the affected area for 4 years by the  same percentages as those rates changed in Louisiana; Massachusetts; and  California, respectively.", "We developed six separate scenarios that are based on each regional  downturn, by varying the scope (i.e., the number of states assumed to be  affected) and timing of the adverse economic conditions in the forecast  period.  Specifically, we used three different scopes.  In the narrowest  scope, we assumed that only the particular region was affected.  That is, for  the scenario based on the downturn in the west south central region in the  late 1980s, we assumed that during 4 years of the forecast period, all of the  states in the west south central region experienced the same changes in  key economic variables as Louisiana experienced from 1987 through 1990.   We then expanded the scope by assuming that two regions in which FHA  has a lot of borrowers, the west south central and Pacific regions, were  affected.  Finally, we then expanded the scope to the entire nation, by  assuming that all states were affected.", "Regarding timing, for each scope we developed two scenarios, one in  which the downturn began in 2000 and one in which it began in 2001.   Although we know that an economic downturn did not begin in 2000, we  developed scenarios starting then to test the ability of the Fund to  withstand an economic downturn that occurs when the portfolio contains  many recent loans.  Scenarios in which the downturn does not begin until  2001 would be expected to be less adverse because most of the large  number of borrowers who took out mortgages in 1998 and 1999 would have  seen substantial price appreciation in 2000, thereby reducing the likelihood  of default.", "We developed two historical scenarios that are based on the 1981-82  recession and subsequent recovery.  In those scenarios, we assumed that in  each state, the rates of change in house price appreciation and  unemployment for 5 years during the forecast period are the same as they  were from 1981 through 1985.  In one scenario, we assumed that these  adverse conditions replicating 1981 through 1985 began in 2000; in the  other scenario, we assumed that they began in 2001.  Under these  scenarios, some states fared better than in the base case scenario.", "Because it will be more difficult to manage and dispose of foreclosed  properties during an economic downturn, we increased the loss rates on  the proportion of mortgages affected by a given scenario during the years  the scenario runs.  We assumed that losses on affected foreclosed  properties would rise to 45 percent of the property\u2019s value.  Without this,  loss rates average about 37 percent.", "Our estimates of the economic value of the Fund and the capital ratio for  the historical scenarios are presented in table 14.", "Judgmental Scenarios  We developed several judgmental scenarios to test the ability of the Fund to  withstand various types of economic conditions that might adversely affect  the Fund without regard to their relationship to historical experience.  In  one scenario, we assumed that median existing house prices declined by 5  percent per year for 3 consecutive years\u2014an extremely steep rate of  decline\u2014and that unemployment increased compared with the base case,  with both changes beginning in 2001.  Specifically, we increased the  unemployment rates in each state from forecasted levels by 2 percentage  points in 2001; 5 percentage points in 2002, 2003, and 2004; and 2  percentage points in 2005.  In a second scenario, we allowed the mortgage  interest rate to decline in 2000\u2014by 2 percentage points from its forecasted  level\u2014and then to return to forecasted levels.  We did this to precipitate a  wave of refinancing.  We also assumed declining house prices and rising  unemployment beginning in 2001, as in the previous judgmental scenario.  We used this scenario to test what might happen if premium income turns  out to be substantially less than expected and premium refunds  substantially more than expected because of rapid prepayment of loans,  most of which would not default.  In our third scenario, we added 1  percentage point to the base case forecasts of the mortgage interest rate,  and 1- and 10-year Treasury rates for the year 2000, 3 percentage points to  the forecasts of these interest rates between 2001 and 2003, and 1  percentage point in 2004.  We used this scenario to test what might happen  if interest rates were to rise more than anticipated.  In a fourth scenario, we  used the same rising interest rates as in the third scenario and also added  one percentage point to the forecasts of median existing house prices over  that period.", "Our estimates of the economic value of the Fund and the capital ratio for  the judgmental scenarios are also presented in table 14.", "In another type of judgmental scenario, we did not forecast the economic  variables and then use the forecasted claims and prepayments from our  econometric model, as we did with all of our other scenarios, both  judgmental and historical.  Instead, because none of our other scenarios  produced foreclosure rates nearly as high as FHA experienced in the 1980s,  we developed two scenarios in which we directly assumed higher  foreclosure rates.  First, we assumed that in 2000 through 2004, the  proportion of loans insured in each region experienced for the 1989  through 1999 books of business the same foreclosure rates that the 1975  through 1985 books of business experienced in that region in 1986 through  1990.  This scenario produced a capital ratio of 0.92 percent.  Second, we  assumed that in 2000 through 2004, varying proportions of FHA\u2019s portfolio  experienced for the 1989 through 1999 books of business the same  foreclosure rates that the 1975 through 1985 books of business experienced  in the west south central states in 1986 through 1990.  Because streamline  refinanced mortgages and ARMs did not exist or were minimal parts of  FHA\u2019s portfolio from 1975 through 1985, foreclosure rates were not  adjusted for these types of loans.  For the other products\u201430-year fixed- rate, 15-year fixed-rate, investor, and graduated payment mortgages\u2014 foreclosure rates were adjusted accordingly for each type of product.  For  this scenario, we found that if 36.5 percent of FHA-insured mortgages  experienced these high default rates, the estimated capital ratio for fiscal  year 1999 would fall by 2 percentage points, and if about 55 percent of  FHA's portfolio experienced these conditions, the economic value would  be depleted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Nancy Barry, Elaine Boudreau, Steve  Brown, Jay Cherlow, Kimberly Granger, DuEwa Kamara, John McDonough,  Salvatore F.
