In that report, DOD proposed some actions to reduce its infrastructure, including personnel reductions, base closures and realignments to reduce additional excess facilities, and streamlined operations. Actions and initiatives as a result of the Quadrennial Defense Review were to be reflected in the fiscal year 1999 budget and FYDP for fiscal years 1999-2003.", "Central training programs include individual training activities such as new personnel training, skill and proficiency training, initial pilot and navigator training, management of the central training system, and the support of central training installations. These programs provide training for active military personnel, reserve component personnel, and DOD civilians.

According to DOD and service training officials, although these commands do not manage the military personnel appropriations portion of central training funds (used for instructor and student salaries), the commands are responsible for course operations (i.e. the development of course curricula, course books and supplies, etc.); the maintenance of training facilities; and the administration of the training programs.", "Central training is different from unit mission training. Unit mission training is undertaken by operational units to maintain the units\u2019 required readiness in their primary combat, combat support, or combat service support missions. Central training is the training of individual military members in formal courses.", "The services consider a number of factors in formulating their central training requirements. Factors include projected authorized end strength, losses in each occupational specialty/category by grade and years in grade, accessions, promotions, and reenlistments. Therefore, a change in end strength levels may not lead to a proportional change in training requirements. For example, higher than expected separation rates may require increased training requirements despite programmed lower personnel levels. The services compile \u201ctraining workload\u201d to determine resources (people, funds, material, and facilities) required to conduct training.

During 1992-96, enlisted workload declined as end strength fell, resulting in decreased funding levels for the training of new personnel. Installation support fell 8.5 percent between 1992 and 1996 due to the closure of two technical training bases and two flying training wings in 1993 and 1994. In addition, aviation and flight training declined 31 percent since the Air Force had to train fewer pilots during this period as it drew pilots out of its excess pilot inventory. Offsetting some of this decline were some significant increases in other categories. For example, professional and skill training funding increased 10.7 percent between 1993 and 1996. In fiscal year 1992, the Air Force initiated servicewide improvements in its training establishment, called the \u201cYear of Training\u201d initiatives.

ITRO\u2019s role is to facilitate the consolidation/collocation of similar occupational and training courses managed by the services. Participation in ITRO is voluntary, and therefore, a service can reject recommended course consolidations. The implementing regulations make no provision for oversight by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) or the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Regulations, however, discourage major capital investments for consolidation and state that if major capital investment is required, savings should offset the investment within 10 years. Today, ITRO is focusing on ways to improve training efficiency/effectiveness through more extensive use of technology, and continuing efforts to consolidate courses.", "Interservice training regulations govern the process to consolidate/collocate courses. Serviceable training materials and equipment are transferred to a host service without reimbursement to the donating services. The participating services should provide the proportionate share of instructor and school support personnel to the host service in order to support consolidated training. When a course is consolidated, the host service is responsible for making changes to the course so that it complies with the new curriculum that all of the participating services have approved. The participating services must also provide the host service with an estimate of their need for school graduates (estimated trained personnel requirements). The host service will, in turn, provide training positions and facilities for students from other participating services.", "ITRO is working to overcome some obstacles to the consolidation of courses. The host service historically has not been reimbursed for the additional costs of training the other services\u2019 personnel. Recent draft ITRO regulations have established ground rules for resource transfers. Also, the services have not always provided their proportionate share of support.", "For example, the Army, following a base closure, agreed informally with the Navy to relocate two courses to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Army and Navy students would be trained. A study in 1997 established the Navy\u2019s fair share bill for these courses, and the Navy training command agreed to pay. Later, Navy headquarters told the Navy training command that it would not receive funding for the joint courses, and now the Navy wants to establish its own version of the same courses at a Navy facility using different resources.", "One factor limiting course consolidations is the unavailability of facilities for interservice classes. While it may seem logical to consolidate similar courses at one location, it may be costly to build the facilities necessary for the increased training workload from consolidated courses. Also, different service standards impact consolidation decisions. For example, the services have different housing standards for their students. The cost to consolidate a course would be affected if the host service has to upgrade existing housing facilities to accomodate higher standards.", "As part of the Roles and Missions effort, in November 1992, the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, asked the service chiefs, through ITRO, to conduct a thorough review of all technical and operations technical training across three functional areas: combat service support, combat support, and combat operations. This review, known as the Military Training Structure Review, was conducted over 3 years, January 1993 to December 1995, to eliminate unnecessary duplication of like training across the services. Of the two types of training, institutional and unit, only institutional or formal school training programs were reviewed to meet the prescribed 3-year time constraint. The Review\u2019s scope was limited to initial/entry-level training.", "Four tenets were established to guide the review. First, eliminate duplication, create cost savings, and develop single-site training where feasible. Second, use a systems approach that considers factors such as cost, personnel, and infrastructure and their impact on the services. Third, establish an essential long-term perspective, unconstrained by a short-term initial startup cost, to posture for optimum out-year training capability. Finally, provide recommendations consistent with the readiness, responsibilities, and requirements of the services.", "ITRO identified similar courses for possible consolidation/collocation. ITRO identified 49 occupational training areas, consisting of 1,517 military training courses, for possible consolidation/collocation. Of the courses considered, 128 were consolidated/collocated. ITRO reported that nearly 50,000 students would be trained in a consolidated/collocated environment\u201441 percent of that number from the Army, 24 percent Air Force, 20 percent Navy, and 15 percent from the Marine Corps. As a result of the Review, DOD reported it will realize an estimated annual recurring savings of $8.2 million for a one-time cost of $9.4 million, with a payback period of 1.1 years.", "A specific example where ITRO directed consolidations involves dental technicians. The Army trained dental specialists, the Air Force trained dental assistant specialists, and the Navy trained dental technicians, before the Review. The ITRO Executive Board recommended that all of these courses, plus several similar ones, be consolidated at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. The Board determined that there would be a one-time cost of $633,000 for this consolidation but annual recurring savings of $218,000 would accrue.", "Today, ITRO is monitoring the implementation of the Review\u2019s recommendations, evaluating training technology initiatives, and continuing efforts to consolidate courses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distance Learning", "paragraphs": ["Distance learning is structured training that can take place almost anywhere and anytime without the physical presence of a student at a resident training institution. Distance learning can be facilitated by newer technology such as computers, video conferencing, the Internet, and satellite communications, or older means such as correspondence courses.", "DOD is emphasizing distance learning concepts today for several reasons. First is the changing nature of the tasks assigned to the U.S. military. Missions other than war, such as peacekeeping, drug interdiction, and disaster relief, may require rapid ad hoc preparations for unusual contingencies. Distance learning can rapidly disseminate information developed for those missions. Second, it can increase force readiness by providing geographically dispersed personnel better access to training. Finally, DOD believes that downsizing means that it is less able to afford the time and resources needed to assemble students in a single location to provide training. Distance learning can increase the cost-effectiveness of training delivery systems by reducing the central training infrastructure and eliminating some of the travel costs associated with individual training.", "To implement a distance learning program, we reported that a substantial investment will be required. OSD officials estimated that DOD would need to invest as much as $2 billion for distance learning over the next  10 years. Even though estimated savings through the increased use of distance learning is an important factor in justifying the programs, the services have not developed a method to quantify the total savings. However, the Army estimates that it will achieve over $900 million in operation and maintenance savings and cost avoidances from 1998 to 2010.", "OSD has facilitated the coordination of the services\u2019 distance learning plans and activities by sponsoring working groups to facilitate the increased use of distance learning and publishing specifications and guidance for military training products. For example, DOD issued an instruction that mandated standards for interactive courseware. Although OSD has actively promoted collaboration among the services, it has not developed a departmentwide strategy to focus service efforts. As a result, each of the services is pursuing its own distance learning strategy. Service officials noted that having a departmentwide strategy could prevent duplicative efforts, and inadequate sharing of resources and attention to the needs of both active and reserve forces.", "Not all courses, however, can be taught by distance learning. The services must review thousands of courses to determine which can be taught via distance learning technologies. After reviewing 2,000 courses, the Army plans to convert about 525 traditional courses to distance learning and has estimated that it would cost about $20 million in 1998 to convert 31 of these courses. The Air Force has about 4,000 courses that it must review for conversion. In fiscal year 1999, the Air Force plans to fund one-time start up funding for distance learning equipment and software. The Navy is reviewing about 4,000 courses and the Marine Corps plans to review about 250 courses for conversion to distance learning.", "In addition to determining the number of courses that can be taught through distance learning, training developers must determine the best and most cost-effective media for delivering distance learning. From 1989 to 1994, the Army conducted pilot studies to determine the effectiveness of training with five distance learning technologies: video teletraining, computer conferencing, computer-based instruction, voice-based computer-based instruction, and desktop video production. The Army concluded that the instructional delivery medium would not significantly affect training effectiveness compared with traditional face-to-face training and that distance learning could significantly decrease the time a soldier is absent from his home station, thereby reducing travel and per diem costs.", "Along with developing the distance learning courses, the services must establish facilities and acquire the necessary communications equipment to transmit their distance learning courses. The Army, for example, is planning to establish 745 distance learning classrooms that will be linked through a commercial telecommunications network. The Army currently has 100 television network sites that have delivered 30,000 hours of training to at least 100,000 Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and civilian students in fiscal year 1996.", "Today, all of the services have begun to incorporate distance learning technology into their training programs. The Army is the only service that has a formally documented distance learning plan, which has been endorsed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense as a model for developing and implementing the concept. The plan establishes critical milestones and funding requirements for both active and reserve forces.", "The Air Force has used a satellite broadcast network for distance learning since 1992. The Air Force has increased the amount of network broadcast hours from less than 500 in 1992 to 2,000 in 1996, and it projects that it will use 4,500 broadcast hours by 1999. Today, the network reaches every U.S. base.", "The Air Force Reserve leases its satellite network equipment from the Army and uses the Army\u2019s television network system. The Air Force Reserve has 46 Army video teletraining sites that are capable of both two-way video and audio and has five Air Force network sites that receive programs from the active Air Force satellite broadcast network. The Air Force Reserve system broadcasted 2,800 hours in fiscal year 1996. The Air National Guard uses the same satellite broadcast system as the active Air Force and maintains 202 of its own sites that can receive broadcasted courses.", "The Navy has a video teletraining network that is used for both distance learning and teleconferencing. The system uses satellites to broadcast to ships at sea and telecommunication lines to deliver courses on shore. The system, which consists of 19 sites and 25 classrooms, is available 24 hours every day and is used an average of 10 hours per day, 5 days a week. In 1997, the Navy offered 52 courses through its network.

It hopes to do this through the development of a common technical framework for computer and network-based learning that will foster the creation of reusable learning content as instructional modules. DOD envisions ADL as a collaborative effort among DOD, other government agencies, education communities, and the private sector. It also thinks that many university and business training organizations are interested in the same kind of system.

Since a portion of DOD training is core material that does not change over time, DOD will be able to reuse these core modules, as well as many applications and utilities. Only certain modules would need to be updated regularly, which would be less costly than completely revising an entire course.", "Some of the courseware will be applicable to private training needs as well as DOD\u2019s needs. For example, the services train personnel in wheeled vehicle maintenance, as does General Motors. Therefore, courseware and job performance aids might be developed jointly to meet the needs of both parties and be network-based for delivery, feedback, and management. Some of the courseware may already be developed, and through collaboration with industry, DOD may be able to capitalize on what is available in private industry.", "The ADL participants have established a three-phased approach for designing the ADL concept that will run through June 1999. During  Phase I, participants will develop and refine functional and technical requirements and identify opportunities for collaboration. Phase II is expected to consist of issuing initial guidelines for a common ADL framework and building and testing pilot models.
