As an alternative to traditional treatments, some researchers have studied the use of HBO2 therapy, which delivers higher levels of oxygen to the body inside of pressurized hyperbaric chambers to promote healing. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, included a provision for GAO to review the use of HBO2 therapy to treat TBI and PTSD.", "This report identifies and describes published research on the use of HBO2 therapy for these conditions. GAO conducted a literature review for relevant articles published in peer-reviewed journals during the most recent 10-year period, from January 1, 2005 through April 6, 2015. GAO interviewed DOD, VA, and researchers affiliated with published articles, as well as other stakeholders, including officials with the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. GAO also interviewed officials from the Food and Drug Administration about the process to approve HBO2 therapy for the treatment of TBI and PTSD.", "GAO provided a draft of this report to DOD, VA, and the Department of Health and Human Services.

The 32 articles consisted of 7 case reports (reports on the treatment of individuals), 10 literature reviews (reviews of studies), and 15 articles on interventional studies or clinical trials, which provide the strongest clinical evidence about a treatment. Three of the 15 articles on interventional studies or clinical trials focused on the safety of HBO2 therapy for treating TBI and concluded that it is safe. The other 12 articles described the effectiveness of HBO2 therapy in treating TBI. Four of these articles (two on severe TBI and two that did not specify severity) reported that HBO2 therapy was effective. The remaining eight articles focused on mild TBI\u2014six concluded that it was not effective and two concluded that it was.", "The six articles that concluded HBO2 therapy was not effective in treating mild TBI were based on three studies funded by the Department of Defense (DOD) with collaboration from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and others. Each of the DOD-funded studies 1) was randomized\u2014participants were randomly assigned to clinical trial groups, 2) was double-blinded\u2014neither researchers nor participants knew who was assigned to which group, and 3) included a sham control group\u2014participants received a procedure that was similar to HBO2 therapy but lacked certain components of the intervention. However, there is no standard design for sham control groups in HBO2 therapy, and in each of the DOD-funded studies the approach varied. The authors of the six articles based on these studies concluded that HBO2 therapy was not effective in treating mild TBI because participants in the sham control and treatment groups had similar outcomes. Although both groups showed improvement, the researchers concluded that this was likely due to other factors, such as a placebo effect. Researchers not affiliated with the DOD-funded studies have raised concerns about whether the sham control groups received a placebo or a therapeutic treatment. In a published editorial, researchers affiliated with one of the DOD-funded studies acknowledged the challenges associated with designing a sham control group and stated that additional research would be needed to determine whether these participants actually received a therapeutic benefit. DOD officials told us that studying the long-term effects of the treatment also would help confirm whether the sham control groups' improvements should be attributed to a placebo effect.", "The two articles that concluded that HBO2 therapy was effective in treating mild TBI were based on studies that were designed differently than the DOD-funded studies. DOD and VA researchers told GAO that the studies related to these articles did not have the same methodological rigor as the DOD-funded studies because they did not have design features such as sham control groups, which help ensure the validity of a study's findings. The researchers for one of these two studies noted in their article that they did not use a sham control group because it was difficult to ensure that participants would receive a non-therapeutic treatment. Researchers for the other study noted in their article that a sham control group was not used because this was preliminary work, and further work would be needed to confirm the findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  are signature wounds for servicemembers returning from the conflicts in  Iraq and Afghanistan. TBI is a traumatically induced structural injury or  physiological disruption of brain function resulting from an external force  that is indicated by clinical signs, such as confusion, disorientation, or  memory loss. PTSD is a trauma- and stressor-related disorder that can  develop after an extremely stressful event, such as the threat of death or  serious injury. The nature of the current conflicts\u2014particularly the  widespread use of improvised explosive devices\u2014increases the  likelihood that active duty servicemembers will be exposed to incidents,  such as blasts, that can result in these conditions.", "TBIs vary greatly in terms of severity. Mild TBIs are commonly referred to  as concussions and may be difficult to detect because of the absence of a  visible injury, while severe cases may involve an extended period of  unconsciousness or amnesia after the injury. The health implications of  TBI, which can be dependent on the severity of the injury, may include a  wide range of physical, mental, social, and emotional symptoms. The  majority of TBIs overall, in the military and the general population, have  been classified as mild. Most individuals with mild TBI recover quickly,  within a matter of hours to days.", "Symptoms of PTSD include insomnia, intense anxiety, nightmares, and  difficulties coping with work, family, and social relationships, among  others. PTSD can also be associated with substance abuse, severe  depression, and suicide. Experts believe that early identification and  treatment of PTSD-related symptoms may lessen the severity of the  condition and improve the overall quality of life for servicemembers.  Studies have found that one-third or more of servicemembers with mild  TBI also have PTSD.", "Treatment for mild TBIs may consist of therapies, such as physical and  cognitive rest, while treatment for moderate and severe TBIs is usually  focused on managing the initial injury to the brain followed by other  therapies. To treat PTSD, patients are often prescribed various  psychotropic drugs to ease their symptoms, although these drugs may  have negative side effects. As an alternative to these treatments, some  researchers have studied the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy to  treat TBI or PTSD, which delivers higher-than-normal levels of oxygen to  the body inside of a hyperbaric chamber and is hypothesized to promote  healing, reduce brain damage, and improve long-term outcomes. Some of  these researchers have reported positive results with this therapy. In  contrast, research conducted by the Department of Defense (DOD) and  the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has found that it does not appear  to be effective in treating mild TBI based on their research to date.

The  diagnosis of moderate and severe TBI usually occurs in a timely manner  due to the visible nature of the head injury, as well as the duration of  symptoms, such as memory loss. Identification of mild TBI, also known as  a concussion, can be challenging because there may be no visible head  injury, and symptoms may be minimal and brief. In addition, in the combat  theater, a mild TBI may not be identified if it occurs at the same time as  other combat injuries that are more visible or life-threatening, such as  orthopedic injuries or open wounds. Furthermore, some of the symptoms  of mild TBI, which account for the majority of these injuries in the military,  are similar to those associated with other conditions, such as PTSD.", "Individuals sustaining mild TBIs often report physical, cognitive, and  emotional or behavioral symptoms referred to collectively as  postconcussion symptoms. The most commonly reported postconcussion  symptoms are headache, dizziness, decreased concentration, memory  problems, irritability, fatigue, visual disturbances, sensitivity to noise,  judgment problems, depression, and anxiety. Although the majority of  individuals with mild TBI have symptoms that resolve within 1 month,  some symptoms may persist for months to years following injury,  potentially becoming permanent and causing disability. When these  symptoms are persistent, they are often referred to as postconcussion  syndrome or persistent postconcussion symptoms.", "PTSD can develop following exposure to life-threatening events, natural  disasters, terrorist incidents, serious accidents, or violent personal  assaults and may have a delayed onset, which is described as a clinically  significant presentation of symptoms at least 6 months after exposure to  trauma.
