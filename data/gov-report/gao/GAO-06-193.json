In response to congressional direction, Joint Forces Command, designated as DOD's executive agent for urban operations training, contracted for a study, completed in early 2005, to identify facility and training requirements. In May 2005, the Command began working with the services to review the study's results and to develop the detailed facility and training requirements needed to form the basis for a joint training strategy. While the draft strategy identifies some facility needs, as of October 2005, the Command and services have not reached consensus on the level or types of joint training exercises needed to prepare troops for urban operations. As a result, the Command has been unable to finalize the strategy or the facility and joint training requirements that will form the baseline for measuring capabilities within each service and across DOD. DOD officials told us they will not be able to deliver the required baseline on time and instead plan to provide criteria for the Congress to use in evaluating service facility plans. Until the Command develops an overall strategy for joint urban operations training and related requirements, neither the Secretary of Defense nor the Congress will have a sound basis for evaluating service training and facility plans, and related funding requests. Despite DOD's increasing emphasis on the importance of training for joint urban operations before deployment, few opportunities currently exist for training that places troops from different services on the ground working under a joint headquarters. Joint and service doctrine both require forces to be prepared to operate jointly across the full range of military operations. Various factors account for the lack of joint training opportunities, such as the services' focus on service-specific skills, and the lack of an overall strategy requiring joint urban operations training, specific training requirements, and a formal mechanism to schedule joint training at service facilities. Without a strategy, defined requirements, and a joint scheduling mechanism, DOD cannot be assured that joint urban operations training will occur or that it will maximize the joint usage of training facilities. While DOD has taken steps to incorporate lessons learned from ongoing operations into its training program, training and troop personnel GAO interviewed offered suggestions, based on their own operational experience, for further enhancing training. One of DOD's training goals is to train as it expects to fight. Based on feedback from ongoing operations, DOD has made several adjustments, including constructing urban structures, using civilian role players, and adding training on techniques to counter emerging enemy tactics. Persons GAO interviewed cited the need for more live-fire capability, larger numbers of role players, information gathering and cultural awareness training, and training with newly fielded equipment. While DOD plans more improvements, until it develops a strategy and specific requirements as discussed above, it lacks a solid basis to evaluate suggestions, and guide its improvement efforts and investment decisions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted the challenges  facing U.S. forces as they conduct military operations in urban  environments, typically referred to as urban operations. These challenges  include the presence of large numbers of noncombatants, a high density of  buildings that complicate the coordination of firing weapons, a diminished  effectiveness of communications equipment, and an increased ability of  insurgents or guerrilla fighters to conceal their whereabouts. Based on  ongoing operations, which often require U.S. forces to conduct urban  operations, military commanders have increasingly called for more training  in this area. In response, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the military  services have begun placing a higher priority on urban operations training.  DOD has also increasingly emphasized the importance of joint training,  including exercises to prepare U.S. forces to conduct joint urban  operations. DOD defines a joint exercise as the interaction of joint forces  or joint staffs conducted under a joint headquarters according to joint  doctrine that prepares forces/staffs to respond to operational  requirements.

In the latter report, the Senate Armed Services Committee noted the  services will continue to address urban operations training requirements  and expend resources independently with minimal coordination and  cooperation until a comprehensive joint training plan and investment  strategy are approved and implemented within the department. In  response, the Joint Forces Command has been working with the military  services to develop an overall training strategy that addresses the need for  troops to train jointly for urban operations, and related facility and training  requirements.

Additionally, we visited several service  training installations and combat training centers in the United States as  well as overseas, observed exercises, and analyzed training documents to  identify the extent of joint participation in exercises and improvements  made to urban operations training as a result of lessons learned from  ongoing operations. We also conducted interviews with training personnel  and troops recently returned from Iraq and Afghanistan to obtain their  views on the type of urban operations training needed to realistically train  troops as they will fight. We determined that the data we analyzed were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this review.

Recent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted the  trend towards urban operations and the many challenges they present U.S.  forces. Military planners recognize this trend and acknowledge the  likelihood that enemies will continue to draw U.S. forces into cities to  degrade U.S. military advantages. According to DOD, in the future, U.S.  forces will likely conduct military operations in urban areas, which are  characterized by multiple structures, numerous noncombatants, and  complex infrastructure. These areas are also political, cultural, and  economic centers, as well as hubs for transportation, information, and  manufacturing. Thus, the urban environment constrains many of the  advantages that U.S. forces currently enjoy in open environments,  increasing the risks of high casualties to friendly forces and  noncombatants, and extensive collateral damage. \u201cThe wars and the conflicts of the 21st century will not be fought by individual services.   Rather, they will be fought by joint forces, and more often than not, by combined forces.   Therefore, we will have to think, train, and exercise jointly and combined, because let there  be no doubt that is the way that we will fight.\u201d", "As part of its Training Transformation Program, DOD is attempting to  provide more of a joint context to its training. DOD defines a joint exercise  as the interaction of joint forces and/or joint staffs conducted under a joint  headquarters according to joint doctrine that prepares forces/staffs to  respond to operational requirements. To develop a stronger program of  joint training, DOD designated the Joint Forces Command as the joint  trainer for DOD to support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well  as senior commanders worldwide in meeting joint training objectives. In  2002, DOD published its Doctrine for Joint Urban Operations and,  recognizing the need to place a stronger emphasis on urban operations  training, assigned the role of joint urban operations executive agent for  training to Joint Forces Command. While the Office of the Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness has overall responsibility for training  policies, Joint Forces Command, as DOD\u2019s executive agent, is the \u201cprimary  DOD point of contact and proponent for joint urban operations doctrine,  training, and equipment,\u201d and is to lead, coordinate, and integrate the  activities of the other DOD components on such matters. In this role, Joint  Forces Command has conducted experiments on concepts of operations  for joint urban operations and monitored lessons learned from ongoing  urban operations.", "The training of U.S. forces for urban operations is primarily the  responsibility of the services.

Then  they progress through collective training that sometimes includes other  services on a limited basis. Training ends with a culminating exercise at a  major training center, such as the Joint Readiness Training Center or  Twenty-Nine Palms, and is based on real-time scenarios that troops may  encounter in the urban environment.

As envisioned, the troops  that execute the operations would undergo training that places members of  different services together to learn to operate together and to overcome  differences in standard practices, terms, and organizational cultures that  can limit the effectiveness of operations.

The draft strategy notes that  many officers often spend more time in the course of their careers working  on command staffs than they do in command of troops. In order to  establish staff training, the strategy proposes building four new joint staff  training centers large enough to handle battalion or combatant-command- level staffs to replicate the sort of command and control arrangements and  joint staff processes they will encounter while serving as staff officers  under a joint force commander.

Although there is often some level of jointness incorporated  into Marine Corps and Army urban operations training events, these efforts  fall short of DOD\u2019s definition of a joint training event because they do not  include a joint headquarters and focus on service, rather than joint, training  objectives. Marine Corps officials said that the Marine Corps includes some  joint scenarios in its events and incorporates to some extent other service  participation in performing certain specialty roles, such as air-ground  coordination. The Army simulates some of the joint aspects of a battlefield  in its training as well, such as the joint command and control structures  troops are expected to encounter in theater, and it incorporates special  operations forces when possible. According to Joint Forces Command  officials, the Joint Operations Center at Joint Forces Command in Suffolk,  Virginia, and the Joint Multinational Training Center in Grafenwoehr,  Germany, are used to provide some officers with the type of joint staff  officer training called for in the draft strategy.

The two  services that perform the bulk of urban operations training, the Army and  Marine Corps, are proactively working to ensure that their troops are  trained in the individual skills needed for operations in urban terrain.  Soldiers and Marines are exposed to individual urban tasks in their basic  training and specialty schools. The Army and Marine Corps primarily  concentrate their urban operations training on enhancing the capabilities  of individual soldiers and small units\u2014primarily squads, platoons, and  companies. As noted in our June 2005 report, historically, service training  has focused on individual service competencies or mission-essential tasks,  with less emphasis on joint operations. While this has allowed the services  to meet their core training responsibilities, it has also contributed to the  problem of forces often entering combat without prior experience or  training in joint urban operations.", "Second, in the absence of a joint urban operations training strategy, there is  currently no specific requirement for the services to train jointly for urban  operations. While it is not urban-specific, the DOD Directive 1322.18, which  advocates joint training, states: \u201cTo the maximum extent possible, the DOD  components shall conduct joint training in accredited events at certified  facilities, and shall synchronize schedules to integrate training events.\u201d  However, the directive does not define what is meant by \u201cto the maximum  extent possible\u201d and therefore provides the services much leeway in how  much they participate in joint training. Absent a directive requiring the  services to train for joint urban operations tasks at a specified level and  specific joint urban operations training requirements, the services are  likely to continue to focus their training on service-specific skills and tasks  for which they are held accountable. As discussed earlier, Joint Forces  Command expects the joint urban operations training strategy it is  developing to include such requirements.", "Lastly, the services own the facilities used to conduct urban operations  training and are currently using them primarily for service-specific training  requirements. While the services agree that joint urban operations training  is needed, there is no formal mechanism in place to ensure that joint  training requirements are incorporated into the different services\u2019 training  schedules. Urban training that involves placing two or more battalions  together is usually reserved for the combat training centers and these  training centers are limited in throughput capacity. For example, the Joint  Readiness Training Center normally sponsors 10 training rotations per year  and is limited in its ability to expand the amount of rotations it can host per  year to increase joint usage. Even though Joint Forces Command is the  executive agent for joint urban operations, it does not have the authority to  direct the services or combatant commands to modify their training plans  to accommodate joint urban operations training. It is the Office of the  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness that has overall  authority over DOD training policies. Table 1 lists those facilities that can  currently support large joint urban operations training exercises and staff  officer training.", "In a June 2002 report, we recommended that DOD create a database that  identifies all ranges available to the department and what they offer,  regardless of service ownership, so that commanders can schedule the best  available resources to provide required training.

Our discussions held with troops and training personnel revealed  additional items that they believed could further enhance training to better  reflect current operating conditions such as the need for additional live-fire  capability, adding larger numbers of role players and providing more  cultural awareness training to adequately prepare troops for the required  interaction with a large civilian populace once in theater, and training with  newly fielded equipment.

These databases include numerous lessons  learned related to ongoing urban operations. For example, the Marine  Corps database contains lessons learned on urban operations including  basic Arabic language training, information on convoy operations tactics,  and search techniques. Additionally, Joint Forces Command also sends  subject matter experts into theater and its Joint Center for Operational  Analysis maintains a database of lessons learned and helps facilitate the  sharing of joint lessons among the services. Both the Army and Marine  Corps formally disseminated the information collected through  publications such as handbooks, newsletters, and official Web sites. For  example, the Army\u2019s Center for Lessons Learned issued a tactical convoy  operations handbook that was also used by the Marine Corps and the  Special Operations Command, according to Army Center for Lessons  Learned officials.

Further, in June 2004, the Army issued guidance stating that it intends to  provide all deploying brigade and battalion commanders and staff training  on urban stability and support operations through its Battle Command  Training Program.", "At training sites in Germany we visited, we found that Army trainers  incorporated real-time scenarios from ongoing operations in their  exercises to provide troops with training that realistically reflects the urban  environment. For example, they incorporated Iraqi elections into the  mission rehearsal exercise in July 2005 in anticipation of the conditions  they would face once deployed. Other examples of curriculum changes that  services had made to provide troops with more of the skills necessary to  effectively face urban challenges included:  developing mobile training teams that deploy to training sites to provide  instruction to Marines on the handling of detainees at detention  operations;  placing more emphasis on search procedures related to dwellings,  caves, and vehicles to locate insurgents or weapons;  delivering training on how to respond to improvised explosive device   training troops on how to conduct convoy operations.", "During our visits to training sites, we also observed that the facilities used  for urban operations training had been expanded and upgraded to more  closely reflect urban conditions troops can expect to face in current  operations. For example, we observed small towns that had been enhanced  to replicate urban terrain by including mosques, open markets, and flat- roofed dwellings. Figure 2 depicts Marines practicing raid procedures on  flat-top roofs to simulate the type of buildings they would encounter in  current urban operational environments.", "Both services have populated these urban training facilities with role  players that portray government officials, tribal leaders, religious leaders,  and officials from interagency organizations. For example, the Joint  Multinational Training Center has increased the total number of civilian  role players to up to 600 participants, though not all are used in each  training event. Our discussions with soldiers who had returned from  operations in Iraq, however, stated that exercises need to include a larger  number of role players to more realistically represent the urban  environment. We noted that the Joint Readiness Training Center replicates  the media and incorporates nongovernmental organizations and civilian  role players in its training. Figure 3 shows an Army exercise that  incorporates civilian role players to simulate local inhabitants in a Middle  Eastern environment.", "Furthermore, we observed that the Marine Corps and Army have included  newly built live-fire or simulated convoy courses in some of their urban  operations facilities. Those with live-fire courses are emphasizing the  importance of training troops on them at night and in adverse weather.  Figure 4 shows training on a live-fire convoy operations training course in  Germany. The services are also updating training to reflect changes to  enemy tactics such as the use of improvised explosive devices. We saw  incorporation of simulated improvised explosive devices at Fort Campbell,  Kentucky, and observed the newly developed training site for explosive  devices at the Joint Multinational Training Center in Germany.", "In addition to recent improvements, the services are currently planning  further enhancements to existing training facilities. For instance, the  Marine Corps is requesting funds to construct a large-scale urban training  facility at Twenty-Nine Palms, California. The new facility will have up to  1,500 buildings, including live-fire capability, and outlying components such  as an airfield, port, and villages. According to Marine officials, the facility  will be large enough to accommodate joint training exercises with the  Army. It is also expected to provide a venue from which to experiment,  develop, and exercise joint/interagency urban operations with the Joint  National Training Capability. The Marine Corps also plans to add a night  driving course to pre-deployment training. Additionally, the Marines plan to  add shoot houses at Camp Pendleton, Camp Lejeune, and Marine Corps  Base Quantico. Likewise, the Army is in the process of improving its  combat training centers by adding more buildings and instrumentation, and  its major installations by providing shoot houses, urban assault courses,  breach facilities, and combined arms collective training facilities. Army  officials at the Joint Multinational Training Center have initiated an effort  to enhance training through the development of an Expeditionary  Instrumentation System, which is a new mobile instrumentation capability  that provides feedback to the battalion at any training site that lacks  instrumentation.

Troops we spoke with indicated that the number  of role players included in exercises is not sufficient to adequately prepare  them for the density and level of persistent contact that is typical of  noncombatants in the urban environment. In addition, troops and training  personnel we interviewed wanted the role players to more actively engage  the troops during the exercises to better replicate operational conditions.", "The troops and trainers also indicated that more cultural awareness  training, which would include basic language training, would be helpful to  establish and maintain communication with local civilians so that they  could better interact with civilians and minimize civilian interference with  military operations. Currently, training exercises contain some level of  cultural awareness and civil affairs training by including role players that  interact with troops, and exercises that we observed emphasized the use of  translators when working with the local population. However, access to  translators in training is limited, and officials and troops agreed that  translators were not often available for everyday interaction with civilians  and so further training would be beneficial. Both the Marine Corps and  Army have taken steps to improve this training; the Marine Corps has  established an advanced cultural awareness center and according to an  Army official, the Army continually updates its cultural awareness training  to reflect conditions in current operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Equipment Available for Training Prior to Deployment", "paragraphs": ["Troops and training personnel identified a third area for further  enhancement: the ability to train with newly fielded equipment prior to  deployment.

These items had been developed to help alleviate the  difficulties of conducting urban operations by addressing the adversaries\u2019  tactics, such as improvised explosive devices, and the adversaries\u2019 ability  to conceal themselves in an urban environment. According to training  personnel and DOD officials, limited production quantities and the need for  the items in theater to respond to rapidly changing operational  environments makes it difficult for the training centers to initially have the  items. Some examples of newly fielded equipment that are in limited supply  but DOD believes will improve troops\u2019 ability to conduct urban operations  include the following.", "Up-armored High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV).  These vehicles are not available at some training facilities and only the  soft-top HMMWVs were on hand for training exercises, according to  officials at the Joint Multinational Training Center in Hohenfels and  Twenty-Nine Palms. Traveling in the up-armored HMMWVs provides  greater protection from improvised explosive devices while maintaining  transport mobility for forces, civil affairs teams, and engineers operating  in urban areas. However, Army and Marine Corps officials and troops  that we interviewed stated that the up-armored HMMWVs used in  theater were top-heavy, difficult to maneuver, and required different  tactical procedures from the soft-top HMMWVs when used in combat.", "The Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight. This gunsight is another piece  of equipment used in conducting urban operations that has been quickly  fielded into theater, but limited quantities prevented its use in training  prior to deployment.

The inherent complexities of operating in urban  environments, DOD\u2019s expectation that urban environments will play a  significant role in future military operations, and that most of these  operations will be conducted jointly, coupled with the combatant  commanders\u2019 interest in ensuring U.S. forces are sufficiently prepared, are  significant incentives for Joint Forces Command and services to develop  and implement an overall joint training strategy and related requirements.  In addition, the fact that U.S. forces are currently involved in urban  operations adds a tangible sense of urgency for joint training.  Notwithstanding these incentives, current training exercises offer few  opportunities for U.S. forces to train jointly for urban operations. An  overall strategy requiring joint urban operations training and clearly  defined facility and training requirements, and a mechanism for scheduling  joint training at training facilities, would provide a framework to assign  accountability, synchronize the services\u2019 training efforts to ensure they  include joint training, and maximize the joint usage of training facilities. In  the absence of this framework, DOD risks that the services will continue to  pursue their respective service-specific training and facility plans. Until  DOD develops an overall strategy for joint urban operations training and  related requirements, neither the Secretary of Defense nor the Congress  will have a sound basis for evaluating service training and facility plans,  and related funding requests. To its credit, DOD and the services have  actively sought to incorporate lessons learned during ongoing operations  and made several adjustments to make the training environment more  reflective of operational conditions. To further enhance training, the troops  and training personnel we interviewed identified several additional  adjustments that they believed would further enhance urban operations  training.

Once established, we envision this framework would be used to guide  the review and approval of service training and facility plans, and to  guide efforts to make additional improvements to existing urban  operations training curriculum, including evaluating any suggestions  from training and troop personnel.", "To increase opportunities for joint training and maximize the joint usage of  training facilities, we are recommending that the Secretary of Defense   direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to  establish a mechanism for scheduling joint urban operations training at  major training centers to facilitate increased multiservice participation  in urban operations training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with our first  recommendation and did not concur with the second. DOD concurred with  our first recommendation that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Commander, Joint Forces Command, to finalize development of the joint  urban operations training strategy and related requirements including joint  training tasks and standards, levels, and types of joint training exercises to  be conducted. DOD stated that current efforts, when completed, will  adequately address this recommendation without further direction from  the Secretary of Defense. DOD also noted its view that we seemed to blur  the distinction between what it characterized as two separate actions\u2014 Joint Forces Command\u2019s efforts to develop a joint training strategy for  urban operations and DOD\u2019s efforts to develop criteria for evaluating  service plans to construct training facilities. We note that efforts to develop  the joint strategy have been underway for some time and continue to  believe that the lack of consensus within DOD regarding the draft strategy  may delay the completion of this effort without further emphasis and  monitoring from the Secretary of Defense. Furthermore, we believe that  the strategy and evaluation criteria should not be viewed as separate  actions, but rather must be clearly linked. As discussed in our report, until  Joint Forces Command develops an overall strategy for joint urban  operations training and related requirements, neither the Secretary of  Defense nor the Congress will have a sound basis for evaluating service  facility and training plans, and related funding requests.", "DOD did not concur with our second recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness to establish a mechanism for scheduling joint urban operations  training at major training centers to facilitate increased multiservice  participation in urban operations training. In its response, DOD stated that  it remains strongly committed to a decentralized training ranges and  facilities management solution in supporting the services\u2019 Title 10  responsibilities. DOD also noted the Office of the Secretary of Defense is  providing planning support, oversight, and policy guidance to ensure all its  training resources support service, cross-service, and joint needs and goals.  DOD further stated that it is committed to maximizing system integration,  sharing of data, and facilitation of the services' scheduling processes to  better leverage all assets for the full benefit of military readiness. However,  we note that, to date, DOD has not given sufficient leadership attention to  ensuring necessary coordinated action among the services to accomplish  these goals. We believe the lack of progress is more an issue of leadership  to ensure coordinated action among the key stakeholders than an issue of  usurping the services\u2019 Title 10 responsibilities. Our report shows that the  lack of a formal mechanism for scheduling joint urban operations training  at major training centers is one of the key factors accounting for the limited  number of joint urban operations training opportunities. Our  recommendation is intended to facilitate increased multiservice  participation in urban operations training events. Without focused  leadership efforts on the part of DOD to ensure coordinated action among  the services to establish a mechanism to schedule joint training, we believe  that DOD will perpetuate the current situation in which few exercises are  joint according to its definition.
