To facilitate the safety and efficiency of this system, the Coast Guard maintains aids-to-navigation (ATON), such as buoys and beacons, and conducts domestic icebreaking in the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence Seaway, and northeast coast. To conduct these missions, the Coast Guard has a fleet of more than 200 vessels, ranging from 225-foot seagoing buoy tenders and 140-foot domestic icebreakers to 21-foot boats. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, many of these assets took on additional responsibilities for security patrols and other homeland security duties. Although some assets have been recently acquired, many others are reaching or have exceeded their design service lives, raising concerns about how well and for how much longer these older assets may be able to carry out their missions. In response, GAO examined (1) recent trends in the amount of time these assets have spent performing missions; (2) asset condition and its effect on mission performance; and (3) the actions taken by the Coast Guard to continue to achieve the missions of these assets. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed Coast Guard documents, interviewed Coast Guard officials, and made site visits to various locations around the country.

Domestic icebreakers are now used more for homeland security than for icebreaking, reflecting their availability at times of the year when no icebreaking is needed. While not designed for homeland security, the assets can perform such duties acceptably, according to the Coast Guard. Most ATON vessels are used primarily for ATON activities. Newer ATON assets receive the greatest use on other missions, reflecting their greater multi-mission capabilities. Trends are mixed with regard to asset condition and mission performance. Available evidence, such as the amount of maintenance conducted, suggests condition is declining for some assets, though not precipitously. Coast Guard officials said some assets, while being operated for more hours, are still largely being operated within planned limits. Against this backdrop, indicators for measuring performance show mixed results: some have declined, while others have not. The current measure for asset condition is not clearly linked to mission performance, but the Coast Guard is working on developing a measure that links the two. Actions the Coast Guard has taken to continue to achieve the missions of these assets include revising maintenance approaches and developing a new analytical tool for deciding which projects provide the most capability for the dollars invested. The Coast Guard continues to acquire some new vessels to replace aging ones, but proposals to rehabilitate or replace other aging vessels have not been implemented, largely because of other funding priorities. The Coast Guard also studied the feasibility of contracting out some activities. While some possibilities for outsourcing were identified in the study, the Coast Guard has identified potential disadvantages to outsourcing these activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The marine transportation system, which allows for the transportation of  The marine transportation system, which allows for the transportation of  people and goods on the water, is a vast and critical part of the nation\u2019s  people and goods on the water, is a vast and critical part of the nation\u2019s  infrastructure.

PWCS activities grew quickly from 15 percent of  total resource hours in fiscal year 2001 to 53 percent in fiscal year 2002,  and they have remained at 44 percent or more of total hours through fiscal  year 2005. At the same time, icebreaking hours began at 41 percent in  fiscal year 2001 and then dropped down to 13 percent in 2002, but ended at  26 percent in fiscal year 2005. The vast majority of this increase in PWCS  has occurred in the New York City area with smaller increases in other  East Coast ports. As figure 2 shows, the increase came about largely by  adding to the total number of hours these assets were operated. The total  number of resource hours for these assets grew from about 12,000 hours  in fiscal year 2002 to a high of about 20,000 the following year.", "The increase in PWCS hours for domestic icebreakers mainly reflects their  availability during those months when no icebreaking needs to be done.  Icebreaking needs are typically greatest from December 15 to April 15.  Coast Guard officials said that because icebreakers do not have a primary  summertime mission, using them to conduct PWCS missions during slack  periods has not limited the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to conduct routine  icebreaking missions. Icebreaking hours, however, did see some marked  shifts during this period\u2014most notably a decrease in fiscal year 2002  followed by a substantial increase in fiscal year 2003. The decrease in 2002  appears related to two main factors: a mild winter, during which the Great  Lakes region was virtually free of ice throughout December and most of  January, and a change in the way the Coast Guard accounted for its use of  icebreakers. The Coast Guard does not record resource hours under two  mission categories simultaneously, and prior to the attacks on September  11, 2001, resource hours used to break ice while escorting a vessel with  hazardous cargo would only have been recorded as ice operations. After  the attacks, these same hours could be logged either as PWCS or  icebreaking at the discretion of the vessel\u2019s commanding officer. The  increase in ice operations hours for fiscal year 2003 reflected an unusually  severe winter in the Great Lakes.", "Increased workloads have placed some icebreakers above the maximum  number of recommended operating hours for the assets. The maximum  recommended operating level, called an \u201cunderway hours limit,\u201d reflects  maximum use established from planning documents, missions, and  maintenance requirements, and historic use. In particular, the 65-foot  small harbor tug fleet exceeded their underway hours limit from fiscal  years 2001 to 2003 by increasingly more hours, starting with being   10 hours over the underway limit in 2001 and progressing to nearly   2,000 hours over the underway limit in 2003. In contrast, the 140-foot  icebreaking tugs were operated within their underway hours limit from  2001 to 2005.", "Coast Guard officials said domestic icebreakers, while not their vessel of  choice for maritime security missions, can perform all PWCS missions  adequately except for shore side patrols. The Coast Guard\u2019s 87-foot  coastal patrol boats are the preferred assets for PWCS missions.  Commissioned since 1998, these boats can travel at up to 25 knots and  have a system that allows the crew to launch and recover small boats.  Relative to these vessels, domestic icebreakers show both advantages and  disadvantages (see table 4). Icebreakers are more capable of operating in  cold weather, and their substantial size provides a significant presence on  the waterways, but they are slower, less able to launch small boats, and  pose increased training challenges for training crews in law enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increase in Homeland Security Missions Is Less Extensive for ATON Assets", "paragraphs": ["ATON assets also experienced an increase in use for homeland security  missions after September 11, 2001, but to a much lesser degree than for  domestic icebreakers.

Time spent in  PWCS activities increased from 4 percent of total resource hours in fiscal  year 2001 to 10 percent in fiscal year 2002; since then, PWCS mission  hours have steadily decreased (see fig. 3).

Overall, ATON  activities account for about 79 percent of total resource hours for the  cutters, compared with about 90 percent for ATON boats (vessels less   65 feet in length). ATON boats were the only vessels that did not have as  much of an increase in PWCS resource hours immediately after the attacks  on September 11, 2001, though their use in PWCS activities did rise in  fiscal year 2003. Among the ATON cutters, the newer cutters have greater  multiple mission capabilities and consequently tend to be used more often  in other missions.

Fiscal year 2004 was the worst of the 5 years, with only two of the  eight types of cutters meeting the standard.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s condition measure for these assets, while instructive,  needs to be viewed with some caution. As we have reported in our  analysis of the condition of the Coast Guard\u2019s legacy deepwater assets, the  measure captures only major equipment casualties, which degrade mission  capabilities but does not capture minor equipment casualties that may also  degrade mission capabilities. As such, this measure may underestimate  the decline in asset condition. The Coast Guard has acknowledged the  limitations of this measure and is working on a replacement for it, which  will better determine specific mission impacts.", "The POTF condition measure applies to cutters; the Coast Guard only  recently started tracking POTF data for assessing condition trends on  ATON small boats. During the fiscal year 2000 through 2004 period we  reviewed, the Coast Guard did not have a centralized system for tracking  the condition of these boats. Its internal assessment of the condition of the  boats was based on two approaches, as follows:    For standard boats, which are purchased by Coast Guard headquarters  and have similar capabilities and equipment for all boats of a particular  type, the Coast Guard assessed condition by determining the boats\u2019  remaining service lives through a process referred to as ship structure  and machinery evaluation boards (SSMEB). The SSMEB, which is  conducted 10 years after a boat is commissioned and is repeated at   5-year intervals, applied to two of the six types of ATON boats we  reviewed.", "For nonstandard boats, which are purchased by individual Coast Guard  units for individual needs, the Coast Guard\u2019s assessment was based on  anecdotal information from district boat managers, maintenance  managers, annual boat inspection reports, and site visits. This approach  was used on four of the six types of boats we reviewed.", "Using these approaches, the Coast Guard characterized most of these  asset types as in fair to poor condition. By contrast, however, when the  Coast Guard assembled POTF data for a portion of these boats in fiscal  year 2005, the data did not support this assessment. The boats analyzed  had average scores above the Coast Guard\u2019s goal of 72 percent.

These projects, such as replacing a generator, help sustain capability  but do not enhance it, according to Coast Guard officials.", "While there are some asset-by-asset variations, total maintenance costs for  domestic icebreakers and ATON cutters increased during the period we  examined (fiscal years 2001 through 2005). As figure 4 shows, total  annual maintenance costs for domestic icebreakers nearly doubled, from  slightly more than $3 million to slightly more than $6 million. The increase  came primarily in two of the three categories in most years\u2014scheduled  maintenance costs and ELC costs. Although maintenance costs are also  affected by the amount of funding available in any given year, according to  Coast Guard officials, maintenance managers have discretion to move  some funds to those assets most in need of maintenance money. Coast  Guard officials have also said that these costs are indicative of condition  issues. For example, an ELC official said that the increase in ELC costs  was related to condition because the money was used for the overhaul of  domestic icebreakers. In addition to the amount of funding available in  any given year, these maintenance costs can also be impacted by a variety  of other factors such as the pace of operations. For example, maintenance  costs can be expected to increase as the pace of operations increases.", "Total annual cost increases for ATON cutters showed a similar trend, more  than doubling from over $13 million to over $32 million during the 5-year  period (see fig. 5). For ATON cutters, cost increases were greatest in ELC  maintenance and unscheduled maintenance. As with icebreakers, Coast  Guard officials considered these expenditures to be related to asset  condition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evidence Gathered from Interviews, Site Visits, and Other Records also Indicate Condition Issues", "paragraphs": ["Evidence we gathered during our discussions with maintenance personnel,  our visits to various Coast Guard installations, and our review of other  Coast Guard records also pointed to declining condition of a number of  these assets. However, according a program manager who previously  served as a commanding officer on an icebreaker, for some of the older  assets, the decline in condition of those assets has not been beyond what  would be expected of assets 20 years or more in age. During our  interviews and site visits, Coast Guard personnel reported to us that crew  members have had to spend increasingly more time and resources to  troubleshoot and resolve maintenance issues on older domestic  icebreaking and ATON assets. They indicated that because the systems  and parts are outdated compared with the technology and equipment  available today, it can be challenging and time consuming to diagnose a  maintenance issue and find parts or determine what corrective action to  take. For example, the propulsion control system on the 140-foot  icebreaking tugs uses circuit cards that were state-of-the-art when the tugs  were commissioned in the late 1970s to 1980s but are no longer  manufactured today and have been superseded by computer control  systems (see fig. 6). Coast Guard personnel said the lack of a readily  available supply of these parts has forced maintenance personnel to order  custom made parts or refurbish the faulty ones, increasing the time and  money it takes to address maintenance problems. Finding knowledgeable  individuals to identify problems with outdated equipment is difficult, they  said, which further complicates maintenance. Crews of other assets we  visited also confirmed the difficulty of diagnosing problems and obtaining  replacement parts for other critical subsystems such as the main diesel  engines.", "Since at least 2002, the Coast Guard has been on record as saying these  assets are in decline. In a mission needs analysis issued that year, the  Coast Guard concluded that its domestic icebreaking and ATON assets  were affected in varying degrees with respect to safety, supportability,  environmental compliance, and habitability, and that addressing these  issues would require replacing or rehabilitating the assets. The analysis  noted that the need to replace or rehabilitate inland buoy tenders and   45-foot buoy boats had been identified as early as 1993 but had not yet  been addressed. It also noted that the 21-foot trailerable aids-to- navigation boats and the 55-foot aids-to-navigation boats\u2014most of which  have yet to be replaced\u2014had been extended beyond their projected  service lives.", "When we asked Coast Guard officials if current usage patterns were  precipitating the decline of these assets, they said that overages can have  an impact on some assets, especially those with more complex systems  and subsystems. The officials said that exceeding planned usage limits  may leave less time to maintain these systems. They said that the  deterioration of an asset and its systems from usage consistently above the  limits would be reflected in periodic engineering assessments, known as  SSMEBs, of the assets. In our site visits, we did learn of one example in  which increased use of assets for security-related purposes may be  affecting condition. The example involves the 140-foot icebreakers, which  currently are being used extensively for security-related activities when  they are not engaged in icebreaking activity. According to Coast Guard  personnel, these icebreakers were designed to operate at maximum power  for icebreaking; however, maritime security missions typically require  several hours of idling, which is detrimental to the engine. Extended  periods of idling, they said, causes oil discharge and sludge build up in the  engine and mufflers. Thus, running assets in ways for which they were not  designed could result in faster degradation of their condition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Indicators for Icebreaking and ATON Missions Show Mixed Results", "paragraphs": ["Against this backdrop of condition indicators, the Coast Guard\u2019s measures  of performance for domestic icebreaking and ATON missions show mixed  results, with several indicators showing that mission performance has  been improving or largely unchanging, while at least one other indicator  indicates a decline.", "For domestic icebreaking, the Coast Guard\u2019s performance indicator is  the number of days that ice leads to closures of waterways in the Great  Lakes region\u2014the region in which most domestic icebreaking activity  occurs. The Coast Guard\u2019s performance goal is to have 2 or fewer  closure days during average winters. During fiscal years 2001 through  2005 the Coast Guard met this goal every year but 1. The exception was  fiscal year 2004, when waterways were closed for 4 days. According to  Coast Guard officials, however, vessel condition was not a factor in  waterway closures; instead, they were related to an icebreaker\u2019s being  diverted to free a stuck vessel and to a response to a commercial  aircraft crash.", "For ATON, the Coast Guard\u2019s primary performance indicator is the  number of collisions, allisions, and groundings. Since these events  can cause deaths and injuries, environmental and property damage,  and lead to waterway closures that limit commercial and recreational  activity, a decline in this measure is an improvement. During fiscal  years 2001 through 2005, this measure declined\u2014a positive  development (see fig. 7).", "While the Coast Guard\u2019s primary ATON performance indicator was  showing improvement, however, an important secondary measure was  showing an adverse effect. This indicator, which measures the  probability that an aid to navigation or a system of aids-to-navigation is  performing its specified function at any randomly chosen time and is  expressed as a percentage of total time, is the leading performance  measure used in managing the ATON program, according to Coast  Guard officials. This measure has steadily declined since fiscal year  2002 (see table 6), and since a smaller percentage means fewer aids are  available, a decline in this measure is an adverse development. Coast  Guard officials said some of this decline was attributable to the  condition of ATON cutters and boats for servicing the navigational  aids, but they were not able to estimate how much of the decline could  be attributed to this cause.", "In other work, we have noted that the Coast Guard\u2019s performance  indicators can be affected by multiple factors and that there are challenges  to using such measures in linking resources to results. The ability to meet  icebreaking goals, for example, can be affected by the severity of the  winter. In fact, when the Coast Guard met its goal for waterway closures  in fiscal year 2005, Coast Guard officials attributed the result in part to less  severe average ice conditions than in previous years. Similarly, the ability  to keep navigational aids in working order can be adversely affected by  such uncontrollable factors as the severity of a hurricane or winter storm  season.", "The Coast Guard has launched a number of initiatives designed to address  challenges in linking resources to results of these missions. These  initiatives followed program assessments conducted by the Office of  Management and Budget, which completed an assessment of the ATON  program in 2002 and the domestic icebreaking program in 2004.

The new buoy tenders have improved capabilities  such as the following:    A computerized positioning system that automates the task of holding  the vessel in place while working on a navigational aid. Previously, this  task had to be done manually, requiring the crew to constantly monitor  and maintain the vessel\u2019s position, sometimes for up to 10 hours at a  time.

Their size, stability, and maneuverability are useful for  such missions as search and rescue, homeland security, and law  enforcement, and they have specific capabilities for dealing with other  duties as skimming oil or mounting machine guns for security patrols.", "With their sizeable fuel tanks and storage capacity, they can also serve as  logistics support platforms to restock vessels involved in drug interdiction  and other activities. For 7 weeks in 2005, for example, one tender served  as a supply platform for a Coast Guard vessel conducting drug interdiction  patrols. According to Coast Guard officials, this enabled the patrol vessel  to remain on patrol in the area for a longer period of time than it would  have otherwise with its limited fuel and storage capacities.", "Besides the buoy tenders, the Coast Guard commissioned a new 240-foot  multimission icebreaker in 2006 to replace a 62-year-old icebreaker and an  aging buoy tender on the Great Lakes.

This  information is used to identify the asset types that are most in need of  replacement or major maintenance, and therefore should be given greater  consideration in maintenance planning and budgeting.", "In 2002, the Coast Guard proposed options for systematically rehabilitating  or replacing 164 cutters and boats in these fleets. According to Coast  Guard officials, these options were proposed after determining that the  age, condition, and cost of operating these assets would diminish the  capability of the Coast Guard to carry out ATON and domestic icebreaking  missions over time without rehabilitation or replacement of some or all of  the assets. In 2004, it completed a preliminary analysis of four approaches,  including the status quo\u2014that is, maintaining the existing fleet.

The  officials said that the funding demands from other major Coast Guard  programs already underway (such as the Deepwater program for replacing  or rehabilitating aircraft and cutters with greater at-sea capability) that  likely had higher priority in the competition for limited resources  combined with the large scope and size of the proposed project, may have  prevented the project from being funded.", "Without specific funding to move the project forward, the Coast Guard has  attempted to break the project into smaller components and pursue  potential funding from within the Coast Guard\u2019s budget, focusing on the  assets most in need of maintenance or replacement. In February 2006, the  Coast Guard began a project to replace its fleet of 80 trailerable aids-to-  navigation boats with new boats that have enhanced capabilities to do  ATON work as well as other missions. The enhanced capabilities include  equipment to lift navigational aids out of the water for service, more deck  space for working on these aids, an elevated work platform for working on  aids that are high in the water, and faster speeds to reduce transit times.  The Coast Guard intends for the new boats to be more multimission  capable. For example, their added speed and deck space will help with  search and rescue missions, and they will have gun mounts for use in law  enforcement or maritime security missions.", "According to a Coast Guard official, this acquisition would cost  approximately $14.4 million if all 80 boats are purchased and would bring  on new boats over a 5-year period as funds allow. The Coast Guard  official responsible for the project said the Coast Guard intends to make  the purchases using a funding stream appropriated for the maintenance of  nonstandard boats that can be allocated to the boats with the most  pressing maintenance or recapitalization needs. Availability of these funds,  however, depends on the condition and maintenance needs of other  nonstandard boats; if this funding has to be applied to meet other needs,  such as unanticipated problems, it may not be available for purchasing  these boats.", "Separate from this effort to acquire new trailerable boats, the Coast Guard  has made a request as part of the budget process to begin rehabilitating  aging river buoy and construction tenders. This project, which will focus  on rehabilitating the systems within the engine rooms of the assets, is  estimated to cost approximately $75 million.

Potential disadvantages they mentioned include the following:    Outsourcing could lead loss of \u201csurge\u201d capability\u2014that is, the capacity  to respond to emergencies or unusual situations. In part, this capability  may be needed within the ATON or icebreaking mission itself, such as  when a hurricane or ice destroys or damages a large number of  navigation aids. In the case of Hurricane Katrina, Coast Guard officials  stated that because the Coast Guard had ATON assets such as  construction tenders, crews were able to begin working immediately to  repair damaged aids and get the waterways open to maritime traffic  again. This \u201csurge\u201d capability may also be needed for other missions,  such as occurs when ATON assets can be used to support search and  rescue efforts. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, for example,  some ATON assets provided logistical support for first responders or  transported stranded individuals.", "Outsourcing may disrupt the Coast Guard\u2019s personnel structure and  weaken the agency\u2019s ability to attract and retain personnel.

The available evidence also indicates that despite some decline  in the condition of some asset types, the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to meet its  aids-to-navigation and domestic icebreaking missions, as indicated by  mixed outcomes of its key mission performance measures, has not shown  clear trends of decline. Efforts by Coast Guard personnel to troubleshoot  operational problems and to take other steps to keep assets operating  appear to be one reason mission performance has not been further  affected, and many other factors, such as the harshness of a winter or the  severity of storm damage on navigation buoys and beacons, can also affect  performance results. For the present, however, the impact of these  additional mission responsibilities does not appear to be a cause for alarm.", "That said, the future of these assets bears close watching. The fact that  many of the assets have or will be approaching the end of their design  service lives could mean the need for rehabilitated or new assets may  become more pressing in the future. Another issue is whether current  operations, both in level and types of usage, are adding to these costs and  incidents beyond what the Coast Guard would normally expect. For  example, operating domestic icebreakers beyond their underway hours  limit\u2014could potentially accelerate the level of decline. If this is the case,  using these assets to meet security missions could be meeting the Coast  Guard\u2019s immediate needs but accelerating the need for replacement or  rehabilitation. According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard\u2019s  attempt to systematically rehabilitate or replace its ATON and domestic  icebreaking fleet was proposed at a time when competing demands likely  caused postponements of requests for the needed funds. These competing  demands, reflected largely in the Coast Guard\u2019s expensive and lengthy  Deepwater asset replacement program, will continue for some time, as will  other pressures on the federal budget. The Coast Guard is moving to  improve the process it uses to set budget priorities through actions such as  its new tool to link asset condition and funding decisions to better identify  the projects that will provide the most capability with the limited funds  that are available. Given that many of these actions are recent and need a  chance to work, it is too early to evaluate their effectiveness. However,  even as the Coast Guard takes steps to determine how best to replace or  rehabilitate its assets, limited budgetary resources combined with other  competing asset replacement programs already in process will likely  continue to challenge the Coast Guard to find sufficient resources to carry  out the options identified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Department of  Homeland Security and the Coast Guard.
