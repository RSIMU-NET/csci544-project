Experts who participated in a meeting held by GAO indicated that the Administrator's approach was reasonable but could be improved.", "According to these experts, a hazard-based approach focuses on identifying whether particular \u201chazards\u201d\u2014sources of potential harm\u2014are associated with certain health conditions, and does not attempt to quantify the risks of developing those health conditions. The Administrator's approach used four methods to determine whether there was an association between a September 11 exposure and a specific cancer, and thus, whether to add that cancer to the list.", "The experts considered the approach reasonable given the WTCHP certification process for enrollees to obtain coverage for treatment for a condition on the list, the lack of data related to exposure levels and risks, and the use of similar approaches by previous federal compensation programs.", "The experts indicated the approach could have been communicated more clearly. For example, the description of the approach in rulemaking did not clearly articulate how decisions would be made when evidence under one method supported adding a cancer type to the list, and evidence under a different method did not. The Administrator noted that this omission was an oversight. Since the Administrator plans to use the same approach in future cancer-related decision making, the absence of a clear description can lead to questions about the credibility and equity of the program.", "According to the experts, an independent peer review process similar to that used in other federal compensation programs could improve the approach. According to the Administrator, this was not feasible due to time constraints imposed by law. A process through which an independent party assesses the validity of the information upon which decisions are being made and that rationales for decisions are clearly described could help ensure the credibility of the Administrator's approach.", "WTCHP spending (claims paid) directly attributable to the addition of cancers to the list of covered conditions accounted for 6.5 percent of its total spending on services from October 2012 (when cancers were added) through March 2014. The addition of cancers to the list led to the need for a third-party administrator to help the program provide uninterrupted cancer-related services to enrollees who had been receiving care outside of the program. WTCHP and other officials reported that the addition of cancers has helped ensure enrollees have access to high-quality cancer care, which may contribute to better health outcomes, but required increased WTCHP staff to accommodate the program's growing scope.", "The effects on the Department of Justice's September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) of adding cancers to the list of covered conditions are not yet known because there have been a small number of compensation decisions.

Experts highlighted the fact that an applicant  must obtain certification to receive coverage for treatment, and as part  of this process provide information comparable to that used in a risk- based approach, adding some of the benefit of that type of  approach. The Administrator explained that the information reviewed  during the certification process includes assessing WTCHP enrollees\u2019  time period of exposure, duration of exposure, temporal sequence of  symptoms, and activities that caused the exposure. In addition,  qualitative exposure assessments are performed to determine  whether enrollees have met the requirements needed for certification  that their condition be covered.", "Data Constraints. Experts told us that developing a risk-based  approach would have been less feasible than developing a hazard- based approach. Specifically, a risk-based approach would have  required data on levels of exposures to specific hazards among  individuals, but such data (for example, epidemiologic studies  regarding cancer risk in the exposed population) was lacking. This  point was confirmed by the Administrator who told us that using a risk- based approach would have been challenging due to the lack of data  on individual exposures following the attacks, especially in the  immediate aftermath of the attacks when exposures were at their  highest. According to experts, the multiple-method approach was  reasonable because of limitations in available data due to the length  of cancer latency and the relatively short period of time that had  elapsed between the attacks and the Administrator\u2019s review.", "Use of Similar Approaches. Other federal compensation programs,  such as those for Gulf War Veterans, used a similar hazard-based or  multiple-method approach to assess the available, often limited, data  about relationships between exposures and health outcomes,  according to the experts. For example, under the Persian Gulf War  Veterans Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs was required to use  the National Academy of Sciences to determine whether certain  health conditions had a relationship with specific war-related  exposures; the Academy performed this task through committees  convened by its IOM. The IOM committees used a similar hazard- based approach as the Administrator, and did not consider the  magnitude of the risk as would have been done with a risk-based  approach.

Specifically, the  Administrator did not clearly communicate the approach when there was  negative evidence (information that supported not adding a cancer) under  one method and positive evidence (information that supported adding a  cancer) under a different method. The approach described in the  flowchart and text in 2012 rulemaking (see fig. 1) suggested that if there  was positive evidence under a given method (for example, Method 3), the  Administrator would add the cancer to the list and cease assessing  evidence; he would not consider negative evidence found under methods  higher in the hierarchy (Methods 1 or 2), or any evidence under methods  lower in the hierarchy (Method 4) in making his decision of whether to add  that cancer to the list.

He agreed that the  process for decision making when there was negative evidence under a  method higher in the hierarchy and positive evidence under a method  lower in the hierarchy was not expressed in the flowchart or text included  in 2012 proposed and final rulemaking. He acknowledged that it was an  oversight not to have included this information. Further, according to the  Administrator, decisions to add a condition to the list could be  reconsidered with new evidence; however, the approach outlined in  2012 rulemaking did not clearly communicate how he would assess such  new evidence, for example from future studies, against existing evidence.", "Information about decision making should be adequately communicated  to external stakeholders, such as Congress and the public, according to  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. Additionally, clear communication is particularly important as the Administrator plans to  use the same approach to make future determinations on potential  additions of cancer to the list. In the absence of a clearly communicated  description, the approach may not be consistently applied during such  future decision making, which could raise questions not only about the  approach\u2019s credibility, but also equity for program enrollees.", "In addition to improvements regarding communication, the Administrator\u2019s  approach could be improved by the use of an independent peer review  process, according to experts who participated in the meeting we  convened. This peer review process would include, for example, an  evaluation of scientific and technical evidence by independent experts to  assess the validity and credibility of the information upon which decisions  are being made. Experts participating in our meeting noted that  independent peer review has been used to review conclusions made by  IOM committees assessing scientific evidence related to exposures and  health outcomes for other federal compensation programs. In these  instances, peer reviewers independent of the IOM committee provided  feedback on matters such as whether the specific evidence assessed by  the committee was appropriate, what additional evidence should be  assessed, and if aspects of the committee\u2019s report could be more clearly  described. committees, independent peer review helps ensure that a committee\u2019s  assessment of scientific evidence is accurate and as effective in relaying  its conclusions as possible. This assurance enhances the credibility of the  final product by ensuring that the conclusions are scientifically based and  appropriately portrayed, according to IOM officials.", "According to IOM officials, independent peer reviewers are selected based on their  familiarity with the subject(s) addressed by the committee and conduct their evaluation of  the report independent of the committee; however, the reviewers themselves may be  stakeholders or those with known opinions on the subject.", "While the Administrator agreed that independent peer review was  important, he told us that, due to time constraints, he did not use it in his  approach for the 2012 decisions. Specifically, he told us that although  he supported the use of independent peer review in all NIOSH programs,  he did not consider implementing such a process feasible given the time  limitations in place under the Zadroga Act for responding to petitions and  receiving a recommendation from the STAC. According to the act, when a  recommendation from the STAC is requested for a review based on a  petition, up to 300 days may elapse from the time the Administrator  receives the petition to when he publishes a response in the Federal  Register. The Administrator told us that the time limits imposed by the  Zadroga Act for the review of petitions and responses to STAC  recommendations, in addition to the time needed for administrative  processes, are very restrictive and provide little time for scientific analysis  and decision-making processes. However, without an independent peer  review process through which an independent party has determined that  the evidence assessed was appropriate and that the rationales for  decisions made were clearly described, there may be questions around  the transparency of the process and whether the decisions made were  appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Addition of Cancers to the List of Covered Conditions Accounted for a Small Portion of Spending and Led to the Need for a Third- Party Administrator", "paragraphs": ["WTCHP spending on services (claims paid) directly attributable to the  addition of cancers to the list of covered conditions accounted for   6.5 percent of total spending on services from October 2012 (the month  when cancers were added) through March 2014.
