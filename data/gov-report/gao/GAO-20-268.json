We found that NSF\u2019s procedures met many best practices for cost  estimating but not those for developing project schedules. We  recommended that NSF revise its policies for estimating and reviewing  the costs and schedules of major facilities projects to better incorporate  best practices in GAO\u2019s cost and schedule guides. In March 2019, we  reported on several aspects of NSF\u2019s management of major facilities  projects and made further recommendations. For example, we found that  NSF took some steps to assess project management expertise among its  staff, but did not take certain additional steps. We recommended that  NSF assess the agency\u2019s major facilities oversight workforce to identify  any project management competency gaps, develop a plan to address  any gaps and time frames for doing so, and monitor progress in closing  them. NSF concurred with the recommendations in both the 2018 and  2019 reports.", "In its fiscal year 2020 budget request, NSF proposed funding mid-scale  research infrastructure projects\u2014projects costing between $20 million  and $70 million\u2014through the MREFC account. NSF has reported a  significant community demand for mid-scale projects and has identified  mid-scale research infrastructure as one of NSF\u2019s 10 Big Ideas for its  future investments, as the scientific community is increasingly relying on  such infrastructure and facilities projects to provide innovative  approaches for solving the community\u2019s most pressing problems.  However, NSF did not previously have a formal mechanism to fund and  centrally manage a program for these projects outside of its research  directorates, which support research and education in a wide range of  science and engineering disciplines. The American Innovation and  Competitiveness Act of 2017 required NSF to develop a strategy to  support mid-scale research infrastructure projects. In response, the  National Science Board (NSB) issued a report confirming the need for a  program to fund mid-scale projects and recommended that NSF consider  funding mid-scale projects through its MREFC account as one option.", "Senate Report 114-239 and House Report 114-605, issued in 2016,  included provisions for us to review projects within NSF\u2019s MREFC  account, which now includes mid-scale projects as well as major facilities  projects.

We reviewed, for example,  cooperative agreements, progress reports, risk reports and risk registers,  documentation on available scope reduction options, and other NSF,  award recipient, and external panel project documents, as applicable,  related to project cost, schedule, scope, and risks. We assessed the  reliability of project data by obtaining supporting documentation when  possible, conducting routine checks for consistency with other information  contained in the documentation provided by NSF, and clarifying any  discrepancies with NSF project officials. Through this process, we  determined that the project data were sufficiently reliable for our purpose  of describing information available on the projects\u2019 cost and schedule  performance and current status.", "To assess the extent to which NSF has implemented prior GAO  recommendations related to its oversight of major facilities, we reviewed  NSF documentation and NSF\u2019s written responses related to actions the  agency took to implement these recommendations. We took additional  steps to assess NSF\u2019s implementation of certain recommendations.  Specifically, for our recommendation on revising policies for estimating  the costs of major facilities to incorporate the best practices in GAO\u2019s cost  guide, GAO staff with cost estimating expertise compared the updated  procedures documented in NSF\u2019s policies with the best practices.  Similarly, for our prior recommendation to revise the Rubin Observatory\u2019s  schedule to incorporate the best practices contained in GAO\u2019s schedule  guide, GAO staff with schedule expertise compared the updated schedule  to the best practices. For both of these recommendations, we focused on  cost estimating and scheduling best practices that we found to be  minimally met or partially met in our 2018 and 2019 reports. We did not  address best practices that we assessed as substantially or fully met in  our prior reports.", "In comparing NSF\u2019s procedures and the Rubin Observatory\u2019s schedule to  best practices in GAO\u2019s cost and schedule guides, we used the following  ratings:  \u201cFully met\u201d means there was complete evidence that satisfied the  entire best practice.  \u201cSubstantially met\u201d means there was evidence that satisfied a large  portion of the best practice.  \u201cPartially met\u201d means there was evidence that satisfied about half of  the best practice.  \u201cMinimally met\u201d means there was evidence that satisfied a small  portion of the best practice.  \u201cNot met\u201d means there was no evidence that satisfied any of the  elements of the best practice.", "After conducting our initial assessments of NSF\u2019s procedures and the  Rubin Observatory\u2019s schedule, we shared our draft analyses with NSF  officials to provide the agency with an opportunity to comment.

Initial project ideas emerge, and a broad consensus is  built within the relevant scientific community for the potential long-term  needs, priorities, and general requirements for research infrastructure  that NSF may consider funding.", "Design. Entrance into this stage occurs when the NSF Director  approves the proposed research infrastructure as a national priority  and the sponsoring directorate makes an award (either through a  cooperative agreement or contract) for developing detailed project  cost, scope, and schedule for possible construction. This stage is  divided into conceptual, preliminary, and final design phases.  According to NSF documentation, the goal of the conceptual design  phase is to create a comprehensive design that clearly articulates  project elements that NSF will consider, such as a description of  research infrastructure and technical requirements, a concept of  operations, and an initial risk analysis, among others. The preliminary  design phase further develops projects through the formulation of a  site-specific scope, an accurate budget estimate, a revised and  updated project execution plan, and other deliverables to establish a  project baseline. In the final design phase, a candidate project will  refine cost and contingency estimates, complete recruitment of key  staff needed to undertake construction of the project, and develop the  necessary documentation needed to undergo final design review. A  candidate project will exit the design stage and enter the construction  stage after a successful review by the NSF director and other key  stakeholders of its project execution plan and authorization of its not- to-exceed total project cost by the National Science Board, as  discussed below.", "Construction. The construction stage begins when NSF makes  awards to external recipients for acquisition or construction of  research infrastructure. Such awards generally take the form of  cooperative agreements, although NSF occasionally uses contracts,  according to agency officials. The policies and procedures in NSF\u2019s  Major Facilities Guide apply to research infrastructure projects  regardless of the award instrument employed. According to NSF\u2019s  Major Facilities Guide, the transition from construction to operations  could be a single acceptance event or multiple events depending on  the nature of the project, and many projects require an integration and  testing phase, followed by a commissioning phase to bring the facility  up to the design level of operational readiness. The construction stage  ends after final delivery and acceptance of the defined scope of work  and facility performance per terms of the award instrument.", "Operations. The operations stage includes the day-to-day work  necessary to operate and maintain the research infrastructure  (including refurbishment or upgrade activities) and to perform  research. Operations awards, which are separate from construction  awards, may be made to the construction award recipients or to a  different entity. Depending on the project, initial operations may begin  before completion of construction. Integration and testing activities  may continue during the operations stage, depending upon the  complexity and time needed to reach design specifications.", "Divestment. Divestment can include the transfer of the research  infrastructure to another entity\u2019s operational and financial control or  the decommissioning of the research infrastructure, including its  complete deconstruction and removal. NSF generally decides to  divest when the agency or the scientific community determines that  the facility is no longer considered an operational priority with regard  to advancing science, according to NSF\u2019s Major Facilities Guide.", "NSF funding for the development, design, operations, and divestment  stages generally comes from the sponsoring directorate. Funding for the  construction stage generally comes from the MREFC account. However,  if the sponsoring directorate funds construction, the policies and  procedures in NSF\u2019s Major Facilities Guide apply if total project costs  meet the definition of a major multiuser research facility project under the  American Innovation and Competitiveness Act\u2014that is, if the costs  exceed $100 million or 10 percent of the responsible directorate\u2019s annual  budget, whichever is less."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NSF Oversight of Major Facilities Projects", "paragraphs": ["NSF has established an oversight structure for major facilities projects  that includes offices from across the agency (see fig. 1).

These components of the total project cost and schedule are the  following:", "Performance measurement baseline. During design, the cost,  scope, and schedule are refined and eventually become the project  baseline. Once the baseline has been authorized and included in a  construction award, it is known as the performance measurement  baseline.

This is an amount of budget or time for covering the  cost increases or delays that would result if foreseen project risks  were to occur. During development of a total project cost estimate, the  timing and impacts of such risks are uncertain. As a project  progresses, the impacts of risks that materialize may exceed the cost  or schedule in the performance measurement baseline and lead to  use of the project\u2019s budget or schedule contingency. According to  NSF\u2019s Standard Operating Guidance on budget contingency, it is  likely no contingency will be left over by the end of a project because  all of it will have been used during normal execution of the project to  manage known risks and uncertainties. NSF approval is needed when  use of contingency exceeds certain project-specific thresholds, which  are described in the project\u2019s execution plan and codified in the  award.", "In this report, we identify total project costs for the construction of major  facility projects which were developed during the design phase based on  the latest estimates available from NSF officials; those estimates are  subject to change before construction awards are made.

NSF officials said that under  this policy, they will only request an increase to the not-to-exceed cost  that the National Science Board authorized if the recipient cannot address  the increase through use of the project\u2019s budget contingency or  acceptable reductions to the project\u2019s scope. Accordingly, at the  preliminary design review, projects must have a prioritized, time-phased  list of options for reducing scope during construction, known as scope  contingency, and the potential cost savings associated with those options  is to total at least 10 percent of the project\u2019s baseline.

For example, the Rubin Observatory utilized  $11.9 million in budget contingency and 5 months of schedule  contingency to better align testing of the camera within the project  schedule due to delays associated with the completion of the dome  enclosure and telescope mount assembly, among other delays.

By the project\u2019s final design review  in October 2018, the AIMS team determined that it could not execute  the project with the desired scope for this amount because of  changing market conditions. NSF evaluated scope reduction options  for the project but decided to maintain the project\u2019s scope at the  higher total project cost of $410.4 million. This change in total project  cost did not count as an increase under NSF\u2019s no cost overrun policy  because the previous amount had not been authorized by the  National Science Board as the project\u2019s not-to-exceed cost.", "Completed construction project. In May 2019, NSF completed  construction of the National Ecological Observatory Network project  within the $35.5 million cost increase authorized by the National  Science Board and a schedule increase of 2.8 years (57 percent).

The not-to-exceed cost that the  National Science Board authorized is the amount against which NSF  measures cost increases to implement its no cost overrun policy. In  September 2019, NSF convened two external panel reviews for the  final design of the two separate detector upgrades that make up the  HL-LHC program. According to NSF officials, the panels  recommended to the NSF Director that the detector upgrades proceed  to the construction stage. According to NSF documentation dated  November 2019, the HL-LHC program had an estimated total project  cost of $150 million for both upgrade projects. However, this amount  was subject to change since the projects had not yet been authorized  by the National Science Board to advance to the construction stage.

In our June 2018 report, we  found that NSF\u2019s procedures for recipients substantially met one of the 10  best practices for developing project schedules\u2014the best practice on  conducting a schedule risk analysis. In contrast, NSF\u2019s procedures  partially or minimally met six and did not meet three of the remaining best  practices. For example, we found that NSF\u2019s procedures did not meet the  best practice of establishing the durations of all activities because the  NSF documents we reviewed did not include policy or guidance related to  this practice, such as guidance on using realistic assumptions in  estimating durations. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act  requires that NSF ensure that its policies for estimating and managing  costs and schedules are consistent with the best practices in GAO\u2019s  schedule guide, and NSF requires the same of its recipients.

Taking these steps would be consistent with leading  principles for strategic workforce planning that we and the Office of  Personnel Management have previously identified. Therefore we  recommended that NSF assess its major facilities oversight workforce to  identify any project management competency gaps, develop a plan to  address any gaps and time frames for doing so, and monitor progress in  closing them.", "In September 2019, in response to our recommendation, NSF awarded a  contract for a proficiency assessment and workforce gap analysis. NSF  expects this analysis to assess the core competencies and necessary  proficiency levels of agency staff overseeing the major facilities portfolio  and promote long-term workforce development. According to contract  documentation, the contractor will take the following actions, among  others:  conduct a proficiency assessment and gap analysis based on a  review of existing workforce materials, such as relevant position  descriptions, vacancy announcements, performance plans, and other  NSF guidance documents; work with NSF staff to refine competency guidance to better meet  needs of the agency; and work with NSF to update training plans as necessary, based on the  findings in the gap analysis and a review NSF\u2019s existing training plan.", "According to contract documentation, NSF anticipates finishing the  competency assessment and workforce gap analysis by the second  quarter of calendar year 2020 and the implementation of contract tasks by  March 2021.

In our March 2019 report, we found that NSF had  some procedures in place to help ensure that award recipients had  project management expertise, but that the agency had not established  criteria for the expertise needed by recipients or how they should  demonstrate it. We concluded that, as a result, NSF was at risk of making  awards to organizations that may not be well qualified to manage  construction of major facilities projects.

The solicitation required  full proposals to describe the full life cycle cost and schedule\u2014including  development, design, implementation, operations, and divestment.  According to agency officials, NSF is only seeking to fund construction  and acquisition costs from the MREFC account but needs to understand  potential cost impacts on other life cycle stages.", "According to NSF officials, the mid-scale program is designed to identify  potential projects with shorter implementation timelines and high levels of  readiness as compared to the multiyear, incremental refinements to cost,  scope, and schedule that occur with major facilities projects. NSF officials  also stated that, to assess the readiness of the mid-scale projects for  which full proposals were received, the agency will use an internal  proposal review process similar to the final design review process used  for major facilities projects.

As a result, NSF has tailored its guidance to provide the  level of oversight commensurate with each project\u2019s technical scope, type  and mix of work, and risk profile. In addition, NSF is incorporating some  aspects of its existing guidance for major facilities projects into its  guidance for mid-scale projects.

Similar to major facilities  projects, NSF requires that the scope, cost, and schedule for mid-scale  projects be defined at the time of award. In addition, NSF requires budget  management, cost controls, and identification of potential risks and  mitigation strategies for mid-scale projects, and its guidance states that  budgets should be developed in accordance with GAO\u2019s cost estimating  best practices. While NSF officials state that NSF will apply substantial  rigor in assessing the defined total project cost, mid-scale projects will not  be subject to NSF\u2019s no-cost-overrun policy.

For those mid-scale projects that have budget contingency, they  must follow guidance for budget contingency laid out in the Major  Facilities Guide, such as obtaining approval from NSF for using budget  contingency.", "Monitoring and assessment. Like major facilities projects, NSF will  monitor the award progress of mid-scale projects through periodic reports  that provide quantifiable measurements on technical progress as well as  cost and schedule performance. Depending on the complexity of each  project, annual site visits or reviews may also be conducted. However,  recipients of mid-scale projects may use alternatives to an earned value  management system to report progress, such as reporting on milestone  events or expenditure reports. According to NSF officials, the burden of  establishing an earned value management system for some mid-scale  projects may outweigh the benefits of using such a system, depending on  the technical nature of the project.", "Project execution plan. According to the Major Facilities Guide, NSF will  require a project execution plan for all mid-scale projects to demonstrate  how recipients will manage the projects. A project execution plan serves  as the stand-alone document that explains all of a project\u2019s requirements  for execution. According to NSF officials, the project execution plan used  for major facilities projects would be excessive for mid-scale projects and  may discourage potential proposals. Thus, NSF guidance for mid-scale  projects requires only nine of the 16 sections normally required in a  project execution plan and allows the recipients to tailor the detail and  scope of each section to the specifics of each project. In addition, NSF  will not require mid-scale projects to include design and development  plans or site and environment information, which are required sections for  major facilities projects.
