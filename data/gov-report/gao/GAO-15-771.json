Possible reasons for the lack of a detectable effect include the small size of the e-cigarette market (estimated at $2.5 billion in 2014) relative to the cigarette market ($80 billion in the same year); lack of comprehensive and reliable data on e-cigarette quantities and prices; and lack of comprehensive and reliable information about the extent to which e-cigarettes substitute for cigarettes. If users consume e-cigarettes instead of cigarettes, cigarette FET revenue would decline as fewer cigarettes are consumed. Data from a recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing high school students' increasing use of e-cigarettes and decreasing use of cigarettes suggest that these students may substitute e-cigarettes for cigarettes to some extent. If the percentage of high school students using cigarettes continues to decline, cigarette FET revenue could also decrease at a greater rate than the average historic trend observed since April 2009, when FET on cigarettes and other tobacco products was last increased.", "Comprehensive data on e-cigarette quantities and prices are not available from federal agencies. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) do not collect data on e-cigarette quantities comparable to data that they collect for cigarettes and some other tobacco products. According to FDA officials, if e-cigarettes are deemed subject to FDA's tobacco product authorities as a result of a rule proposed in April 2014, the agency could start collecting some data on the types of e-cigarettes on the U.S. market but will not collect data on the quantities of e-cigarettes sold.

The model uses monthly data obtained from the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and  Trade Bureau and controls for a 6-year historical trend in cigarette FET  revenue, from April 2009 through December 2014; the presence of other  tobacco products (cigars, roll-your-own tobacco, and pipe tobacco); and  seasonality effects. The model also includes a time variable that tests for  the presence of e-cigarettes. We used five different dates during the  period January 2012 to October 2013 for the time variable, and we  estimated regressions for each date.
