In 1985, with 55 to 60 percent of the storage space occupied, the stockpile held about 2 million tons of ammunition. Most of the stockpile consisted of large lots, which optimized space and facilitated economical surveillance and inventories. However, in 1990 and 1991, world politics changed significantly as the Soviet Union collapsed. As a result of this event and other worldwide changes, the United States shifted from preparing for a global war to preparing for regional conflicts and crises, and a general reshaping of military resources and budgets began. First, four major Army storage installations were closed or realigned, which reduced the ammunition stockpile\u2019s storage capacity from 36 million to 30 million square feet. Second, because of overall reductions in the budget, the single manager decided to significantly decrease its inventorying of the wholesale stockpile. Third, massive amounts of ammunition were returned from overseas: (1) prepositioned ammunition from Europe, as U.S. forces stationed there were withdrawn and (2) stock from Operation Desert Storm, of which only 10 percent was used during the war. The continental U.S. stockpile installations received twice as much stock\u20141 million tons\u2014as they had shipped out. This ammunition arrived in small, broken-up lots, which required more storage space and inventory work.", "The stockpile has also been affected by (1) increases in retail stock stored within its facilities, which increased the cost of storage installation operations and reduced storage space and (2) lower usage rates, as customer demand declined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint Service-Sponsored Study Addressed Stockpile Operations", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, the Joint Ordnance Commanders Group, concerned that the wholesale conventional ammunition stockpile\u2019s readiness and quality had been degraded, initiated a comprehensive study to assess the wholesale ammunition stockpile.

The report identified problems in all the major functions that related to stockpile operations and management. Some degraded functional areas, such as inventory and surveillance, directly affect the readiness and reliability of the stockpile; others, such as receipts, issues, and storage of ammunition, affect the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. The report predicted that conditions would worsen over the next 4 years because of continued funding problems and identified several initiatives to effect improvements to the readiness and operations of the stockpile.", "The report\u2019s findings led to a charter for an ammunition functional area analysis and the development of the Integrated Ammunition Stockpile Management Plan to address funding and storage management concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Concerned about the condition and readiness of the wholesale ammunition stockpile, given changes in world and stockpile conditions, the Chairmen, Subcommittee on Military Readiness and Subcommittee on Military Procurement, House Committee on National Security, asked us to determine (1) the availability of ammunition to meet wartime and peacetime requirements and (2) what problems the Army single manager has in managing the military services\u2019 wholesale ammunition stockpile.", "To determine whether DOD has sufficient ammunition to meet demands for training and war reserves, we compared serviceable ammunition, from both wholesale and retail inventories, on hand for each service as of September 30, 1994, with the amount needed to meet requirements for wartime and peacetime operations. In making this determination, we used the automated data systems that each service maintains for its ammunition items. Specifically, the requirements were obtained from the Army Worldwide Ammunition Reporting System (WARS), Navy Non-Nuclear Ordnance Requirements System, Air Force Theater Allocation Buy/Budget System, and the Marine Corps Ammunition Requirements Management System. We did not independently verify the military\u2019s method of determining ammunition requirements.", "To determine whether the services have excess amounts of ammunition, we analyzed computerized files of the services\u2019 inventories as of September 30, 1994 (the end of the fiscal year). First, we compared the total on-hand serviceable inventory, item by item, to that needed to satisfy wartime requirements, testing and training requirements for 7 years  (6 years of testing for the Army), and other requirements. We used testing and training requirements for 7 years (1) to be conservative in calculating on-hand quantities exceeding requirements, (2) because DOD\u2019s retention policy authorizes this level of supply to meet Defense Planning Guidance, and (3) because 7 years coincides with the future years\u2019 planning of the services. As requested by the Army, we used operational project, wholesale, and basic load requirements in addition to 6 years of testing requirements and 7 years of training. Second, we determined the amount of unserviceable ammunition by type of ammunition for which there was excess serviceable inventory. Third, we compared the single manager\u2019s inventory database showing ammunition stored for the services with the services\u2019 databases that we had used in our comparison. We then determined the amount of additional ammunition excess to requirements that was not on the services\u2019 records. Finally, we identified the amount of ammunition DOD has designated for disposal. To determine the services\u2019 rationale for excesses, we selected and discussed with item managers  145 types of ammunition (126 randomly selected and 19 judgmentally selected because they had large quantities of excess items) for which on-hand quantities exceeded service-determined requirements.", "To determine whether the services have shortages of ammunition, we compared the same universe to the amount needed to meet wartime requirements plus that needed for 1 year of training and testing. We used only 1 year of training and testing requirements to be conservative in calculating ammunition shortages. To determine the services\u2019 rationale for types of ammunition with shortages, we selected and discussed with item managers 154 types of ammunition (152 randomly selected and  2 judgmentally selected because they represented large dollar values) for which on-hand quantities were less than service-determined requirements. Additionally, we selected and discussed with service officials the  42 highest unit cost items (representing $32 billion of the $60 billion shortage) to determine the rationale for shortages.", "We used the Standard Depot System database for our analyses of the wholesale stockpile. This database includes information from 11 of the  12 storage installations (Pine Bluff Arsenal is not included in the system). We used data as of March 1995 for old ammunition in the wholesale stockpile, serviceability of ammunition in the stockpile as classified by condition codes, and backlogs of periodic inspections and data as of September 1995 on the net storage space of installations.

This excess amount includes about $22 billion worth of ammunition that was still usable.", "This situation has occurred primarily as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the change in the primary threat to the United States. As a consequence, the services\u2019 ammunition requirements were drastically reduced, and more of the ammunition stockpile became excess. The Army\u2019s war reserve requirements, for example, were reduced by 74 percent.", "Of the various types of ammunition in the stockpile, we found that almost half have amounts that exceed the services\u2019 needs in varying quantities. For some types of ammunition, the services have over 50 times their stated needs. While there are shortages of some specific ammunition types, overall, the services generally have enough ammunition to meet their wartime and peacetime requirements.", "DOD management practices perpetuate the buildup of excess and aging ammunition, even though the ammunition stockpile is supposed to comprise only ammunition and explosives essential for peacetime and wartime needs. In many instances, the services keep it available just in case they or other organizations, such as state agencies or foreign allies, have a need for it. However, DOD often does not determine what would be a reasonable amount to keep to meet these needs. For all these reasons, storage facilities are reaching capacity levels, and the excess ammunition is stressing the ability of installation personnel to manage required ammunition since all ammunition not identified for disposal, including the $31 billion excess mentioned above and $2.9 billion in excess that appears on the single manager\u2019s inventory records but not the services\u2019 inventory records, receives the same amount of single manager attention (see ch. 3 for a discussion of stockpile management). Moreover, in fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the services spent about $125 million for ammunition that exceeded fiscal year 1995 stated requirements. No service purchased ammunition items in fiscal year 1995 for which it had quantities on hand in excess of stated requirements at the end of fiscal year 1994.", "In addition to its ammunition in excess of stated requirements, DOD has shortages of some types of ammunition. However, the services generally believe that these shortages are manageable because they have substitute items and planned procurements to make up for shortages.", "We believe that the shortages of some items could be satisfied by better sharing of amounts in excess of stated requirements among the services. While the Army has shared some excess ammunition among the other services, the single manager is unaware of all ammunition in excess of stated requirements because the services have not identified which of their ammunition is required and which is not required.

(Fig. 3.4 shows Maverick missiles stored outside.)", "Among the serviceable ammunition stored at installations were items that were beyond repair and designated for disposal and occupying considerable space. As of September 1995, 12 percent, or 3.2 million square feet, of the stockpile\u2019s storage capacity was occupied by stocks designated as beyond repair or for disposal. For example, about 300,000 tons of items designated for disposal were stored inside at an annual cost of about $8 million and occupied nearly 2.8 million square feet. Aggregated, these stocks would fill at least two storage installations that could be used to store serviceable stocks. We found the following examples of individual types of ammunition with questionable needs.", "In one case, 251,000 propelling charges (for 155-millimeter guns) that had been condemned but not designated for disposal were taking up 36,031 square feet (see fig. 3.5).", "In another case, 715 unserviceable Nike Hercules rocket motors with no requirements occupied 31,212 square feet. One depot was storing 458 of these items, some of which were manufactured in 1959. According to an official there, these rocket motors occupied 16 to 20 storage sites at that depot (see fig. 3.6).", "Two types of 3-inch, 50-caliber gun ammunition occupied about 15,000 square feet, even though the Navy no longer has any weapon in active inventory that uses this ammunition. According to an official at one installation, this ammunition has had few or no issues in 15 years.", "In yet another case, 5,382 Navy MK25 mines that appeared in the Army\u2019s wholesale inventory database as belonging to the Navy did not appear in the Navy\u2019s inventory database, and was occupying 49,552 square feet. About 2,200 (40 percent) of these mines had been suspended because their condition was unknown. We noted that some of these mines at one installation were manufactured in 1954, and at another installation, none of these mines had moved in over 10 years (see fig. 3.7).", "The proliferation of small, fragmented lots of ammunition also impedes the efficient management and use of ammunition storage space. According to the 1993 report on the wholesale stockpile, about 32,000 fragmented lots were stored largely because of base closures and the return of ammunition from Europe and Operation Desert Storm. Installations were forced to store the returned ammunition without knowing whether additional quantities of the same lots would be received. These lots were often stored in more than one location. To optimize storage space and reduce inventories and surveillance, ammunition from the same lot in the same condition should be located in one storage structure when possible. If personnel have to fill requisitions from several locations, response time is delayed and issue costs increase.", "Our analysis shows that since October 1993, the number of fragmented lots in the stockpile has increased 14 percent. These lots\u2014some of which were stored in more than three structures\u2014occupy 24 percent (5.9 million square feet) of the total storage space (see fig. 3.8). Fragmented lots can be reduced by selecting them first when filling requisitions, either by using an automated lot selection process or a manual selection process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Items Marked for Disposal Accumulate Faster Than They Can Be Eliminated", "paragraphs": ["As storage space has been significantly reduced and ammunition has been added, the disposal of excess, obsolete, and unusable ammunition has become crucial.

According to single manager officials, the ammunition designated for disposal has increased and is likely to increase further. Also, in recent years, the identification of ammunition for disposal has greatly exceeded the amount disposed of. Ammunition designated for disposal from fiscal years 1986 through 1995 amounted to 681,000 tons, while the amount eliminated was 390,000 tons (see fig. 3.10).", "Storage installations and contractors execute the ammunition disposal program. Before an item is earmarked for disposal, other options\u2014sales, transfers, and reuse\u2014are explored. According to single manager officials, foreign military sales have not proved a successful means of disposing of excess ammunition because foreign countries buy new, rather than obsolete, items if they have the means to do so. Currently, the primary means of disposing of ammunition is by open burning or detonation.

However, except in its inventorying of ammunition, the single manager has not substantially improved the operations and readiness of the wholesale ammunition stockpile. The single manager cannot ensure success in implementing the plan and managing the stockpile until the Army and other services identify their ammunition as required and nonrequired, but the services have no incentives to do so. Successful implementation of the plan also is dependent on sufficient funding being provided for the care, maintenance, and disposal of stockpile items. The Congress established a minimum funding level in fiscal year 1995, and the conferees on the DOD appropriations act established a funding minimum for fiscal year 1996 for the care and maintenance of ammunition. Also, the House Committee on Appropriations, in its report on DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1995 appropriations, said it expects DOD to fund disposal activities at a level that will decrease the disposal backlog to a sustainable level of about 100,000 tons early in the next century."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Single Manager Has Begun to Implement Parts of the Stockpile Plan", "paragraphs": ["The single manager has greatly improved its inventory records, a critical function previously identified as seriously degraded.

It also introduced major changes in the inventory process to focus on the accuracy of quantities within storage sites. It did not, however, assess condition. Once a site is physically inventoried, it is sealed and no longer subject to a yearly inventory unless activity affects its stock balance. To ensure that stock balances are correct, 10 percent of all sealed locations will be sampled annually. This new process is intended to reduce the inventory workload, freeing staff for other duties.", "The single manager has also taken steps to improve the stockpile\u2019s operations, as planned. For example, it has consolidated some small, fragmented lots of material and redistributed them within warehouses and has removed some items from inappropriate storage. Storage installations in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 freed about 800,000 square feet of space.

The problem is that neither the Army nor the other services have identified stock in those categories. The single manager\u2019s three-tier concept is designed to ensure that the more critical ammunition is stored in depots capable of providing the quickest response to mobilization. Four tier I depots would contain mostly required items needed in the first 30 days of mobilization, items needed for training, and items needed beyond 30 days to augment tier II and III depots\u2019 war reserve stocks. Tier I depots would receive all support necessary for storage, surveillance, inventories, maintenance, and disposal. Tier II depots would normally store war reserves needed more than 30 days after mobilization, production offset items, and some nonrequired stocks awaiting disposal. Tier III depots would be caretakers for items awaiting disposal or relocation.", "The single manager has not aggressively pursued the services\u2019 efforts to identify stock as required and nonrequired, and the single manager does not know the priority the services place on each type of ammunition. As a result, surveillance, maintenance, storage, and inventories may not be focused on priority stock to ensure it is ready for shipment when needed, and scarce resources may be spent on items with low or no priority. During our review, we found that the Army had not fully complied with the single manager\u2019s plan to identify ammunition, and the other services may not fully understand the stockpile\u2019s definition of required and nonrequired ammunition. Some attempts were made to generate the necessary data, but the services did not provide sufficient detail.", "In 1993, the Air Force classified serviceable high-priority items as tier I, unserviceable items as tier III, and all others as tier II, but it did not know whether the items in tiers I and II were required and the items in tier III were nonrequired. Officials said that the single manager did not ask for the information by required and nonrequired categories. In 1994, the Navy provided tonnage data to the single manager by types of ammunition, which in a general sense categorizes items into tiers. Navy officials could not recall being requested to categorize ammunition as required or nonrequired, and they noted that the wholesale stockpile manages only 13 percent of the Navy\u2019s ammunition inventory. Most of the Navy assets are stored aboard ships and at naval weapon stations, which they consider to be tier I and II locations.", "Marine Corps officials said they had not been required by the single manager to categorize items as required or nonrequired.", "During our review, we found that for inspection purposes, the Army had assigned a priority to each type of ammunition that can be used to identify required and nonrequired ammunition. The priorities range from ammunition needed for training and war reserve to ammunition for which there is no formal requirement. The single manager requested that the other services concur with these priority definitions. The Marine Corps responded; however, the Navy and the Air Force have not responded to this request, and the single manager cannot require the services to provide this information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Single Manager May Not Have Sufficient Funds to Carry Out the Plan", "paragraphs": ["The single manager is concerned that it will not consistently have sufficient funds through 2001 to implement its $2.7 billion plan to restore the stockpile to a usable condition and dispose of unneeded ammunition. The single manager uses operation and maintenance (O&M) funds for receipts and issuance, inventories, and surveillance of ammunition and procurement appropriations for disposal of excess, obsolete, and unsafe ammunition.", "The O&M funding allocated by the Army for inventories, storage, and surveillance has historically been less than needed by the single manager and has not yet been provided to implement the single manager\u2019s plan. Therefore, the single manager has made little progress in correcting stockpile problems. Moreover, the progress made in correcting inventory records in 1995 may be jeopardized because funding allocated by the Army is insufficient to maintain the accuracy of the records.", "According to the single manager, to successfully carry out its plan and restore stockpile readiness, it must have consistent full funding over several years for stockpile activities. The plan was based on near-term funding levels, beginning in fiscal year 1996, and it projected full implementation by fiscal year 2001. However, actual funding for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 was less than required, which, according to the single manager, postponed implementation of the plan by 2 years\u2014from 2001 to 2003. Moreover, because of limited staff at stockpile installations, large funding levels in any given year will not enable the single manager to catch up\u2014a lost year will add an additional year to fully implement the plan.", "For fiscal year 1995, the Congress statutorily required that a minimum of $388.6 million of the Army\u2019s 1995 O&M account be spent specifically for the safety and security, receipt and issue, efficient storage and inventory, surveillance, and other activities associated with conventional ammunition. For fiscal year 1996, the conferees on the DOD appropriations act directed that a minimum of $300.9 million be spent for the same purpose. According to single manager officials, setting a minimum is a good approach because funding levels are consistent and better planning and management decisions can be made. The House Committee on Appropriations report on the 1995 DOD appropriations stated that it expects the Army to fully fund ammunition activities in future budget submissions. It also commended DOD for increasing its budget for disposal activities to $95 million for fiscal year 1995, and it recommended funding of $110 million and stated the expectation that DOD would continue this level of funding in future budgets.", "In its 1994 plan to improve stockpile management, the single manager set a goal to reduce the 423,000 tons of ammunition awaiting disposal to 100,000 by fiscal year 2004. The three interrelated factors to accomplish this goal are anticipated disposal quantities between fiscal years 1996 and 2004, the actual disposal funding, and the average cost to destroy a ton of ammunition. In March 1996, the Army estimated that 685,900 tons\u2014more than triple the 1994 single manager\u2019s estimate of 225,000 tons\u2014will be generated between fiscal years 1996 and 2004. This estimate does not include 98,834 tons (85,733 tons of industrial stocks and 13,101 tons of tactical missile and large rocket motor assets) that will be generated which have other sources of disposal funding. If the single manager receives $100 million a year through fiscal year 2004 for disposal, and the disposal cost per ton is no more than $909 a ton, the single manager will meet its goal of eliminating the 100,000-ton backlog. The single manager recognizes that it will be difficult to meet this goal because it relies on a significant level of funding and the cost to dispose of ammunition may increase. Therefore, the goal will not be met if the single manager does not receive $100 million a year or if the disposal cost per ton increases. For example, if the average cost per ton is $1,100, the disposal backlog will be over 239,000 tons at the end of fiscal year 2004. Likewise, if the cost is $1,300 a ton, the backlog will be over 365,000 tons. The disposal stockpile most likely will grow even more as ammunition quantities excess to service requirements are identified (see ch. 2).", "Moreover, the single manager is concerned that the disposal program will suffer from funding cuts, personnel shortages, and low priority. If the past is any indication, the single manager may be correct. During fiscal years 1986-94, funding for disposal totaled $266 million, considerably less than the $695 million the single manager estimated was needed to operate at maximum capacity.", "The disposal of obsolete and deteriorated ammunition is a time-consuming and expensive process. At the installation with the largest disposal capacity, 1,300 tons of ammunition were destroyed at a cost of about $1 million during 1 week we visited. Additionally, the lack of Army funding has affected the single manager\u2019s ability to operate disposal facilities at full capacity. Although the estimated disposal capacity is over 100,000 tons of ammunition per year, the single manager has not been able to fully fund this function. Prior to 1995, the greatest amount disposed of was 61,500 tons in 1992; only 11,700 tons were disposed of in 1990. For example, one installation that can process 27,800 tons of ammunition annually had been allocated only 19,200 tons for disposal in fiscal year 1995. Another installation with a capacity to dispose of about 35,900 tons had been allocated only about 3,800 tons in fiscal year 1994.", "The single manager plans to gradually decrease its reliance on open burning/detonation of ammunition because environmental regulations have made these methods difficult and undesirable. Currently, however, open burning/detonation is the only cost-effective method of disposal for some items, such as cluster bombs and large rocket motors. Nonetheless, the single manager plans to increase disposal through resource recovery and recycling methods. These methods are more costly\u2014over $2,000 per ton or over twice as much as for open burning/open detonation. Should the cost per ton to dispose of ammunition approach this higher level, the backlog would increase significantly."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD concurred that problems with the ammunition stockpile management threaten readiness. DOD noted that funding levels in fiscal years 1993 and 1994 were so low as to force concentration on shipments and receipts at depots. DOD said that during this period surveillance, stockpile reliability testing, and priority maintenance projects were severely limited. DOD agreed that defect codes had not been entered for all items with overdue inspections but said inspections are performed prior to issuance of any item. DOD also said that during the first quarter of fiscal year 1996, significant progress was made toward prioritizing ammunition items and identifying those that satisfy power projection and training requirements. Based on the new priorities, periodic inspection backlogs were adjusted and reduced from approximately 60,000 lots to approximately 30,000 lots with the identification of the required part of the stockpile. We strongly support identifying what is needed for power projection and training and concentrating limited resources on these ammunition items. We believe that DOD\u2019s observation that periodic inspection needs were reduced from 60,000 to 30,000 lots and is indicative of potential reductions that can be made in the care and maintenance functions of the single manager.", "DOD partially concurred that the single manager\u2019s plan for improvement has been delayed. DOD said that while funding has been problematic, DOD does not believe that the implementation of the improvements in ammunition management will be delayed. DOD said the overall goal of the Integrated Ammunition Stockpile Management Plan is to accomplish (1) depot tiering by 2001 and (2) the other changes in stockpile management as soon as possible. With the closure of three depots, DOD expects to accomplish the tiering goal on schedule. DOD notes that the two major requirements to implement the management plan are adequate funding and segregation of the stockpile. We agree that these are important. We are particularly concerned that the identification of required ammunition, such as for power projection and training, be done as quickly as possible so that the single manager can better use limited resources. We are also particularly concerned that unless funding levels and ammunition disposal are closely monitored, the single managers will not meet its 2004 disposal goal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["Unquestionably, the single manager faces difficulties in resolving problems that developed with the wholesale stockpile as the Cold War ended. These difficulties stem from DOD\u2019s downsizing of its force and facilities in response to the much reduced threat. Reductions in ammunition storage space and the workforce, coupled with the return of massive amounts of ammunition from closed bases in Europe and from Operation Desert Storm, have degraded the single manager\u2019s ability to manage the stockpile. In addition, this ammunition was returned in small, broken lots that were stored haphazardly as they came from overseas.", "Partly as a result of this situation, half of the ammunition types in the stockpile contain items in excess of stated requirements, which we estimated to be valued at about $31 billion. This $31 billion of usable and unusable ammunition, as well as $2.9 billion of excess ammunition that was on the single manager\u2019s inventory records but not the services\u2019 inventory records, was being treated by the single manager as necessary to meet requirements. Because the single manager has concentrated on responding to requests for usable ammunition, inspections and tests of ammunition have been delayed. The single manager does not know how much ammunition in excess of stated requirements is in the stockpile and is therefore unaware of what ammunition could be shared among the services to alleviate shortages and what unusable ammunition does not need attention beyond that for safety reasons. In addition, there are tremendous backlogs of ammunition to dispose of. For the foreseeable future, this disposable ammunition will increase and take up limited storage space.", "These problems are not insurmountable, but they will take time to overcome. The Integrated Ammunition Stockpile Management Plan is a step in the right direction. In addition, the minimum levels set for the care and maintenance of ammunition established by the Congress for fiscal year 1995 and the House Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 1996 have helped the single manager in meeting its responsibilities.", "The single manager\u2019s success in implementing the management plan is limited by the services\u2019 lack of incentives to identify excess ammunition. The services are not inclined to determine which of their ammunition is required and declare the remainder excess because once ammunition is declared excess, a service is not reimbursed for its cost if another service wants it. Also, the services have no incentive to mark ammunition for disposal because they do not have to pay the single manager to store it. As the Joint Commanders Ordnance Group\u2019s 1993 report points out, the single manager could charge the services a storage fee as an incentive for the services to relinquish ownership of excess, old, and obsolete ammunition. The report also suggested that additional storage space could be made available if excess ammunition was used in training, included in foreign military sales or grant aid programs, or destroyed. In addition, as we recommended in 1979, the single manager could own, manage, and control the entire ammunition stockpile. If this was the case, the manager would have visibility over ammunition in excess of established requirements and could distribute it to other services that need it or, if unneeded, dispose of it when there was no longer a reason to retain it.", "Another troublesome problem is the disposal of excess ammunition, which is a time-consuming, expensive process. For example, at the installation with the largest disposal capacity, 1,300 tons of ammunition were destroyed at a cost of about $1 million during 1 week we visited. With over 375,000 tons of ammunition awaiting disposal at the end of fiscal year 1995 and additional ammunition identified for disposal each year, it will take years to dispose of the ammunition. And because of the expense associated with disposing of this much ammunition, finding the funds to facilitate disposal is difficult. One option would be to require the services to include the cost to dispose of ammunition being replaced in budgets for new ammunition. While this option would not eliminate the significant quantities of ammunition already awaiting disposal, it would focus earlier attention on the ammunition disposal problem, provide additional funds for disposal, and over time significantly reduce the quantities for disposal."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To impress upon the services the need to address the problem of excess ammunition, the Congress may wish to consider requiring the Secretary of Defense to report annually the amount of ammunition on hand and the amount that exceeds established requirements.

Possible changes in ammunition management, include requiring the services to pay the single manager a fee for storing their ammunition; using excess ammunition in training; authorizing the single manager to own, manage, and control the wholesale stockpile and/or have visibility of the services\u2019 retail stocks and total requirements so the manager can identify ammunition excess to stated requirements and coordinate redistribution of it to services that need the ammunition or dispose of it; and requiring the services to include the cost to dispose of excess ammunition in their budgets for new ammunition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD partially concurred with the matter for congressional consideration.
