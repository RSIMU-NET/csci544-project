EPA awards and manages discretionary grants at 10 headquarters program offices and 10 regional offices. Past reviews by GAO and EPA's Inspector General found that EPA has faced challenges managing such grants, including procuring insufficient competition for them and providing incomplete public information about them. GAO was asked to review EPA's management of discretionary grants.", "This report examines (1) how EPA manages competition for discretionary grants, (2) how much in discretionary grants EPA provided from fiscal years 2013 through 2015 and to what types of grantees, and (3) the information EPA makes publicly available on discretionary grants. GAO reviewed EPA's competition policy and guidance, examined internal evaluations of grant applications for competitions that were selected partly because they accounted for large portions of discretionary grant dollars, analyzed EPA data as well as information EPA made available on public websites, and interviewed EPA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) manages competition for its discretionary grants through a process established by its competition policy and implemented by its program and regional offices. Under the policy, offices are to advertise discretionary grant opportunities on Grants.gov\u2014a website for federal grant announcements\u2014and may also advertise using other methods, such as trade journals and e-mail lists. The announcements must describe eligibility and evaluation criteria, and the process may be customized to assess (1) all applications against eligibility criteria and (2) eligible applications for merit against evaluation criteria. Under the policy, EPA established a Grants Competition Advocate, a senior official who provides guidance to and oversight of the offices. EPA officials said this position has been key to improving competition for discretionary grants.", "From fiscal years 2013 through 2015, EPA provided nearly $1.5 billion in discretionary grants to about 2,000 unique grantees, with state governments, nonprofits, and Indian tribes receiving the largest shares, according to GAO's analysis of EPA data. Of the $1.5 billion, $579 million was for new grants subject to the competition policy, and according to EPA, the agency met its performance target to competitively award at least 90 percent of these new grant dollars or awards annually. Some discretionary grants are not subject to the competition policy for several reasons\u2014for example because they are available by law only to Indian tribes. Of the remaining approximately $920 million, $282 million was for new grants not subject to the competition policy, and about $632 million was for amendments to existing grants, such as for added work.", "Publicly available information from EPA about its discretionary grants is neither easy to identify nor complete. For example, different information about the grants, such as dollar amounts, is available at four federal websites; but three of these websites do not have a way to search all the grants, and the fourth cannot identify the grants because EPA does not flag them in its submissions to the website. EPA officials plan to better flag these grants in the future; however, to obtain complete information, users would still have to search several websites containing different parts of this information. Also, GAO found that the unofficial reports EPA makes publicly available on the number of applications received for its grant competitions contain limited information. Moreover, these reports are not current because EPA relies on manual processes to collect the information from its offices, which can cause reporting delays. Further, GAO found that although EPA's internal grants management system has a field for tracking grant types, a lack of clarity in EPA's guidance may contribute to EPA staff's inconsistent use of this field. Consequently, EPA cannot easily identify discretionary grants in its system or collect complete and accurate information on them. EPA is transitioning to a new system that is expected to be operational in 2018 and to provide the capability to collect more timely and complete information. However, EPA officials said they do not have plans to use the new system to improve their publicly available reports, which is inconsistent with effective internal and external communication suggested by federal internal control standards. More complete information could help Congress and other decision makers better monitor EPA's management of discretionary grants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that EPA develop clear guidance for tracking grants and determine how to make more complete information on discretionary grants publicly available.

Roughly  11 percent of EPA grant dollars, or about $500 million annually, are  awarded through discretionary grants, for which EPA has the discretion to  determine grantees and dollar amounts. EPA awards hundreds of  discretionary grants competitively (i.e., through a merit-based selection  process) and noncompetitively every year, and these grants fund a range  of activities, from environmental research and education to wetlands  restoration. Our past reviews and those of the EPA Office of Inspector  General have found that EPA has faced challenges managing its grants,  including discretionary grants. Challenges related to discretionary grants  have included insufficient competition for discretionary grant awards and  incomplete publicly available information about discretionary grant  opportunities. In response to some of these reviews, EPA has taken  several actions, including issuing a grants management plan, developing  and continuing to update a grants competition policy, and beginning to  transition to a new internal grants management system.", "EPA awards and manages its grants at multiple levels across the agency,  including the Office of Grants and Debarment (OGD) in the Office of  Administration and Resources Management in headquarters, 10 national  program offices in headquarters, and program offices and administrative  grants management offices in EPA\u2019s 10 regional offices. OGD develops  national grant policies and guidance, awards some grants, and oversees  EPA\u2019s administrative grants management agency-wide.

The competition policy directs program and  regional offices, in most cases, to establish a panel of reviewers for  evaluating applications and specifies that reviewers must independently  review applications in accordance with the criteria stated in the  announcement. OGD officials stated that program and regional offices  typically have one person perform the eligibility review, in consultation  with EPA legal staff if necessary, and a panel of different people reviews  applications against the evaluation criteria. These officials said that the  eligibility reviewer may be someone from the program or regional office  but that evaluation panels are usually composed of technical and subject- matter experts who are typically EPA staff, although some programs may  use other federal or nonfederal reviewers. According to OGD guidance,  program and regional offices are to prepare reviewer instructions and  brief reviewers on their responsibilities, including providing guidance on  the scoring process so that all reviewers are operating under a common  framework.", "OGD officials told us that program and regional offices have flexibility to  design the scoring approach for evaluation criteria they believe is best  suited for their competition opportunity. They stated that, although most  offices use a weighted 100-point scale, some use other approaches. For  example, ORD uses an external peer-review process to evaluate eligible  applications, and the scores are based on descriptive ratings (e.g., poor,  fair, good, very good, excellent), which are then used to determine  applications to forward to an internal EPA review panel. According to EPA  documents, the agency occasionally receives a group of applications that  all receive low scores; in these cases, EPA may not make any awards  because, according to OGD officials, there are no proposals worth  funding.", "In May 2006, we reported that, before 2002 EPA did not extensively  award grants competitively or provide widespread notification of  upcoming grant opportunities. We further reported that the 2002  competition policy represented a major cultural shift for EPA managers  and staff, requiring EPA staff to take a more planned, rigorous approach  to awarding grants. OGD officials told us that creating and implementing  the agency\u2019s competition policy in 2002, continuing to update the policy,  and creating the Grants Competition Advocate were several steps taken  to improve EPA\u2019s grants competition process in response to past  congressional reviews and assessments of the process by OMB, EPA\u2019s  Office of Inspector General, and us.

Among other things, such guidance directs  program and regional offices to document that individuals involved in the competition, evaluation, and  selection of grants do not have any conflicts of interest; use exceptions to and exemptions from competition only under proper  and appropriate circumstances and prepare adequate and defensible  justifications for noncompetitive awards, many of which must be  reviewed and approved by the Grants Competition Advocate; ensure that funding recommendations and award decisions contain  selection justification documents required by the competition policy;  and provide the Grants Competition Advocate with information, as  requested, pertaining to competitions conducted.", "According to EPA documents we reviewed and OGD officials we spoke  with, the Grants Competition Advocate\u2019s Office provides support to  program and regional offices in several ways.", "Training and guidance. The competition policy directs the Grants  Competition Advocate to coordinate training to help program and  regional offices implement the policy and make recommendations and  take actions necessary to maintain, facilitate, promote, and enhance  the policy, such as by providing guidance. For example, according to  OGD officials, the Grants Competition Advocate\u2019s Office provides  ongoing guidance for program and regional offices via training,  intranet sites, group emails, and in-person consultations. This  guidance includes an intranet checklist for preparing announcements  that meet the competition policy and Uniform Guidance. According to  OGD officials, EPA\u2019s competitive discretionary grant announcements  have become more consistent, reliable, and of better quality in recent  years as program and regional offices have become more familiar  with the guidance, including the checklist, and begun consulting the  Grants Competition Advocate\u2019s Office as they prepare new  announcements.", "Announcement reviews.

Further according to EPA, depending on workload and other  considerations, the Grants Competition Advocate\u2019s Office and agency  attorneys review many announcements under $1.5 million.

The Grants Competition Advocate\u2019s Office  conducts annual competition effectiveness reviews of a small sample  of discretionary grant competitions to ensure that they were  conducted in accordance with the competition policy, according to  OGD officials. The office selects a single competition opportunity for  review from every office that conducts competitions, alternating  annually between headquarters and regional offices. According to  officials from the Grants Competition Advocate\u2019s Office, the main  methodology for making each selection is to pick a competition  opportunity where awards have been made and that has not been  reviewed recently. The officials stated that they also try to avoid  picking competition opportunities with the same subject matter in  consecutive years, but that this can be challenging when selecting  competition opportunities from the regional offices because they  generally offer fewer competition opportunities than headquarters  offices. In its competition effectiveness reviews from fiscal years 2013  through 2015, EPA found that the competitions were generally being  conducted in accordance with the competition policy and that most  offices had made improvements, such as in ensuring reviewers  documented their evaluations properly.

Over this period, most of the program and  regional offices that conduct competitions and award grants had received  at least one formal dispute.

First, while one of the main purposes of Grants.gov is to provide public  information about competitive grant opportunities, the website includes  information only about opportunities for open competition, not simplified  competition, exceptions to competition, or exemptions from competition.  In addition, information is difficult to identify partly because  USAspending.gov and the EPA Grant Awards Database do not have a  way to search for discretionary grants. Further, although CFDA.gov has a  search field for grant types and \u201cdiscretionary grant\u201d is a second-tier grant  type that users can choose to search for, EPA does not flag discretionary  grants in the information it submits for CFDA.gov. Consequently, when  users search for EPA discretionary grants on CFDA.gov, they get no  results. OGD officials stated that they do not flag discretionary grants in  the information they submit for CFDA.gov because several of the  available second-tier grant types, such as fellowships or cooperative  agreements, could simultaneously apply to the same discretionary grant  program, and the CFDA.gov template for submitting information allows  them to identify only one second-tier grant type. As a result, they said  they do not flag any of these second-tier grant types because prioritizing  one over the others would mean excluding options that also apply, which  could confuse users. OGD officials stated that changing this would  depend on the agency making a policy decision to select discretionary  grant as the second-tier grant type when submitting information for  CFDA.gov.", "The Uniform Guidance states that, when agencies submit information for  CFDA.gov, they must identify whether a program makes awards on a  discretionary basis. In addition, EPA\u2019s CFDA user manual directs  program and regional offices to distinguish discretionary grants from other  types of grants in their CFDA submissions. According to EPA officials,  EPA has complied with the Uniform Guidance and user manual, in part,  by using only two primary-tier grant types\u2014formula grant or project  grant\u2014to flag its grants in the information it submits for CFDA.gov. EPA  officials stated that, since formula grants are nondiscretionary by  definition, this approach signals that discretionary grants would be found  under the project grant type, by default. EPA officials said they also  include competition instructions in the narrative of their CFDA  submissions for competitive discretionary grant programs, which further  distinguishes them as discretionary. However, according to EPA officials,  this method is not entirely sufficient because it identifies discretionary  grants indirectly, thus requiring users to understand the difference  between formula and project grants when searching for discretionary  grants. In addition, the project grant type is not exclusively for  discretionary grants; for example, some formula grants, such as EPA\u2019s  State Indoor Radon Grants, are flagged as project grants on CFDA.gov.  According to OGD officials, grant types have not always been clear to the  program and regional staff responsible for preparing CFDA submissions.", "OGD officials told us that, as a result of our work for this review, they  realized that they needed to improve how they identify discretionary  grants in their CFDA submissions. To do so, OGD officials stated they are  planning to specifically identify discretionary grant programs in the  narrative descriptions of their future CFDA submissions by including a  sentence explaining that the program generally makes awards on a  discretionary basis. OGD officials also said that, through their ongoing  participation in a working group coordinated by the General Services  Administration (GSA), they plan to work to clarify GSA\u2019s government-wide  guidance on identifying discretionary grants in agencies\u2019 CFDA  submissions.", "Even if EPA were to flag discretionary grants in the information it submits  for CFDA.gov, however, identifying such grants on CFDA.gov would be  just one of several steps that users would have to take to obtain more  complete information about EPA discretionary grants, since information  about EPA grants is spread across different websites. Specifically, to  obtain a range of information about discretionary grants, including  program descriptions, eligibility requirements, application procedures,  grantees, and award amounts, users would first have to identify  discretionary grants on CFDA.gov and obtain the CFDA numbers. These  CFDA numbers are the only way to link information across the other three  websites, and they are the only way to identify discretionary grants on  USAspending.gov and the EPA Grant Awards Database. Users would  have to enter the CFDA numbers on USAspending.gov to obtain  information on individual awards, including amendments, and on the EPA  Grant Awards Database for cumulative awards over the life of a grant.  According to OGD officials, the award amounts cannot be compared for  the same grant across USAspending.gov and the EPA Grant Awards  Database because USAspending.gov reports individual amounts  awarded\u2014i.e., for a new award or each amendment made\u2014on a specific  date, whereas the EPA Grant Awards Database reports the total amounts  awarded cumulatively\u2014i.e., for a new award plus or minus any  amendments\u2014over the life of a grant, which may span many fiscal years.", "According to OGD officials, EPA\u2019s unofficial reports on grant competitions  are the only publicly available source of information about the number of  applications received for discretionary grant competition opportunities.  However, our review of these reports found that they are not current, and  they contain limited information. EPA\u2019s current internal grants  management system cannot provide the type of information included in  these reports because it does not have the capability to centrally track the  number of applications received per competition opportunity. Instead, the  Grants Competition Advocate\u2019s Office collects the information manually  from each program and regional office. OGD officials stated that this  approach takes time and means that a report for a particular fiscal year  may not be complete until a year or two later because the information is  updated on a rolling basis, as it becomes available. In addition, the  information for these reports is not collected until all the awards for a  particular competition opportunity have been made, and, according to  OGD officials, it may take more than a year to complete the award  process. We also found that these reports contain limited information. For  example, they do not include such key information as award amounts,  grantee types, or amendments.

OGD officials told us that they had to  manually review the agency\u2019s CFDA program descriptions in order to  identify all the discretionary grants and respond to our data request.  They stated that EPA\u2019s internal grants management system was not  designed to collect and track this information. Although EPA\u2019s internal  grants management system includes a data field for distinguishing grant  types, including discretionary grants, from one another, the field is not  being used consistently to identify all EPA discretionary grant programs,  according to OGD officials. These officials explained that some  discretionary grants were flagged in EPA\u2019s internal grants management  system as other types of grants, such as categorical grants, which may  have some discretionary aspects to them. The officials stated that EPA  staff may not have a clear understanding of how to use the data field, and  one reason for this may be that OGD\u2019s definition of discretionary grants is  not clear, in part because it does not explain whether categorical grants  with discretionary aspects are considered to be discretionary grants.  According to OGD officials, some categorical and discretionary grant  programs can have overlapping aspects. Another reason EPA staff may  not have a clear understanding of how to use the data field may be that  EPA\u2019s guidance for CFDA.gov provides a definition of discretionary grants  that differs slightly from OGD\u2019s, and inconsistencies among these  definitions could create ambiguity for staff. For instance, OGD\u2019s  definition states that a discretionary grant is one for which EPA has  discretion in negotiating and approving the work plan, whereas the  definition in EPA\u2019s guidance for CFDA.gov does not discuss grants for  which EPA has discretion over work plans. Under federal standards for  internal control, management should design control activities to achieve  objectives and respond to risks\u2014for example, by clearly documenting  internal control in management directives, administrative policies, or  operating manuals. While EPA has documented its guidance for  CFDA.gov, it is not clear because there are inconsistencies between the  definition of discretionary grants in the guidance and OGD\u2019s definition.", "OGD officials stated that, in response to our review, they provided the list  of active discretionary grant programs to all program and regional offices  to help them better identify discretionary grants in EPA\u2019s internal grants  management system. OGD officials also posted the list of discretionary  grant programs to their intranet site so that program and regional offices  could access it at any time. In addition to these steps, by having clear  guidance on identifying discretionary grants generally\u2014such as how to  flag categorical grants with discretionary aspects and how to reconcile  inconsistencies among EPA\u2019s two definitions of discretionary grants\u2014 staff might be able to better identify all discretionary grants in the internal  grants management system, especially discretionary grant programs  developed in the future. Such guidance would also help staff update  information for ongoing grants made under programs that are now  inactive (i.e., no longer making new awards). By providing clear guidance  to EPA staff to help ensure that they correctly identify all discretionary  grants in the agency\u2019s grants management system, EPA could  communicate more accurate and complete information to internal and  external decision makers and improve the quality of the information it  makes publicly available about its use of taxpayer dollars."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, EPA has taken steps to improve competition for its  discretionary grants in response to our past reports and other reviews  identifying challenges in how EPA manages such grants.

However,  the information EPA makes publicly available is neither easy to identify  nor complete.", "EPA has faced challenges identifying the full universe of its discretionary  grants. Until recently, EPA did not have complete information about which  of its grants are discretionary because staff were not consistently  distinguishing discretionary grants in EPA\u2019s internal grants management  system. EPA has manually reviewed its CFDA descriptions to develop a  complete list of its active discretionary grant programs. Moving forward,  this information can help officials provide clearer guidance to program  and regional staff to help ensure they correctly identify programs in the  internal grants management system. This information can also help  inform guidance on how to update information for ongoing grants made  under programs that are no longer active. Improving how it identifies  discretionary grants internally will allow EPA to provide more complete  information to internal decision makers and improve the information it  makes publicly available.", "In addition, our review of EPA\u2019s unofficial reports on grant competitions\u2014 the only publicly available source of information about the number of  applications received for discretionary grant competition opportunities\u2014 found that they are not current and they contain limited information.

EPA stated that also in 2017 the agency will assess whether other actions  need to be taken to better identify discretionary grant programs in its  internal grants management systems, including training for grants  personnel to ensure consistency in defining discretionary grant programs.  To address our second recommendation, EPA stated that in 2017 the  agency will begin to examine whether and how it can use its new internal  Next Generation Grants System to generate more timely and complete  reports related to discretionary grants and make them publicly available.  EPA also stated that at the outset the agency plans to explore the  system\u2019s ability to (1) generate more timely and complete information that  can be posted on the EPA website, such as on applications received, and  (2) post an annual report on the amount of funds per discretionary grant  program and whether they were new awards or amendments.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We also examined fiscal year 2013 through 2015 annual competition  effectiveness reviews and office competition assurances for program and  regional offices for fiscal years 2014 through 2015. We reviewed EPA  decisions for grant eligibility and evaluation disputes from May 2004  through March 2016, which includes every year EPA has issued these  dispute decisions, according to EPA Office of Grants and Debarment  (OGD) officials. We also reviewed the Grants Competition Advocate  Office\u2019s dispute decision matrix, which includes summary information on  all formal disputes filed from May 2004 to March 2016. In addition, we  assessed the extent to which a nongeneralizable sample of competitive  discretionary grant announcements met key EPA criteria for preparing  such announcements in the competition policy and OGD\u2019s checklist for  preparing announcements by selecting and reviewing all of the 12 active  announcements, prepared by nine different program and regional offices,  available on Grants.gov on April 27, 2016. To do so, two analysts  reviewed the extent to which the announcements included the dozens of  elements that the competition policy and checklist direct them to include.  The analysts then discussed and compared results to resolve any  differences in their assessments. In addition, we reviewed internal  documentation for the eligibility and evaluation criteria reviews for a  nongeneralizable sample of two discretionary grant competition  opportunities managed by the Office of Research and Development  (ORD) and three discretionary grant competition opportunities managed  by the Region 9 Office. We selected these offices, in part, for geographic  diversity and because they are responsible for some of the largest  portions of discretionary grant dollars and awards among program and  regional offices. We selected the most recently closed discretionary  grant competition opportunities managed by each office, according to  EPA\u2019s unofficial reports on grant competitions. The internal  documentation for the eligibility and evaluation criteria reviews included  conflict-of-interest statements, reviewer instructions, eligibility reviews,  reviewer scoresheets, reviewer comments, and funding  recommendations.

In response to our data request, EPA  obtained these data from its Integrated Grants Management System, as  of May 6, 2016. According to EPA, the data could change over time as  offices make corrections or adjustments. In order to assess the reliability  of the data we analyzed, we reviewed database documentation;  interviewed EPA officials familiar with the data; and conducted electronic  tests of the data, looking for missing values, outliers, or other anomalies.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In  addition, EPA officials reviewed and verified our data analysis results.
