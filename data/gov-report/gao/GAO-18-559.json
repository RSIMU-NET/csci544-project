This report (1) summarizes the events regarding the breach and the steps taken by Equifax to assess, respond to, and recover from the incident and (2) describes actions by federal agencies to respond to the breach. To do so, GAO reviewed documents from Equifax and its cybersecurity consultant related to the breach and visited the Equifax data center in Alpharetta, Georgia, to interview officials and observe physical security measures. GAO also reviewed relevant public statements filed by Equifax. Further, GAO analyzed documents from the IRS, SSA, and USPS, which are Equifax's largest federal customers for identity-proofing services, and interviewed federal officials related to their oversight activities and response to the breach."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In July 2017, Equifax system administrators discovered that attackers had gained unauthorized access via the Internet to the online dispute portal that maintained documents used to resolve consumer disputes (see fig.). The Equifax breach resulted in the attackers accessing personal information of at least 145.5 million individuals. Equifax's investigation of the breach identified four major factors including identification, detection, segmenting of access to databases, and data governance that allowed the attacker to successfully gain access to its network and extract information from databases containing personally identifiable information. Equifax reported that it took steps to mitigate these factors and attempted to identify and notify individuals whose information was accessed. The company's public filings since the breach occurred reiterate that the company took steps to improve security and notify affected individuals.", "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Social Security Administration (SSA), and U.S. Postal Service (USPS)\u2014three of the major federal customer agencies that use Equifax's identity verification services\u2014conducted assessments of the company's security controls, which identified a number of lower-level technical concerns that Equifax was directed to address. The agencies also made adjustments to their contracts with Equifax, such as modifying notification requirements for future data breaches. In the case of IRS, one of its contracts with Equifax was terminated. The Department of Homeland Security offered assistance in responding to the breach; however, Equifax reportedly declined the assistance because it had already retained professional services from an external cybersecurity consultant. In addition, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and the Federal Trade Commission, which have regulatory and enforcement authority over consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) such as Equifax, initiated an investigation into the breach and Equifax's response in September 2017. The investigation is ongoing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

A lender  uses the information provided to determine whether to offer credit to an  individual, the rate of interest to be assigned to the loan, and other terms  of the contract. In addition, a growing number of entities use information  provided by CRAs to help make decisions about individuals\u2019 credit  worthiness when determining eligibility for insurance, housing, or  employment, among other things. Information from CRAs can also be  used for other purposes, such as to identify potential customers with  specific characteristics for new credit card accounts.", "CRAs may provide a variety of verification services to government and  private sector organizations. For example, Equifax provides income and  employment verification services using information collected from  employers.", "Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian\u2014the three major CRAs\u2014also  leverage information they collect from organizations, such as financial  institutions, utilities, cell phone service providers, public records, and  government sources, to offer identity verification services. Other entities,  including federal agencies, use identity verification when they enroll new  applicants for benefits and services. In addition, the IRS uses identity  verification to ensure that individuals who want to access prior year tax  returns are the legitimate filers of those returns.", "With regard to identity verification, CRAs typically use information they  collect to generate questions that federal agencies and other entities can  use to test applicants\u2019 knowledge of information in their credit file. These  questions and answers are typically the basis for identity proofing\u2014the  process of comparing evidence from an individual with a trusted source of  data to verify that the individual is who they claim to be. The evidence  generally consists of information or documentation that only the legitimate  individual should know or have access to. For example, a driver\u2019s license,  passport, knowledge of recent financial transactions, and biometric  information are all considered relatively strong evidence that the  individual is who they say they are."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Data Breach Can Have Harmful Results", "paragraphs": ["Although there is no commonly agreed-upon definition, the term \u201cdata  breach\u201d generally refers to an unauthorized or unintentional exposure,  disclosure, or loss of an organization\u2019s sensitive information.

A breach can  also occur as a result of a cyber-based attack by a malicious individual or  group, agency insiders, foreign nation, terrorist, or other adversary. Data  breaches have occurred at all types of organizations, including private,  nonprofit, and federal and state entities.", "The loss or unauthorized disclosure of information in a data breach can  lead to serious consequences and can result in substantial harm to  individuals, private sector organizations, and the federal government.  Examples of harmful results include:  loss or theft of resources, including money and intellectual property,  and identity theft;  inappropriate access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of  sensitive information; harm to national security; use of computer services for unauthorized purposes or to launch an  attack on other computer systems; damage to networks and equipment;  loss of privacy, emotional distress, or reputational harm;  loss of public confidence; and high costs to remediate the effects of the breach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Attackers Use a Variety of Tools and Techniques", "paragraphs": ["Cyber criminals seeking access to sensitive information, such as PII,  typically use a variety of readily available software tools to carry out  attacks. These tools can be used to intercept and capture data as they  are transmitted, exploit known vulnerabilities in commercially available  software, and facilitate e-mail phishing techniques for gaining  unauthorized access to systems and information.", "Attackers often use similar techniques and tools, making it difficult to  distinguish one attacker from another. When custom-built tools are used,  an attacker may rely on unique methods or display other telltale signs that  can be used for identification; such tools are usually used when a target\u2019s  defenses justify them. Off-the-shelf tools are usually enough to conduct a  successful attack that allows an attacker to steal data, bring systems  down, or gain further access to systems and resources.", "Attackers often begin with network-scanning programs, which are used to  map the layout of a targeted network and determine the location of data  repositories that may contain information of interest. Some scanners are  designed to scan only a single networked computer, extracting as much  data about that system as possible. Others can scan Internet addresses  across the web to identify potential targets by determining whether they  are using a version of software that is vulnerable to an attack.", "Once a target has been identified, the attacker will generally attempt to  gain access to the system or network without leaving any indication of  who they are or from where they launched their attack. This is commonly  accomplished using tools that mask the attacker\u2019s origin by using the  Internet address of another computer from another location. While an  investigator can sometimes use forensic tools to trace the original Internet  address, often this leads to misleading information.", "Attackers use additional tools and techniques to gain unauthorized  access to systems and data on the target network and to transfer stolen  data back to the attacker\u2019s own computer system. One such technique is  to leverage the access rights gained on the originally compromised  system to get further access into other servers on the network. To do this,  an attacker can use standard, off-the-shelf tools for navigating systems  and managing information that blend in with normal network activity. For  example, encryption can be used to hide the transfer of sensitive  information from one server to another or out of the network entirely. This  enables the attacker to continue probing for more repositories of  information and stealing copies of that information without being detected  by the targeted network\u2019s system administrators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Oversee CRA Activities, Including Protection of Personally Identifiable Information", "paragraphs": ["CRAs have been subject to federal regulation since the passage of the  Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1970.

No data was taken at this time.", "According to Equifax officials, beginning on May 13, 2017, in a separate  incident following the initial unauthorized access, attackers gained access  to the online dispute portal and used a number of techniques to disguise  their activity. For example, the attackers leveraged existing encrypted  communication channels connected to the online dispute portal to send  queries and commands to other systems and to retrieve the PII residing  on the systems. The use of encryption allowed the attackers to blend in  their malicious actions with regular activity on the Equifax network and,  thus, secretly maintain a presence on that network as they launched  further attacks without being detected by Equifax\u2019s scanning software.", "Equifax officials added that, after gaining the ability to issue system-level  commands on the online dispute portal that was originally compromised,  the attackers issued queries to other databases to search for sensitive  data. This search led to a data repository containing PII, as well as  unencrypted usernames and passwords that could provide the attackers  access to several other Equifax databases.

Specifically, while Equifax had installed a device to inspect network traffic  for evidence of malicious activity, a misconfiguration allowed encrypted  traffic to pass through the network without being inspected. According to  Equifax officials, the misconfiguration was due to an expired digital  certificate. The certificate had expired about 10 months before the  breach occurred, meaning that encrypted traffic was not being inspected  throughout that period. As a result, during that period, the attacker was  able to run commands and remove stolen data over an encrypted  connection without detection.", "Equifax officials stated that, after the misconfiguration was corrected by  updating the expired digital certificate and the inspection of network traffic  had restarted, the administrator recognized signs of an intrusion, such as  system commands being executed in ways that were not part of normal  operations. Equifax then blocked several Internet addresses from which  the requests were being executed to try to stop the attack.", "Equifax reported that, on July 30, 2017, after its information security  department observed additional suspicious activity continuing to occur,  the online dispute portal was taken offline.

Specifically,  Equifax officials told us that key factors that led to the breach were in the  areas of identification, detection, segmentation, and data governance:  Identification. According to Equifax officials, the Apache Struts  vulnerability was not properly identified as being present on the online  dispute portal when patches for the vulnerability were being installed  throughout the company. After receiving a notice of the vulnerability  from the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team in  March 2017, Equifax officials stated that they circulated the notice  among their systems administrators. However, the recipient list for the  notice was out-of-date and, as a result, the notice was not received by  the individuals who would have been responsible for installing the  necessary patch. In addition, Equifax officials stated that although the  company scanned the network a week after the Apache Struts  vulnerability was identified, the scan did not detect the vulnerability on  the online dispute portal.", "Detection. As reported by Equifax officials, an expired digital  certificate contributed to the attackers\u2019 ability to communicate with  compromised servers and steal data without detection. Specifically,  while Equifax had installed a tool to inspect network traffic for  evidence of malicious activity, the expired certificate prevented that  tool from performing its intended function of detecting malicious traffic.", "The certificate had expired before May 2017, meaning that traffic was  not being inspected throughout the breach.", "Segmentation. Because individual databases were not isolated or  \u201csegmented\u201d from each other, the attackers were able to access  additional databases beyond the ones related to the online dispute  portal, according to Equifax officials. The lack of segmentation  allowed the attackers to gain access to additional databases  containing PII, and, in addition to an expired certificate, allowed the  attackers to successfully remove large amounts of PII without  triggering an alarm.", "Data Governance. Data governance includes setting limits on access  to sensitive information, including credentials such as usernames and  passwords. According to Equifax officials, the attackers gained access  to a database that contained unencrypted credentials for accessing  additional databases, such as usernames and passwords. This  enabled the intruders to run queries on those additional databases.", "In addition to these four broad categories, Equifax officials noted one  other factor that also facilitated the breach.

Equifax officials  responsible for coordinating the response to the incident stated that, once  the company identified how the attackers were able to gain unauthorized  access to company systems and remove sensitive data, it took measures  to address the internal factors that led to the breach. The measures were  intended to better protect the company\u2019s infrastructure from future  disruptions, compromises, or failures. We did not independently assess  Equifax\u2019s efforts to address the identified factors.", "Specifically, Equifax officials stated that system-level remediation  measures were implemented to address the factors that led to the breach.

Also, to help ensure  that detection of malicious activity is not hindered in the future, Equifax  officials said they have developed new policies to protect data and  applications and implemented new tools for continuous monitoring of  network traffic. Further, in an effort to improve segmentation between  devices that do not need to communicate, Equifax officials stated that  they have implemented additional controls to monitor communications at  the external boundary of the company\u2019s networks and added restrictions  on traffic between internal servers. Finally, to help address data  governance issues, the officials said they were implementing a new  security controls framework and tighter controls for accessing specific  systems, applications, and networks.", "In addition to these measures, Equifax stated that they implemented a  new endpoint security tool to detect misconfigurations, evaluate potential  indications of compromise, and automatically notify system administrators  of identified vulnerabilities.

For example, these agencies assessed the technical impact  of the breach on their own systems that rely on Equifax services to  determine whether the breach could have compromised the integrity of  their identity proofing processes. While there was no breach of agency  systems or information, they also sought to determine which of their  customers were directly affected by the breach, recognizing that those  individuals could be at heightened risk of identity fraud. Information  security officials we spoke to at IRS, SSA, USPS, and DHS expressed  concern about how the breached data could be used to compromise  sensitive information or fraudulently procure government services, even  from agencies that are not direct customers of Equifax.", "Representatives of IRS, SSA, and USPS noted that they responded to  the breach independently of other agencies, because they said it was  unclear whether any single federal agency had responsibility for  coordinating government actions in response to a breach of this type in  the private sector.

According to SSA officials, their agency\u2019s  review assessed compliance with the baseline set of controls required  by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for systems  determined to pose a moderate level of risk. SSA officials stated that  they shared the results of their assessment with IRS, the Office of  Management and Budget, House Ways and Means Social Security  Subcommittee, and the Senate Committee on Finance. USPS officials  said they reviewed both physical security and cybersecurity controls  at Equifax\u2019s data centers in Alpharetta, Georgia and St. Louis,  Missouri locations. IRS officials said they also conducted a security  assessment at Equifax\u2019s Alpharetta data center, as well as a separate  review of physical security and cybersecurity controls at the  company\u2019s St. Louis, Missouri site.

IRS and SSA made changes to  contracts they had with Equifax to require prompt notification of any  future breach, among other things. According to officials from both  agencies, Equifax did not directly notify major federal customers of the  2017 breach prior to its public announcement because its contracts  with these agencies required notification only of breaches directly  involving the systems that provided services to the federal  government. SSA officials stated that it was important to update the  agency\u2019s contract to require Equifax to promptly notify SSA of any  data breach, regardless of which of the company\u2019s systems it may  affect. IRS officials stated that a similar change was made to their  contract with Equifax for credit reporting services. The contract  change also required the company to notify IRS within one hour after  a breach is discovered, rather than within the previous time frame of  24 hours. In addition, according to the officials, cybersecurity  language in the IRS\u2019s contract was modified to ensure better  implementation and oversight of technical security controls.", "Communicated with the public and affected individuals.

SSA issued a public blog  post reminding consumers about steps they could take to protect their  Social Security numbers.", "Made changes to agency identity-proofing procedures. Following  its assessment, IRS updated its internal cybersecurity contractor  requirements and controls related to incident handling. Further, upon  completing its assessment, USPS initiated discussions with the  National Institute of Standards and Technology to determine risks  associated with the knowledge-based verification questions it had  been using with Equifax\u2019s identity-proofing service.
