While both help students meet current expenses, tax preferences also assist students and families with saving for and repaying postsecondary costs. Both serve students and families with a range of incomes, but some forms of title IV aid--grant aid, in particular--provide assistance to those whose incomes are lower, on average, than is the case with tax preferences. Tax preferences require more responsibility on the part of students and families than title IV aid because taxpayers must identify applicable tax preferences, understand complex rules concerning their use, and correctly calculate and claim credits or deductions. While the tax preferences are a newer policy tool, the number of tax filers using them has grown quickly, surpassing the number of students aided under title IV in 2002. Some tax filers do not appear to make optimal education-related tax decisions. For example, among the limited number of 2002 tax returns available for our analysis, 27 percent of eligible tax filers did not claim either the tuition deduction or a tax credit. In so doing, these tax filers failed to reduce their tax liability by $169, on average, and 10 percent of these filers could have reduced their tax liability by over $500. One explanation for these taxpayers' choices may be the complexity of postsecondary tax provisions, which experts have commonly identified as difficult for tax filers to use. Little is known about the effectiveness of title IV aid or tax preferences in promoting, for example, postsecondary attendance or school choice, in part because of research data and methodological challenges. As a result, policymakers do not have information that would allow them to make the most efficient use of limited federal resources to help students and families."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here this morning to discuss the federal government\u2019s  efforts to financially support attendance at postsecondary education  institutions. American higher education has long been crucial to the  development of our nation\u2019s cultural, social, and economic capital. At the  dawn of the 21st Century, changing workforce demographics, a more  integrated global economy, and numerous technological advances are  placing new demands on our colleges and universities. For the United  States to remain competitive in the rising global knowledge economy, its  citizens will need both the ways and means to endow themselves with the  tools necessary for the task. However, rising tuition has become a  disconcertingly fixed feature of our higher education system, and in recent  months concerns about postsecondary access and affordability have  received notable attention through the findings of the Secretary of  Education\u2019s Commission on the Future of Higher Education and the  Comptroller General\u2019s recent forum on the Global Competitiveness of the  Nation\u2019s Higher Education System.", "This hearing is an opportunity to consider whether any changes should be  made in the government\u2019s overall strategy and the individual programs and  tax provisions that provide financial assistance to students and families  saving or paying for postsecondary education or repaying student loans.  This opportunity to review the programs and tax provisions is important  for several reasons. The fact that we face large and growing structural  deficits in the future\u2014primarily driven by demographics and rising health  care costs\u2014emphasizes the need to consider how the government  allocates resources. In addition, GAO has noted that fundamental  reexamination of government programs, policies, and priorities is  necessary to assure that they match the needs of the 21st Century. GAO  has identified the coordination of student aid programs and the  effectiveness of those programs both as key topics needing congressional  oversight.", "My statement today will focus on three issues that emerged in our 2005  report on student grant and loan assistance made available under Title IV  of the Higher Education Act and postsecondary education tax  preferences.", "Postsecondary student financial assistance provided through programs  authorized under title IV and the tax code differ in three key ways. First,  title IV grant and loan programs traditionally provide aid to students and  families while students are in college, whereas tax preferences help both  during the college years as well as before and after college by assisting  with saving for or repaying college costs. Additionally, while student aid  programs and tax preferences serve students and families across a wide  range of income groups, some title IV programs\u2014particularly the Pell  grant program\u2014provide much of their financial assistance to students and  families whose incomes are lower, on average, than students and families  who receive student loans, tax credits, and deductions, or who make use  of tax-exempt saving vehicles. Last, students and families have more  responsibility for appropriately using and thereby obtaining the benefits of  tax preferences than they do with title IV aid.", "Second, postsecondary tax preferences are difficult for families to  understand and use correctly. Perhaps due to the complexity of the tax  provisions, hundreds of thousands of taxpayers fail to claim tax  preferences to which they are entitled or do not claim the tax preference  that would be most advantageous to them.", "Finally, we found that Congress has received little evidence concerning  the effectiveness of assistance provided under title IV or through tax  preferences, including whether such assistance increases attendance or  choice.", "Our statement today is drawn from previous GAO reports and testimonies  covering postsecondary title IV programs and tax preferences, which were  done in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards, as well as reviews of relevant literature."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Financial assistance to help students and families pay for postsecondary  education has been provided for many years through student grant and  loan programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of  1965, as amended. Examples of these programs include Pell Grants for  low-income students, PLUS loans to parents and graduate students, and  Stafford loans. Much of this aid has been provided on the basis of the  difference between a student\u2019s cost of attendance and an estimate of the  ability of the student and the student\u2019s family to pay these costs, called the  expected family contribution (EFC). The EFC is calculated based on  information provided by students and parents on the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Statutory definitions establish the criteria  that students must meet to be considered independent of their parents for  the purpose of financial aid, and statutory formulas establish the share of  income and assets that are expected to be available for the student\u2019s  education. In fiscal year 2005, the Department of Education made  approximately $14 billion in grants, and title IV lending programs made  available another $57 billion in loan assistance. Title IV also authorizes  programs funded by the federal government and administered by  participating higher education institutions, including the Supplemental  Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Perkins loans, and federal work- study aid, collectively known as campus-based aid. Table 1 provides brief  descriptions of the title IV programs that we reviewed in our 2005 report  and includes two programs\u2014Academic Competitiveness Grants and  National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grants\u2014that  were created since that report was issued.", "Postsecondary assistance also has been provided through a range of tax  preferences, including postsecondary tax credits, tax deductions, and tax- exempt savings programs. For example, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997  allows eligible tax filers to reduce their tax liability by receiving, for tax  year 2006, up to a $1,650 Hope tax credit or up to a $2,000 Lifetime  Learning tax credit for tuition and course-related fees paid for a single  student. The fiscal year 2005 federal revenue loss estimate of the  postsecondary tax preferences that we reviewed was $9.15 billion dollars.  Tax preferences discussed as part of our 2005 report include the  following:  Lifetime Learning Credit\u2014income-based tax credit claimed by tax filers on  behalf of students enrolled in one or more postsecondary education  courses.", "Hope Credit\u2014income-based tax credit claimed by tax filers on behalf of  students enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program of study and who  are in their first 2 years of postsecondary education.", "Student Loan Interest Deduction\u2014income-based tax deduction claimed by  tax filers on behalf of students who took out qualified student loans while  enrolled at least half-time.", "Tuition and Fees Deduction\u2014income-based tax deduction claimed by tax  filers on behalf of students who are enrolled in one or more postsecondary  education courses and have either a high school diploma or a General  Educational Development (GED) credential.", "Section 529 Qualified Tuition Programs\u2014College Savings Programs and  Prepaid Tuition Programs\u2014non-income-based programs that provide  favorable tax treatment to investments and distributions used to pay the  expenses of future or current postsecondary students.", "Coverdell Education Savings Accounts\u2014income-based savings program  providing favorable tax treatment to investments and distributions used to  pay the expenses of future or current elementary, secondary, or  postsecondary students.", "As figure 1 demonstrates, the use of tax preferences has increased since  1997, both in absolute terms and relative to the use of title IV aid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Preferences Differ from Title IV Assistance in Timing, Distribution, and Students\u2019 and Families\u2019 Responsibility for Obtaining Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Postsecondary student financial assistance provided through programs  authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act and the tax code  differ in timing of assistance, the populations that receive assistance, and  the responsibility of students and families to obtain and use the assistance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Title IV and Tax Programs Differ in Benefit Timing", "paragraphs": ["Title IV programs and education-related tax preferences differ significantly  in when eligibility is established and in the timing of the assistance they  provide.

As a result, the beneficiaries of title IV programs  and tax preferences differ.", "Title IV programs generally have rules for calculating grant and loan  assistance that give different consideration to family income, assets, and  college costs in the award of financial aid. For example, Pell Grant  awards are calculated by subtracting the student\u2019s EFC from the maximum  Pell Grant award ($4,050 in academic year 2006-2007), or the student\u2019s cost  of attendance, whichever is less. Because the EFC is closely linked to  family income and circumstances (such as the size of the family and the  number of dependents in school), and modest EFCs are required for Pell  eligibility, Pell awards are made primarily to families with modest  incomes. In contrast, the maximum unsubsidized Stafford loan amount is  calculated without direct consideration of financial need: students may  borrow up to their cost of attendance, minus the estimated financial  assistance they will receive. As table 2 shows, 92 percent of Pell financial  support in 2003-2004 was provided to dependent students whose family  incomes were $40,000 or below, and the 38 percent of Pell recipients in the  lowest income category ($20,000 or below) received a higher share (48  percent) of Pell financial support.", "Because independent students generally have lower incomes and  accumulated savings than dependent students and their families, patterns  of program participation and dollar distribution differ. Participation of  independent students in Pell, subsidized Stafford, and unsubsidized  Stafford loan programs is heavily concentrated among those with incomes  of $40,000 or less: from 74 percent (unsubsidized Stafford) to 95 percent  (Pell) of program participants have incomes below this level. As shown in  table 3, the distribution of award dollars follows a nearly identical pattern.", "Many education-related tax preferences have both de facto lower limits  created by the need to have a positive tax liability to obtain their benefit  and income ceilings on who may use them. For example, the Hope and  Lifetime Learning tax credits require that tax filers have a positive tax  liability to use them and income-related phase-out provisions in 2005 that  began at $45,000 and $90,000 for single and joint filers, respectively.  Furthermore, tax-exempt savings are more advantageous to families with  higher incomes and tax liabilities because, among other reasons, these  families hold greater assets to invest in these tax preferences and have a  higher marginal tax rate, and thus benefit the most from the use of these  tax preferences.

The Department of Education is  responsible for calculating students\u2019 and families\u2019 EFC on the basis of the  FAFSA, and students\u2019 educational institutions are responsible for  determining aid eligibility and the amounts and packaging of awards.", "In contrast, higher education tax preferences require students and families  to take more responsibility. Although postsecondary institutions provide  students and IRS with information about higher education attendance,  they have no other responsibilities for higher education tax credits,  deductions, or tax-preferred savings. The federal government\u2019s primary  role with respect to higher education tax preferences is the promulgation  of rules; the provision of guidance to tax filers; and the processing of tax  returns, including some checks on the accuracy of items reported on those  tax returns. The responsibility for selecting among and properly using tax  preferences rests with tax filers. Unlike title IV programs, users must  understand the rules, identify applicable tax preferences, understand how  these tax preferences interact with one another and with federal student  aid, keep records sufficient to support their tax filing, and correctly claim  the credit or deduction on their return."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Tax Filers May Not Effectively Use Postsecondary Tax Preferences, Possibly Due to Complexity", "paragraphs": ["According to our analysis of IRS data on the use of Hope and Lifetime tax  credits and the tuition deduction in our 2005 report, some tax filers appear  to make less-than-optimal choices among them.

They may also fail to minimize  their federal income tax liability by claiming a tax credit or deduction that  yields less of a reduction in taxes than a different tax preference or by  failing to claim any of their available tax preferences. For example, if a  married couple filing jointly with one dependent in his/her first 2 years of  college had an adjusted gross income of $50,000, qualified expenses of  $10,000 in 2006, and tax liability greater than $2,000, their tax liability  would be reduced by $2,000 if they claimed the Lifetime Learning credit  but only $1,650 if they claimed the Hope credit.", "In our 2005 report, we found that some people who appear to be eligible  for tax credits and/or the tuition deduction did not claim them. The files of  about 77 percent of the tax year 2002 tax returns that we were able to  review were apparently eligible to claim one or more of the three tax  preferences. However, about 27 percent of those returns, representing  about 374,000 tax filers, failed to use the any of them. The amount by  which these tax filers failed to reduce their tax averaged $169; 10 percent  of this group could have reduced their tax liabilities by over $500.", "Suboptimal choices were not limited to tax filers who prepared their own  tax returns. A possible indicator of the difficulty people face in  understanding education-related tax preferences is how often the  suboptimal choices we identified were found on tax returns prepared by  paid tax preparers. We estimate that about 50 percent of the returns we  found that appear to have failed to optimally reduce the tax filer\u2019s tax  liability were prepared by paid tax preparers. Generalized to the  population of tax returns we were able to review, returns prepared by paid  tax preparers represent about 223,000 of the approximately 447,000  suboptimal choices we found. Our April 2006 study of paid tax preparers  corroborated the problem of confusion over which of the tax preferences  to claim. Of the 9 undercover investigation visits we made to paid  preparers with a taxpayer with a dependent college student, 3 preparers  did not claim the credit most advantageous to the taxpayer and thereby  cost these taxpayers hundreds of dollars in refunds. In our investigative  scenario, the expenses and the year in school made the Hope education  credit far more advantageous to the taxpayer than either the tuition and  fees deduction or the Lifetime Learning credit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Suboptimal Use of Postsecondary Tax Preferences May Result from Their Complexity", "paragraphs": ["The apparently suboptimal use of postsecondary tax preferences may  arise, in part, because of the complexity of using these provisions. Tax  policy analysts have frequently identified postsecondary tax preferences  as a set of tax provisions that demand a particularly large investment of  knowledge and skill on the part of students and families or expert  assistance purchased by those with the means to do so. They suggest that  this complexity arises from multiple postsecondary tax preferences with  similar purposes, from key definitions that vary across these provisions,  and from rules that coordinate the use of multiple tax provisions. Twelve  tax preferences are outlined in the IRS publication, Tax Benefits for  Education, for use in preparing 2005 returns (the most recent publication  available). The publication includes 4 different tax preferences for  educational saving. Three of these preferences\u2014Coverdell Education  Savings Accounts, Qualified Tuition Programs, and U.S. education savings  bonds\u2014differ across more than a dozen dimensions, including the tax  penalty that occurs when account balances are not used for qualified  higher education expenses, who may be an eligible beneficiary, annual  contribution limits, and other features.", "In addition to learning about, comparing, and selecting tax preferences,  filers who wish to make optimal use of multiple tax preferences must  understand how the use of one tax preference affects the use of others.  The use of multiple education-related tax preferences is coordinated  through rules that prohibit the application of the same qualified higher  education expenses for the same student to more than one education- related tax preference, sometimes referred to as \u201canti-double-dipping  rules.\u201d These rules are important because they prevent tax filers from  underreporting their tax liability.

The federal tax code now contains a range of  tax preferences that may be used to assist students and families in saving  for, paying, or repaying the costs of postsecondary education. These tax  preferences include credits and deductions, both of which allow tax filers  to use qualified higher education expenses to reduce their federal income  tax liability.

Similarly, student loans forgiven  when a graduate goes into certain professions for a certain period of time  are also not subject to federal income taxes.

After subtracting tax-free assistance  from qualified educational expenses to arrive at the AQEE, tax filers  multiply total distributed earnings by the fraction (AQEE / total amount  distributed during the year).
