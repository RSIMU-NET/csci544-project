In March 2008, GAO designated the 2010 Decennial Census a high-risk area, citing a number of long-standing and emerging challenges, including weaknesses in the U.S. Census Bureau's (Bureau) management of its information technology (IT) systems and operations. In conducting the 2010 census, the Bureau is relying on both the acquisition of new IT systems and the enhancement of existing systems. Thoroughly testing these systems before their actual use is critical to the success of the census. GAO was asked to testify on its report, being released today, on the status and plans of testing of key 2010 decennial IT systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the Bureau has made progress in testing key decennial systems, critical testing activities remain to be performed before systems will be ready to support the 2010 census. Bureau program offices have completed some testing of individual systems, but significant work still remains to be done, and many plans have not yet been developed (see table below). In its testing of system integration, the Bureau has not completed critical activities; it also lacks a master list of interfaces between systems and has not developed testing plans and schedules. Although the Bureau had originally planned what it refers to as a Dress Rehearsal, starting in 2006, to serve as a comprehensive end-to-end test of key operations and systems, significant problems were identified during testing. As a result, several key operations were removed from the Dress Rehearsal and did not undergo end-to-end testing. The Bureau has neither developed testing plans for these key operations, nor has it determined when such plans will be completed. Weaknesses in the Bureau's testing progress and plans can be attributed in part to a lack of sufficient executive-level oversight and guidance. Bureau management does provide oversight of system testing activities, but the oversight activities are not sufficient. For example, Bureau reports do not provide comprehensive status information on progress in testing key systems and interfaces, and assessments of the overall status of testing for key operations are not based on quantitative metrics. Further, although the Bureau has issued general testing guidance, it is neither mandatory nor specific enough to ensure consistency in conducting system testing. Without adequate oversight and more comprehensive guidance, the Bureau cannot ensure that it is thoroughly testing its systems and properly prioritizing testing activities before the 2010 Decennial Census, posing the risk that these systems may not perform as planned."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the 2010  census. The U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) is relying on both the  acquisition of new systems and the enhancement of existing legacy  systems for conducting operations for the 2010 Decennial Census. As you  know, the census is mandated by the U.S. Constitution and provides data  that are vital to the nation. These data are used, for example, to  reapportion and redistrict the seats of the U.S. House of Representatives,  realign the boundaries of the legislative districts of each state, and allocate  federal financial assistance. Carrying out the census is the responsibility of  the Department of Commerce\u2019s Census Bureau, which is relying on  automation and technology to improve the coverage, accuracy, and  efficiency of the 2010 census.

For example, enumeration  \u201cuniverses,\u201d which serve as the basis for enumeration operations and  response data collection, are organized by the Universe Control and  Management (UC&M) system, and response data are received and edited  to help eliminate duplicate responses using the Response Processing  System (RPS). Both UC&M and RPS are legacy systems that are  collectively called the Headquarters Processing System.", "Geographic information and support to aid the Bureau in establishing  where to count U.S. citizens are provided by the Master Address  File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing  (MAF/TIGER) system. The Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS)  is to provide a system for collecting and integrating census responses from  all sources, including forms and telephone interviews. The Field Data  Collection Automation (FDCA) program includes the development of  handheld computers for the address canvassing operation and the  systems, equipment, and infrastructure that field staff will use to collect  data. Paper-Based Operations (PBO) was established in August 2008  primarily to handle certain operations that were originally part of FDCA.  PBO includes IT systems and infrastructure needed to support the use of  paper forms for operations such as group quarters enumeration activities,  nonresponse follow-up activities, enumeration at transitory locations  activities, and field verification activities. These activities were originally  to be conducted using IT systems and infrastructure developed by the  FDCA program.

However, significant activities  remain to be completed. For example, for systems such as PBO, interfaces  have not been fully defined, and other interfaces have been defined but  have not been tested. In addition, the Bureau has not established a master  list of interfaces between key systems, or plans and schedules for  integration testing of these interfaces. A master list of system interfaces is  an important tool for ensuring that all interfaces are tested appropriately  and that the priorities for testing are set correctly. As of October 2008, the  Bureau had begun efforts to update a master list it had developed in 2007,  but it has not provided a date when this list will be completed.", "Without a completed master list, the Bureau cannot develop  comprehensive plans and schedules for conducting systems integration  testing that indicate how the testing of these interfaces will be prioritized.

In addition, comprehensive guidance should describe  each level of testing and the types of test products expected.", "In response to prior recommendations, the Bureau took initial steps to  enhance its programwide oversight; however, these steps have not been  sufficient. For example, in June 2008, the Bureau established an inventory  of all testing activities specific to all key decennial operations. However,  the inventory has not been updated since May 2008, and officials have no  plans for further updates.", "In another effort to improve executive-level oversight, the Decennial  Management Division began producing (as of July 2008) a weekly  executive alert report and has established (as of October 2008) a  dashboard and monthly reporting indicators. However, these products do  not provide comprehensive status information on the progress of testing  key systems and interfaces. Further, the assessment of testing progress  has not been based on quantitative and specific metrics. The lack of  quantitative and specific metrics to track progress limits the Bureau\u2019s  ability to accurately assess the status and progress of testing activities. In  commenting on our draft report, the Bureau provided selected examples  where they had begun to use more detailed metrics to track the progress  of end-to-end testing activities.", "The Bureau also has weaknesses in its testing guidance.
