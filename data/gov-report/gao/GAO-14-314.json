GAO has reported on potential risks to DOD's implementation caused by the lack of a coordinated management approach and an absence of life-cycle cost estimates. Given DOD's BMD investment and revised approach, GAO was asked to review EPAA's implementation. GAO evaluated the extent to which DOD (1) identified and planned to resolve implementation issues before deploying BMD capabilities to Europe; and (2) estimated the long-term costs to operate and support BMD elements in Europe.

As a result, DOD experienced implementation issues, such as incomplete construction of housing facilities for soldiers arriving at the EPAA radar site in Turkey and incomplete implementing arrangements defining how to operate with allies when certain BMD elements arrived in the host country. U.S. Strategic Command, in coordination with other combatant commands, developed criteria to assess whether a BMD capability is ready for operational use to ensure that BMD capabilities can be used as intended when they are delivered. However, the assessment criteria used during this process focused on effectiveness, suitability, and interoperability areas\u2014such as whether BMD elements can work together to track ballistic missile threats\u2014and did not explicitly require DOD to comprehensively identify and plan to resolve implementation issues prior to deploying these capabilities. DOD plans to continue to use its existing process to accept BMD capabilities planned for Europe in the future. Without identifying and planning to resolve implementation issues before deployment, DOD risks continuing to encounter implementation issues after it deploys additional BMD capabilities in Europe, which may lead to significant delays and inefficiencies.", "DOD has estimated the long-term operating and support cost estimates for some but not all BMD elements in Europe, and existing estimates could change. Specifically, initial estimates indicate these costs could total several billion dollars over the elements' lifetime, but key decisions that have not been made are likely to change these estimates. Also, DOD has not developed a comprehensive estimate for a key element\u2014Aegis Ashore. In prior work developing cost-estimating best practices, GAO concluded that cost estimates can assist decision makers in budget development and are necessary for evaluating resource requirements at key decision points and effectively allocating resources. Office of Management and Budget guidance also emphasizes that agencies should plan for operations and maintenance of capital assets. In 2012, the Army and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) estimated the lifetime operating and support costs for two BMD elements, a forward-based radar and terminal high-altitude air defense batteries. However, DOD has not completed business-case analyses for them, which would underpin a decision on long-term support strategies, and has not decided where to station the terminal-defense battery. In addition, MDA and the Navy have separately begun to identify some costs but have not developed a comprehensive joint estimate of lifetime operating and support costs for the two planned Aegis Ashore sites. Although MDA and the services agreed to jointly develop estimates of lifetime operating and support costs, there is no explicit requirement to complete business-case analyses to support a decision on long-term product support, and jointly develop cost estimates, before deploying BMD elements in Europe. However, without completed business-case analyses and up-to-date operating and support cost estimates, DOD and decision makers are limited in their ability to develop sound budgets and identify the resources needed over the long term to operate and support BMD elements in Europe."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD identify and plan to resolve implementation issues prior to deploying and operating BMD elements and require and set a deadline for completing business-case analyses and joint cost estimates for all BMD elements in Europe.

In 2009, the President announced a revised  approach for BMD in Europe called the European Phased Adaptive  Approach (EPAA). This approach is to include ships, land-based radars  and interceptors, and a communications network, to be implemented in  phases of increasing capabilities beginning in 2011. EPAA is intended to  be a flexible and cost-effective way to address short-, medium-, and  intermediate-range ballistic missile threats from Iran. EPAA replaced a  prior plan to defend both Europe and the United States from longer-range  ballistic missiles by deploying a radar in the Czech Republic and ground- based intercontinental missile interceptors in Poland.", "We have issued numerous reports over the last 10 years on  development, acquisition, and plans for operating ballistic missile defense  capabilities.

This  document described the goal of the warfighter acceptance process, which  is, in essence, to ensure that capabilities can be used as intended when  they are delivered, and culminates in formal acceptance of BMD  capabilities by U.S. Strategic Command. We also reviewed key  documents, such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction  titled Policy Guidance for Ballistic Missile Defense Operations and the  Joint Staff Publication on Countering Air and Missile Threats, which  describe DOD\u2019s BMD guidance and responsibilities of various  organizations. We also met with officials from the Office of the Secretary  of Defense, the Joint Staff, U.S. European Command and its military  service components, and U.S. Strategic Command to understand how  DOD\u2019s acceptance process was implemented.

To determine the general purpose for estimating long-term costs, we  identified and reviewed documents containing best practices for  determining high-quality cost estimates from the Office of Management  and Budget and the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide.  Specifically, we determined that cost estimates can assist decision  makers in budget development and are necessary for evaluating resource  requirements at key decision points and effectively allocating resources.  In addition, we reviewed the Army\u2019s regulation on Integrated Logistic  Support, which includes guidance on business-case analysis, and is  referenced in the agreement annexes between MDA and the Army, to  identify DOD criteria for conducting business-case analyses to assess  alternatives for providing long-term support. We then reviewed  documentation of estimates developed by MDA and the services for BMD  elements designated for EPAA, as well as elements that DOD could  deploy to support EPAA.

Subsequently, as we found during this  review, MDA is working with the services to jointly develop estimates of  operating and support costs for two BMD elements.

Until the permanent facilities are completed, soldiers deployed  to the site may continue to face difficult conditions. Further, without a  process that accounts for implementation issues such as this, DOD  may encounter similar challenges as it deploys additional capabilities  to the region.", "Lack of defined policies and procedures for sharing BMD radar data  across geographic combatant commands: Sharing BMD element  data, such as radar data, can improve missile defense performance,  but DOD accepted its most-recently deployed forward-based radar  before finalizing policies and procedures that address potential  overlapping operational priorities across geographic combatant  commands. Subsequent to its deployment of a forward-based radar  for EPAA in 2011, DOD deployed another forward-based radar in the  operational area of U.S. Central Command in 2013. DOD had begun  discussions on the benefits and drawbacks of sharing radar data, but  the most-recent deployment proceeded without a decision for how to  address these issues, even though both regions face a common  threat. According to officials, the first priority for deploying each radar  was to support separate missions in their respective areas of  responsibility, and a decision to use one radar to support the other  radar was a secondary priority and thus did not require resolution prior  to deployment. However, officials also stated that sharing radar data  between the recently deployed radar with the EPAA forward-based  radar could benefit missile defense in Europe and potentially increase  operational effectiveness across both geographic combatant  commands. DOD guidance states that U.S. Strategic Command is  responsible for synchronizing global missile defense planning in  coordination with the combatant commands, services, MDA, and  appropriate agencies. Guidance further indicates that U.S. Strategic  Command, working with the geographic combatant commands,  integrates and synchronizes various BMD elements, such as radars.", "However, the warfighter acceptance process did not explicitly require  a comprehensive assessment of whether policies and procedures for  sharing BMD radar data are defined. The combatant commands,  including U.S. European Command, have made progress on  addressing this implementation issue. For example, since  deployment, U.S. European Command, in coordination with U.S.  Strategic Command, has requested technical analysis from MDA in  order to determine the extent to which the radars can share  information. In addition to the technical analysis, U.S. European  Command officials stated that DOD has held several senior-level  meetings to discuss policies and procedures for addressing potential  overlapping operational priorities and to discuss possible  consequences that might occur if the radars are integrated. As a  result of not completing such policies and procedures prior to  accepting BMD capabilities, DOD continues to operate these radars  separately and may face difficulty in sharing the radar data across  geographic combatant commands, thus affecting efficient BMD  operations in Europe.", "Incomplete implementing arrangements and procedures for working  with allies: DOD\u2019s experience delivering Patriot batteries to Turkey in  early 2013 demonstrates some of the difficulties the warfighter could  encounter by not finalizing implementing arrangements and tactics,  techniques, and procedures with allies prior to deployment. DOD  deployed Patriot batteries to Turkey as part of a NATO mission to  support the country\u2019s air defense, but this action was not part of  EPAA\u2019s first phase. However, U.S. European Command officials  indicated that it shaped this deployment to be similar to future U.S.  deployments of Patriot batteries to Europe, and interoperability with  NATO is a key aspect of EPAA. However, according to Army officials,  host-nation implementing arrangements had not been finalized before  the Patriot batteries arrived in Turkey, resulting in the equipment  remaining at an airfield for several weeks before it could be deployed  for operations. In addition, according to Army officials, foreign  disclosure issues were not resolved by the time Patriot batteries  arrived in Turkey, and initially there were limitations on what  intelligence information could be shared with non-U.S. forces. Further,  according to Army officials, soldiers had to receive supplemental  training to perform the NATO mission, including using NATO tactics,  techniques, and procedures, which can differ from those of the United  States. According to officials, DOD was aware of these issues but  could not address them prior to deploying Patriot batteries to Turkey  due to the need to address threats there.

Nonetheless, the warfighter acceptance process did not  explicitly require a comprehensive assessment of whether these  implementing arrangements and procedures were completed prior to  deployment.

Additionally, the Navy, in  coordination with MDA and U.S. European Command, is tracking the  development and deployment of the Aegis Ashore weapon systems and  facilities. However, these efforts are not part of DOD\u2019s warfighter  acceptance process, which means that issues raised through these  efforts would not necessarily be addressed prior to accepting or deploying  additional EPAA capabilities.

We have previously reported on issues related to  frequency access for Aegis Ashore. The two Aegis Ashore elements  dedicated to EPAA Phases Two and Three\u2014which are expected to  operate in Romania and Poland by 2015 and 2018 respectively\u2014have  radars that DOD has designed to use a certain range of frequencies for  full operations, including maintenance, periodic testing of equipment, and  training of crews. However, according to U.S. European Command  officials, some of the frequencies Aegis Ashore is designed to use are  reserved for civil use, such as commercial and cell phone services.  Accordingly, U.S. European Command officials stated that resolving  frequency access issues and completing the implementing arrangements  for U.S. radars takes time and must be initiated early in the planning  process to allow time for completion before DOD deploys Aegis Ashore in  Romania. According to U.S. European Command officials, in 2013, DOD  and Romanian officials worked together to agree on frequencies available  for Aegis Ashore operations so that both the radar and the commercial  and cell phone services can coexist, with restrictions, by early 2015. In  Poland, however, resolving frequency range access issues is more  complex, according to DOD officials. Specifically, the frequency range is  more congested in central Europe, which increases the potential for  cross-border interference with neighboring countries. In addition,  according to U.S. European Command officials, Poland is in the process  of issuing new commercial licenses for frequencies within its civil  frequency range that overlap with those Aegis Ashore is designed to use.  This process may affect the time frame for resolving Aegis Ashore\u2019s  access to these frequencies. DOD officials stated that they plan to work  closely with their Polish counterparts to resolve these issues prior to the  planned deployment of Aegis Ashore in 2018. According to DOD officials,  construction of Aegis Ashore can proceed without these issues being  resolved. However, the extent to which the radar could be used to train,  maintain, and test the capabilities may be limited. As a result, the current  warfighter acceptance process, with its focus on meeting operational  needs based on criteria that do not comprehensively include potential  implementation issues, may not ensure that radar capabilities can be fully  used once deployed.", "In addition, DOD may choose to forward station or deploy Patriot and  THAAD batteries to supplement EPAA or NATO operations. U.S.  Strategic Command officials stated that the warfighter acceptance  process will not be applied to Patriot batteries, and they have not yet  decided whether the process will be applied to THAAD batteries.  Nonetheless, it is important that the warfighter be prepared to operate the  batteries and that implementing arrangements be in place. As with the  Aegis Ashore radar, if DOD forward-stationed a THAAD battery to  Europe, it may need to negotiate implementing arrangements for the  THAAD radar to access frequency ranges for periodic testing,  maintenance, and training to support BMD operations. Also, if Patriot  batteries were sent to Europe, DOD may need to negotiate implementing  arrangements and coordinate tactics, techniques, and procedures with  allies as it did for the Patriot deployment to Turkey. Since DOD\u2019s  experience has shown that it may require considerable time in order to  develop necessary implementing arrangements, it would be important for  these types of issues to be identified as soon as possible. Unless DOD  comprehensively identifies and develops a plan to resolve implementation  issues for elements that may deploy to support BMD operations in  Europe, DOD risks experiencing challenges that may affect the  warfighter\u2019s ability to fully utilize the systems as designed.", "DOD has encountered various implementation issues when deploying  BMD capabilities in Europe and risks encountering similar issues in the  future, because there is no explicit requirement within the warfighter  acceptance process to ensure that these types of issues are  comprehensively identified before the capabilities are deployed. The  current warfighter acceptance process does not produce an integrated,  holistic identification of implementation issues and, as a result, DOD does  not identify and develop a plan to resolve them before BMD capabilities  are deployed. Instead, responsibilities are diffused across several  organizations. For example, U.S. Strategic Command officials view their  role as ensuring that EPAA capabilities function within the BMD system  worldwide, which includes BMD elements that are not among those  dedicated to EPAA. U.S. European Command is responsible for  conducting BMD operations in its area of responsibility. The services  operate individual BMD elements and provide the manpower and training  necessary to do so. Although U.S. Strategic Command considers input  from U.S. European Command and the services when defining  acceptance criteria, the criteria used to-date do not fully assess the extent  to which implementation issues may affect operational performance, for  instance by limiting the available frequencies for radar use in a particular  country or region.

Further, Army guidance,  which is referenced in the annexes, similarly directs the use of business- case analyses as part of selecting the product-support strategy.", "In January 2012, the Army and MDA estimated that the EPAA forward- based radar would cost $61 million in fiscal year 2014 and $1.2 billion in  then-year dollars over its 20-year life. However, this estimate assumes  continued contractor support throughout the life of the forward-based  radar. Even though forward-based radars have been deployed since  2006, DOD has not yet completed a business-case analysis as part of  determining the long-term support as described in an Army regulation and  in the forward-based radar annex, which is to include an assessment of  alternatives to contractor-provided support over the lifetime of this  element. In addition, the Army has made changes to reduce operating  and support costs for the forward-based radar, but these changes are not  reflected in the $1.2 billion lifetime cost estimate previously cited. Army  officials stated that the Army and MDA met in November 2013 to begin  developing the business-case analysis for the radar, which they intend to  complete in fiscal year 2015. However, the annex does not include an  explicit requirement that this analysis be completed by a specific time.  Also, MDA and Army officials said that completion of this analysis to  inform a decision on a long-term support strategy will, in turn, provide  information for updating the operating and support cost estimates for the  forward-based radar.", "In December 2012, the Army and MDA estimated operating and support  costs for six THAAD batteries for 20 years, totaling $6.5 billion in then- year dollars.throughout the life of THAAD. Even though the first two THAAD batteries  have been available since early 2012, DOD has not yet completed a  business-case analysis as part of determining the long-term support  strategy, as provided for in the annex, which is to include an assessment  of alternatives to contractor-provided support over the lifetime of THAAD.  Specifically, MDA conducted an initial THAAD business-case analysis,  which it provided to the Army for comment. The Army did not agree with  the analysis because it was not done in accordance with Army  regulations. As the Army and MDA work through these disagreements,  the THAAD business-case analysis remains incomplete as of December  2013, and there is no firm deadline to complete the analysis. Completion  of this analysis to inform a decision on a long-term support strategy will, in  turn, provide information for updating the operating and support cost  estimates for the THAAD.", "This estimate also assumes continued contractor support  In addition, the estimate of operating and support costs for THAAD  assumed that all six batteries would be located in the United States.  However, DOD officials stated that they are examining options for  forward-stationing some THAAD batteries overseas. Doing so would likely  increase operating and support costs due to higher operational tempo,  contractors that are deployed with the system, additional needed security,  life-support facilities such as barracks and a mess hall, and site  preparation for the equipment. For example, MDA recently estimated that  operating and support costs for one THAAD battery in Guam could be  $11 million higher annually than if the battery was located in the  continental United States. However, this estimate does not include costs  for military personnel, fuel, site activation, transportation, or some  contractor costs. Further, costs could be even higher if an element is  located at an austere location due to additional costs for site preparation,  security, transportation, and some contractor costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Developed a Comprehensive Joint Estimate of Operating and Support Costs for Aegis Ashore", "paragraphs": ["MDA and the Navy have not developed a comprehensive, joint estimate  of the operating and support costs for the two European Aegis Ashore  sites over their expected 25-year life span, and it is unclear when such an  estimate will be completed. The Navy and MDA completed an annex to a  memorandum of agreement in August 2012 describing how they are to  jointly manage Aegis Ashore, which notes that the two organizations will  collaborate on cost estimating and budget planning. Under the annex,  MDA responsibilities include providing funding for construction of certain  mission-essential facilities and the operations and support of aspects of  the Aegis weapon system through fiscal year 2017. The Navy  responsibilities include providing funding for construction and operations  and sustainment of housing and quality-of-life facilities, as well as the  training facility, which is located in the United States. The Navy will be  responsible for all Aegis Ashore operating and support costs at the two  planned sites beginning in fiscal year 2018. Although the Navy and MDA  have agreed to jointly develop cost estimates, and officials from the Navy  and MDA have stated these estimates will focus on operating and support  costs, their August 2012 memorandum of agreement does not include a  clear deadline for first completing a joint cost estimate.

Specifically,  the Navy has estimated $155 million will be required for manning,  operating, and supporting the base facilities from fiscal year 2014 through  fiscal year 2018. MDA has reported in its 2013 Ballistic Missile Defense  System Accountability Report that operating and support costs for the  Aegis Ashore test facility and the two European sites may total $82 million  through fiscal year 2018, but this does not include operating and support  costs for the entire expected 25-year life. In addition, MDA officials stated  that their estimate does not include costs for base facilities, military  personnel, or other Navy costs and, therefore, cautioned against  combining both Navy and MDA\u2019s individual estimates in order to  approximate total Aegis Ashore operating and support costs. By fiscal  year 2018, the Navy will assume responsibility for all operating and  support costs for the Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland.  However, without a comprehensive, joint estimate of the lifetime operating  and support costs for the two Aegis Ashore sites that is updated as key  program decisions are made, it will be difficult for the Navy to develop  accurate budgets for operating and supporting this element of EPAA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More-Comprehensive Cost Estimates Can Aid Budget Development", "paragraphs": ["We and the Office of Management and Budget have reported that cost  estimates are important to support budget development. Specifically, cost  estimates can assist decision makers in budget development and are  necessary for evaluating resource requirements at key decision points  and effectively allocating resources. In addition, Office of Management  and Budget guidance containing principles for capital asset acquisitions  emphasizes that government agencies should understand all costs in  advance of proposing acquisitions in the budget, and notes that agencies  should plan for operations and maintenance of capital assets. Further, it  is important to fully identify operating and support costs since these costs  can be up to 70 percent of a weapon system\u2019s lifetime costs. Major  defense acquisition programs within DOD generally follow an acquisition  process that includes steps in which cost estimates are developed,  including operating and support costs. Due to the acquisition flexibilities  MDA has been granted, application of this process has been deferred and  MDA follows a separate process for development and acquisition.  Nonetheless, DOD has not required completed operating and support  cost estimates prior to introducing BMD capabilities in Europe.

By not fully  identifying and planning to resolve implementation issues in its  acceptance process to-date, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. European  Command, and the services have had to rush to secure and emplace the  resources needed to support the capabilities it has already deployed.  Without identifying the resources, implementing arrangements,  infrastructure, and other items that need to be in place before deploying  additional EPAA capabilities, DOD may continue to face challenges in  operating BMD elements as it moves forward with the future phases of  EPAA. In addition, if DOD does not also take action to identify and plan to  resolve these types of implementation issues for all current and future  BMD capabilities that could support BMD operations in Europe, DOD is  likely to experience additional implementation challenges.", "Similarly, the department\u2019s commitment to EPAA implementation has  proceeded without a full understanding of the related long-term operating  and support costs, thereby lessening assurance of the approach\u2019s  sustainability through all phases. Although the services and MDA have  begun to estimate operating and support costs, there are no firm  deadlines for completing and revising estimates as the programs mature  and key decisions are made, such as completing business-case analyses  to support decisions on long-term support strategies or where the BMD  capabilities may be forward-stationed. Making such decisions and  updating the estimates accordingly would enable the services and MDA  to more-accurately develop budgets for their respective share of the  costs.

Also, DOD completed a security review of this report and determined that  its contents were unclassified and contained no sensitive information.  DOD and the Department of State provided technical comments, which  we incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD partially agreed with our recommendation that U.S. Strategic  Command, in consultation with U.S. European Command and the  services, identify and develop a plan to resolve implementation issues  prior to deploying and operating future BMD capabilities in Europe. In its  comments, DOD stated that U.S. Strategic Command does not have the  authority or mission to resolve implementation issues, but the services  and MDA will work to identify and resolve implementation issues for future  BMD capabilities in Europe. DOD further stated that U.S. Strategic  Command will also work in consultation with U.S. European Command  and the services to resolve integrated air and missile defense  requirements and warfighter acceptance criteria, validate element  performance and system integration, and advise cross global combatant  command capability optimization/sharing as part of its global missile  defense role. We understand that U.S. Strategic Command may not have  the authority to directly resolve all implementation issues. However, it  does have a role in integrating capabilities across combatant commands,  as we discuss in this report.", "In addition, our recommendation does not state that U.S. Strategic  Command should resolve all implementation issues prior to deploying  capabilities, but rather that it identify and develop a plan to resolve  implementation issues prior to deployment and to do so in consultation  with U.S. European Command and the services. As we note in the report,  the acceptance criteria used to-date focuses on effectiveness, suitability,  and interoperability; however, the manual describing the acceptance  process indicates that prerequisites for credibly assessing operational  suitability include assessing whether such things as organization, training,  or facilities are defined and in place for BMD elements. While it may be  appropriate for U.S. European Command and/or the services to take the  lead in resolving some implementation issues, such as ensuring proper  infrastructure is in place, U.S. Strategic Command, in its advocacy and  integration roles, can help in identifying and planning to resolve some  issues, such as advising cross-combatant command capability sharing.  Further, U.S. Strategic Command\u2019s warfighter acceptance process is the  only existing high-level forum where all key BMD stakeholders come  together to assess operational utility of BMD elements. Therefore, we  believe that U.S. Strategic Command, in conjunction with U.S. European  Command and the services, can use its position as the warfighter  advocate to elevate implementation issues, such as cross-combatant  command capability sharing and system integration, to ensure that such  issues are identified and that a plan to resolve them is developed.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation to require and set a deadline for  completing a business-case analysis for the forward-based radar to  support a decision on the long-term support strategy, and updating the  joint MDA and Army estimate for long-term operating and support costs  after a decision on the support strategy is made. DOD stated that the  business-case analysis will be delivered in late fiscal year 2015 and that  the joint cost estimate is updated biennially. The department further  stated that if the business-case analysis results substantially change the  underlying assumptions of the joint cost estimate, an out-of-cycle joint  cost estimate would be conducted. Establishing a target date for  completing the business-case analysis is a positive first step, and we  believe that DOD needs to be vigilant to ensure that the late fiscal year  2015 date is met in order to be fully responsive to the intent of our  recommendation. Doing so will enable DOD to update operating and  support cost estimates, which, in turn, can improve budget development.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation to require and set a deadline for  completing a business-case analysis for THAAD to support a decision on  the long-term support strategy, and update the joint MDA and Army  estimate for long-term operating and support costs after this and other  key program decisions, such as where the THAAD batteries are likely to  be forward-stationed, are made. DOD stated that THAAD is a \u201csurge  support\u201d asset for EPAA with no specifically assigned area of  responsibility, battery quantities, or locations. DOD further stated that  MDA and the Army will support the decision to deploy THAAD assets and  any related business-case analysis for projected sites. According to an  Army official, conducting a business-case analysis to assess a weapon  system\u2019s lifetime support strategy and making stationing decisions are  two separate, independent decisions although both affect operating and  support costs. In other words, a business-case analysis can be completed  and a support strategy decided upon without a decision on where the  weapon system may be located. The purpose of a business-case analysis  is to identify the optimum support concept at the lowest life-cycle cost,  and DOD had previously planned to complete a business-case analysis  for THAAD by late 2011. We recognized in this report that THAAD could  deploy to support EPAA as needed and that options are being examined  for forward-stationing some THAAD batteries overseas. We also noted  that operating and support costs can account for up to 70 percent of a  weapon system\u2019s lifetime costs and that these costs are generally higher  when a system is stationed overseas. Given that decision makers need to  understand and therefore adequately budget for THAAD operating and  support costs, we believe it is important for DOD to set a deadline for  completing the business-case analysis to support a decision on the long- term support strategy and update the joint estimate of lifetime operating  and support costs accordingly.

This document describes the  goal of the warfighter acceptance process, which is, in essence, to ensure  that capabilities can be used as intended when they are delivered, and  culminates in formal acceptance of BMD capabilities by U.S. Strategic  Command. We also reviewed key documents, such as the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3295.01, Policy Guidance for Ballistic  Missile Defense Operations, and the Joint Staff Publication 3-01,  Countering Air and Missile Threats, which describe DOD\u2019s BMD guidance  and responsibilities of various organizations, and U.S. Strategic  Command\u2019s June 2013 Instruction 538-03 on Integrated Air and Missile  Defense (IAMD) Warfighter Involvement Process (WIP).

We identified and reviewed  documents containing best practices for determining high-quality cost  estimates from the Office of Management and Budget and the GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide, which indicate that estimating long- term operations and support costs assists in budget development and the  allocation of resources. In addition, we reviewed the Army\u2019s regulation on  Integrated Logistic Support, which includes guidance on business-case  analysis and is referenced in the agreement annexes between MDA and  the Army to identify DOD criteria for conducting business-case analyses  to assess alternatives for providing long-term support. We then reviewed  documentation of estimates developed by MDA and the services for the  BMD elements that are part of EPAA or could be deployed to support  EPAA, which include Aegis Ashore, forward-based Army  Navy/Transportable Radar, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  (THAAD), Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications,  Patriot, and Aegis BMD-capable ships. We focused our assessment on  the first three elements, because the services and MDA are sharing the  operating and support costs for these elements. We assessed the  documentation of the Army and MDA December 2012 joint estimate of  operating and support costs for THAAD and the January 2012 joint  estimate of operating and support costs for the forward-based Army  Navy/Transportable Radar.

For Aegis Ashore, we confirmed with  MDA and Navy officials that the two organizations had not yet jointly  developed a comprehensive, long-term estimate. We did, however,  assess Navy and MDA documentation of some Aegis Ashore costs that  each organization expects to fund over the next 5 years. We did not  evaluate the quality of the estimates in this review since we reported in  2011 that six of MDA\u2019s life-cycle cost estimates did not meet the  characteristics of a high-quality cost estimate.
