To support the investment needed to close the IT center, the process requires--and USPS prepared--analyses based on prevailing economic and other conditions. However, these conditions have changed since USPS prepared the analyses in 2000. In 2001, USPS announced plans to automate and reengineer its field accounting activity, which will result in USPS closing its 85 district accounting offices and consolidating the residual activities into its 3 Accounting Service Centers. USPS has not updated its analyses to reflect the changed conditions, but said that it planned to do so. San Mateo IT employees anticipate mostly negative social impacts if they relocate and mostly negative economic impacts if they stay in the Bay Area. Of the 213 San Mateo IT employees who responded to our survey, 36 (17 percent) indicated they would likely relocate, although most would be offered jobs at other postal IT centers. In 2000, USPS' economic analyses included an assumption--and San Mateo IT employees believed--that local jobs would be available for those individuals who did not want to relocate. However, local postal jobs are no longer available, and nonpostal IT job opportunities have tightened considerably in the Bay Area. GAO has previously noted that progressive organizations that are restructuring often provide job placement assistance to employees faced with losing their jobs. USPS plans to offer job assistance to management employees seeking nonpostal jobs. However, USPS does not plan to offer job assistance to union employees because such assistance is not covered by their collective bargaining agreement. Because the employment outlook in the Bay Area has changed dramatically, union employees who decide not to relocate may encounter difficulty finding employment in the Bay Area."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request for information about the U.S. Postal  Service\u2019s Department of Information Technology (IT Department)  proposal to close its San Mateo, California, Information Service Center,  including the social and economic impacts that the closure would have on  affected postal employees and their families.

During the 1980s, the  Service expanded its IT technology network to cover essentially all facets  of postal operations. However, as networking technology improved, the  Service realized that it no longer needed to colocate some of its IT  functions with the hardware processors. This presented the Service with  the opportunity to reduce costs and improve efficiencies by consolidating  some of its IT functions. The practice of consolidating IT functions is  consistent with industry trends, as companies strive to utilize new  technologies to improve operations at less cost.", "Before 1993, the Service had six computer centers, each with a mainframe  computer, located in New York City, New York; St. Louis, Missouri;  Raleigh, North Carolina; Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; San Mateo,  California; and Minneapolis, Minneapolis. In 1993, the Service closed its IT  center located in New York and transferred all functions performed at the  center to its postal IT centers located in San Mateo and Eagan. Some  employees affected by the New York IT Center closure relocated to San  Mateo and now face the prospects of being affected by yet another postal  IT center closure.

The Integrated Business Systems Solutions  Centers maintain and enhance software applications for postal business  systems. The Management Support Service Centers provide facility  support to the other centers.

The Accounting Service Centers are not included as part of the IT  Department\u2019s proposed consolidation of the San Mateo IT Center.", "Figure 1 shows the San Mateo IT Center, which is located at 2700 Campus  Drive, San Mateo, CA, in the Bay Area. The building is a three-story  structure plus a basement, contains approximately 160,000 square feet of  space, and is located on 12.4 acres. The building was constructed in 1976  and was purchased by the Service in 1983 for about $13 million. After  purchasing the building, the Service spent an additional $14 million on  renovations, and during the last 10 years has spent an additional $3.7  million on major upgrades.", "The consolidation plan currently under consideration provides that San  Mateo\u2019s computer operations, management support functions, and some of  its software functions would be transferred to Eagan, along with some  employees.

If this authority is granted, the Service plans to make the  option of voluntary early retirement available to all eligible employees.

While the Service recently developed a  transformation plan to address its financial difficulties and has been able  to cut costs, it has a significant amount of fixed costs due to its vast  infrastructure that are difficult to cut in the short term. Rationalizing the  Service\u2019s infrastructure will be key as it strives to ameliorate its fiscal  situation. This means that the Service may have to close or consolidate  certain retail, mail processing, and administrative facilities if necessary to  cut costs and improve performance.

The IT  Department\u2019s proposal to close the San Mateo IT Center was based on  several major economic assumptions that have since changed. First, when  the IT Department prepared the San Mateo DAR, it noted that the job  market in the Bay Area was very good and that employees with IT skills  were in great demand, thereby making it difficult to recruit and retain IT  employees at the San Mateo IT Center. Since then, however, the general  job market has declined significantly. For example, in the Bay Area, from  2000 to 2002, the unemployment rate increased from 2.2 percent to 5.4  percent. Even more dramatic was the reversal in employment growth.  From 1999 to 2000, the number of Bay Area employees grew by 3.8  percent. In contrast, the number of these employees contracted by 5.9  percent from 2000 to 2002. Given the increase in unemployment and the  shrinking employment growth in the Bay Area, current IT labor costs may  not be as high as they were in 2000, thereby creating a more favorable  recruiting environment for the Service.", "Second, the IT Department received an appraisal in 2000, indicating that it  could reasonably expect to sell its San Mateo facility within 6 months for a  minimum price of $49 million. However, according to real estate experts,  office-building values in the San Mateo area are currently depressed. From  the 4th quarter of 2000 to the 2nd quarter of 2002, average asking rents fell  by about 60 percent, and office vacancy rates increased nearly sixfold,  from less than 4 percent to 22 percent. As a result of this depressed real  estate market, the time and value estimates that the IT Department  received in 2000 for the San Mateo facility may be out of date.", "In view of what might be significant changes in some of the economic  assumptions used in the San Mateo DAR, we asked the Service about  updating (1) the estimate of the fair-market value of the San Mateo  building and property and (2) the estimate of rental rates for office space  in the Bay Area. The Service said that it was too costly to have a  commercial real estate broker update this information before the Service  was ready to make a decision about closing the San Mateo IT Center.  However, the Service acknowledged that the commercial office market in  the Bay Area has changed since the DAR was prepared in 2000. Postal  officials said that the key assumptions used in preparing the DAR would  be updated before the Service makes a decision about closing the San  Mateo IT Center. Until these data are updated, it is uncertain how much  the Service would save by closing the San Mateo IT Center.", "Another significant change indicating the need to update the San Mateo  DAR is the Service\u2019s plans to revamp its accounting functions. In 2001, the  Service announced plans to automate and reengineer its field accounting  activity. These changes will result in the Service closing its 85 district  accounting offices; eliminating 1,063 field accounting technicians in these  offices; and consolidating the residual activities into its 3 Accounting  Service Centers located in Eagan, St. Louis, and San Mateo. Postal officials  stated that this would result in about 350 more accounting technician and  finance positions at these 3 centers. As noted earlier, the San Mateo DAR  includes a plan to move the accounting functions and its 102 employees  into leased space in the Bay Area. The DAR included $2.1 million as the 3- year estimated cost for this leased space. As a result of the planned  consolidation of district accounting functions, the Service\u2019s estimated cost  of leased space may no longer be accurate for its accounting functions in  the Bay Area and could affect projected savings associated with closing  the San Mateo IT Center. Given this possibility, before the Service makes  its decision about closing the San Mateo IT Center, the DAR may also need  to be reviewed and updated, if appropriate, to reflect the cost associated  with obtaining the leased space necessary to accommodate about 40  additional accounting technician and finance positions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Relocation Experts Report that Negative Economic and Social Impacts Generally Accompany Plant and Facility Closures", "paragraphs": ["Relocation experts we interviewed reported that plant and facility closings  generally have negative economic and social impacts on displaced  employees and their families.

Research  indicates that in over 50 percent of married households, both spouses are  employed. This prevalence of dual-income households in the workforce is  prompting companies to provide employment assistance to trailing  spouses in order to reduce family stress during relocation transitions,  according to studies and experts. For example, employers assist trailing  spouses in a variety of ways, including paying a job-finders fee, assisting  with finding employment either within or outside the company, and  reimbursing the spouse for lost income while seeking employment at the  new location. Examples of other types of assistance provided trailing  spouses include resume preparation and review, development of job  search strategies, and career counseling.

He stated that the only option the Service offered him besides  relocating to another postal IT center was to remain in the New York City  area as a mail clerk or letter carrier with temporary saved-pay. Another  respondent who relocated also stated that she didn\u2019t believe she had any  other viable choice besides relocating. She stated that she was too old to  look for a nonpostal job and didn\u2019t believe she could afford to remain with  the Service in the New York City area in a non-IT position and take a  reduction in pay when her saved pay expired. As previously noted, our  analysis of the Service\u2019s salary data for displaced New York IT Center  employees confirmed that employees who relocated generally fared better  economically than those who remained in the New York City area.", "Twenty-two of the 49 relocated survey respondents also reported that in  deciding to relocate, they had considered it very important that they keep  their IT jobs for career advancement purposes. Twenty respondents also  reported that they had been very concerned that as older workers, they  would have found it very difficult to find satisfactory jobs if they had not  relocated to other postal IT centers and kept their IT jobs. A respondent  who relocated to another postal IT center stated that he had no other  choice but to relocate if he wanted to continue working with the Service in  an IT position.", "Most of the 49 survey respondents who relocated to postal IT centers in  other geographic areas tended to have fewer years of service than the 46  respondents who remained in the New York City area.

Further, the respondents were  concerned that because of the tight job market in the technology sector,  they might be unable to find nonpostal IT jobs in the Bay Area. Of the 167  respondents, 140 (84 percent) anticipated difficulty finding jobs to  adequately support their families. Finally, respondents said they were  concerned that if they could not find satisfactory jobs with the Postal  Service or the federal government, they would lose their ties to the federal  retirement and health care systems.

Three-fourths of  the respondents planning to stay are over 45 years old; have lived in the  Bay Area for more than 20 years; and indicated that they have extensive  family ties, social ties, and other responsibilities in the area. These older  respondents also typically have working spouses who are reluctant to  leave their jobs and lose their pension benefits.

Conversely, EAS employees are not guaranteed jobs, and  some San Mateo EAS employees will likely not have the option of  relocating and continuing employment with the Service. According to the  Service, the option to relocate will likely be extended to about half of the  EAS employees. One respondent who was an EAS employee, age 49 with  15 years of service, commented that not having the assurance of being able  to relocate to another postal IT center has increased his anxiety about the  potential closure. He reported that he is not eligible for retirement and  doubts that he will be offered other employment with the Service. He  indicated that he essentially has no option but to find a nonpostal job  because he is the primary breadwinner and has many years to go on his  mortgage payments. He indicated that the Service will pay him severance  pay equal to 4 or 5 months\u2019 salary, but he anticipates much difficulty  finding another IT job in the Bay Area because of the tight labor market  for technology positions.", "The majority of the 167 San Mateo respondents who anticipate staying in  the Bay Area reported that they will likely seek whatever postal  employment that may be available in the Bay Area, although many  indicated in their narrative responses that such job prospects do not look  good.

(See fig. 4 for details.)", "San Mateo respondents indicating that they would likely seek other  employment in the Bay Area were skeptical about finding such  employment. According to postal officials, finding other postal  employment is unlikely because of Servicewide downsizing. Some  respondents thought they might qualify for other postal management or  administrative positions, but they were not optimistic about the  availability of such positions. Both EAS and bargaining unit respondents  seeking nonpostal employment anticipated difficulties because of the  current slump in IT employment and the added difficulty faced by older  workers in finding new employment. Additionally, those anticipating  seeking new employment were concerned that their earnings would likely  be less and that they would lose current health and retirement benefits.", "Some San Mateo respondents indicated they would be willing to take a  non-IT job if it would mean continued employment with the Service in the  Bay Area. For example, one younger respondent said she would be willing  to transfer from her computer programmer/analyst job to other kinds of  postal work in order to stay in the Bay Area because both her and her  husband\u2019s families live nearby, her mother cares for her baby while she is  at work, and her husband\u2019s parents are in frail health and need constant  assistance. Other respondents indicated they wanted to stay in the Bay  Area but did not want to take a non-IT job.

For example, eight  respondents reported having a trailing spouse who would be looking for  employment after relocation, and seven of those thought employment  would be difficult for their spouses to find. One respondent commented  that relocating her spouse would be a major problem because her husband  is a journalist and has already learned that prospects for such jobs at the  new location are poor.

Of 25  organizations we surveyed for our 1995 report on job loss issues, 23 had  devised programs to help employees who lost their jobs. These programs  included job placement assistance, employee and family counseling,  relocation assistance, and training. Some of the organizations surveyed  provided self-administered job placement assistance while others used  outside job assistance companies. Also, we have previously reported that  the Department of Defense was very successful in minimizing the impacts  of maintenance depot closures on employees, primarily through a  comprehensive outplacement effort.", "Our prior work on job loss issues further showed that, in general,  organizations that offer job placement assistance to displaced employees  also benefit. Providing job placement assistance helped sponsoring  organizations (1) avoid lawsuits by displaced employees, (2) reduce  unemployment costs, and (3) enhance their reputations in the community  by demonstrating that they cared about their employees. Similar to other  organizations that have helped displaced employees, the Service has  indicated that it plans to provide assistance to San Mateo IT Center  employees to minimize the impact, if it decides to close the center. In  addition to providing the relocation and separation benefits mentioned  earlier, the Service has indicated that it plans to hold a series of meetings  with affected San Mateo employees and their families to provide them  with needed information on available options and opportunities and to  address employees\u2019 questions about the closure. Additionally, as noted  earlier, the Service plans to provide the services of a job search firm to San  Mateo EAS employees, although bargaining unit employees will not  receive similar services because such services are not provided for by the  collective bargaining agreement that governs IT bargaining unit  employees\u2019 benefits.

Our survey of San Mateo employees, however,  indicates that the IT Department\u2019s estimate of relocating employees may  be overstated; and its need for contractor support could, therefore, be  greater than planned. According to our survey results, only 17 percent of  San Mateo employees currently anticipate that they would likely relocate  to another postal IT center if the Service closes the San Mateo IT Center.  Fifty-nine percent of the respondents (who indicated they would likely  stay in the Bay Area and provided reasons for not relocating) identified  concerns with their spouses\u2019 careers as a primary motivator in their  decision not to relocate. Further, seven of the eight respondents relocating  with trailing spouses who would be looking for jobs at the new location  expressed concern that the spouses would have difficulty finding suitable  employment.", "Relocation experts have noted that because of the prevalence of dual- income households in the workforce, employees who must make a  relocation choice often base their decision on whether or not their trailing  spouses can find suitable employment at the new location. Given this,  relocation experts report more companies are providing employment  assistance to trailing spouses, such as resume preparation and review,  paying job finders-fees, assisting with finding employment, and  reimbursing trailing spouses for lost income while they seek employment  at the new location.", "When the IT Department first proposed closing the San Mateo IT Center in  2000, economic conditions and the employment outlook in the Bay Area  were noticeably better than they are today; so much so that the Service  anticipated that postal positions would be available in the Bay Area for  many displaced employees who did not relocate. However, because of  changed economic conditions, recent drops in mail volumes, and advances  in automated mail processing, the Service no longer expects that it will  have job openings to accommodate employees who do not relocate. As  noted earlier, although the Service has indicated that it plans to make the  services of a private job search firm available to San Mateo EAS  employees, the Service has no plans at this time to extend similar services  to San Mateo IT Center bargaining unit employees because their benefits  are governed by the Service\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the  APWU. Consequently, many bargaining unit employees will face a dilemma  if the Service closes the San Mateo IT Center. If bargaining unit employees  do not relocate, they will likely lose their postal employment and would  not have the services of a private job search firm to help them find other  employment. Additionally, bargaining unit and EAS employees with  working spouses who are not postal employees face a dilemma concerning  the impact a relocation would have on their trailing spouses\u2019 careers and  their families\u2019 household incomes. That is, if these employees relocate, will  their trailing spouses be able to find suitable employment at the new  location or will household incomes and spouses\u2019 careers suffer?", "By not addressing employees\u2019 concerns about trailing spouses, the Service  may be missing an opportunity to entice more of its San Mateo IT Center  employees to relocate to other postal IT centers, thereby exposing itself to  higher than necessary contractor costs. If the Service decides to close the  San Mateo IT Center, it is required under its agreement with APWU to  notify the union of its decision and offer to meet with national level  officials to discuss the closure\u2019s impact on affected employees.  Historically, discussions preceding previous closures have resulted in  additional provisions for affected bargaining unit employees, which were  specified in Memorandums of Understanding that modified existing  collective bargaining agreements.

For example, all displaced New  York IT Center employees had the option of relocating with their jobs to  another postal IT center or continuing to work for the Service in the same  geographic area (though not necessarily in an IT position), whereas San  Mateo IT Center employees likely will not have this option. Table 2  displays the range of options/opportunities likely to be available to San  Mateo IT Center employees and options/opportunities that were available  to displaced New York IT Center employees. Options/opportunities are  similar for early retirements, assistance programs to help EAS employees  find employment outside the Service, and help for trailing spouses who are  postal employees and need to find suitable employment at the new  location. Options/opportunities are not similar with regard to buy-outs,  ability to continue employment with the Service in some capacity, saved- pay protections, and the availability of local postal and nonpostal jobs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Postal Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
