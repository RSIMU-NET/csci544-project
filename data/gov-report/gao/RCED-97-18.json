In fiscal year 1995, DOE had contract obligations of $17.5 billion, or about 91 percent of the Department\u2019s total fiscal year 1995 obligations. Its contracting practices are rooted in the development of the atomic bomb under the Manhattan Project during World War II. This Project was a unique undertaking to produce atomic capability under emergency conditions and under circumstances of utmost urgency, extreme risk, and unprecedented security. Special contracting arrangements were developed by DOE\u2019s predecessor agencies with participating industry and academic organizations, including the government\u2019s agreement, with few exceptions, to fully reimburse all of the contractors\u2019 costs and completely indemnify contractors against any liability incurred from their involvement on the project.", "From these roots, DOE\u2019s contracting took two separate paths\u2014(1) the path for management and operating (M&O) contracts, the direct descendants of the Manhattan Project, under which several current contracts were originally awarded during World War II and (2) the path for non-M&O contracts. The M&O contracts, which accounted for 82 percent ($14.3 billion) of DOE\u2019s fiscal year 1995 contract obligations, have been governed in key procurement areas by DOE\u2019s own unique procurement regulations. M&O contracts are for the operation, maintenance, or support of government-owned research, development, production, or testing facilities, both nuclear and nonnuclear. The non-M&O contracts, which account for the remaining 18 percent ($3.2 billion) are governed by the governmentwide Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). As a result of the two different paths, these contracts have distinct differences. For example, noncompetitive procurement has been the normal practice for M&O contracts, while competitive contracting has been the norm for non-M&O contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Designated DOE\u2019s Contract Management as an Area of High Risk", "paragraphs": ["In early 1990, we designated DOE\u2019s contract management as one of 16 high-risk areas in the federal government warranting close attention over a period of several years.

To find solutions to its contracting problems, the Secretary announced the creation of a Contract Reform Team, chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Energy, to do a \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d review of DOE\u2019s contracting mechanisms and practices. In February 1994, the Contract Reform Team published its report, Making Contracting Work Better and Cost Less. In the report, the Reform Team focused its efforts on M&O contracting and identified a number of problems that needed correction, including the following:", "Loose accountability for contractors\u2019 performance and few controls to ensure that funds are spent on the highest priorities.", "Few controls over contractors\u2019 costs.", "Fees that did not properly reflect the quality of the contractor\u2019s performance.

The Secretary subsequently added another recommendation to the Reform Team\u2019s list regarding diversity among participating contractors and subcontractors. These 48 recommendations included requirements to develop items, such as policy, guidance, and plans to correct identified problems.

We then analyzed the information provided by DOE to determine if the new decisions reflected an increase in competition from past procurements.

The Reform Team further recommended that contractors be provided with incentives to encourage the contractors to subcontract these services. However, DOE\u2019s proposed regulation, published in the Federal Register in June 1996, did not include provisions for the incentives that were recommended by the Reform Team. According to Project Office officials, the incentives were unnecessary because the proposed regulation would require contractors to subcontract for these services where appropriate. However, the Project Office officials stated that several DOE field offices are currently providing their contractors with incentives to subcontract these services.", "Furthermore, in an effort to implement performance-based contracting methods for support service contracts, the Reform Team recommended that DOE develop a plan for converting cost-reimbursement support service contracts to performance-based contracts, when applicable. Although DOE provided illustrations of potential application of performance-based methods to support services and identified specific program and field offices that are now planning to convert some of their support service requirements to performance-based support, DOE did not develop an actual plan with targets and milestones for converting these possible support services as required by the Reform Team.", "Project Office officials and program office officials who were assigned to develop actions in response to recommendations stated that while actions may not have strictly adhered to the requirements of the Reform Team\u2019s report, these actions, nevertheless, achieved their intended goals. For example, the Reform Team recommended that DOE reduce its current audit backlog in order to improve the ability of DOE managers to administer financial operations. In doing so, the Reform Team advised DOE to identify ways to provide the Defense Contract Audit Agency with sufficient funding to permit additional resources to be assigned to DOE\u2019s non-M&O contracts. Before providing the Defense Contract Audit Agency with funds, however, the Reform Team recommended that the costs and benefits of obtaining such additional resources as well as any plausible alternatives be assessed. In response, DOE provided the Defense Contract Audit Agency with funding in fiscal year 1995 to reduce DOE\u2019s current audit backlog with plans to continue funding until the current backlog is eliminated.

Moreover, Project Office officials said that a considerable amount of time was consumed in an attempt to achieve greater participation from departmental organizations in reviewing and commenting on actions. Delays were also encountered in the assigning of actions to specific departmental organizations. For example, Project Office officials mentioned that the Office of Procurement and Assistance Management opposed being assigned responsibility for six action items because these actions were inherently field related, which the officials believed, could best be handled by the Office of the Associate Deputy Secretary for Field Management. Project Office officials further pointed out that the reform actions were done by staff on a part-time basis because the reform action work was in addition to their normal duties.

These problems must be identified and corrected during implementation for contract reform to succeed. For this reason, we believe it is vital for the continued monitoring of contract reform implementation by the Secretary of Energy and other top DOE officials.

Of the 24 decisions made between July 1994 and August 1996, DOE decided to extend 16 on a noncompetitive basis while competitively awarding 8.

Although the act requires full and open competition, it provides seven exceptions to full and open competition that can permit noncompetitive procurement. One exception that DOE could use to justify noncompetitive procurements for many of its M&O contracts is the exception that authorizes noncompetitive procurements to maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by a federally funded research and development center. Although this exception is available to DOE, in the past, DOE has successfully awarded M&O contracts competitively to operate its research centers at the Sandia National Laboratory and the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. Additionally, within the last few months, DOE has decided to competitively award the future contract for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2014another research center. We believe that DOE should continue its efforts to competitively award its research centers whenever feasible.", "In the event that DOE does need to use this exception to justify a noncompetitive procurement, we believe that, whenever feasible, DOE should use noncompetitive procedures only after segregating the research work from other activities of its M&O contractors. For example, in 1995, we reported that about 50 percent of the funds spent by M&O contractors in fiscal year 1994 under 19 contracts for research centers was for research and development activities. The remaining funds were spent on such things as the environmental restoration of facilities contaminated with hazardous and nuclear waste. Thus, about 50 percent of the M&O contractors\u2019 funds were not directly associated with research activities. DOE could maximize its competitive awards by separating the nonresearch work from that of the research center and competitively awarding the nonresearch work.", "We discussed the new competition policy and its potential use in regard to the research centers with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement and Assistance Management, the Director of the Contract Reform Project Office, and the Deputy Associate Deputy Secretary for Field Management. They told us that DOE shares our concern about the granting of exceptions from competition for all of the work done at research facilities.

While DOE was incorporating performance goals in its new contracts, it also was working on its strategic planning initiative. During its strategic planning efforts, DOE developed a strategic plan that includes performance goals to be achieved and performance indicators to determine if the goals were achieved. Considering that DOE\u2019s M&O contractors were provided with about 74 percent of DOE\u2019s total fiscal year 1995 obligations, it is clear that DOE cannot fulfill its strategic goals without directing the work of its M&O contractors.

Specifically, by September 30, 1997, they will be required to prepare a strategic plan covering at least a 5-year period that describes, among other things, (1) general goals and objectives for the major functions and operations of the agency, (2) how the agency intends to achieve these goals and objectives, and (3) how the goals of the strategic plan are related to those to be used in annual performance plans. In later years, agencies will be required to prepare annual performance plans with goals that are related to those of the strategic plans and program evaluation reports that show the success at accomplishing their goals.

The plan identifies five programmatic business lines and four critical success factors. The plan includes performance goals and indicators to determine if the goals for the business lines and success factors have been achieved.
