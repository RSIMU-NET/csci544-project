This measure is widely used as an indicator of the economic well-being of the population, for analysis of government policies, and in allocating benefits in social welfare programs, but it has not changed significantly since 1965. Over the past 2 decades, researchers have questioned the accuracy of its measurement of family resources for this purpose, as well as the appropriateness of the level of income used to define poverty. Two years ago, the National Academy of Science\u2019s National Research Council (NRC) Panel on Poverty and Family Assistance issued a report, Measuring Poverty: A New Approach (1995), recommending a thorough review and updating of the definition of family income and its standard for comparison.", "This letter responds to a request from your office that we describe various issues involved in updating the federal government\u2019s measure of poverty. As agreed with your office, in this report we identify (1) the issues associated with measuring a family\u2019s economic well-being and setting a standard below which families are considered poor, (2) the suggestions experts have for addressing these issues, and (3) recent developments on these issues since the NRC panel issued its report in 1995. To do this work, we reviewed the panel\u2019s report and recommendations and literature published since 1995, and we interviewed selected experts in the areas of poverty measurement and government statistics. These experts included 4 academic researchers, 3 of whom were members of the panel; the panel\u2019s study director; and 10 federal government officials who were either involved in the production of poverty statistics or were consumers of those statistics. As agreed with your office, we did not independently analyze the various technical approaches discussed, but, instead, are summarizing expert opinion on these issues. Previously, you asked for information about an experimental measure suggested as a replacement for the current measure, which uses the amount a family spends on goods and services, rather than its income, as the measure of a family\u2019s well-being.

It can be defined as deprivation experienced in material terms, such as hunger or poor housing quality; in economic terms, such as inadequate income; or in social terms, such as isolation from the community or feelings of low self-esteem. In U.S. government statistics, poverty is defined as economic deprivation\u2014that is, lacking the economic resources to meet basic needs\u2014which can put families at high risk of material deprivation. Although some might prefer to directly measure a family\u2019s level of material deprivation, this is impractical for an annual statistic because it is difficult to objectively assess the quality of a family\u2019s standard of living and then to combine measures for various basic needs (such as food, shelter, and clothing) into a single indicator that can be readily analyzed.", "In 1969, the federal government officially adopted a poverty measure to determine how many people across the country had incomes that were inadequate to meet expenses for basic needs. The official measure determines a family\u2019s poverty status by comparing its resources, defined as before-tax money income, with a standard income level, or \u201cthreshold,\u201d designated for that family\u2019s size and composition. Information on income received in the previous calendar year is collected from households by the Bureau of the Census using the March Income Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is jointly sponsored by the Bureau of the Census and BLS. Poverty statistics are published each year that allow comparisons of economic well-being across families, population groups, and regions and over time.", "Thresholds for families of different size and composition were initially defined as three times the cost of a minimum diet for a family of that size. This approach was based on the finding of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) 1955 Household Food Consumption Survey that, on average, families of three or more persons spent one-third of their income on food. Costs of a minimum diet for various family sizes were calculated from USDA\u2019s Economy Food Plan, the least costly food plan designed by USDA. Since then, the poverty thresholds, of which there are currently 48, have been updated annually, to adjust for price inflation nationwide using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In 1995\u2014the year of the most recent update\u2014a family of four with cash income of less than $15,569 was considered to be living in poverty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criticisms of the Poverty Measure", "paragraphs": ["The problems in the official measure of poverty are well documented. The value of the resources a family receives from noncash government assistance programs like the Food Stamp Program was never included in the formal definition of income, in part because the poverty measure was developed before the advent of such programs. In considering the 1981 Commerce Department appropriations, the Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the official poverty statistics for ignoring the \u201cbillions of dollars of Government in-kind benefits, such as food stamps, housing subsidies and medical care.\u201d In the conference committee report, the House and Senate conferees urged the Secretary of Commerce to \u201ccontinue research and testing of techniques for assigning monetary values to in-kind benefits, and for calculating the impact of such benefits on income and poverty estimates.\u201d In the early 1980s, the Bureau of the Census embarked upon research programs to examine the effects of both government in-kind (noncash) benefits and taxes on poverty and other measures of income distribution and has published the results since 1982.", "A 1990 review of concepts and approaches to measuring poverty concluded that although the official poverty thresholds \u201crepresented a reasonable approach, given existing data, . . . in the 1960s, the rather minimal consumption data on which they were based became outdated long ago.\u201d For example, recent surveys find that food now represents about one-seventh rather than one-third of average family expenditures. In addition, the report noted that the methods used to update thresholds over time and to adjust for differences in family size and type were questionable and sometimes inconsistent.", "In 1995, NRC\u2019s Panel on Poverty and Family Assistance published an in-depth review of the U.S. poverty measure addressing concepts, measurement methods, and information needs. In addition to reviewing the literature and numerous experts\u2019 views, with help from federal agencies, the panel conducted data analyses to assess the effects of its recommended poverty concept and alternative measures on the numbers and characteristics of persons in poverty. It concluded that the official measure of poverty required revision and recommended that OMB adopt a revised measure. Specifically, the panel recommended that new thresholds be developed using actual consumer expenditure data to represent a budget for basic needs and adjusting that budget to reflect the needs of different family types and geographic differences in housing costs. It recommended that family resources be redefined as the sum of money income and near-money benefits, minus necessary expenses (such as taxes), and thus the net amount available to buy the goods and services in that poverty budget. (App. I reproduces the panel\u2019s recommendations in their entirety, including some issues not discussed in this report.)", "More recently, a researcher criticized the reliance of the official poverty measure on reported income, pointing out that some families are misidentified as poor because they can increase their purchasing power by either taking out loans or drawing on their savings to avoid material deprivation. He and others have suggested that a family\u2019s economic well-being is more appropriately assessed with a measure of what it spends on goods and services than with a measure of its income."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues in Assessing a Family\u2019s Economic Well-Being", "paragraphs": ["In developing, as well as evaluating, a poverty measure, certain assumptions and choices must be made as one addresses two fundamental decisions: first, how to define a family\u2019s resources and, second, how to select a threshold, or standard, to represent a \u201cminimally adequate standard of living.\u201d While the two decisions are distinct, the two definitions must be consonant with each other so that the eventual comparison of a family\u2019s resources with a standard is considered fair. For example, if government medical benefits are considered as part of a family\u2019s resources, then need for medical care should be considered in defining the threshold. Although many technical choices must be made in developing a valid and practical measure of family economic well-being for the purposes of determining poverty status, we identified three key choices to be made: whether to directly measure a family\u2019s spending on basic necessities or to use income and other economic resources as a proxy for its ability to buy those necessities, which economic resources should be considered available for meeting a family\u2019s basic needs, and whether existing data sources are adequate or should be modified to improve the reliability of poverty estimates."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Should Well-being Be Measured Through Spending or Economic Resources?", "paragraphs": ["Some poverty researchers have proposed examining families\u2019 consumption of goods and services, rather than their income, to assess more directly whether they are able to obtain a minimal standard of living. Many on the NRC panel and some of the experts we interviewed were sympathetic with that view. The panel report noted that consumption is more closely related conceptually to material deprivation\u2014the core concept underlying poverty\u2014than is income. However, as we previously noted, efforts to directly measure material deprivation meet with both conceptual and practical difficulties. For example, some readily identified deprivations, such as loss of housing, may not result from low income but from imprudent spending or difficulties with one\u2019s landlord. And defining housing adequacy would require subjective judgments to select standards for living space; cooking and plumbing facilities; and heating and, perhaps, cooling needs. Even when expert-defined standards exist, assessing the nutritional adequacy of a family\u2019s diet, for example, would likely require a costly expert assessment and the collection of detailed data on family meals. Thus, measures of material deprivation are more often recommended as a supplement to, than as a replacement, for data on family resources.", "Instead, researchers who assess poverty status through consumption typically use as their measure the dollar value of a household\u2019s reported spending (excluding taxes, gifts, and savings). The primary source for these data is the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), which collects detailed data from households on their expenditures. Because we do not know whether a family\u2019s level of expenditures is sufficient to meet its material needs, the dollar value of expenditures is really only a proxy for the family\u2019s level of material deprivation. However, some researchers still prefer to look at what families spend rather than their income because expenditures reflect what they were able to obtain with all their available economic resources (including savings, assets, and credit), whereas income is only a proxy for those resources.", "There were mixed views in the field about whether income or expenditures were more conceptually consistent with the intended uses of the poverty measure. A perceived disadvantage of measuring family well-being with income is that it tends to overstate the material deprivation of families who experience a temporary economic setback and of those low-income families who can use savings to maintain their level of expenditures. But, precisely because families can smooth out the effects of dips in income, expenditures tend to vary less among families and over time than income does. Thus, for policy planning and evaluation purposes, an expenditure-based measure might not be as sensitive an indicator of families\u2019 economic need as income would be. In contrast, a perceived advantage of measuring poverty with family income is that much of government antipoverty policy is expressed and analyzed in terms of change in total or disposable family income. If poverty was measured on the basis of expenditures, forecasting the effects of a change in economic policy would require estimating how the expected change in family income would affect a family\u2019s expenditures, which are more difficult to predict than income.", "In the end, the NRC panel concluded, and experts we interviewed concurred, that, at least at present, measuring poverty for official purposes with expenditures was simply not feasible. The only available national survey of household expenditures, the CEX, is not currently appropriate for measuring poverty. Its sample size is too small to support the level of detail on demographic subgroups that we now obtain from the income surveys. Because the CEX is also expensive to administer and time consuming to process, experts considered it prohibitively costly to greatly expand the survey in its current form. Moreover, the panel reported concerns about its design and response rate that raised questions for them about its quality and appropriateness as a source for an expenditures-based poverty measure. For example, because estimates of different types of expenditures are currently derived from different samples answering different surveys, the panel had questions about how to obtain a comprehensive resource estimate for individual families. (App. II provides more detail on this survey.) Nevertheless, because the conceptual advantages of an expenditure measure of poverty have appeal, the NRC panel also recommended research into improving available expenditure data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Which Economic Resources Should Be Counted as Available Toward Meeting a Family\u2019s Basic Needs?", "paragraphs": ["For more than a decade, critics have pointed out that the official poverty measure\u2019s use of gross cash income does not fully represent the resources families actually have available to meet basic needs. Specifically, gross cash income excludes the value of in-kind benefits (like food stamps and public housing rental subsidies), which clearly increase the resources available for basic needs, and fails to account for taxes and payment of child support, which reduce available resources. Since the poverty measure was developed, there have been significant increases in payroll taxes and noncash government transfers for low-income families, as well as significant changes in income taxes, so these omissions have become more problematic over time. The NRC panel believed that it was also critical to take into account both in-kind benefits and tax payments in order for the poverty measure to reflect the antipoverty effects of government tax and assistance policies.", "We found disagreement among the experts, however, about how far to go in making these adjustments to cash income. The NRC panel recommended adding the value of near-cash, nonmedical in-kind benefits (such as food stamps, rental housing subsidies, school lunches, and home energy assistance) to families\u2019 gross money income and deducting income taxes, Social Security taxes, payment of child support, out-of-pocket medical expenditures, and child care and other work-related expenses (up to a limit). One of the panel members dissented from the panel\u2019s recommendations on how to incorporate out-of-pocket medical expenses and the value of public medical insurance (Medicaid and Medicare). Over the years, efforts to find a generally acceptable method for valuing public medical insurance have been unsuccessful, in part because the value of insurance to recipients depends on whether they need to use it. In addition, the dollar value of expenses covered by insurance can be so large that it exceeds the amount of money a low-income family has available for other needs, yet it cannot be spent on those needs. The panel\u2019s suggestion to deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses from income, instead of adding the value of insurance coverage to income, avoids ascribing unrealistically large amounts of resources to families who never made use of their insurance and those whose insurance covered unusually high expenses. But one panel member preferred to treat health care as another basic need such as food, shelter, and clothing, and incorporate out-of-pocket medical expenses as part of the family budget used to develop the thresholds.", "Deciding which income adjustments to make also depends on how accurate these adjustments can be made, at reasonable expense. The Bureau of the Census, which has developed ways to approximate values for food and housing assistance received and taxes paid for the families that are surveyed to produce the poverty statistics, has used those figures to calculate adjusted poverty rates on an experimental basis. However, Bureau of the Census officials were not confident about the success of this approach for some of the other recommended income adjustments without expanding the CPS questionnaire. One expert stressed that if estimates are used, it is important that they accurately reflect the real choices made by lower-income families, because using average family expenditure values could introduce bias into the poverty estimates.", "Another consideration raised by government officials in deciding whether and how to change the way family economic resources are officially defined for measuring poverty is the implications of such a change for those government programs that link receipt of assistance to the official poverty measure. Some programs determine eligibility, in part, by comparing an applicant\u2019s income with the poverty guidelines (which are derived from the thresholds) or some multiple of them. Poverty guidelines are issued annually by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by smoothing the official poverty thresholds for different size families, increasing the levels for Alaska and Hawaii, and updating them for price inflation.", "To aid coordination of assistance programs, it is preferable for programs to share a common definition of \u201cincome\u201d; one way to simplify a program\u2019s application process is to limit its resource definition to gross monetary income, based on readily obtained information. The panel believed that its disposable income definition of family resources is a substantial improvement over the current measure, and so encouraged consideration of, but did not directly recommend, the use of this definition by programs that currently compare gross income to the administrative poverty guidelines. The panel recognized that, in programs that currently employ a fairly crude measure of gross income, implementing its proposed resource definition would require obtaining additional data on applicants\u2019 in-kind benefits and expenses. The panel also recognized that this could place a burden on both clients and administrators. As an alternative, the panel suggested that such programs could choose to use a simplified definition of disposable income if the programs were willing to give up some precision in determining eligibility status in order to minimize data burden."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Are Existing Data Sources Adequate or Should They Be Improved?", "paragraphs": ["Part of the argument for using expenditures rather than income to measure a family\u2019s economic well-being is the claim that many apparently low-income households underreport their income. This claim is primarily based on the finding that in the single national household survey that collects extensive data on family expenditures (the CEX), low-income families report higher levels of expenditures than income. Although the Bureau of the Census acknowledges some income underreporting in the survey that is used to derive the official poverty statistics (the CPS), this problem is understood to be somewhat greater in the CEX, which was not specifically designed to measure income.", "The NRC panel recommended changing the data source for poverty statistics from the CPS to the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which is also conducted by the Bureau of the Census. The CPS is basically a labor force survey that is supplemented in March of each year with a large battery of income questions used for measuring poverty. In contrast, the SIPP was specially designed as a survey of household income and, through both different questions and more frequent interviews, provides more detailed and more accurate data on income than the CPS. In addition, because the CPS survey does not collect certain data on expenses (notably taxes, child care, and child support payments), estimates of the likely value of such payments (that is, imputations) would be required to make some of the recommended income adjustments. In the absence of some of the information needed, the technical adequacy of the imputations becomes increasingly important. Thus, many experts prefer the SIPP because they believe it provides a more accurate report of income for low-income people and provides most of the information required for the additional income adjustments recommended by the panel. (App. II provides more detail on these surveys.)", "Currently, the decennial census, due to its broad coverage, is the primary source of poverty rates for small areas such as cities and counties; yet, it does not gather the detailed information that would be required to implement the panel\u2019s proposed resource definition. Officials of the Bureau of the Census indicated that they have tested several limited questions in the National Content Survey (the main content-testing vehicle for the year 2000 census) on the receipt of in-kind benefits and payments for child support but that no expansions are planned to the census long-form questionnaire at this time. Thus, if the panel\u2019s definition of family resources was adopted, simulations would be required to produce comparable estimates from the census. Differences between estimates from the two surveys would likely result, but some comparability problems exist currently between poverty estimates derived from the CPS and the census."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developments Since the NRC Report", "paragraphs": ["OMB has not yet acted on the panel\u2019s recommendations to revise the poverty measure but has discussed forming an interagency working group with BLS, the Bureau of the Census, and other interested agencies to explore general issues in measuring income and poverty and consider alternative measures to be developed and tested. BLS has not yet begun a comprehensive study of how to improve the CEX as a tool to measure family resources for the purposes of determining their poverty status per se, as the panel recommended, but awaits direction from OMB and additional funds to undertake such research. However, efforts are under way to address some of this survey\u2019s data quality problems that were noted by the panel.", "Staff of the Bureau of the Census, in a joint project with BLS staff, have begun to examine the feasibility of implementing the panel\u2019s recommendations for a revised resource definition. After replicating the panel\u2019s procedures on the CPS, they concluded that \u201che Panel\u2019s recommendation that resources be measured as disposable income places much faith in the Census Bureau\u2019s ability to expand data collection efforts or do better modeling in an environment in which small annual changes in poverty are perceived as important, since there is no national survey that currently collects all the information necessary to portray a family\u2019s poverty status under the proposed measure.\u201d Bureau of the Census staff report that researchers within the Bureau are currently examining nearly every dimension of the resource measure they employed (including the valuation of housing subsidies and imputation of work, child care, and out-of-pocket medical expenses) and are currently working on implementing the resource measure in the SIPP instead of the CPS.", "In 1996, the sample design of the SIPP was changed in order to focus on collecting longitudinal information on change in families\u2019 income and behavior over time. As a result, the SIPP is no longer able to provide nationally representative estimates of family income each year. The Bureau of the Census has developed a proposal to supplement the SIPP\u2019s new sample design to ensure this survey\u2019s ability to provide national estimates from year to year, comparable to current practice. However, additional funds would be required for this new design. The Bureau is also considering an alternative process for conducting the 2010 decennial census that would involve collecting more detailed data from samples of respondents throughout a 10-year period rather than only once every 10 years. However, it is not clear at this time whether this process will be adopted and, if so, whether it would include the detailed information on family resources and expenses needed to implement a disposable income definition. Nevertheless, because government analysts are also just beginning to recognize the implications for existing surveys of the new reporting requirements of the 1996 welfare reform legislation, we believe it is critical that all proposed changes to the SIPP and census be carefully coordinated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues in Updating the Poverty Thresholds", "paragraphs": ["The current thresholds, or levels of income below which families of different sizes are considered poor, are based on family consumption patterns of 4 decades ago and contain certain logical inconsistencies. As a consequence, many experts believe that the thresholds should be revised, but there is less consensus on how to do so. Although many technical choices will need to be made in developing thresholds, we highlight four key choices: on what basis to set the level of a poverty threshold, whether to accommodate changes over time in standards of living as well how to quantify the difference in need among families of different size and whether and how to accommodate geographical differences in the cost of living."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Should an Appropriate Threshold Level Be Identified?", "paragraphs": ["The NRC panel concluded that \u201clthough judgement enters into nearly all aspects of the poverty measure . . . questions of the threshold concept and level are more inherently matters of judgment than other aspects of a poverty measure.\u201d Many of the experts we interviewed believed that scientists should not set the poverty thresholds on their own but instead should provide information about what it means to live at one income level or another (in terms of expenditures or living conditions) and let policymakers make the judgment. That is, the poverty level is viewed as essentially an arbitrary point selected to represent what society defines as constituting a \u201cminimally adequate standard of living.\u201d However, the panel noted that several sources are available to inform the selection of a particular income level: public opinion on what level of income is believed necessary to \u201cget along,\u201d the distribution of family or household income, and poverty budgets that estimate what income levels families need to obtain basic necessities.", "From 1946 to 1989, the Gallup poll has asked the following question: \u201cWhat is the smallest amount of money a family of four (husband, wife, and two children) needs each week to get along in this community?\u201d Denton Vaughan\u2019s 1993 analysis of these data found that the \u201cget-along\u201d amount, while remaining below the median level of post-tax income for four-person families, has increased over the years along with increases in median family income. In contrast, the official poverty level, in constant dollars, while similar to the \u201cget-along\u201d amount from 1947 to 1950, declined sharply thereafter relative to both median income and the \u201cget-along\u201d amount through the early 1970s. Vaughan concluded that the official poverty threshold, by remaining fixed while real incomes and expectations rose, \u201cis no longer fully consistent with the standards of the American people.\u201d The NRC panel recommended against using these or similar poll findings directly to set the poverty level because (1) responses are quite variable, both over time and with the exact wording of the question and (2) the knowledge that their response would be used to set the poverty standard (and thus, perhaps, benefit levels) might affect the way in which people respond. Indeed, a government official pointed out that precisely because these surveys did not directly ask what level of resources families should be guaranteed, these responses were not appropriate for setting guidelines that would determine public assistance benefit levels. However, opinion surveys were considered a valid way of tapping societal norms, so experts suggested that their results be used as a confirmatory source to help bracket figures derived from other sources.", "Alternatively, poverty can be treated as a relative notion and the poor defined as all those with income below a particular point on the distribution of family or household income, such as the bottom fifth or those below a point representing 50 percent of the median income. This approach emphasizes the socially defined aspect of poverty, that \u201chose whose resources are significantly below the resources of other members of society, even if they are able to eat and physically survive, are not able to participate adequately in their relationships, and therefore are not able to participate fully in society.\u201d The NRC panel noted that relative thresholds are easy to understand and calculate, are thus often used in international comparisons of poverty, and are self-updating.", "The panel also noted that some find the relative, arbitrary, and self-updating features of relative thresholds to be drawbacks, instead. For example, creating a purely relative poverty level (such as the bottom fifth of the distribution) was unappealing because it would mean that the statistic would no longer serve as a measure of progress against poverty. Every year, no matter how much family incomes improved, one fifth of the population would automatically be defined as poor. That problem can be avoided, however, by defining the threshold as a percentage of median income, which would not require a particular proportion of the population to be labeled as poor.", "The third major approach to setting a poverty threshold is to develop some form of poverty budget based on expert judgment of families\u2019 needs, the observed expenditures of low-income families, or some combination of the two. Poverty budgets based on expert judgments \u201chave the appeal of being based on the notion of minimum standards of physical needs,\u201d but \u201clarge elements of relativity and subjective judgment invariably enter the process\u201d because few established standards exist to guide the choice of what to include in these budgets. The dilemma is that there are many different ways to meet basic nutritional needs, for example, but to cost out a poverty budget, the expert must select one nutritionally adequate diet over another, which requires subjective judgment. Therefore, in practice, experts must base their judgments on either their own beliefs about the needs of low-income families or on observations of families\u2019 spending patterns.", "The primary choice in developing a poverty budget is whether to specify in detail a comprehensive poverty-level family budget or to cost out one or a few categories of spending that can then be multiplied by a factor to represent the rest of a family\u2019s needs. Comprehensive detailed budgets that attempt to mimic an entire family\u2019s budget have the advantage of appearing to be absolute rather than relative and provide a concrete picture of what it would look and feel like to live at that particular income level. But the experts also cautioned that a carefully detailed budget was very burdensome to create and required a substantial number of subjective judgments to justify (such as about what to include and at what cost).", "In contrast, a budget based on specifying one or two budget categories, such as food, paired with a multiplier to cover the rest of a family\u2019s needs, is much simpler to create, but using a large multiplier can distort the measure over time if it is not reassessed. This is precisely what happened with the official poverty measure. The original formula (three times the cost of a poverty food budget) no longer reflects contemporary family consumption patterns because costs of different budget categories have changed differentially. Food costs have not risen as much as other costs since the 1950s and standards of living have climbed, so food now represents about one-seventh rather than one-third of family budgets. Thus, a literal update of the original poverty measure would multiply the current cost of a poverty food budget by seven rather than by three.", "To ground the thresholds in families\u2019 basic needs yet avoid the numerous judgments involved in detailing a comprehensive budget, the NRC panel recommended developing a budget for a four-person reference family for the three categories of food, clothing, and shelter needs from actual family expenditure data, along with a small multiplier to account for other needs. It recommended basing the budget on a fixed proportion of the median expenditures of two-adult, two-child families on these basic needs. It further recommended that that proportion and the multiplier be selected in concert with both expert judgment and public opinion concerning what constitutes a minimally acceptable standard of living. As one expert argued, since poverty is, in the end, a social construct, triangulation between threshold levels generated through expert judgment, family expenditure data, and public opinion polling is most likely to achieve the desired consensus.", "Another consideration in deciding whether and how to revise the poverty thresholds is the implications of such a change for those government programs that link receipt of assistance to the administrative poverty guidelines. Some programs providing cash, in-kind benefits, or services to low-income persons have as one of their income eligibility criteria that their income be compared with the poverty guidelines or some multiple of them; others have their own income standards. Currently, the administrative poverty guidelines issued by HHS are a simplified version of the poverty thresholds. If changes to the poverty thresholds were made, OMB officials indicated that the administrative guidelines would not necessarily be affected, unless a separate decision was made that revised measures were more appropriate for those programs that use the guidelines. Nevertheless, even changing the level of these poverty guidelines would only have direct caseload and budget implications for some programs, and only if the newly eligible people applied for services. This is because only some of the programs that link eligibility to the poverty guidelines are entitlement programs, that is, they must provide benefits to all eligible applicants (for example, Medicaid, food stamps, School Lunch, and School Breakfast). In others, legislatively set budget limits determine how many eligible people who apply for services will actually be assisted and how many will be put on waiting lists. The NRC panel recommended that program agencies carefully review the proposed measure to determine whether it is appropriate as an eligibility standard and whether it may need to be modified to better serve program objectives. \u201cOther considerations, such as funding constraints and competing use of scarce tax dollars, may dictate that assistance program benefits be set at a level below the statistical poverty thresholds.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Should the Thresholds Accommodate Changes Over Time in Standards of Living as Well as in Prices?", "paragraphs": ["No matter what level is selected to represent the income needed to purchase a \u201cminimum adequate standard of living,\u201d some mechanism is needed to maintain its currency over time. Currently, the thresholds are updated annually for price inflation, but we found mixed views on whether to also update them regularly for real changes in income levels or expenditures. As noted before, by not reestimating the food share of families\u2019 budgets, the current method\u2019s adjustment of the 1960s\u2019 thresholds for price inflation alone is believed to have misestimated the effect of changes in the cost of living on the entire poverty budget.", "In support of routinely adjusting for changes in standards of living, the panel noted that, historically, the levels of estimated minimum standards\u2014whether from expert budgets, programmatic standards, or public opinion polling\u2014have in fact risen over time with real (that is, inflation-adjusted) growth in both income and consumer expenditures. Additionally, of course, it would be administratively simpler to have a routine mechanism for updating the thresholds, rather than wait until serious concerns arise to instigate a major reevaluation and revision. To keep the thresholds current, the NRC panel proposed updating them annually to reflect changes in median family expenditures on food, clothing, and shelter, with the amount averaged over the previous 3 years to reduce the thresholds\u2019 volatility over the cycles of the economy.", "However, other experts were concerned that such annual adjustments would turn the poverty measure into a relative standard that would no longer provide a stable target for assessing government programs\u2019 progress. Moreover, they were concerned that, in the short run, a relative threshold tied to median income (or expenditures) could end up yielding perverse results. For example, in an economic recession, as median expenditures declined, so would the poverty threshold, potentially leading to lower rather than higher poverty rates. NRC\u2019s proposed updating mechanism would not create a truly relative measure because the threshold would be updated on the basis of families\u2019 expenditures on food, clothing, and shelter, which represent about 45 percent of total expenditures for four-person households and do not tend to rise as fast as income. Additionally, updating thresholds with median expenditures averaged over the past 3 years would moderate the effect of year-to-year economic fluctuations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Should the Thresholds Reflect Differences in Need Among Families of Different Size?", "paragraphs": ["Thresholds for different types of families were initially developed in an effort to ensure the equivalence of the poverty level, conceptually, across families whose different circumstances implied different needs. The USDA food plans were developed to reflect presumed differences in the food needs of children and elderly individuals and those of nonelderly adults, and the thresholds were developed to accommodate the economies of scale enjoyed by larger families compared with smaller ones. However, it was pointed out in 1990 that the initial equivalence scales (that is, the set of differences between thresholds for different families) were not entirely systematically based on variation in family consumption patterns and the data that were used are now out of date. Additionally, the scales exhibit some abnormalities in terms of natural economies of scale for different family sizes.", "Analysts want the thresholds to reflect only those sources of variation in family needs for which empirical evidence of sizable systematic variation exists. While elderly people do have different consumption patterns from the nonelderly, evidence that the elderly have consistently lower income needs is limited. Thus, the panel proposed dropping the distinction made in the current method that provides a lower threshold for elderly individuals living alone than that for nonelderly adults. In response to a legal challenge, the distinction between female and male heads of households was removed in 1981.", "A large body of research has developed a variety of approaches for creating equivalence scales to represent the variation in needs among different family types. However, no single approach can be clearly demonstrated to be more accurate than the others because of conceptual difficulties in assessing whether two families of different types are equally well-off. For example, although married couples with one child may spend less on food outside the home than those without children, we have no measure of whether they are equally well-off. Thus, it is difficult to identify the extent of economies of scale from simply comparing different families\u2019 expenditure patterns. Moreover, in any consumption-based analysis, care must be taken to avoid simply institutionalizing the status quo. If larger families also tend to have lower incomes than smaller families, their smaller per capita spending could represent the effects of their lower income rather than lower needs.", "In the absence of an objective procedure for determining the relative costs of living for families of different sizes and composition, the NRC panel proposed using a statistical formula to produce thresholds for various combinations of adults and children so that the resultant equivalence scale would at least be logical and internally consistent. The panel developed a formula reflecting the general form of the varied formulas in the literature, which treats the cost per child as a fixed proportion of the cost per additional adult and provides for the scale economies of larger families. It also made suggestions for the choice of the actual terms of the formula. These choices need to be carefully examined because, by raising or lowering the thresholds for different families from what they are now, the demographic profile of people defined as living in poverty can be substantially changed. For example, the panel found that applying one of the proposed scales while retaining the current threshold for a two-adult, two-child family would reduce the threshold for single people and thus increase the poverty rate for that group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Should Thresholds Reflect Geographic Differences in Cost of Living and, if so, How?", "paragraphs": ["Another important source of variation in family circumstances that affects the cost of meeting families\u2019 basic needs is geography. It has long been recognized that, \u201cbecause some parts of the country have higher prices than other parts, families that live in relatively expensive areas actually may need higher incomes to maintain the same level of consumption as lower income families in less expensive places.\u201d The experts we interviewed agreed that it was conceptually appropriate to adjust the poverty thresholds to account for reliable differences across areas in the cost of living but were unsure about whether adequately reliable data would be available to do so. Another noted that such a change could cause the Congress to consider the effects that such a change would have on the distribution of funds to states and localities from federal programs whose distribution formulas currently consider the differences in poverty rates between areas.", "Long-standing data and conceptual problems have prevented any adjustment of poverty measures for geographic differences in cost of living in the past and may continue to do so. Currently, no standard index of comparative prices exists that reflects variation both within and across regions and that covers all areas of the country. Previous efforts to develop such an index have been stymied by lack of comprehensive and comparable price data on samples large enough to provide reliable estimates for areas within regions, as well as by the problem of how to adjust for differences in local preferences or standards of living. That is, while it seems reasonable to account for differences in types of expenditures that are directly related to the climate, such as heating costs, some other differences, such as food preferences, may also represent differences in quality that are related to differences in income levels between areas.", "As an alternative to a comprehensive interarea price index, the NRC panel proposed adjusting the poverty thresholds with an interarea price index for shelter, because shelter costs show considerable geographical variation and are a major component of consumer spending. The NRC panel proposed developing an interarea housing cost index for metropolitan areas of various population sizes within nine regions and developed an experimental one themselves, using a modified version of the \u201cfair market rent\u201d methodology developed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). To administer rental housing subsidies, HUD sets \u201cfair market rents\u201d at the 45th percentile of the rent distributions in metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan counties for apartments that meet specified quality standards and that are occupied by recent movers. The NRC panel applied this methodology to rental housing data from the 1990 census to develop index values for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. We previously reported, however, that experts have criticized the use of the HUD method for creating an interarea price index for adjusting poverty thresholds because HUD\u2019s estimates do not cover all types of rental housing; fail to adjust for interarea differences in the quality of housing; and, of course, capture only one component of the cost of living.", "While experts agreed it was rationally justified to adjust the thresholds for geographic cost-of-living differences, we found little consensus on which methodology would be both reasonably accurate and practical for creating and maintaining such an index. One concern is that no single data source, including the decennial census, had both adequately reliable data on metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas within regions and the detail on housing characteristics required to accurately distinguish differences in prices from those in quality. Another concern is that housing prices may differ as much within metropolitan areas as they do between them. Moreover, because housing markets can experience large changes within a 10-year period, developing a method to produce reliable updates between decennial censuses is important to ensure that the geographic adjustments do not create more error than they were intended to reduce. However, there was no consensus among the experts we interviewed that a solution to the periodic updating problem had been found."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developments Since the NRC Report", "paragraphs": ["Staff of BLS, in a joint project with the Bureau of the Census, have begun exploratory work to examine the feasibility of implementing the panel\u2019s proposals for developing poverty thresholds should they be asked to do so.

However, in testing alternative valuation procedures, they found that replacing a homeowner\u2019s shelter costs with a rental equivalence value produced higher thresholds and thus higher poverty rates. They report that BLS researchers are currently examining (or planning to examine) numerous issues related to the panel\u2019s recommendations, including other methods to estimate the service flows from owned housing and vehicles, the impact of using data from consumer units reporting a full year of expenditures, and which Consumer Price Index to use to update the basic bundle of expenditures.", "Professor David Betson, a member of the panel, has continued research on the evidence underlying the current and alternative equivalence scales and the consequences of alternative scales for who is considered poor. In a preliminary summary, he reports that several different sets of scales are consistent with the research on spending on children but yield quite different results for single adults. Yet, with limited research evidence on the scale relating one and two adults, additional research will be required to choose among these scales.", "Additionally, BLS has been conducting some experimental work on interarea indexes of price differences that may help resolve concerns regarding the quality of available data for adjusting the thresholds for geographical differences in the cost of living. Specifically, BLS is using sophisticated statistical techniques to isolate the relative differences in prices among geographic locations when, as is done in developing the CPI, price information is collected for similar but not identical items across localities.

In total, about 65 separate sources of cash income are identified for each household member aged 15 or over, together with benefits from 7 in-kind programs; for a few sources, annual amounts are obtained in special interview supplements called \u201ctopical modules.\u201d Data are also collected, once or twice in each panel, on a wide range of subjects, including annual income and income taxes; educational financing and enrollment; eligibility for selected programs (including expenditures on shelter, out-of-pocket medical care costs, and dependent care); housing costs and financing; individual retirement accounts; and wealth (assets, including property, and liabilities)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Comparisons Between the CPS and SIPP", "paragraphs": ["The SIPP obtains somewhat more detailed information on topics relevant to measuring poverty than the CPS does. For example, the March CPS supplement asks no questions about any type of tax payment. The Bureau of the Census, instead, models federal and state income taxes and payroll taxes of each household for its experimental poverty estimates. The SIPP includes twice for each panel questions about tax payments for the previous year. However, its questions on such topics as tax liability and adjusted gross income have high nonresponse rates, primarily because only one-third of respondents use their tax forms to answer the questions, as they are asked to do. In addition, the CPS asks whether a household received benefits from the School Lunch Program or housing assistance the previous year but asks about the amounts received only for food stamps and energy assistance. The SIPP, on the other hand, obtains monthly information on the number of people who receive and benefit amounts for food stamps and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC); information every 4 months about energy assistance and the School Lunch and Breakfast programs; and information twice a panel about public housing and subsidized housing. Finally, whereas the CPS does not ask questions about expenses for medical care or child care, the SIPP obtains detailed information on these at least once each panel.", "The National Research Council (NRC) panel, in reviewing research on data quality in the two surveys, found that the SIPP is favored on some indicators, such as item nonresponse rates and amounts of Social Security and other income types collected (in comparison with independent estimates), while the March CPS supplement fares better on household nonresponse rates and the amount of wages and salaries collected. Citro and Michael report that \u201cverall, however, SIPP appears to be doing a better job at measuring income, particularly at the lower end of the income distribution. SIPP\u2019s more frequent interviews and detailed probing for receipt of different income sources appear to be identifying more recipients of many income types than the March CPS, although the dollar amounts reported are not always more complete in SIPP than in the CPS.\u201dAs a consequence, SIPP poverty estimates are consistently several points below those from the March CPS. In addition, the panel and Bureau of the Census officials we interviewed felt that the SIPP, because of its focus on income and program participation, was in a better position than the CPS to provide both higher quality information on income and the other information on family expenditures needed for a revised definition of family resources for measuring poverty."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Bureau of Labor Statistics", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Bureau of the Census", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bibliography", "paragraphs": ["Betson, David M. \u201cIs Everything Relative?
