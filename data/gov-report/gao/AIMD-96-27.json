A great deal of controversy was generated by DIA\u2019s construction. Proponents pointed to various inadequacies related to SIA\u2019s facilities, limits on expansion, and noise pollution. Opponents raised objections related to DIA\u2019s construction and operating costs, levels of future passenger demand, and long-term financial viability. The airport, which opened for business on February 28, 1995, experienced numerous construction delays and cost overruns. Allegations of inadequate disclosures in bond offerings to the public have resulted in an SEC investigation and several lawsuits.", "About 65 percent of DIA\u2019s revenues are collected from the airlines for space rental and landing fees. The remaining 35 percent of revenues come from concessions, passenger facility charges (PFCs), interest income, and other sources.", "To help ensure that revenues will cover costs, DIA has a rate maintenance covenant with bondholders. This covenant requires DIA to set annual rates and fees to result in an amount that, when combined with funds held in reserve in the coverage account, is equal to (1) all costs of operating the airport plus (2) 125 percent of the debt service requirements on senior bonds for that year. Senior bonds comprise about $3.5 billion of DIA\u2019s total $3.8 billion bond debt. DIA\u2019s revenue bonds were issued under the 1984 General Bond Ordinance, which promises bondholders that the rate maintenance covenant will be honored in setting billing rates for airlines.", "Under the airlines\u2019 use and lease agreements, each airline is required to pay rates and charges sufficient to meet the rate maintenance covenant after taking into consideration all airport revenues. Because there are no limits on costs built into the rate maintenance cost recovery model, DIA has agreed to share 80 percent of net receipts with airlines for 5 years from February 28, 1995, and lower percentages thereafter. After sharing net receipts with the airlines, DIA estimates that it will retain an estimated $6.3 million to $7.6 million a year for fiscal years 1996 through 2000, which will be transferred into the capital fund.", "Many airports calculate the airlines\u2019 cost per enplaned passenger as a benchmark. This cost is based on the airlines\u2019 share of airport costs, divided by the actual number of enplaned passengers.

Also, because DIA\u2019s revenues are primarily driven by passenger volume, increased ticket prices may be a concern if they result in significant passenger declines. Other risks include the possibility of (1) unknown construction defects resulting in major unexpected costs or (2) adverse actions arising from a current Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and/or lawsuits filed by bondholders against DIA.

One factor influencing passenger volume, in turn, is ticket prices. Ticket prices at DIA increased 20 percent to 38 percent compared to those charged a year earlier at SIA. American Express recently reported that the average fare paid at DIA for March 1995 was 20 percent higher than fares at SIA in March 1994, with an average fare of $290 at DIA compared to $241 at SIA. American Express also reported that the average fare nationally, based on 215 domestic city pairs, showed no change during that period. In addition, the American Express review for the second quarter of 1995 reported that the average fare paid at DIA in June 1995 was 38 percent higher than the average fare at SIA in June 1994, while the average fare was up 7 percent nationally during that period.", "We also reviewed the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) airfare statistics, which are based on a broader 10 percent sample of all domestic airline travel. DOT\u2019s data showed that the average fare for Denver travel for the second quarter of 1995\u2014DIA\u2019s first full quarter of operation\u2014was 9 percent higher than the SIA fare for the same period in 1994. According to DOT\u2019s statistics, the average fare nationwide for the second quarter of 1995 was 2.4 percent higher compared to the average fare 1 year earlier.", "According to airline industry representatives we interviewed, airport charges to airlines for rental costs and landing fees represent a small fraction of airlines\u2019 total costs, which also include, for example, aircraft fuel and maintenance costs and personnel and benefits expenses. Thus, the industry officials indicated that the lack of a competitive market in the Denver area for United Airlines, rather than DIA airline charges, is probably the most important factor affecting the price of tickets. United Airlines dominates the market at DIA, carrying about 70 percent of all passengers enplaned in Denver during the first 4 months of 1995. Historically, Continental Airlines was United\u2019s major competition in the Denver market; however, as discussed later, Continental has eliminated its hubbing operation from Denver.", "Airlines that have a reputation for low fares, such as Southwest, have stated in media reports that they have chosen not to use DIA because its rates are too high. The airport at Colorado Springs, which is located about 70 miles south of Denver, has attracted a low fare airline, Western Pacific Airlines, that is offering competition to DIA. Colorado Springs expects to enplane 1.4 million passengers in 1995 compared to 791,000 in 1994, a 72-percent growth rate. Colorado Springs Airport officials told us that some of the growth is fueled by Denver passengers, although they have not performed any studies to verify this. Future growth at Colorado Springs, however, will be limited by its size; it is currently operating at full capacity with only about 7 percent of DIA\u2019s passenger volume.", "Our analysis of landing reports generated by the airlines for the first 6 months of operations at DIA showed that DIA enplaned 100.3 percent of forecasted passengers for March, April, and May 1995. However, volumes declined through the summer of 1995 as compared to forecasts, with 94.5 percent in June, 90.6 percent in July, and 89.0 percent in August. DIA officials stated that higher ticket prices were the primary cause of the decline in passenger volume in the summer of 1995, as well as the loss of Continental\u2019s hubbing operation.

The four lawsuits allege that the city misrepresented the design and construction status of the automated baggage system and the opening date of DIA. In addition, two of the lawsuits make allegations that the city and other defendants engaged in a conspiracy to conceal adverse facts from the investing public in order to artificially inflate the market price of the bonds.

Table 2 presents DIA\u2019s reported reserve fund balances as of September 25, 1995.", "The following restrictions apply to the use of the reserve funds:", "Bond Reserve Fund. Under terms of the bond ordinance, money can be withdrawn from this fund only to meet debt service requirements. Withdrawn funds must be paid back at the rate of 1/60th of the amount owed each month. Our analysis showed that about $200 million could be withdrawn from this fund before the payback requirements would exceed the remaining balance. However, according to bond analysts to whom we spoke, drawing on this fund could have a negative effect on DIA\u2019s bond ratings if DIA seeks future bond financing. As previously discussed, only one additional bond sale is currently being planned.", "Capital Fund. This fund can be used without restriction to pay for capital improvement costs, extraordinary costs, or debt service requirements. DIA anticipates that in the ordinary course of business, it will draw upon this fund for capital improvements.", "Coverage Fund. DIA\u2019s rate maintenance covenant requires that net revenues of the airport, combined with the coverage fund, equal no less than 125 percent of the debt service requirement on senior bonds for the upcoming year. The coverage fund amount is calculated at the end of each year and must be fully funded at that time. In June 1995, DIA reported that the December 31, 1996, coverage fund requirement will be $58.4 million. Any amounts withdrawn from the coverage fund must be replenished by December 31 of each year, which effectively limits the use of this fund in a financial crisis.", "Operations and Maintenance Reserve Fund. This fund must be fully funded by January 1, 1997. Full funding requires that 2 months of operations and maintenance expenses be on deposit in the fund, a requirement of about $27 million. This fund can be used to cover operations and maintenance expenses if net cash from operations is inadequate.", "We requested written comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of Transportation and the Director of Aviation, DIA, of the City of Denver.
