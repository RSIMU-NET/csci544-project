AmeriCorps, the act\u2019s signature program, is jointly administered by the Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation) and state commissions. AmeriCorps allows participants to earn education awards to help pay for postsecondary education in exchange for performing community service that matches priorities established by the Corporation. In an era marked by fiscal austerity, AmeriCorps has experienced substantial growth relative to other domestic programs in budgetary terms. Through fiscal year 1997, the Congress has appropriated over $800 million to support about 100,000 AmeriCorps participants. Amid concerns over costs and internal controls, however, considerable congressional oversight activity has accompanied AmeriCorps\u2019 appropriations.", "Several studies of the Corporation\u2019s first operating year have been completed. Between January 1995 and May 1996, at the request of the Congress, we conducted three studies that focused on AmeriCorps program resources and benefits. In March 1996, the Corporation\u2019s Inspector General issued five reports on the Corporation\u2019s financial management systems and its 1994 AmeriCorps National Direct grant award process. The results from these reviews prompted several initiatives aimed at lowering AmeriCorps\u2019 costs.", "Under the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-134) and the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997 (P.L. 104-208), the Congress mandated new funding restrictions for the Corporation. One provision makes federal agencies ineligible to receive AmeriCorps grants, while another directs the Corporation, to the greatest extent possible, (1) to increase the amount of matching contributions provided by the private sector and (2) to reduce AmeriCorps\u2019 total federal cost per participant. Among the program reforms contemplated during the 1996 appropriation process, some Members of Congress expressed interest in scaling back AmeriCorps\u2019 federal bureaucracy and transferring more program management to state commissions.", "To better gauge state commissions\u2019 capacity to absorb additional program management responsibility, the Congress mandated through the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act that we study state commission programs. Because of your long-standing interest in AmeriCorps, we coordinated our work with representatives from your offices and agreed to address our report to you. On the basis of discussions with your staff, we agreed to provide information on the following three issues: the statutory role of state commissions, state commission operations, including project-level outputs from national service projects within their purview, such as participant enrollment and expenditure data, extending state commissions\u2019 administrative and oversight role over AmeriCorps and correspondingly decreasing the federal government\u2019s role.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed seven state commissions representing a range and mix of characteristics, including geographic location, level of Corporation grant funding, and number of AmeriCorps participants.

We also reviewed files at state commission offices to obtain program documentation or obtained documentation directly from commission officials.", "We also reviewed 24 AmeriCorps projects administered by the seven state commissions. We selected the projects on the basis of the type of service program, the level of Corporation funding, and whether the decision to fund the project was made solely by the state commission or jointly with the Corporation.

The number of projects that state commissions were currently administering at the time of our review were those funded with fiscal year 1995 federal funds. Finally, because of differences between the federal and state governments\u2019 fiscal years and the AmeriCorps program\u2019s operating year, we compared state commissions\u2019 operating budgets on the basis of their federal fiscal year 1996 allocations.", "Because the data are self-reported and unverified, and we reviewed a judgmentally selected sample of state commissions, our results cannot be generalized beyond the commissions and programs studied.

The board has the authority to review and approve the strategic plan and proposed grant decisions. The Corporation provides grants to AmeriCorps projects directly and through states. To receive AmeriCorps funds, states must establish commissions on national service. These state commissions must have between 15 and 25 members and be composed of representatives from a variety of fields, including local government, existing national service programs, local labor organizations, and community-based organizations.

To earn a part-time award, a participant must perform 900 hours of community service within 2 years (or within 3 years in the case of participants who are full-time college students). Individuals can serve more than two terms; however, they can receive only federally funded benefits, including education awards, for two terms.

Participants released for cause are ineligible to receive an education award and may disqualify themselves from future service in AmeriCorps. Participants may be released for cause for a variety of reasons, including being convicted of a felony, chronic truancy, or consistent failure to follow directions. In addition, participants released for cause may include those who leave a project early to take advantage of significant opportunities for personal development or growth, such as educational or professional advancement. Education awards, which are held in trust by the U.S. Treasury, are paid directly to qualified postsecondary institutions or student loan lenders and must be used within 7 years after service is completed.", "In addition to the education award, AmeriCorps*State/National participants receive a living allowance stipend that is at least equivalent to, but no more than double, the average annual living allowance received by VISTA volunteers\u2014about $7,500 for full-time participants in fiscal year 1996.

They said they sought input from a broad cross-section of individuals and organizations to ensure extensive input in identifying state service needs. Most commission officials said they solicited public comment through local and regional meetings and other public forums. For example, one commission mailed meeting announcements to various government, nonprofit, and community-based organizations. Another commission mailed over 1,000 invitations to various service programs and individuals. Another state commission used interactive computer technology to coordinate input from 60 individuals collectively representing over 250 organizations.", "After developing state plans and prioritizing service needs, commissions used a variety of measures to identify, develop, and select AmeriCorps projects. For example, while some commissions published request-for-proposals packages, others solicited proposals from existing community service and government agencies, and some held regional meetings around the state where local organizations identified community needs and proposed projects to address them. In general, state commissions convened review panels to assess project proposals and rank them according to how well they met the state\u2019s needs and priorities as established in the state\u2019s strategic plan. One review panel was composed only of the commissioners themselves; others used panels made up of commissioners, commission staff, and local service project officials; while another included citizens with academic and public service backgrounds.
