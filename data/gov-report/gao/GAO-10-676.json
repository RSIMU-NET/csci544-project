GAO issued its latest assessment of MDA's progress covering fiscal year 2009 in February 2010. This report supplements that assessment to provide further insight into MDA's prime contractor performance for fiscal year 2009. Prime contractors track earned value management (EVM) by making comparisons that inform the program as to whether the contractor is completing work at the cost budgeted and whether the work scheduled is being completed on time. Our analysis of contractor EVM data included examining contract performance reports for 14 BMDS contracts, reviewing the latest integrated baseline reviews, performing extensive analysis of data anomalies, and conducting interviews with Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) officials--the independent reviewers of MDA contractor EVM systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Unlike GAO's reports in previous years, GAO was unable to analyze the EVM data for all MDA contracts. GAO determined that the data for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) and Targets and Countermeasures programs were not sufficiently reliable to include in our report because of instability in these programs' baselines. When the baseline on which the work is performed and measured against is no longer representative of the program of record, program managers and other decision makers lose the ability to develop constructive corrective action plans to get the program on track. Specifically, without reliable EVM data, GAO was unable to identify significant performance drivers or forecast future cost and schedule performance. Because the two contracts associated with these programs represent half of the budgeted cost at completion for the 14 contracts GAO reviewed, GAO also determined it was not appropriate in this report to aggregate total projected underruns or overruns of the remaining 12 prime contracts as GAO has in prior reports. The GMD prime contractor performance data was not sufficiently reliable to use as the basis for analysis because the contractor was unable to update its baseline to include numerous changes to the program and modifications to the contract. Despite three large restructures since 2007 totaling over $2 billion, the GMD program has not conducted an integrated baseline review since December 2006. DOD acquisition policy states that an integrated baseline review is to be conducted within 6 months after contract award, exercise of contract options, or a major modification to an existing contract. The Director, MDA has taken extra steps to gain insight into the contractor's performance. Further, he intends to report EVM information to Congress annually. Similarly, the EVM data for the Targets and Countermeasures contractor is also not sufficiently reliable to use in our analysis. DCMA identified several issues with the stability of the Targets and Countermeasures program baseline including a large amount of schedule and quantity changes to planned flight tests and over 20 contract changes to the scope of work or corrective actions to quality issues for one of the delivery orders over the course of a year. Because the contractor has not been able to update the established budget in the baseline, the cost performance reports do not reflect an appropriate baseline against which to measure cost and schedule progress. Nine of the remaining twelve contracts experienced cost overruns for fiscal year 2009 mostly because of issues with maturing technologies, immature designs, or other technical issues. For example, the Airborne Laser contractor experienced a failure in some of the system's optics which required it to develop and procure new high power optics, delaying the test schedule and increasing program cost."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that MDA resolve prime contractor EVM data reliability issues by the beginning of fiscal year 2011.

The  Missile Defense Agency (MDA), established to develop and deploy these  missile defense capabilities, began delivering an initial capability by  concurrently developing and fielding assets. MDA is the DOD\u2019s largest  single acquisition program\u2014spending from approximately $7 billion to  $9.5 billion per year.", "To more effectively manage complex investments such as these, in  December 1996 the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and  Technology signed a memorandum announcing DOD\u2019s adoption of  industry standards for earned value management (EVM) systems for use  on defense acquisitions.

Congress directed GAO in its  fiscal year 2002, 2007, and 2008 National Defense Authorization Acts, to  assess the cost, schedule, testing, and performance progress that MDA is  making in developing the BMDS. We have delivered assessments of  MDA\u2019s progress covering fiscal years 2003 through 2009, issuing our latest  assessment of fiscal year 2009 in February 2010. As we reported in our  February 2010 report, although our annual assessments usually include  analysis of EVM data for MDA contractors, this year we are reporting on  this information separately.", "To assess progress during fiscal year 2009, we examined contract  performance reports for 14 BMDS contracts that were managed by eight  BMDS program elements. However, we were only able to report our  analysis of EVM data for 12 of these 14 contracts in appendix II due to  concerns with data reliability. The data for the Ground-based Midcourse  Defense and the Targets and Countermeasures contracts were not  sufficiently reliable for inclusion in our analysis. The 14 contracts we  reviewed EVM data for are:     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) weapon system software;   two Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IA contracts for   a fourth lot of 27 missiles and   another lot of 24 missiles;    Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IA and IB missile technology development and    Airborne Laser (ABL);   three Sensors\u2019 contracts    BMDS radars,    Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance\u2014Model 2 (AN/TPY- 2) radar #7, and     Thule upgraded early warning radar;     Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications    Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD);     Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS);     Targets and Countermeasures; and   two Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) contracts for    development and   fire unit fielding production.", "Because we were only able to analyze EVM data for 12 of 14 contracts, this  report does not provide a BMDS-level analysis as we have provided in  previous years, again, because of data reliability concerns. To perform our  review of the EVM data for 14 contracts, we included several checks to  ensure data reliability including reviewing the most current  documentation on contractor performance data systems for each of the  contractor sites, reviewing the latest integrated baseline review (IBR) for  each contract, and following up with each program office to track how  identified risks are being addressed. In addition, we checked the reliability  of the performance data by consulting with earned value experts who  provided us with tools to perform extensive analysis to independently  review the data. We followed up on the results of this analysis tool with  the program office and further reviewed its responses with the Defense  Contract Management Agency (DCMA), which independently reviews all  of the MDA contractor EVM systems. Our scope and methodology is  discussed in more detail in appendix III.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2010 to July 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["MDA\u2019s mission is to develop an integrated and layered BMDS to defend the  United States, its deployed forces, allies, and friends. In order to meet this  mission, MDA is developing a highly complex system of systems\u2014land-,  sea- and space-based sensors, interceptors and battle management. Since  its initiation in 2002, MDA has been given a significant amount of flexibility  in executing the development and fielding of the BMDS. To enable MDA to  field and enhance a missile defense system quickly, the Secretary of  Defense in 2002 delayed the entry of the BMDS program into the DOD\u2019s  traditional acquisition process until a mature capability was ready to be  handed over to a military service for production and operation. Because  MDA does not follow the traditional acquisition process, it has not yet  triggered certain statutory and regulatory requirements that other major  defense acquisition programs are required to adhere to.", "For example, other major defense acquisition programs are required to  establish the total scope of work and total cost baselines as part of their  entry into the formal acquisition cycle. Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.)  section 2435 requires a baseline description for major defense acquisition  programs, however the requirement to establish a baseline is not triggered  until a system enters into system development and demonstration.  DOD  has implemented this requirement with the acquisition program baseline in  its acquisition policy. Because the BMDS has not yet formally entered the  acquisition cycle, it has not yet been required to meet the minimum  requirements of section 2435. Therefore, because of the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s decision to delay entry of the BMDS system into the acquisition  cycle, MDA is not required to establish the full scope of work or total cost  baselines. Since we began annual reporting on missile defense in 2004, we  have been unable to assess overall progress on cost. As a result, one of the  only tools available for us to use in assessing BMDS costs is the costs  reported on individual contracts.", "MDA employs prime contractors to accomplish different tasks that are  needed to develop and field the BMDS. Prime contractors receive the bulk  of funds MDA requests each year and work to provide the hardware and  software for elements of the BMDS.", "Table 1 provides a brief description of eight BMDS elements and the prime  contracts associated with these elements currently under development by  MDA.", "Each BMDS program office\u2019s prime contractor provides monthly earned  value reports which provide insight into the dollar gained or lost for each  dollar invested. These Contract Performance Reports compare monthly  progress to the existing cost or schedule performance baseline to reveal  whether the work scheduled is being completed on time and if the work is  being completed at the cost budgeted. For example, if the contractor was  able to complete more work than scheduled and for less cost than  budgeted, the contractor reports a positive schedule and cost variance, or  \u201cunderrun\u201d. Alternatively, if the contractor was not able to complete the  work in the scheduled time period and spent more than budgeted, the  contractor reports both a negative schedule and cost variance, or  \u201coverrun\u201d. The results can also be mixed by, for example, completing the  work ahead of schedule (a positive schedule variance) but spending more  than budgeted to do so (a negative cost variance).", "We also used contract performance report data to base projections of  likely overrun or underrun of each prime contractor\u2019s budgeted cost at  completion. Our projections of overruns or underruns to the budgeted cost  at completion are based on the assumption that the contractor will  continue to perform in the future as it has in the past. In addition, since the  budgeted cost at completion provides the basis for our projected overruns,  we also provide it for each contract we assessed in appendix II.", "In addition, as part of the yearly system compliance verification process,  DCMA conducts a periodic surveillance of contractor EVM systems to  determine initial and continuing compliance of those management systems  with government accepted standards. Surveillance (routine evaluation  and assessment) of the EVM systems is mandatory for all contracts that  require EVM systems compliance.  Surveillance ensures that the  contractor is meeting contractual terms and conditions and is in  compliance with applicable policies and regulations. DCMA has primary  responsibility for surveillance of the prime contractor and sub-tier  suppliers with EVM requirements. According to a DCMA Earned Value  Management Center official responsible for leading system surveillance, at  the completion of the assessment, the DCMA Earned Value Management  Center submits to the contracting officer a status of the contractor\u2019s EVM  system compliance, including all supporting data to that effect.", "If deficiencies are found during the course of the surveillance process, it is  the surveillance team\u2019s responsibility, working through DCMA\u2019s Earned  Value Management Center, to issue a written corrective action request.  The purpose of a corrective action request is to formally notify the  contractor that a documented course of action in the form of a corrective  action plan is needed to bring the EVM system in compliance with  government accepted EVM system guidelines. Corrective action requests  range in severity from Level I to Level IV where, according to a DCMA  Earned Value Management Center official responsible for leading system  surveillance, Level I is for non-compliance with the Defense Federal  Regulation Acquisition Supplement clauses in the contract that can be  corrected immediately and for which no special management attention is  required, and Level IV identifies issues where cost, schedule, technical  performance, resources, or management process issues have unfavorably  affected the supplier's EVM so that it is incapable of reporting meaningful  EVM across multiple programs or multiple sites; and these issues have not  been corrected. Level III and IV corrective action requests may trigger  formal reviews such as post award review for cause, compliance reviews,  or other system validation reviews and may result in suspension or  revocation of EVM systems certification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EVM Data for the GMD and Targets and Countermeasures Programs Are Not Sufficiently Reliable", "paragraphs": ["For GMD and Targets and Countermeasures, we determined that the EVM  data were not sufficiently reliable to analyze these contracts\u2019 cost and  schedule performance because of instability in these programs. Without  reliable EVM data, we are unable to identify significant performance  drivers or forecast future cost and schedule performance. Further, when  the baseline on which the work is performed and measured against is no  longer representative of the program of record, program managers and  other decision makers lose the ability to develop constructive corrective  action plans to get the program on track. These reliability issues affect  MDA\u2019s oversight of contractor progress and both MDA and GAO\u2019s ability  to report this progress to external parties and Congress. MDA officials  were aware that significant changes were not reflected in the baselines for  these two elements and have been conducting more extensive oversight to  compensate, but did not alert us to this issue during the course of our  audit. The Director, MDA has acknowledged the importance of EVM and  to address some of these issues he has enacted quarterly reviews of each  of the program\u2019s baselines. Further, he intends to report EVM information  to Congress annually.", "According to DCMA officials, there were several issues associated with the  Boeing EVM system for GMD. One of the main issues was the contractor\u2019s  inability to maintain a consistent performance measurement baseline.  With numerous changes to the program and modifications to the contract,  the contractor experienced difficulty incorporating these changes into the  baseline in order to measure performance against this new work. For  example, although the GMD program experienced a $1.3 billion dollar  restructure in 2007, another major restructure beginning in fiscal year 2008  for over $500 million that was completed in fiscal year 2009, and a third  in fiscal year 2010 for over $380 million, the GMD program has not  conducted an IBR since December 2006.DOD\u2019s acquisition policy states  that an IBR is to be conducted within 6 months after contract award,  exercise of contract options, or major modifications to a contract.DCMA  officials told us that the GMD program had an IBR underway following the  restructure that began in fiscal year 2008 and completed in fiscal year  2009, but in May 2009 the program was again redirected and the baseline  review was cancelled.", "The Director, MDA explained that some of the GMD program\u2019s baseline  instability from frequent restructures was related to the changing GMD  role in European defense. The February 2007 budget request for fiscal year  2008 included an approach to European defense focused on GBIs from the  GMD element and a large fixed radar as well as transportable X-Band  radars. In September 2009, the administration altered its approach to  European defense and instead constructed a defense system to consist  primarily of Aegis BMD sea-based and land-based systems and  interceptors, as well as various sensors to be deployed over time as the  various capabilities are matured. The Director told us that these European  capability requirements changes drastically affected the GMD program as  a significant amount of work had to be restructured.", "During these three to four years of GMD baseline instability, the Director,  MDA told us that MDA took steps to gain additional insight into the  contractor\u2019s progress. The program held added reviews in the absence of  IBRs to understand planned near-term effort and how well they were  executing against those plans. In addition, the Director told us that the  program held monthly focus sessions during which the joint government  and contractor teams briefed the status of progress and risks. The Director  acknowledged that these insights are necessary to understand the meaning  of the near-term EVM data. However, without the benefit of a documented  IBR after multiple larger restructures to the program or being made aware  of MDA\u2019s added reviews, we do not have sufficient confidence in the GMD  program performance measurement baseline to reliably analyze the  existing EVM data.", "Boeing and MDA are taking steps to address problems with the reliability  of the contractor\u2019s EVM data. The contractor had planned to deliver a  performance measurement baseline by May 2010 and the GMD program is  planning to conduct a series of IBRs on the remaining prime and major  subcontractor effort beginning in July 2010. In addition, the contractor is  taking initiatives to put a performance measurement baseline in place as  quickly as possible and is providing additional training for its management  and control account managers in charge of EVM. The Director, MDA told  us that MDA was changing how its future contracts for the GMD program  are being structured to be more receptive to modifications. This new  contract structure will include dividing the work into delivery orders so  that modifications will be reflected at a delivery order level instead of  affecting a larger contract. These steps may help resolve the EVM issues;  however we cannot determine the full effect of these steps until further  evaluation after their full implementation.", "Similarly, we have determined that the EVM data for the Targets and  Countermeasures contractor, Lockheed Martin Space Systems, are not  sufficiently reliable for inclusion in our analysis. Based on discussions  with and reports issued by DCMA, the Targets and Countermeasures  contractor was unable to update its baseline because of numerous  program changes. In September 2007, when the delivery order for the  launch vehicle-2 was approximately 60 percent complete, Lockheed Martin  signaled that its baseline was no longer valid by requesting a formal  reprogramming of the effort to include an overrun in its baseline for this  delivery order. MDA allowed the contractor to perform a schedule  rebaseline and remove schedule variances \u2013 but did not provide any more  budget for the recognized overrun in the performance measurement  baseline. As a result, DCMA reported that the performance indicators for  this delivery order, needed to estimate a contract cost at completion, were  unrealistic. According to the Director, MDA did not believe the contractor  had justified that there was a scope change warranting additional budget  in the performance measurement baseline. He said he believed doing so  would mask problems the contractor was experiencing planning and  executing the contract which he identified as the issue as opposed to  changes in the contract\u2019s scope. According to the Director, one example of  the issues the contractor was experiencing on this delivery order included  a failure rate of 64 percent on production qualification components. MDA  has since completed the work on this delivery order and begun managing  follow-on target production on a newly established delivery order.", "In addition, during fiscal year 2009 DCMA identified several issues with the  stability of the Targets and Countermeasures program baseline. For  example, program changes since fiscal year 2008 on one delivery order  included over 20 contract changes to the scope of work or corrective  actions to quality issues. In addition, the schedule and quantity of planned  flight tests changed significantly. During the fiscal year, DCMA submitted a  corrective action request for noncompliance with incorporating authorized  changes in a timely manner although the contractor was able to close this  issue before the end of the reporting period. Because of the instability in  the baseline and the contractor\u2019s inability to update the baseline with  these frequent changes, we determined the cost performance reports for  2009 do not reflect an appropriate baseline against which to measure cost  and schedule progress.", "According to the Director, MDA, the agency has undertaken a major effort  to stabilize the Targets and Countermeasures program. MDA has  established a new target acquisition strategy to address recurring target  performance issues and increases in target costs. In this new strategy, the  agency will buy generic targets in larger lots that are not tied to a  particular test instead of smaller lots. This effort should also help increase  MDA\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing program requirements. In  addition, the Director, MDA told us that the Director of Engineering at  MDA will define target requirements instead of the program manager  which should also help create more stability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Despite Non-Compliance Ratings for MDA Prime Contractor EVM Systems, Most Were Sufficiently Reliable for GAO Review", "paragraphs": ["During the course of our review, we found that DCMA assessed 7 of the 14  contractors\u2019 EVM systems as noncompliant in fiscal year 2009.

During the  course of our audit, we interviewed DCMA representatives at each of the  contractor sites to understand the basis for the noncompliance  determination and to gain information to help us assess the reliability of  the data.", "For example, the EVM system of the STSS contractor Northrop Grumman  was deemed noncompliant because of two low-level corrective action  requests related to issues with other contracts that did not materially  affect the performance baseline for the STSS contract we assessed. Also,  the C2BMC\u2019s contractor Lockheed Martin Information Systems & Global  Services received a rating of noncompliant during 2009 because of a  corrective action request that stated that major subcontractor efforts were  not specifically identified, assigned, or tracked in the organizational  breakdown structure. However, after the noncompliant rating was given,  DCMA reversed its decision and decided to close the corrective action  without requiring the contractor to change its methods.", "In addition, although DCMA was unable to assess two EVM systems during  2009 for Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors under the Aegis  BMD weapon system contract, and Lockheed Martin Space Systems  Company under the two THAAD contracts, we determined that the  reasons for the unassessed rating did not lead to issues with data  reliability. According to the DCMA EVM specialist responsible for  monitoring the Aegis BMD weapon system, the Aegis BMD weapon system  contractor was unassessed because some of the accounting guidelines  could not be assessed in time for the compliance rating. In addition, the  THAAD contractor was not assessed because, according to DCMA,  although the contractor had addressed the open corrective action  requests, DCMA did not have the resources to review and document the  effectiveness of those actions in order to close these items before the end  of the rating assessment period.

Cumulative variances are the overruns  or underruns the contractor has earned since the contract began. In order  to calculate fiscal year variances, we determined the contractor\u2019s  cumulative variances at the end of September 2008 and subtracted them  from the cumulative variances at the end of September 2009. Fiscal year  2009 variances give us an idea of the contractor\u2019s performance trends  during the fiscal year. A contractor may have cumulative overruns but  underrun its fiscal year budgeted cost or schedule by improving its cost  performance over the course of the fiscal year.", "In our graphs, positive fiscal year variances (underrunning cost or  schedule) are indicated by increasing performance trend lines and  negative fiscal year variances (overrunning cost or schedule) are shown by  decreasing performance trend lines. In our notional example in Figure 1,  the positive slope of the cost variances line indicates that the contractor is  underrunning fiscal year budgeted cost. Specifically, the contractor began  the fiscal year with a negative cumulative cost variance of $7.0 million but  ended the fiscal year with a negative cumulative cost variance of $1.0  million. That means that the contractor underran its fiscal year budgeted  costs by $6.0 million and therefore has a positive $6.0 million fiscal year  cost variance.
