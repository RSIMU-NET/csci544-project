GAO designated NFIP as a high-risk area in March 2006, and as of December 2007, FEMA owed more than $17.3 billion to the Treasury for hurricane-related losses. Concerns have been raised about the financial condition of NFIP and FEMA's efforts to mitigate losses and monitor NFIP contractors. This report (1) describes statistical and financial trends for NFIP from 1997 through 2006, (2) assesses the extent to which flood-damaged properties were purchased to mitigate risk, and (3) evaluates procedures for monitoring NFIP-related contracts. For this study, GAO analyzed financial and statistical data on the NFIP and its mitigation programs, reviewed documentation of contract monitoring activities, and interviewed FEMA officials and contractors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of federal flood insurance policies in force nationwide increased 36 percent from 1997 through 2006, but most homeowners at risk of flooding still lacked such insurance. While average insurance amounts (per policy) increased 78 percent from 1997 through 2006--consistent with rising home values--the average premium decreased 3 percent from 1997 through 2006, likely driven in part by the increase in policies sold in moderate- to low-risk areas. Conversely, loss amounts fluctuated by year, peaking at more than $17.7 billion in 2005. Seventy-nine percent of the funds paid out through NFIP from 1997 through 2006 were for hurricane-related claims, but the percentages in individual years varied widely (correlating with hurricane activity). Finally, the extent of claim payments attributed to repetitive loss properties (those with two or more claims in a rolling 10-year period) increased from 1997 through 2006, from $3.7 billion to nearly $8 billion, with the most significant increases resulting from the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Because of data limitations, GAO was not able to determine the actual number of properties acquired through FEMA mitigation programs, which are intended to minimize the damage and financial impact of floods. Information on completed mitigation projects (which encompass multiple properties) indicates that about one-third of properties approved for acquisition from 1997 to 2006 were acquired. However, these data are limited because they do not include a count of properties acquired in ongoing projects. Projects may take several years to complete, and FEMA does not report properties acquired until a project is complete. Further, FEMA collected property acquisition data (for completed projects) in an ad hoc manner because FEMA's grants management system lacks the capability to record acquisition data. As a result, FEMA cannot readily determine the extent to which flood-damaged and repetitive loss properties have been acquired through its mitigation programs. Lack of monitoring records, inconsistent application of procedures, and lack of coordination have diminished the effectiveness of FEMA monitoring of NFIP-related contracts. While federal internal control standards state that records should be properly maintained, FEMA did not consistently follow its monitoring procedures for preparing or maintaining monitoring reports and was unable to provide copies of the majority of monitoring reports GAO requested. Further, FEMA offices did not coordinate information and actions relating to contractor deficiencies and payments. In some cases, key officials were unaware of decisions on contractor performance. As a result, FEMA cannot consistently ensure adherence to contract requirements and lacks information critical for effective oversight of key contractors. Given the reliance of NFIP upon contractors, it is important that FEMA have in place adequate controls that are consistently applied to all contracts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the signing of the Bunning-Bereuter-Blumenauer Flood  Insurance Reform Act of 2004, which reauthorized the National Flood  Insurance Program (NFIP) through September 30, 2008, the United States  experienced back-to-back catastrophic hurricane seasons and experienced  nearly $20 billion in flood-insurance losses. Because NFIP premium rates  have been set to cover losses in an average year (that is, based on \u201caverage  historical losses\u201d), the program has been unable to set aside sufficient  funds to meet future expected losses. According to the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), which administers NFIP, claims from Hurricane Katrina  alone have totaled in excess of $16.3 billion, as of October 2007. The  Katrina-related claims represent more than eight times the amount for  claims in 2004 and surpass (by more than $1 billion) the aggregate amount  of all claims previously paid in the nearly 40-year history of NFIP.", "In response to the magnitude and severity of losses from the 2005  hurricanes, Congress increased NFIP\u2019s borrowing authority from the  Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to $20.8 billion. As of December  2007, FEMA owed more than $17.3 billion to Treasury, an amount the  program is unlikely to be able to repay while paying future claims with its  current premium income of about $2 billion annually. We designated NFIP  as a high-risk area in March 2006 because the program likely will not  generate sufficient revenues to repay the billions it borrowed from the  Treasury to cover flood claims from the 2005 hurricanes. In addition, it is  unlikely that NFIP\u2014a key component of the federal government\u2019s efforts  to minimize the damage and financial impact of floods\u2014could cover  catastrophic losses in future years. The insufficient revenues highlight  structural weaknesses in how the program is funded, and Congress is  considering a number of legislative changes to improve NFIP\u2019s financial  solvency.", "NFIP was created in 1968 in part to provide some insurance protection for  flood victims because private insurers were (and largely still are) unwilling  to bear the economic risks associated with the potentially catastrophic  impact of flooding. NFIP also provides incentives for communities to  adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future  flood damage. Such incentives include mitigation programs that provide  grants to acquire and demolish flood-prone structures that NFIP insures  and perform other activities (such as elevating buildings) to reduce or  eliminate flood losses and insurance claims. Floods are the most common  and destructive natural disasters in the United States. According to NFIP  statistics, 90 percent of all natural disasters in the United States involve  flooding. In previous work, we reported that between 1980 and 2005, about  97 percent of the U.S. population lived in a county that had at least one  declared flood disaster, and 45 percent lived in a county that had six or  more flood disaster declarations. Under NFIP, federally backed flood  insurance is available to homeowners and other property owners in  communities that adopt and enforce local floodplain ordinances. Finally,  FEMA makes extensive use of contractors to implement NFIP. For  example, about 68 FEMA employees, assisted by about 170 contract  employees, manage and oversee NFIP.", "As agreed with your staff, this report    describes trends for NFIP policies, insurance amounts, premiums, and  losses from 1997 through 2006, and the extent to which NFIP losses  were attributable to hurricanes and repetitive loss properties;    assesses how the amounts available for the purchase of flood-damaged  and repetitive loss properties changed over time, and the extent to  which FEMA purchased flood-damaged and repetitive loss properties;  and    evaluates the extent to which FEMA followed its procedures for  monitoring selected NFIP-related contracts.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed data on NFIP policies, insurance  amounts, premiums, and losses for calendar years 1997 through 2006 and  assessed the reliability of these data. In addition, we analyzed available  data on funds available for three NFIP-funded mitigation programs and  properties purchased in connection with two of these programs. We  reviewed monthly contractor monitoring reports and documentation of  contract-specific monitoring policies and procedures at FEMA. We also  assessed the extent to which these procedures were followed for two of  the largest NFIP-related contracts\u2014the Bureau and Statistical Agent  (BSA) and Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) contracts\u2014upon which FEMA  relies to collect all financial and statistical data related to NFIP and  directly sell and service flood insurance policies. Finally, we interviewed  FEMA officials in Washington, D.C., and Virginia and NFIP contractors  based in Kansas and Maryland. Appendix I provides more information on  our scope and methodology. We conducted this performance audit from  March 2007 to June 2008 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["NFIP was established in the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to  provide policyholders with some insurance coverage for flood damage, as  an alternative to disaster assistance, and to try to reduce the escalating  costs of repairing flood damage. NFIP has mapped flood risks, assigning a  flood zone designation based on the risk level for flooding (see table 1 for  examples), which is a factor in determining premium rates.", "To participate in NFIP, communities agree to enforce regulations for land  use and new construction in high-risk flood zones. As of May 2007, more  than 20,300 communities across the United States and its territories  participated in NFIP by adopting and agreeing to enforce state and  community floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood  damage. Although community participation in the program is voluntary,  homeowners with mortgages from federally regulated lenders on  properties in special high-risk, flood hazard areas are required to purchase  flood insurance on their dwellings for at least the outstanding mortgage  amount, up to the maximum policy limit of $250,000. Optional, lower-cost  coverage also is available under NFIP to protect homes in areas of  moderate- to low-risk. In addition, owners of properties built before NFIP  officially mapped a community (known as pre-FIRM properties, referring  to the Flood Insurance Rate Map) pay premiums that do not reflect their  true risk because Congress authorized subsidized insurance rates to be  made available for policies covering certain structures to encourage  communities to join the program. To insure other personal property items  against flood damage, homeowners may purchase separate NFIP personal  property (or \u201ccontents\u201d) coverage, up to the maximum coverage limit of  $100,000.", "In addition to mapping and categorizing flood risk zones, FEMA also has  developed two estimates of potential losses to help set rates and develop  information relating to losses. FEMA introduced the concept of the  average historical loss year\u2014the purpose of which is to estimate the  amount of premium that would be sufficient to pay for losses resulting  from the type of loss years that previously occurred. According to FEMA,  this estimate is used as one indicator in setting subsidized premium rates.  FEMA also prepares a catastrophic loss year estimate, usually every other  year, to provide Congress with an informal guide on the losses that could  occur in the event of a storm that would have 0.1 percent chance of  occurring in a given year (a 1 in a 1,000 year event).", "For more than a decade, FEMA has pursued a variety of strategies to  reduce the number of repetitive loss properties, which are insurable  buildings for which NFIP paid two or more claims of more than $1,000  within any rolling 10-year period. For example, NFIP funds three  mitigation programs, the FMA program, the RFC program, and the SRL  pilot program. The purpose of the FMA program is to fund activities that  reduce or eliminate the long-term risk of flood damage to buildings and  other structures insured by NFIP, such as property acquisition. The FMA  program requires applicants to provide a portion of the funds for the  proposed mitigation activities. If the applicant cannot secure funding for  the proposed activities, FEMA may contribute 100 percent of the funding  through the RFC program, which is specifically designed to mitigate  repetitive loss properties (structures insured by NFIP that have had one or  more claim payments for flood damages). Finally, the SRL program is  designed for repetitive loss properties that have at least four claim  payments of more than $5,000 each. See table 2 for more information on  these mitigation programs.", "NFIP staff are located at FEMA headquarters in Washington, D.C., and 10  regional offices. Their functions include tasks for administering mitigation  grant programs such as processing applications for grant funds and  distributing the funds to eligible applicants. While FEMA establishes  policies and procedures for NFIP, and has some staff dedicated to the  management of the program, FEMA relies on contractors to administer  key aspects of the program. Contractors collect NFIP data, market the  program, and sell specific flood-insurance policies. Private insurance  companies that participate in FEMA\u2019s Write Your Own (WYO) program  largely are responsible for insurance sales and claims adjustment.", "At the time of our work, there were four major ongoing contracts in place  for NFIP, two of which we reviewed in this report. For example, FEMA  awards a contract for a BSA, which is responsible for conducting financial  and statistical reporting based upon data submissions from the 92 WYO  companies, developing forms and information related to NFIP, and  providing various data analyses. The BSA contract that was effective  from September 2005 through December 2007 was valued at $38 million.  FEMA also awards a contract for a DSA, which is responsible for selling  and servicing standard and group insurance for policies that are not sold  through WYOs. For that agent, the value of the contract in effect from  September 2003 to September 2008 is $26.5 million.", "Two offices in FEMA are responsible for contracts and contract oversight  (see fig. 1). A Contracting Officer in the Acquisition Operations Branch  awards contracts related to NFIP and has responsibility for determining  the adequacy of a contractor\u2019s performance. The Program Management  Office also has responsibilities for overseeing each contractor\u2019s  performance. A COTR is assigned to each contract. The COTR is  authorized to act on behalf of the Contracting Officer to monitor the  contract. However, the COTR is not authorized to make any contractual  commitments or contractual changes on behalf of FEMA; any changes that  the contractor deems may affect the contract, price, terms, or conditions  are referred to the Contracting Officer in the Acquisition Operations  Branch for action. Each COTR is assisted by monitors, who review and  report on technical aspects of the contractor\u2019s performance such as  compliance with specific contract terms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policies and Insurance Amounts Increased, Premiums Decreased, and Losses Fluctuated from 1997 through 2006 with Hurricane Activities", "paragraphs": ["Overall, data relating to the number of NFIP policies and amount of  insurance coverage indicated upward trends for the period we reviewed  and most losses were paid for hurricane-related claims, primarily due to  losses from the 2005 hurricane season.

The average premium per flood-insurance policy decreased 3  percent, but when analyzed by flood risk zone, average premiums  increased in the high-risk coastal flood zone, from about $1,039 in 1997 to  more than $1,400 in 2006. Over this period, total losses fluctuated from a  low of $302 million in 2000 to a high of $2 billion in 2004 before reaching  more than $17.7 billion in 2005. In 5 of the 10 years reviewed, less than 10  percent of losses paid out were linked to hurricane-related damage, and  over the 10-year period cumulative losses for repetitive loss properties  increased from $3.7 billion to $7.9 billion.

While the number of policies in force has  increased, a 2006 study commissioned by FEMA estimated that about half  of the single-family homes in special flood hazard areas nationwide do not  have flood insurance policies. Moreover, the study estimated that market  penetration outside of special flood hazard areas is about 1 percent.", "The average amount of insurance coverage per policy in force increased  from about $158,000 in 1997 to almost $214,000 at the end of 2006, an  increase of 78 percent (see table 3).

According to FEMA, the average premium has been influenced by  changes in two types of flood zones. First, the average premium has been  strongly influenced by changes in the moderate- to low-risk flood zones,  where policies as a percentage of the total policies in force have increased  greatly primarily due to increased sales of Preferred Risk Policies, FEMA\u2019s  lowest-cost flood insurance policy. Second, average annual premium per  policy has been influenced by the steep increase in the average premium  of high-risk coastal zone policies, but because they make up a smaller  percent of policies in force, this increase did not drive up the average  policy premium. As figure 3 illustrates, the average premium increased in  the high-risk coastal zone the most (41 percent), from about $1,039 in 1997  to more than $1,400 at the end of 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Total Losses Fluctuated in the Period We Reviewed, and the Majority of Losses Were Attributable to Hurricanes", "paragraphs": ["With the exception of 2005, the amount that FEMA paid out in losses over  the 10- year period fluctuated between a low of $302 million in 2000 and a  high of $2 billion in 2004 (see fig. 4). Losses refer to the amount that  FEMA paid to settle flood insurance claims and are recorded for the year  in which the loss occurred. For example, if a flood damaged an insured  property in 2005, but the claim was not paid until 2006, the amount paid  out would be recorded as a 2005 loss.

While FEMA has tried to  decrease the portfolio of repetitive loss properties, during this same  period, the net cumulative number of repetitive loss properties increased  approximately 64 percent, from 76,000 to 125,000 (see fig. 6). Clearly,  repetitive loss properties continue to be a problem for NFIP. While these  repetitive loss properties account for about 1 percent of NFIP-insured  properties, they account for between 25 and 30 percent of all flood claims.  We could not determine the extent to which losses paid in a given year  were attributable to repetitive loss properties because FEMA collects net  cumulative, not annual, data on such losses.

The estimate is also part  of the calculation that FEMA uses to determine the minimum subsidy  price that should be charged for pre-FIRM flood insurance policies. When  this calculation is used, it ensures that sufficient premiums are collected,  in aggregate, to cover at least the average annual loss as determined by  historical data (see app. II). This estimate increased from 1997 to 2005  because it is annually updated with the previous years\u2019 flooding activity.

However, FEMA  officials stated that the agency does not require FEMA regional offices to  record property acquisitions until an entire project closes. Internal control  standards for the federal government direct that transactions be promptly  recorded to maintain their relevance and value to management in  controlling operations and making decisions. While FEMA guidance for  mitigation programs requires grantees to submit quarterly performance  reports on significant activities, whether work will be completed within  the performance period, and cost information, this guidance does not  explicitly require the reporting of property acquisitions. The lack of an  explicit requirement for FEMA regional offices to record property  acquisitions data in a consistent and timely manner hinders FEMA\u2019s ability  to account for the extent to which flood-damaged and repetitive loss  properties have been acquired through its mitigation programs (thereby  decreasing the inventory of these properties).", "In addition to lacking a requirement to record acquisition data promptly, the  information system that FEMA currently uses for the NFIP mitigation  programs does not record property acquisition data at all. Prior to 2004,  FEMA regional staff recorded data on properties acquired through closed  projects into FEMA\u2019s National Emergency Management Information System  (NEMIS). In 2004, FEMA transitioned from NEMIS to the Electronic Grants  Management System (eGrants) in an effort to meet the intent of the  Electronic Government (eGovernment) initiative. While eGrants was  envisioned to help manage all phases of grants, the system currently assists in  the front end of the grant life cycle by providing grant applicants the ability to  electronically search and apply for grants. The eGrants system does not have  the capability to capture any acquisition data. That is, eGrants records neither  ongoing nor completed property acquisition data for FEMA\u2019s mitigation  programs. According to FEMA officials, FEMA is in the process of  consolidating all nondisaster grants into one information system that will  support the entire grants life cycle from solicitation through closeout. The  enhanced information system will track property acquisitions in real-time and  will have project closeout capabilities; however, this information system is  not scheduled to be completed until 2010. Until the nondisaster grants  management system is developed, FEMA will continue to manage grants  using eGrants, despite its limited capabilities.", "While FEMA\u2019s headquarters officials explained that, since 2004 their  regional staff have used paper files and electronic spreadsheets to  maintain information on property acquisitions for closed projects, FEMA  did not provide information on project closures that have occurred since  2004 for the FMA program because they could not easily collect the  information from their regional offices. Specifically, when we requested  property acquisition data for the 10-year period of our review, FEMA was  able to provide data on closed projects for 1997 through 2003 (6 of 10  years) for the FMA program, and for 2006, the first year of the RFC  program. FEMA had to collect data from at least two information systems  for the FMA program and from paper files for the RFC program. GAO has  previously reported on the continued lack of standardization and other  inefficiencies in grant administration across agencies, including not  aligning federal grant processes with typical grantees\u2019 business processes,  inadequate advance information on potential grant availability, and  unexplained delays in grant awards. However, a lack of standardization  does not preclude FEMA from having a mechanism that allows it to  effectively track real-time property acquisition data.", "As a result of the limitations of eGrants in capturing property acquisition  data, FEMA cannot readily determine the extent to which NFIP-funded  mitigation programs have been reducing or eliminating the risk of losses  from repetitive loss properties, a key measure needed to determine the  effectiveness of the program. Coupled with lack of a requirement for staff  to consistently and promptly record acquisitions data, the lack of  comprehensive data impedes FEMA\u2019s ability to account for the properties  acquired through its mitigation programs and hinders its ability to provide  Congress with timely information with which to assess the impact of these  programs on mitigating losses to NFIP and ensure that limited resources  are appropriately allocated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Oversight of Contractor Activities Lacked Consistency, Documentation, and Coordination", "paragraphs": ["FEMA makes extensive use of contractors who perform critical functions  to implement the NFIP.

When asked about the lack of a direct link to specific performance areas,  as listed in the BSA contract, most of the BSA monitors we interviewed  stated that they did not know the \u201cnumber\u201d of the performance area they  were to monitor but knew the general areas. When we brought this issue  to the attention of FEMA\u2019s Program Management Office in August 2007, it  determined that the numbering of performance areas was inconsistent in  the BSA contract and the surveillance plan.

FEMA  management acknowledged the problem when we presented a preliminary  analysis of performance reports and performance standards. While we did  not become aware of any significant performance problems with the BSA  contractor during the course of our review, our results are inconclusive  because most of the monitoring reports were not documented.

Generally, the DSA  received discrepancy reports for not processing NFIP policy documents,  such as renewals and applications, within required time frames. According  to the COTR, these types of deficiencies had minimal negative effects  because, in some cases, the universe of documents the contractor  processed was so small that the failure to process 10-20 documents in a  timely manner resulted in a discrepancy report. But, interviews with the  FEMA offices responsible for processing discrepancy reports revealed that  FEMA\u2019s Contracting Officer was unaware that the COTR for that contract  had sent 18 discrepancy reports to the DSA.

The COTR said that FEMA had no process  by which he could be informed that a financial penalty had been processed  as a result of the discrepancy reports.

The ability of FEMA officials to effectively monitor  the effectiveness of its flood mitigation programs, as well as its NFIP  contractors, is essential to the effective implementation of NFIP.", "Floods impose an enormous financial burden on the nation\u2019s flood insurer,  the federal government. Consequently, FEMA management, Congress, and  the public need accurate and timely information to assess the  effectiveness of programs designed to mitigate flood-related damages,  particularly for repetitive loss properties that account for a significant  portion of claims paid under NFIP. We found that FEMA does not have  specific written policies for the timely recording of property acquisition  data in its mitigation programs. By developing such policies and guidance,  FEMA could improve its ability to produce, analyze, and report on  property acquisitions and thus improve its ability to assess the operations  and effectiveness of these programs. In addition to not requiring the timely  recording of acquisition data, since 2004 when FEMA began using eGrants  as its grants management system, FEMA has been unable to use this grants  management system to record such information. The eGrants system can  process \u201cfront-end\u201d processes (such as accepting applications) but not  subsequent grants management processes (such as project closures). Not  having an end-to-end grant management capability makes it particularly  challenging for grant management staff to oversee the grant process  across their organization. Grant management systems were intended to  enhance the ability of federal managers and grant-making agencies to  readily collect, analyze, and report information. With its current system  limitations, FEMA cannot accurately assess or report the extent to which  its mitigation programs are reducing the number of flood-damaged and  repetitive loss properties.", "Deficiencies in FEMA processes relating to NFIP data and performance  extend to oversight of contractors responsible for supporting NFIP.

The lack of a framework to  ensure that essential oversight and control functions were completed  could allow performance problems to go unnoticed or worsen.  Furthermore, the lack of documentation to determine the extent to which  specific performance standards were met makes it appear that FEMA was  not effectively monitoring its contractors, diminishes its ability to  determine if and when problems occurred, and may have led the agency to  not apply specific financial incentives or disincentives per contract terms  (such as when the BSA COTR independently determined that discrepancy  reports were not necessary).

FEMA has mapped flood risks in  the United States and in most flood-prone areas has assigned a flood zone  designation based on the level of flood risk. Although FEMA uses 12 types  of flood zones (see appendix VII), we combined these into four flood zone  designations based on risk levels\u2014moderate- to low-risk (Zones B, C, and  X); high-risk (Zone A); high-risk coastal (Zone V); and undetermined risk  (Zone D).
