Of these 301 ports, 24 are located along the Southwest border and\u2014through 39 crossing points (such as bridges)\u2014handle both passengers and commercial cargo entering the United States. At the end of fiscal year 1997, Customs had deployed about 28 percent of its inspectors and about 62 percent of its canine enforcement officers at ports along the Southwest border. This compared to about 24 percent of its inspectors and about 50 percent of its canine enforcement officers being deployed at the Southwest border in fiscal year 1992, the earliest year that complete data were available.

Specifically, as 1 of more than 50 federal agencies involved in the national drug control effort, Customs is responsible for stopping the flow of illegal drugs through the nation\u2019s ports of entry. In addition to routine inspections to search passengers, cargo, and conveyances (these include cars, buses, trucks, aircraft, and marine vessels) for illegal drugs moving through the ports, Customs\u2019 drug interdiction efforts include investigations and the use of contraband enforcement teams and canine enforcement officers.", "In February 1995, Customs initiated Operation Hard Line along the Southwest border to address drug smuggling, including port running (the practice of racing drug-laden conveyances through a Customs inspection point), and related border violence through increased and intensified inspections, improved facilities, and the use of technology. According to Customs officials, port running had increased in part as a result of enforcement operations conducted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service between the ports of entry along the Southwest border. Customs has expanded its anti-smuggling initiative (called Operation \u201cGateway\u201d) beyond the Southwest border to the southern tier of the United States to include the Caribbean and Puerto Rico.", "According to Customs officials, in keeping with the need to perform a multifaceted mission, Customs does not generally allocate inspectors to ports of entry exclusively to perform drug enforcement. Accordingly, while it is the highest priority, drug enforcement is only one of many functions that inspectors are expected to perform when inspecting goods and persons. However, in an effort to enhance its drug enforcement operations, Customs has been using more specialized drug enforcement units, such as contraband enforcement teams, and assigning inspectors to such units on a rotational basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Results Act and Strategic Planning", "paragraphs": ["The Results Act was enacted to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal programs by establishing a system to set goals for program performance and to measure results. Under the Results Act, executive agencies were to develop, by September 1997, strategic plans in which they defined their missions, established results-oriented goals, and identified the strategies they will use to achieve those goals for the period covering at least fiscal years 1997 through 2002. These plans are to be updated at least every 3 years. Beginning in fiscal year 1999, agencies are also to develop annual performance plans. The Results Act requires that these plans (1) identify annual performance goals and measures for each of an agency\u2019s program activities, (2) discuss the strategies and resources needed to achieve the performance goals, and (3) explain the procedures the agency will use to verify and validate its performance data.", "Customs\u2019 Strategic Plan for fiscal years 1997 through 2002 established a goal and a number of objectives designed to continue Customs\u2019 multipronged drug enforcement effort to increase the risk of being caught for those smuggling illegal drugs into the country. The plan also included measures, such as the number and amounts of narcotics seizures, to gauge the success of the enforcement efforts and proposed conducting internal evaluations of specific components of the strategy, such as narcotics interdiction.

Customs officials were not aware of any such process to determine inspectional personnel needs prior to 1995. While Customs has moved in this direction by conducting three assessments to determine its need for additional inspectional personnel since 1995, these assessments (1) focused exclusively on the need for additional personnel to implement its anti-drug smuggling initiatives, such as Operation Hard Line and similar initiatives; (2) were limited to land ports along the Southwest border and certain sea and air ports at risk from drug smuggling; (3) were conducted each year using different assessment and allocation factors; and (4) were conducted with varying degrees of involvement by Customs headquarters and field units. Focusing on only a single aspect of its operations (i.e., countering drug smuggling); not consistently including the key field components (i.e., CMCs and ports) in the decisionmaking process; and using different assessment and allocation factors from year to year could prevent Customs from accurately estimating the need for inspectional personnel and then allocating them to ports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "No Known Efforts Prior to 1995 to Determine Inspectional Personnel Needs", "paragraphs": ["According to Customs officials, they were not aware of any agencywide efforts prior to 1995 to determine the need for additional inspectional personnel at commercial cargo ports of entry. Rather, CMCs (then called districts) requested additional personnel primarily when new ports were established. For example, when the new port at Otay Mesa, California, was established, the Southern California CMC (then called the San Diego District) requested from headquarters, and was allocated, some additional personnel to staff the port. Separately, according to Customs officials, as part of the annual budget request development process, CMCs can also submit requests for inspectional personnel to fill vacancies in existing positions created by attrition.", "On a broader basis, according to officials at Customs\u2019 Anti-Smuggling Division (ASD), beginning in the late 1980s, Customs redeployed some existing inspectional personnel in response to the increasing workload and drug smuggling threat along the Southwest border. For example, as shown in figures 1 and 2 (see also app. II), prior to the Hard Line buildup, there was an increase in inspectional personnel\u2014inspectors and canine enforcement officers \u2014at Southwest border ports between fiscal years 1993 and 1994. According to ASD officials, this was done in preparation for the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the anticipated increase in related workload. According to these officials, Customs accomplished the pre-Hard Line buildup by reallocating positions that had become vacant through attrition from ports around the country\u2014such as those on the border with Canada\u2014to the Southwest border."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Needs Assessments Focused on Anti-Smuggling Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Customs\u2019 personnel needs assessment process for fiscal years 1997 through 1999 focused exclusively on its anti-drug smuggling initiatives, namely Operations Hard Line and Gateway. In focusing on only one aspect of its cargo and passenger operations (i.e., countering drug smuggling), Customs is not identifying the need for inspectional personnel for its overall cargo processing operations.", "According to Customs and Treasury officials, the impetus for the focus of the needs assessements on the anti-smuggling initiatives, beginning with Hard Line, was provided by a June 1995 visit by the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury to ports within the Southern California CMC to observe how Hard Line was being implemented. According to these officials, the Deputy Secretary expressed concern about Hard Line\u2019s implementation, especially about the extensive use of overtime and the apparent lack of results in terms of drug seizures. According to the officials, the Deputy Secretary concluded that the Southwest border ports did not have a sufficient number of inspectors and other personnel to adequately implement Hard Line. As a result, the Deputy Secretary asked Customs officials to review the staffing situation at the Southwest border ports and prepare a proposal for additional staffing and other measures to enhance Hard Line\u2019s implementation.", "In response to the Deputy Treasury Secretary\u2019s concerns about Operation Hard Line, Customs conducted a needs assessment in 1995 for its fiscal year 1997 budget submission. Specifically, in June 1995, ASD asked the four Customs districts (now called CMCs) along the Southwest border to develop estimates of their inspectional personnel needs. The four districts were San Diego, California (now the Southern California CMC); El Paso, Texas (now the West Texas CMC); Laredo, Texas (now the South Texas CMC); and Nogales, Arizona (now the Arizona CMC). The factors used in this assessment and its results are discussed later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Inspectional Personnel Needs Assessments Limited to Certain Ports", "paragraphs": ["Because they focused on Customs\u2019 anti-smuggling initiatives, the inspectional personnel needs assessments that began in 1995 were accordingly limited to ports along the Southwest border and the southern tier of the United States, and to sea and air ports determined to be at risk from drug smuggling. Also, these assessments focused only on the need for additional personnel at these ports. Specifically, Customs did not conduct a review of its 301 ports to determine (1) the appropriate staffing levels at each one of these ports and (2) whether it was feasible to permanently reallocate inspectors to the Southwest border ports and other high-risk ports from other ports around the country that potentially had, at that time, higher levels of inspectors than justified by workload and other factors, before assessing the need for additional personnel.", "In addition, Customs\u2019 strategic plan and the fiscal year 1999 Annual Performance Plan did not provide the detail necessary to determine the level of personnel needed and how Customs planned to align, or allocate, these personnel to meet its plans\u2019 goals and objectives. The strategic plan, however, recognized the need to assess the allocation of resources, including personnel, and their effectiveness and to address any necessary redeployments, while Customs\u2019 fiscal year 1998 Annual Plan identified the linkage of its goals with available and anticipated resources as an area that needed attention.", "Customs officials said that they did not conduct broad-based assessments because the results of these assessments would likely indicate the need to move inspectional personnel. These officials stated that moving personnel would be difficult for four primary reasons. First, about 1,200 current inspectional positions are funded through revenues from user fees established by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 as amended, codified at 19 U.S.C. 58c. These positions are funded for specific purposes at specific locations, such as processing arriving passengers at air and sea ports, in proportion to the revenues contributed by each user fee category. For example, according to Customs officials, since air passenger fees contributed about 85 percent of all user fee revenues, air ports would receive 85 percent of all inspectors funded by the fee revenues. Consequently, Customs cannot redeploy such positions to other locations for other purposes, such as inspecting cargo at commercial cargo ports.", "Second, under the terms of its union contract, to permanently move inspectors from one CMC to another, Customs needed to ask for volunteers before directing the reassignment of any inspectors. However, when Customs asked for 200 volunteers\u2014a number far short of what was ultimately estimated as being needed\u2014to be detailed to the Southwest border to help implement Operation Hard Line, very few volunteers emerged. Consequently, Customs abandoned its call for volunteers and decided to implement Hard Line with existing personnel by relying on the use of overtime. In other instances that would require inspectors to move, according to Customs officials, if volunteers did not emerge, Customs would need to select the most junior inspectors to move. However, for operational reasons having to do primarily with inspector experience, this was not an option preferred by Customs.", "Third, funding historically was not requested in the President\u2019s budgets or appropriated by Congress for permanent changes of station (i.e., permanent moves) because of the high cost involved. Customs officials estimated that it cost between $50,000 and $70,000 to move an inspector, thus making any substantial number of moves prohibitively expensive. However, more recently, the President\u2019s budgets have requested funding for redeploying Customs agents, and Congress has appropriated such funding. For example, in the fiscal year 1998 budget, $4 million was requested for agent redeployments, and Congress appropriated the requested amount.", "Fourth, by 1995, Customs had already reallocated positions to the Southwest border from other ports as the positions became vacant through attrition. However, according to ASD officials, Customs could no longer reallocate positions in this manner because some non-Southwest border ports were experiencing staffing shortages due to attrition and growing workloads and needed to fill their vacancies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customs Used Different Factors in Its Needs Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Customs\u2019 three needs assessments utilized different factors from year to year to determine the need for additional inspectional personnel. However, Customs\u2019 decision not to consider factors critical to accomplishing its overall mission every year\u2014such as the configuration of the ports that was used in the fiscal year 1997 assessment\u2014could have prevented Customs from estimating the appropriate level of personnel at each port."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Factors Used in Fiscal Year 1997", "paragraphs": ["For the fiscal year 1997 assessment, ASD provided the Southwest border districts with a number of factors to use in determining the need for additional inspectors and canine enforcement officers for their cargo and passenger operations. The factors were based primarily on the configuration of ports, which, in addition to its drug enforcement functions, is a reflection of Customs\u2019 mission critical functions. The factors were (1) the need to fully staff all primary passenger lanes, taking into account agreements with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), including inspectors to conduct preprimary roving; (2) the need to fully staff cargo facilities (primary booths and examination docks), while taking into account the balance between Customs\u2019 enforcement mission and the need to facilitate the movement of legitimate conveyances and their cargo; and (3) the need for canine enforcement officers to support all cargo and passenger processing operations. The districts were also asked to (1) assume that they were going to at least maintain the examination rates being achieved at the time of the assessment, based on the national standard to examine a minimum of 20 percent of a selected conveyance\u2019s cargo, and (2) consider the overall drug smuggling threat at ports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Used in Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999", "paragraphs": ["Unlike the fiscal year 1997 needs assessment process that was based on the configuration of ports, ASD officials said they used the threat of drug smuggling at commercial cargo land ports along the Southwest border and at air and sea ports on the southern tier of the United States and other locations to estimate the number of additional inspectors needed in fiscal years 1998 and 1999. However, in not considering land border port configurations, Customs did not take into account changes in the configurations that could have implications for the number of inspectional personnel needed.", "For fiscal year 1998, ASD officials said they focused on three aspects of the drug smuggling threat: (1) the number and location of drug seizures, since they were evidence of the threat; (2) the use of rail cars by drug smugglers to smuggle drugs; and (3) the existence of internal conspiracies by individuals, such as dock workers at ports, to smuggle drugs. According to the ASD officials, the latter two factors represented the evolving nature of the drug smuggling threat and needed to be addressed.", "For fiscal year 1999, in addition to the latter two factors used in fiscal year 1998, ASD said it also considered the need to address the continued evolution of the drug smuggling threat, namely (1) an increase in drug smuggling using waterways bordering the United States and (2) an expansion in the number of drug smuggling organizations operating in U.S. cities. According to an ASD official, the factors used in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 were meant to balance Customs\u2019 continued emphasis on the drug smuggling threat along the Southwest border and the need to address new threats in other areas, such as Miami and Los Angeles."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Year 1997 and 1998 Inspectional Personnel Allocations Utilized Different Needs Assessment Factors", "paragraphs": ["The processes to allocate the inspectional personnel funded by Congress in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 generally used different needs assessments factors. For fiscal year 1997, ASD used commercial truck volume to allocate the new cargo inspectors to the Southwest border ports.According to ASD officials, they used the workload data because they believed that the drug smuggling threat ultimately manifested itself in terms of conveyance and passenger traffic\u2014commercial trucks, passenger vehicles, and pedestrians at land ports; aircraft and passengers at air ports; and vessels, cargo, and passengers at sea ports\u2014and the likelihood that any one of these conveyances or passengers could carry drugs through any port at any time.", "ASD used an estimated ratio of 10 inspectors for every 100,000 laden (full) trucks and 5 inspectors for every 100,000 empty trucks to allocate the additional personnel to the Southwest border ports. An ASD official said that the ratio was based on ASD\u2019s experience with the number of inspectors and the length of time needed to inspect laden and empty trucks. In addition, according to this official, ASD used the ratio because it was relatively easy to understand and implement and was generally supported by the CMCs and ports receiving the resources, such as the Otay Mesa port.", "For fiscal year 1998, ASD officials stated that they used the same aspects of the drug smuggling threat used for that year\u2019s needs assessment to allocate the inspectional personnel that were funded. Accordingly, to address the use of commercial rail cars to smuggle drugs, for example, ASD estimated that a team of between four to eight inspectors was needed to inspect a commercial cargo train, depending on the number of rail cars. Using this estimate, ASD allocated inspectors to ports with rail car inspection operations that were facing a drug smuggling threat, such as Laredo and Brownsville, Texas. However, because Customs did not consider its entire workload, it did not take into account the anticipated growth in trade volume and the potential resulting need for additional inspectional personnel to handle this growth. Further, considering that Customs has identified workload as an indicator of the drug smuggling threat, it could not respond to the escalation of the threat as represented by the growth in its entire workload. Customs officials commented that, since a limited number of additional inspectors were available for allocation to rail operations, they allocated a minimum number of inspectors to each port with such operations, without considering the workload.", "In fiscal year 1997, ASD officials stated that, working with Customs\u2019 Canine Branch, they used workload and the extent of the drug smuggling threat to allocate the additional canine enforcement officers to ports.

In its role, ASD compiled the results of the needs assessment. Customs\u2019 Office of Investigations estimated the number of investigative agents and other staff needed to support the inspectors and canine enforcement officers. The Canine Branch estimated the number of canine enforcement officers needed to provide operational support to inspectors. As described earlier, ASD also allocated the inspectors and, working with the Canine Branch, the canine enforcement officers that were funded by Congress.

Three CMCs indicated that they were satisfied with the number of additional inspectors to be allocated to them. Two CMCs and two ports indicated that additional inspectors were needed. ASD officials said that they took these comments into consideration when finalizing the allocation.", "According to ASD officials, they assumed a leading role because the needs assessments and subsequent allocations were being conducted exclusively in support of Customs\u2019 anti-drug smuggling initiatives, such as Operation Hard Line. These initiatives are conducted under ASD\u2019s oversight. In addition, an ASD official explained that ASD was fully cognizant of the threat, workload, and other factors relevant to the needs assessment and allocation processes at the CMCs and ports; thus, it was able to conduct them without the need to consult extensively with the CMCs and ports. However, because it did not fully involve the two key field components responsible for day-to-day operations (i.e., the CMCs and ports) throughout the needs assessment and allocation processes, Customs received no input from those who, by virtue of their operational roles, are in the best position to know the levels of inspectional personnel they need."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Implementation of the Results Act Requires the Establishment of a Link Between the Deployment of Resources and the Achievement of Performance Goals", "paragraphs": ["The Results Act specifies that all agencies\u2019 strategic plans should have six critical components.

OMB\u2019s decision was appealed by Treasury and ONDCP, which had already certified Customs\u2019 request for 657 additional positions as adequate to meet the National Drug Control Strategy\u2019s goals. In its appeal, Treasury cited the detrimental effect OMB\u2019s denial would have on Customs\u2019 drug enforcement operations, including its inability to increase the number of cargo examinations. In its own appeal, ONDCP identified the level of personnel for Customs as a critical issue and argued that the requested inspectional personnel were needed to strengthen the Southwest border against drug smuggling.", "According to Customs officials, through subsequent negotiations following Treasury\u2019s appeal involving, among others, the Treasury Secretary and the OMB Director, OMB approved the 657-position request. The 657 positions\u2014and $65 million to fund them\u2014were ultimately funded when Treasury received an additional $500 million from Congress as part of its budget appropriation, according to Treasury officials.", "As discussed earlier, for fiscal year 1998, Customs originally estimated that 200 additional cargo inspectors were needed for air and sea ports determined to be at risk from drug smuggling. None of the ports were located along the Southwest border. Treasury initially denied Customs\u2019 request for 200 positions and later approved for submission to OMB a request for 119 additional positions. Customs and Treasury officials again cited budget constraints as the reason for the reduction. As part of its role (see footnote 12), ONDCP certified the submission as adequate. According to Customs budget documents, the 119 positions were funded for 1 year with appropriations from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. For fiscal year 1999, the President\u2019s budget is proposing that these positions be funded from Customs\u2019 Salaries and Expenses account.", "For fiscal year 1999, Customs estimated that it needed an additional 876 inspectional and related positions for its anti-drug smuggling initiatives at the Southwest border and at air and sea ports believed to be at risk from drug smuggling. According to an ASD official, Treasury supported and ONDCP certified this estimate, which was then transmitted to OMB for review. OMB denied the request.

Specifically, for fiscal year 1997, ASD changed its initial allocation of inspectional personnel to include a port not located at the Southwest border. ASD had originally planned to allocate all of the additional inspectional and canine enforcement officers exclusively to Southwest border ports. According to an ASD official, ASD modified the allocation because the South Florida CMC appealed to the Commissioner of Customs for additional inspectional personnel, citing a significant drug smuggling threat as indicated by the number of cocaine seizures\u2014totaling about 10,000 pounds\u2014at Port Everglades port. The Commissioner agreed with the appeal. Consequently, ASD adjusted its allocation to provide nine inspectors and canine enforcement officers to this port.", "For fiscal year 1998, during the course of its review of Customs\u2019 request for the additional resources and its plans to allocate them, ONDCP directed Customs to change its allocation to include cargo ports along the Southwest border. According to Customs and ONDCP officials, this was done to maintain the National Drug Control Strategy\u2019s emphasis on the Southwest border. Subsequently, Customs reallocated 47 of the 119 positions to Southwest border ports.", "According to Customs officials, the potential reallocation of existing inspectional personnel has also been affected by legislative requirements. As discussed earlier, positions funded with the user fees established in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 as amended, cannot be redeployed because these positions are funded for specific purposes at specific ports.

New inspectors are effective in interdicting drugs in the passenger processing environment, but must receive commercial operations training to be proficient at drug interdiction in the truck and rail environments on the Southwest border. As a result, according to this official, it may take up to 2 years to fully train new inspectors in the skills needed in all areas of this CMC\u2019s operations. Also, the South Texas CMC Director said that, once the new inspectors were hired and trained, they were sent to this CMC for an additional 10 weeks of specialized training, of which 2 weeks were for cargo inspections.

Three other measures or targets\u2014including the number of internal conspiracies disrupted\u2014were being reviewed at the time of the Strategic Plan\u2019s introduction by Customs management for possible permanent inclusion in the Plan.

Customs has moved in this direction since 1995 by conducting three assessments to determine its need for additional inspectional personnel. However, these assessments (1) focused exclusively on the need for additional resources to implement Operation Hard Line and other anti-smuggling initiatives, (2) were limited to land ports along the Southwest border and certain sea and air ports at risk from drug smuggling, (3) were conducted each year using different assessment factors, and (4) were conducted with varying degrees of involvement from Customs units.", "Focusing on only a single aspect of its operations (i.e., countering drug smuggling), not consistently including the key field components (i.e., CMCs and ports) in the decisionmaking process, and using different assessment and allocation factors from year to year could prevent Customs from accurately estimating the need for inspectional personnel and then allocating them to ports.", "In conducting its strategic planning under the Results Act, Customs will need an annual approach that considers all of its commercial ports, its mission-related functions, and the impact of technology and related equipment so that it can determine the inspectional personnel it would need to achieve the desired mission outcomes it details in its strategic and annual performance plans. Customs, in its strategic planning documents, has already recognized the need to review its personnel deployments, evaluate their effectiveness, and address any necessary changes and to address the link between performance goals and existing and anticipated resources, including personnel.", "We recognize that Customs\u2019 requests for inspectional personnel will continue to be influenced by budget, policy, and legislative constraints.
