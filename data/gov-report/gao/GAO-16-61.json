CDC has also demonstrated that by identifying risk and protective factors\u2014relative to the domain or environment in which they exist\u2014organizations can focus efforts on eliminating risk factors that promote sexual violence while also supporting the protective factors that prevent it. DOD identifies five domains in its strategy and includes risk factors for three\u2014individuals, relationships, and society\u2014but it does not specify risk factors for the other two domains\u2014leaders at all levels of DOD and the military community. Further, DOD does not specify how the protective factors, such as emotional health, identified in its strategy relate to the five domains.

DOD's strategy identifies 18 activities, 2 of which DOD considers implemented while efforts to address the remaining 16 are ongoing. For example, DOD officials report that they have implemented the activity directing the development of a military community of practice. Additionally, GAO identified activities that had been developed and implemented at the four installations GAO visited, but found that they may not be consistent with DOD's strategy because it has not been communicated or disseminated to the personnel responsible for implementing the activities. Further, service policies\u2014key conduits of such communication\u2014do not provide the guidance necessary to unify the department's prevention efforts because they have not been updated to align with and operationalize the principles outlined in DOD's most recent strategy. Thus, DOD cannot be sure that all prevention-related activities are achieving the goals and objectives of the department's strategy.", "DOD has identified five performance measures to assess the effectiveness of its prevention efforts, but these measures are not fully developed as they are missing many of the 10 key attributes that GAO has found can contribute to assessing program performance effectively, such as baseline and trend data, measurable target, and clarity. Specifically, all five performance measures demonstrate some of these attributes but collectively they are missing more than half of these attributes. All of the prevention efforts' measures demonstrate baseline and trend data but none of the measures have measurable target, clarity, and some of the other attributes.

DOD data show that the number of reported sexual assaults  involving military servicemembers more than doubled from about 2,800  reports in fiscal year 2007 to about 6,100 reports in fiscal year 2014.  However, recent data suggest that these reports represent a fraction of  the sexual assault incidents that are actually occurring. Specifically,  based on the results of its 2014 Military Workplace Study, the RAND  Corporation estimated that about 20,300 active-duty servicemembers  were sexually assaulted in the year prior to the survey. While the  increase in reports since fiscal year 2007 and the most recent estimated  number of servicemember victims are significant, sexual assault is an  underreported crime, and DOD officials believe the increase in reporting  reflects the growing confidence of servicemembers in the department\u2019s  response to victims as opposed to a decrease in the effectiveness of its  prevention efforts. According to DOD, sexual assault continues to  represent a significant and persistent problem within the department and  DOD has considerable interest in better preventing it.", "For over a decade, Congress and DOD have taken a variety of steps to  prevent sexual assault in the military. In 2004, following a series of high- profile sexual assault cases involving servicemembers, Congress  required the Secretary of Defense to develop, among other things, a  comprehensive policy for DOD on the prevention of sexual assaults  involving servicemembers. In response to statutory requirements, DOD  established its sexual-assault prevention and response program in 2005,  and has taken a variety of other steps aimed at improving the  department\u2019s efforts to prevent sexual assault. For example, in 2008,  DOD published its first sexual-assault prevention strategy. In April 2014,  DOD updated its strategy (calling it the 2014\u201316 sexual-assault  prevention strategy).

We found that DOD had not  used all of its data to inform program decision making, had not  established goals or metrics to gauge sexual assault\u2013related issues for  male servicemembers, and had generally not portrayed male sexual- assault victims in its sexual-assault prevention training material. Based on  our findings, we recommended that DOD, among other things, develop a  plan for using its data to inform program development, develop  associated goals and metrics, and revise training to address male victims.

We used Office of Management and Budget  guidance on conducting agency strategic reviews and mitigating risks  related to achieving strategic objectives and performance goals.

Though not required to do so, DOD consulted with  and incorporated CDC\u2019s framework and prevention-related concepts into  its prevention strategy. Specifically, DOD incorporated CDC\u2019s concept  that defines the different levels at which prevention efforts occur and  another CDC concept that describes the importance of identifying and  understanding the domains in which sexual violence takes place.

DOD further states that its  prevention programs will not rely solely on the training and education of  individuals considered to be at risk. Rather, DOD states that its focus on  primary prevention will involve empowered and competent individuals  interacting in an environment that has been sustained to promote the best  possible outcomes.", "DOD\u2019s strategy also incorporates CDC\u2019s concept that there are risk and  protective factors that influence the occurrence of sexual violence.  According to CDC, identification of risk factors and protective factors is a  key step in developing an effective prevention strategy in that it helps to  build an understanding of the circumstances\u2014both positive and  negative\u2014that may play a role in the perpetration of such incidents. To  further enhance the effectiveness of its efforts, CDC categorizes these  factors relative to the four domains in which they are identified to exist: (1)  society; (2) community; (3) relationship; and (4) individual. According to  CDC, this enables an organization to tailor its prevention strategy based  on the characteristics of a specific population.", "In its 2014\u201316 prevention strategy, DOD adapted CDC\u2019s approach by  identifying five domains in which it would focus its prevention efforts: (1)  society; (2) the military community (DOD/services/units); (3) leaders at all  levels; (4) relationships; and (5) individuals. As depicted in figure 1,  while DOD\u2019s model largely mirrors the one created by CDC, it also  included \u201cleaders\u201d as a distinct domain of influence because, according to  its 2014\u201316 strategy, the department wanted to recognize the essential  role of leadership and to highlight the necessity that commanders and  their staffs develop and execute tactics that target this \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d  for prevention efforts.

For  example, within its society domain, DOD identifies inputs, or the  resources on which the effectiveness of an effort depends, such as  community volunteers and collaboration with federal partners, coalitions,  and other primary prevention experts. In addition, DOD\u2019s strategy  specifies outputs, which are the direct products of implemented activities  and are different from outcomes, which are also included in DOD\u2019s  strategy and defined as the intended effect of these activities. For  example, DOD identifies the development of courses that instruct and  empower members as one of the outputs of its efforts, whereas it notes  that the establishment and maintenance of a culture that supports the  prevention of sexual assault is a desired outcome of its efforts within the  \u201cleaders\u201d domain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention Strategy Does Not Link Activities to Desired Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s strategy identifies 18 prevention-focused activities that it plans to  implement as part of its effort to prevent sexual assault, but it does not  link these activities to desired outcomes.

According to CDC, there are factors that may put a  person at risk for sexual-violence perpetration and victimization while  other factors may prevent them from harm. Specifically referred to as risk  factors and protective factors, CDC\u2019s work has demonstrated that by  identifying such influences\u2014relative to the domain or environment in  which they exist\u2014organizations can focus their efforts on eliminating  factors that promote sexual violence while also supporting the factors that  prevent it. In addition to CDC\u2019s work on prevention strategies, the Office  of Management and Budget issued guidance in 2015 on agencies\u2019  strategic reviews in which it acknowledged that while agencies cannot  mitigate all risks related to achieving strategic objectives and performance  goals, they should identify, measure, and assess challenges related to  mission delivery, to the extent possible.", "As noted previously, DOD adapted CDC\u2019s framework for sexual-violence  prevention strategies by identifying five domains to which it would tailor its  prevention program, including: (1) society; (2) the military community  (DOD/services/units); (3) leaders at all levels; (4) relationships; and (5)  individuals. We reviewed DOD\u2019s strategy and found that it includes risk  factors identified by CDC for three of these domains\u2014individuals,  relationships, and society. For example, within the individual risk domain,  DOD identified factors such as alcohol and drug use and hostility toward  women as risks that may influence sexual violence. Within the  relationship domain, DOD identified factors such as associating with  sexually aggressive and delinquent peers and having an emotionally  unsupportive familial environment as possible influences on the incidence  of sexual violence. However, DOD does not specify risk factors for the  two domains over which it potentially has the greatest influence\u2014leaders  at all levels of DOD and the military community (i.e., DOD/services/units).  For example, the strategy does not identify potential risk factors  associated with these domains, such as recognizing that the inherent  nature of certain types of commands or units may cultivate an  environment in which there is an increased risk of sexual assault.", "While not specifically tailored to its military-community domain, DOD\u2019s  prevention strategy includes risk factors that CDC had identified as  generally applicable to the community domain. For example, DOD\u2019s  2014\u201316 prevention strategy identifies general tolerance of sexual  violence within the community and weak community sanctions against  sexual-violence perpetrators as risk factors for that category. While these  risk factors may generally apply to DOD, they do not meet CDC\u2019s criteria  for effective prevention programs because DOD did not identify risk  factors and mitigation techniques based on the unique aspects of the  military-community domain.", "According to officials with DOD SAPRO, they did not identify risk factors  specific to DOD\u2019s military community and leaders domains because  insufficient research existed on risk factors for these domains and the  department did not independently take steps to identify relevant risk  factors prior to the strategy\u2019s publication. A senior DOD official added that  DOD asked the RAND Corporation, after the strategy was published, to  analyze risk factors, including the military community and leaders  domains, as a part of its work on the 2014 Military Workplace Study. In  its fiscal year 2014 Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual  Assault in the Military, DOD reported on the findings of RAND\u2019s analysis,  which included several risk factors for the military-community domain  such as differences between service branches as well as between the  active-duty and reserve components. RAND did not conduct a similar  analysis to identify risk factors for DOD\u2019s leader domain.", "DOD also included six protective factors identified by CDC in its  prevention strategy, but it does not specify how they relate to the five  domains. For example, emotional health and connectedness were listed  as protective factors for high-school boys that may help to curb the  initiation of sexual violence. For high-school girls, academic achievement  was listed as a factor that may reduce their exposure to sexual violence.  However, the protective factors that DOD included in its strategy are  grouped together in a general category rather than being listed under the  domain to which they corresponds. During our review, we spoke with a  senior DOD official responsible for developing the strategy who  acknowledged that more research is needed to identify risk and protective  factors for each of the domains in its model. Without a more  comprehensive list of such factors that correspond to each of the domains  in its strategy, DOD may be limited in its ability to take an evidence-based  approach to the prevention of sexual assault. Further, DOD may not be  able to accurately characterize the environment in which sexual assaults  occur or to develop activities and interventions to more effectively prevent  them.

In its strategy, DOD specifies that one of the  department\u2019s goals is to deliver consistent and effective sexual-assault  prevention methods and programs. In doing so, DOD believes that it will  help to instill a culture of mutual respect and trust, professional values,  and team commitment, which are reinforced to create an environment  where sexual assault is not tolerated, condoned, or ignored. To achieve  this goal, DOD identified 18 activities in its prevention strategy as well as  their general time frame for completion, their priority relative to the overall  strategy, and the office with primary responsibility for their implementation  (i.e., SAPRO, military department, or service). For example, one activity  assigns SAPRO responsibility for developing a military community of  practice focused on primary prevention within 1 year of the strategy\u2019s  April 2014 publication. Other activities, such as implementing policies that  appropriately address high-risk situations targeted by offenders are  designated as responsibilities of the military services and are to be  completed within 3 years of the strategy\u2019s implementation.

Specifically, SAPRO officials said its activities  \u201cImplementation of the 2014-16 Sexual Assault Prevention Strategy\u201d and  \u201cDevelop a military community of practice focused on primary prevention  of sexual assault\u201d are complete and the remaining 16 activities are  ongoing. Officials stated that the implementation of the 2014-16 Sexual  Assault Prevention Strategy activity was completed with its publication in  April 2014. SAPRO also noted that a military community of practice was  started with the August 2014 implementation of \u201cSAPR Connect\u201d\u2014an  online community in which DOD SAPR personnel can collaborate and  share ideas, news, research, and insights from experts on issues related  to sexual assault.", "In addition to the 2 activities it identified as implemented, efforts are under  way to implement the remaining 16. However, SAPRO officials said that  the remaining 16 activities identified in its strategy will never be  considered \u201ccomplete\u201d because, as the program develops, the  department will consistently revise and renew its approach in these areas.  As such, officials stated that the status of the remaining 16 activities is,  and will indefinitely remain, designated as \u201congoing.\u201d Though the  remaining activities are not considered complete, each service has taken  steps to support the ongoing efforts specified in the department\u2019s  strategy. For example, each military service annually administers sexual- assault prevention and response training that addresses the nature of  sexual assault in the military environment using scenario-based, real-life  situations to demonstrate the entire cycle of prevention, reporting,  response, and accountability procedures. In addition, each service has  developed and implemented its own prevention-focused training. For  example, in the spring of 2014, the Air Force held a SAPR Stand-Down  Day focused on teaching airmen to identify sexual-assault offenders by  showing how they operate and to impart the effect that offenders can  have on their victims. In 2014, the Marine Corps also expanded its SAPR  training efforts to include courses that emphasize character, social  courage, and mutual respect among Marines. Specifically, the Marine  Corps instituted a 2-hour ethics course of instruction for new recruits who  are awaiting travel to their initial military training, which focuses on  developing an understanding of sexual assault, harassment, hazing, and  alcohol abuse.", "The services have also taken steps to address the activity that directs  them to review and, if necessary, expand alcohol policies to address  factors beyond individual use. For example, some Army installations have  adopted more stringent alcohol policies, such as limiting the amount of  alcohol that soldiers may have in the barracks or purchase from  installation facilities, and the Navy took steps to improve its training of  alcohol providers and to engage local-community leadership and  organizations to expand prevention efforts off base. In addition, the  Marine Corps restricted on-base retail alcoholic beverage sales to the  hours of 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and limited its availability in non\u2013 package stores to no more than 10 percent of the total retail selling floor  space, while the Air Force revised its alcoholic beverage policy to  deglamorize behavior associated with excessive drinking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Services Have Implemented Installation- Developed Prevention Activities Even Though DOD\u2019s Prevention Strategy Has Not Been Thoroughly Communicated or Disseminated", "paragraphs": ["The military services have developed and implemented activities at the  installation level, independent of DOD\u2019s prevention strategy, in an effort to  prevent sexual assault.

However, DOD also noted that the objectives of DOD\u2019s  prevention strategy are to achieve unity of effort and purpose across all of  DOD in the execution of sexual-assault prevention. During our visits to  selected installations, we found that program personnel were largely  unfamiliar with DOD\u2019s prevention strategy and hence may not be  implementing activities in a manner consistent with the objectives of  DOD\u2019s strategy. In its 2014-16 prevention strategy, DOD highlights that it  is important for leaders to employ targeted interventions, standards, and  messaging to address issues unique to their unit climate, and that  prevention programs should be tailored to specific audiences and for  specific purposes and circumstances. However, DOD also notes that the  strategy provides a framework, means, ways, and supporting end states  to assist leaders and planners in the development of appropriate  activities. SAPRO officials stated that they have implemented several  initiatives to communicate directly with the SAPR Program Leads on  prevention strategy as well as servicemembers in the field. For example,  as of October 1, 2015 SAPRO has provided workshops to SARCs from  the Navy and Marine Corps on implementation of the prevention strategy  via webinar or face-to-face to help participants translate the strategy into  action. Other workshops\u2019 dates are being finalized.", "During the course of our review, we met with military officials and  program personnel from a joint base and three service-specific  installations who described prevention activities that had been developed  locally and were not listed in DOD\u2019s strategy. The efforts at these  installations included a variety of activities ranging from displays of  sexual-assault awareness symbols to service-sponsored sporting events  that were generally based on the theme of preventing sexual assault.  Despite their responsibilities for and experience with coordinating and  implementing prevention-focused activities, the program personnel we  met with consistently said that DOD and their respective services had not  communicated and disseminated guidance to them on the department\u2019s  prevention strategy and that they were generally unaware of how the  department\u2019s 2014\u201316 prevention strategy related to their development  and implementation of sexual-assault prevention activities.", "In the absence of such guidance, we discussed with SAPR personnel at  the installations we visited their processes for determining which  prevention-focused activities to sponsor. For example, we spoke with  program personnel at one installation who said that while they were  aware of DOD\u2019s prevention strategy, they had not received any  headquarter-level guidance or direction on the types of activities they  should sponsor in support of their efforts to prevent sexual assault. At  another installation, we spoke with program personnel who stated they  didn\u2019t think that the communication flow between the headquarters-level  SAPR office and the installation was as fast or as formal as it needs to be  to address a constantly changing program. In addition, SAPR personnel  provided a briefing on their program in which prevention-focused activities  were categorized according to the five domains identified in DOD\u2019s 2014- 16 prevention strategy. When we asked how they became familiar with  DOD\u2019s prevention strategy, a program official said she had found the  information during a self-initiated search through documents on SAPRO\u2019s  website. Such an action is noteworthy; however, without a plan to  communicate the prevention strategy and roles and responsibilities for its  implementation, DOD and the military services cannot be sure that all  installation-based program personnel are implementing activities that are  designed to achieve the goals and objectives of the department\u2019s  prevention strategy.", "We also found that the services\u2019 SAPR policies\u2014a key conduit for  communicating a program\u2019s purpose and corresponding roles and  responsibilities to relevant personnel\u2014have not been updated to reflect  the tenets of DOD\u2019s most recent prevention strategy. DOD\u2019s 2014-16  Sexual Assault Prevention Strategy specifies that one of the department\u2019s  objectives is to achieve unity of effort and purpose across all of DOD in  the execution of sexual-assault prevention and also directs the DOD  components and the Secretaries of the military departments to align their  implementing plans and policies with the department\u2019s prevention  strategy. While the services\u2019 SAPR policies generally address the  prevention of sexual assault, they have not been updated to align with  and operationalize the principles outlined in DOD\u2019s most recent  prevention strategy. Specifically, the Army and Air Force have revised  their policies after the issuance of DOD\u2019s 2014\u201316 prevention strategy,  but neither incorporates specific elements of DOD\u2019s prevention strategy.  The Navy and Marine Corps SAPR policies were issued in 2013 prior to  the issuance of DOD\u2019s 2014\u20132016 prevention strategy and have yet to be  updated..", "We recognize that DOD\u2019s most recent prevention strategy was published  approximately a year and a half ago and that it takes time for its  prevention strategy to take root in an organization as large as DOD.  However, there may be a disconnect between DOD\u2019s SAPR policies and  what is being implemented by the services\u2014something that has  previously been identified within the department as a challenge. Notably,  in May 2012, the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued its Strategic Direction to the  Joint Force on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response in which it noted  that evidence clearly indicated that gaps remain between the precepts of  the DOD\u2019s SAPR program and its full implementation at command and  unit levels.

This direction is further reinforced in  both the 2013 and 2015 versions of its SAPR strategic plan, which note  that it is the department\u2019s objective to deliver consistent and effective  prevention methods and programs. Further, the May 2012 Strategic  Direction from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which predates DOD\u2019s current  prevention strategy, directed commanders and leaders across the military  services to synchronize their respective sexual-assault prevention and  response programs to increase unity of effort through a joint perspective  and consistent application of prevention, intervention, and response.", "During our site visits, we met with military officials and SAPR program  personnel who consistently acknowledged the need to improve cross- service collaboration on the prevention of sexual assault. However, they  added that the different structures and processes of their respective  services\u2019 SAPR programs complicated such collaboration. For example,  during a visit to an Army base, program personnel informed us of an  attempt to collaborate with the other services on SAPR activities.  However, they added that the other services declined to collaborate  because the other services, whose programs were solely focused on  addressing sexual assault, thought it would be confusing to collaborate  with the Army since their program now addressed both sexual  harassment and assault. During a visit to another installation, a military  official stated that the extent of cross-service collaboration on SAPR is  based on the individuals involved and the level of importance that they  place on pursuing joint activities. The official added that he was not aware  of any overarching headquarters-level guidance that promoted such  collaboration when the cross-service relationship and desire to work  together did not exist.", "In addition to the structural differences of each service, program  personnel said that they do not have the number of personnel needed to  cultivate more cross-service SAPR activities. Specifically, program  personnel said that their SAPR offices were consistently understaffed and  that the staff who are available are focused on the needs of their  respective service\u2019s program.

Since that time, we have recommended, among other things, that DOD  develop an oversight framework that contained performance goals,  strategies to be used to accomplish goals, and criteria to measure the  progress of its prevention and response efforts. In October 2009,  Congress required DOD to submit a revised SAPR implementation plan  to include, among other things, methods to measure the effectiveness of  plans that implement DOD policies regarding sexual assaults involving  members of the armed forces. In response, in April 2010, DOD  conceptualized several measures and further directed in its 2013 SAPR  strategic plan that they be developed.

To determine whether DOD\u2019s prevention-focused performance measures  satisfy these four general characteristics, we assessed the measures  using 10 specific attributes.

Table 4 shows the 10  attributes, their definitions, and the potentially adverse consequences of  not having the attributes.", "Our analysis determined that all five of DOD\u2019s prevention-focused  performance measures demonstrate some of the key attributes, but  collectively they are missing more than half of the key attributes of  successful performance measures that we identified in our prior work.  Specifically, DOD\u2019s performance measures have linkage in that they are  aligned with the prevention line of effort set forth in DOD\u2019s 2014\u201316  prevention strategy, include baseline and trend data, and exhibit little to  no overlap with other measures. We also found, however, that DOD\u2019s  prevention-focused performance measures\u2019 usefulness to the department  may be limited because they each do not have between 5 and 7 of the 10  key attributes that we identified as necessary to successfully measure  program performance. Table 5 shows the results of our evaluation of  DOD\u2019s prevention-focused performance measures using the 10 key  attributes of successful performance measures.", "As shown in table 5, all of DOD\u2019s prevention-focused performance  measures are missing the attribute of measurable targets. Leading  practices in federal agency performance management state that, where  appropriate, performance measures should have quantifiable, numerical  targets and that agencies could use baselines to set realistic but  challenging targets. As noted previously, DOD has established baseline  and trend data for each of its prevention-focused performance measures,  but none of these measures have measurable targets because it has not  used these data to set numerical goals nor has it provided the information  needed to appropriately interpret the results of the measures and  determine program achievements. For example, for its \u201cPrevalence  versus Reporting\u201d measure, while DOD has expressed that it aims to  close the gap by decreasing the prevalence of sexual-assault incidents  and increasing the number of victims willing to report a sexual assault, it  does not identify\u2014in either case\u2014a numerical target for the department  to work towards. DOD officials told us that the department has not  established numerical targets for its prevention-focused performance  measures, because it instead uses indicators such as positive results  from surveys or a decrease in the sexual-assault prevalence rate when  compared to previous years as measures of success. Further, officials  stated they have not established numerical targets because there is not  enough research to determine what an appropriate target should be for its  measures related to prevalence.", "We recognize the challenges associated with measuring the progress of  activities with complex outcomes and limited examples to replicate, such  as DOD\u2019s efforts to prevent sexual assault. In these instances, our prior  work on effective agency strategic reviews has shown that setting  measurable targets is an evolutionary process involving trial and error  and that agencies may need to break their strategic objectives into pieces  that can be more easily be measured or assessed. Further, for activities  with long-term, scientific discovery\u2013oriented outcomes, agencies can also  rely on underlying multiyear performance goals, annual performance  indicators, and milestones to better plan for and understand near-term  progress towards those objectives. Without a numerical target, DOD  and other decision makers may be unable to gauge the extent of progress  from the department\u2019s prevention efforts because there are no goals that  can be used to compare projected performance with actual results.  Furthermore, without targets against which it can measure its progress,  DOD may not be able to ensure that it is allocating resources to its most  effective activities\u2014a key determination given the increasingly limited  fiscal resources across the federal government.", "Our analysis also determined that all five of DOD\u2019s prevention-focused  performance measures are missing the attribute of clarity because the  corresponding methodology is not clearly defined. For example, DOD did  not specify that it would assess program performance by gender or rank;  however, we found that three of DOD\u2019s five prevention-focused  performance measures assessed performance both by gender and by  rank, while another was focused solely on results broken out by  servicemember gender. According to a senior official, DOD chooses to  measure performance by gender and rank because data show that  women and junior enlisted servicemembers in general are at higher risk  of sexual assault. However, DOD did not use gender or rank when  calculating its \u201cPrevalence versus Reporting\u201d measure. In our March 2015  report focusing on male-servicemember sexual-assault victims, we  reported that developing clear goals and associated metrics related to  male victims and articulating them throughout the department would  provide DOD with additional information to assess its progress and  determine whether any adjustments are needed in its approach for  addressing sexual assault in the military. Similarly, DOD would benefit  in developing clear goals and associated performance measures by  gender and rank so it can effectively assess its progress of preventing  sexual assaults from occurring in the military.", "Further, DOD\u2019s Prevalence versus reporting measure is not clearly  defined. Specifically, the measure\u2019s name and definition suggests that the  department intends to compare the estimated prevalence of unwanted  sexual contact with the number of sexual assaults reported by  servicemembers while serving in the military by fiscal year. However,  DOD\u2019s annual data on sexual-assault incidents reported to the military  services by fiscal year include assaults that occurred prior to the fiscal  year in which they were reported. As a result, DOD is comparing the  prevalence of unwanted sexual contact that occurred in the past year to  reported sexual assaults, regardless of when they occurred. Given the  lack of available data on the fiscal year in which the sexual-assault  incidents occurred, we are unable to accurately compare the prevalence  of unwanted sexual contact to reported sexual assault by fiscal year.  However, our analysis of DOD\u2019s annual reports since fiscal year 2008  shows an increase in the percentage of unrestricted reports of sexual  assault made for an incident that occurred prior to the fiscal year it was  reported, with about 12 percent reporting a prior-year incident in fiscal  year 2008 compared to at least 24 percent reporting a prior-year incident  in fiscal year 2013. The lack of clarity of what actually is being measured  may lead decision makers to believe that performance was better or  worse than it actually was.", "Our analysis also determined that objectivity and reliability may be  limited for three of the five prevention-focused performance measures,  because they are based on the results of a convenience sample of  servicemembers who respond to the Defense Equal Opportunity  Management Institute (DEOMI) Organizational Climate Survey request  and voluntarily complete the command-climate survey. As such, the  aggregated results are not generalizable to the larger servicemember  population. According to a senior DOD official, DOD is still determining  the usefulness of using the command-climate survey at the department  level by exploring ways to make the results more representative and  meaningful at the department level. Performance measures lacking  objectivity and reliability may affect the conclusions about the extent to  which progress has been made.", "Additionally, our analysis determined that DOD\u2019s overall suite of  prevention-focused performance measures does not identify core  program activities that relate to its prevention efforts, does not address  government-wide priorities such as cost, quality, and timeliness, and,  as a result, is not balanced among priorities. For example, DOD identifies  SAPR education and training as a key component of its prevention  program, but it is unclear how DOD will determine their effectiveness  given that none of DOD\u2019s measures are designed to gauge the  effectiveness of such activities. Senior DOD officials acknowledged that  DOD has more work to do on refining its sexual-assault prevention  metrics. However, until DOD has fully developed its prevention-focused  performance measures, DOD and other decision makers may be unable  to effectively gauge the progress of the department\u2019s prevention efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since our first report in 2008 on sexual assault in the military, DOD has  made progress in improving its efforts to prevent and respond to sexual  assault across the department. For example, to further develop its  strategy to prevent sexual assault, DOD consulted with CDC and  incorporated CDC\u2019s framework and prevention-related concepts into its  prevention strategy. This included, among other things, defining the  different levels at which sexual-assault prevention efforts occur and  describing the importance of identifying and understanding the domains in  which sexual violence takes place. However, DOD\u2019s 2014-16 Prevention  Strategy does not provide a linkage between its prevention-focused  activities and their desired outcomes and it does not identify risk factors  for two of its domains. These actions could help DOD ensure that it is  taking an evidence-based approach to the prevention of sexual assault.  Further, the prevention strategy has not been systematically  communicated or disseminated to the installation-based program  personnel responsible for its implementation, and the services\u2019 SAPR  policies\u2014another means for communicating direction to program  personnel\u2014have not been aligned with the strategy to reinforce its  purpose. Finally, while DOD has identified performance measures, the  measures are not, in all cases, in line with the key attributes of successful  performance measures, which make it difficult for the department to  reliably determine which activities are helping to prevent sexual assault.  Without fully developing its strategy to prevent sexual assault by linking  prevention activities to desired outcomes, identifying risk factors for all  domains, and including fully developed performance measures,  leadership at all levels of DOD may face challenges in determining the  best prevention efforts to implement in order to prevent sexual assault.  Further, without communicating, disseminating, and aligning the  department\u2019s overarching strategy to prevent sexual assault with the  installation level of the military services, DOD could encounter difficulties  in carrying out its vision to eliminate sexual assault in the military. Lastly,  at the three service-specific and one joint installation we visited, we found  challenges related to collaboration in implementing sexual-assault  prevention activities across the services.

For  example, DOD described a prevention roundtable that includes  representatives from the military services, the National Guard Bureau,  and the Coast Guard and meets quarterly to collaborate on sexual assault  prevention requirements and to share their efforts to prevent sexual  assault. DOD also highlighted that, for more than 2 years, it has hosted  quarterly webinars on topics that can assist with the implementation of its  prevention strategy. We are encouraged by the variety of forums that  DOD sponsors to facilitate information-sharing on prevention initiatives  and, in particular, its recent institution of workshops that help participants  to operationalize the prevention strategy. However, as we noted in our  report, it is important for DOD to develop a plan for communicating the  prevention strategy and its purpose to all personnel to help ensure that it  achieves its goal of department-wide unity of effort in the prevention of  sexual assault.", "With regard to the department\u2019s ability to measure the effectiveness of its  efforts to prevent sexual assault, DOD concurred with our fifth  recommendation that it fully develop its performance measures for the  prevention of sexual assault so that they include all key attributes of  successful performance measures. In its comments, DOD stated that  CDC and leading researchers have recognized sexual assault is a non- standard public health issue that requires different metrics to determine  the causal linkages that exist between preventive indicators and  prevention-related outcomes. DOD also stated that it would continue to  monitor best practices in civilian prevention initiatives, and translate them  to military populations as appropriate. As noted in our report, we  recognize the challenges associated with measuring the progress of  activities with complex outcomes, such as DOD\u2019s efforts to prevent sexual  assault. In these instances, our prior work on effective agency strategic  reviews has shown that the development of performance measures is an  evolutionary process that involves trial and error, particularly for activities  with long-term, scientific discovery-oriented outcomes such as the  prevention of sexual assault. We also recognize the difficulties that are  posed to emergent initiatives\u2014such as the prevention of sexual assault in  the military\u2014by the limited number of examples from civilian initiatives  that may exist to be replicated. However, given the substantive  differences between military and civilian culture, we encourage DOD to  pioneer measures that will most effectively depict the department\u2019s  performance.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness, the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and  the Air Force, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

Specifically, the report was to  address major programmatic improvements made by DOD since August  2013, including those related to the prevention of sexual assault.  Accordingly, in November 2014, DOD submitted its report to the  President in which it noted that the department had increased its focus on  prevention and had demonstrated progress in preventing sexual assault,  and that it planned to intensify its prevention-focused efforts in the coming  years.

We interviewed officials in the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness\u2019s Sexual Assault Prevention and  Response Office (SAPRO) as well as SAPR program officials with the  Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force to obtain an  understanding of their respective roles in developing DOD\u2019s prevention  strategy and the extent to which current military-service policies and  guidance are consistent with the department\u2019s goals and objectives for  preventing sexual assault. We also interviewed officials from the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about their work developing  and evaluating sexual-violence prevention programs and we reviewed  and used CDC\u2019s social-ecological model and public-health model to  evaluate the extent to which DOD identified elements such as domains,  risk factors, and protective factors. Further, we used CDC\u2019s program  planning and development model to assess the extent to which DOD\u2019s  2014\u201316 prevention strategy and related documents contain all of the  elements of a framework for effective sexual-violence prevention  programs identified by CDC. We used Office of Management and Budget  issued guidance on the budget preparation, submission, and execution,  which, among other things, includes information regarding agency  strategic reviews and mitigating risks related to achieving strategic  objectives and performance goals. We also used our prior work on  effective agency strategic reviews, which has shown that it is important to  review progress toward strategic objectives in that it can help to  determine subsequent actions and that leaders and responsible  managers should be held accountable for knowing the progress being  made in achieving outcomes. We compared DOD\u2019s strategy with prior  related GAO reports to determine the extent to which the strategy  addressed any of our previous recommendations on the prevention of  sexual assault in the military.

We also used CDC\u2019s evaluation model for public health  programs to assess whether DOD\u2019s 2014-16 Sexual Assault Prevention  Strategy included the six key elements of effective public health strategies  identified by CDC. To determine the extent to which the military services  have implemented activities to prevent sexual assault, we visited three  service-specific installations\u2014Fort Shafter (Army), Schofield Barracks  (Army), and Marine Corps Base Hawaii\u2014and 1 joint base\u2014Joint Base  Pearl Harbor-Hickam (Navy and Air Force)\u2014on Oahu, Hawaii. We chose  these locations based on the reported high numbers of unrestricted  reported sexual assaults relative to other installations within the same  branch of military service and their close proximity to each other. During  these visits, we met with military officials and program personnel who  were identified as having a role in preventing sexual assault, including  commanders, sexual-assault response coordinators, sexual  harassment/assault response and prevention program managers, victim  advocates, chaplains, criminal investigators, legal personnel, and medical  and mental health-care providers to discuss their familiarity with DOD\u2019s  prevention strategy and whether it had a role in the prevention activities  sponsored at their respective installations. We also discussed the extent  of cross-service collaboration on sexual-assault prevention activities at  these installations and compared them with guidance from the Joint  Chiefs of Staff and leading practices on interagency collaboration to  determine whether the military services have taken the steps necessary  to effectively collaborate on similar prevention efforts.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has developed performance  measures to assess the effectiveness of its efforts to prevent sexual  assault in the military, we reviewed DOD\u2019s 2013 Sexual Assault  Prevention and Response Strategic Plan, its 2014 Report to the President  of the United States on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, its  annual report on sexual assault in the military for fiscal year 2014, its  2014-16 Sexual Assault Prevention Strategy, and other related  documents to identify performance measures that the department uses or  plans to use to assess its progress in preventing sexual assault in the  military.
