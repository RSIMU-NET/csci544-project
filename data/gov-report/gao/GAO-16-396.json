DOD conducts joint market research and service officials responsible for advertising at times share some information about lessons learned. However, there is no formal process for addressing inefficiencies and to ensure information sharing among the services. GAO found examples of possible unnecessary duplication, overlap, and fragmentation that may result from the absence of coordination. For example, the Air Force has three advertising programs that contract with three advertising agencies, but officials could not provide a rationale for requiring separate programs. In the absence of a formal process for coordination, the services may be missing opportunities to effectively leverage advertising resources.", "While DOD has generally followed commercial best practices GAO identified to assess the effectiveness of advertising, DOD's components vary in their ability to determine whether their activities are generating leads for potential recruits. For example, while the Marine Corps has developed a framework to assess the effectiveness of its advertising including leads generated from advertising activities at the local level, Army officials stated they do not have reliable data to evaluate whether locally executed advertising activities are generating leads, and the Army National Guard does not require state units to report on the performance of their advertising activities. Without fully measuring advertising performance, especially at the local levels, DOD may be unable to ensure advertising dollars are used efficiently to help meet recruiting goals.", "DOD does not have comprehensive oversight of the components' advertising activities; instead, DOD's components oversee their own programs. However, examples identified by GAO and others of some components paying sport teams to provide recognition ceremonies for servicemembers\u2014a practice later deemed unacceptable by DOD\u2014suggest that the absence of DOD oversight may have contributed to some activities of questionable appropriateness. Further, GAO observed discrepancies in how recent sports advertising guidance was being interpreted and in service officials' understanding of regulations that direct digital advertising. Without a department-wide policy that clearly defines its oversight role, DOD lacks reasonable assurance that advertising is carried out in an appropriate manner."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD develop a formal process for coordination among its components on crosscutting advertising issues; ensure that the components fully measure the performance of advertising activities; and issue department-wide policy that, among other things, defines DOD's oversight role in advertising.

According to DOD officials, advertising is one of several tools, which also  includes recruiters, that the department uses to influence individuals to  consider military service. DOD requested almost $575 million for fiscal  year 2017 for its advertising programs. Advertising is the placement of  messages intended to inform or persuade an audience through various  types of media, such as television, radio, digital media, direct mail, and  others. Sports-related advertising is among the strategies that the military  services have increasingly used to reach their target market for  advertising. Each military service carries out advertising activities to raise  the public\u2019s awareness of the military and help recruiters generate leads  of potential recruits. Public and congressional interest in DOD advertising  increased after 2015 media reports that an Army National Guard unit had  paid a professional football team to conduct ceremonies that recognized  or honored servicemembers, a practice that the media has referred to as  \u201cpaid patriotism\u201d as these ceremonies appeared to voluntarily honor  military service but were paid for by the military as part of an advertising  contract.", "In our 2003 review of DOD\u2019s advertising activities, we found that DOD did  not have clear program objectives and adequate outcome measures in  place to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising as part of its overall  recruiting effort. We therefore recommended that DOD set such  objectives and develop measures to monitor advertising\u2019s performance  and make choices about advertising funding as part of the overall  recruiting investment. DOD implemented this recommendation and  sponsored research intended to determine how best to evaluate the  effectiveness of military advertising.", "Senate Report 114-49 accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision that we  assess DOD\u2019s sponsorships, sports marketing, and advertising activities  for the active duty, reserve, and guard military service components. This  report examines the extent to which DOD (1) has coordinated its  advertising activities among the military service components, (2) has  followed commercial best practices to assess the effectiveness of  advertising activities, and (3) has oversight of the components\u2019  advertising activities.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has coordinated its advertising  activities among the military service components, we reviewed  department- and service-level guidance pertaining to roles and  responsibilities for advertising. We interviewed officials from the Office of  the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Joint  Advertising and Marketing Research Studies (JAMRS) office, and each of  the military service components\u2019 advertising programs to discuss any  coordination of advertising activities that occurs. We compared the  guidance and information obtained from these interviews against a best  practice identified by private sector advertising experts, which calls for an  effective use of coordination in advertising to improve efficiencies, and  our duplication, overlap, and fragmentation evaluation and management  guide. This guide describes how to identify and evaluate instances of  fragmentation (more than one agency involved in the same broad area),  overlap (multiple agencies or programs with similar goals, activities, or  beneficiaries), and duplication (two or more agencies or programs  engaged in the same activities or services to the same beneficiaries)  among programs.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has followed commercial best  practices to assess the effectiveness of advertising activities, we took  several steps. First, we interviewed officials from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and each of the  military service components responsible for advertising to determine what  types of advertising they conduct and how its effectiveness is determined.  Second, to identify the best practices for assessing the effectiveness of  advertising in the commercial sector, we conducted a preliminary search,  including a literature review, and determined that a well-defined and  widely accepted list of best practices had not been established.  Therefore, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of advertising  companies and professional organizations using a \u201csnowball sampling  methodology,\u201d which consisted of interviewing advertising industry  experts from an initial set of organizations and requesting those experts  to refer additional contacts whom we then interviewed. During these  interviews, we asked each expert or organization representative to  identify best practices for assessing the effectiveness of advertising. We  then compiled these practices into a list and provided the list to the  organizations for review and comment. Although the perspectives of the  organizations included in our sample are not generalizable to the  advertising industry as a whole, we found a sufficient degree of  consensus among the sample for the purpose of developing criteria for  this review. Third, we reviewed the most recent version of each military  service component\u2019s annual marketing and advertising plan, which  ranged from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016, depending on the  service component. We compared each plan and associated processes  with the best practices we identified for assessing the effectiveness of  advertising activities and the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which calls for an organization to have relevant, reliable,  and timely information and communication of that information throughout  the agency in order to achieve all of its objectives. Lastly, we interviewed  officials from the headquarters of each of the military service components\u2019  advertising programs and representatives from their contracted  advertising agencies, and reviewed each component\u2019s marketing and  advertising plan to determine the extent to which the services followed the  identified best practices.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has oversight of the components\u2019  advertising activities, we reviewed federal internal control standards,  which calls for planning, directing, and controlling activities to ensure that  goals and objectives can be achieved. Further, these internal control  standards call for an agency\u2019s activities to be directed through policies.  We compared these standards with (1) any department-level guidance for  advertising or recruiting and (2) advertising activities and service-level  guidance on the review and approval processes related to the services\u2019  and components\u2019 advertising programs. In addition, to determine how the  components provide direction to and oversight of advertising, we  interviewed officials from the headquarters of each of the military services  components\u2019 advertising programs and a judgmental, nonprobability  sample of two lower level recruiting units from each military service  component with advertising responsibilities selected to obtain varying  perspectives. Specifically, we met with units responsible for recruiting and  advertising that represent different regions or areas of the United States,  such as a recruiting district, squadron, or brigade depending on the  service. The subordinate level units were selected to obtain distinct views  within each component, based on variations in the size of budgets,  recruiting goals, or the propensity of youth to serve in the military within  the geographical area of the unit. Lastly, we reviewed contracting data  from fiscal years 2014 through 2015 to identify examples of variations in  the types of activities included in military service component advertising  contracts. Through our discussions with relevant experts and our review  of past work, we determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of corroborating the types of activities included in advertising  contracts.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 to May 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

As such, each Secretary has the authority to  organize and delegate responsibility for advertising efforts within each  military service or components within each military service and, as a  result, the organizational structure of advertising programs and  associated recruiting organizational structure for each of the military  departments differs.", "While advertising is carried out by the military services, some roles and  responsibilities for advertising reside with the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. Within that office, the  Accessions Policy office within Manpower and Reserve Affairs has  responsibility for the (1) policy, planning, and program review of active  and reserve personnel, procurement, and processing and (2)  development, review, and analysis of policies, resource levels, and  budgets for recruiting enlisted personnel and for officer commissioning  programs. One function for recruiting enlisted personnel and officer  commissioning programs is advertising. Further, JAMRS reports to the  Director of DOD\u2019s Defense Manpower and Data Center and is  responsible for joint marketing communications and market research and  studies. JAMRS is to conduct research about the perceptions, beliefs,  and attitudes of American youth as they relate to joining the military,  which is often referred to as the propensity to serve. JAMRS officials  stated that understanding these factors helps ensure recruiting efforts are  directed in the most efficient and beneficial manner. JAMRS has in the  past carried out joint advertising aimed at \u201cinfluencers,\u201d or the adults that  can influence or impact a potential recruit\u2019s decisions regarding military  service. JAMRS also maintains a database that is used across the  military services to begin their outreach to potential recruits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Advertising Conducted by the Military Service Components", "paragraphs": ["The military service components conduct advertising in support of their  recruitment missions. Consistent with the private sector, the components\u2019  advertising programs follow a strategy that considers the phases of an  individual\u2019s decision-making process, sometimes referred to as the  consumer journey. The decision to enlist in the military is a significant  commitment and can be affected by numerous factors, such as other  employment or educational opportunities available to an individual who is  considering a career in the military. According to military service officials,  these phases are generally characterized by the components as  awareness, engagement, and lead generation, as illustrated in figure 1.  The goal of military advertising is to move a potential recruit through each  phase and, ultimately, to a decision to enlist. Further, each military  service conducts advertising throughout each phase that according to  military service officials is intended to communicate and reinforce a  certain brand or image among potential recruits, leading potential recruits  to determine that a particular military service is the best fit for their  individual interests, beliefs, or goals.", "Awareness. The military service components conduct general  awareness advertising to inform members of an audience about the  opportunity to serve in the military and the distinct characteristics of  each military service. The components typically pursue awareness  through traditional advertising formats such as television commercials,  print advertisements, and banners at events or signs within a  community.", "Engagement. Advertising focused on building engagement targets  individuals who are aware of the military as a career option and have  begun to consider the possibility of enlisting. During this phase, the  components seek to provide recruits with additional information to aid  in their decision-making process. Often this phase of advertising takes  place in the digital environment, as components seek to provide  informative social media posts and use banner advertisements to  attract individuals to visit their websites for more information. Figure 2  describes a variety of digital advertising activities conducted by the  components.", "Lead Generation. Lead generation advertising targets individuals  who have considered military service and are ready to discuss the  possibility of enlistment. As such, lead generation activities seek to  encourage these individuals to provide their contact information in  order to schedule an opportunity to meet with a recruiter. Lead  generation is often conducted in person, such as through recruiters\u2019  presence at events like career fairs or sports games. Lead generation  may also be conducted through other means\u2014such as direct mail and  online or print classified advertisements\u2014as long as the  advertisement features a \u201ccall to action\u201d intended to prompt viewers to  provide their contact information. Further, the military services often  employ the use of \u201cmobile assets,\u201d such as large trucks and trailers  fitted with equipment and activities intended to draw crowds and  encourage and facilitate public interaction with a recruiter at an event  in order to generate leads.", "Figure 3 shows some examples of various types of military service  advertising used for recruiting purposes, such as mobile assets used at  recruiting events to advertise a specific military service, digital advertising  on social media, and print brochures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Coordinated Some Advertising Activities among Its Components, but Has Not Developed a Formal Process for Coordination", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Steps to Coordinate Some Advertising Activities", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken steps to coordinate some advertising activities among the  military service components. Within the military departments, there are  seven military service component advertising programs (see app. II for  more details) that compete to attract recruits from a relatively small pool  of individuals that are eligible for military service. Private sector  advertising industry experts we spoke to emphasized the importance of  maintaining a unique brand and strategy for each of the service  components when there is competition for a target audience. According to  DOD officials, each component works to develop a unique brand that  differentiates the military services in order to compete for potential  recruits. While industry experts stated that competition is inherent to  advertising, these experts also stated that coordination can sometimes be  beneficial to increase efficiencies and effectiveness, and that DOD could  pursue greater coordination in some instances to help address any  inefficiencies.", "Despite the competition that exists among the military components\u2019  advertising programs, DOD has coordinated certain advertising activities.  For example, DOD established the JAMRS office in 2002 to create a  centralized program for joint market research and communication.  JAMRS provides the military components with information that informs  their advertising programs from surveys of U.S. youth attitudes toward  joining the military, which change and evolve considerably over time.  Officials across the military components stated that they heavily relied on  the market research conducted by JAMRS and reported using the  information to tailor their advertising and recruiting activities to address  the interests of U.S. youth.", "JAMRS used to provide joint advertising campaigns directed at adults  who might influence an individual\u2019s decision to join the military, such as  parents or coaches, known as influencers. According to JAMRS officials,  joint advertising campaigns of any type have not been carried out in  recent years due to budget constraints. Military service component  officials stated that JAMRS\u2019 joint advertising campaigns had been  important for building awareness among influencers and assisting in  promoting a positive image of military service to the U.S. public. Further,  these officials stated that joint advertising for influencers provided by  JAMRS was beneficial for all the military services and that due to the  resources needed to conduct service-specific advertising, it is not feasible  for their components to conduct additional advertising focused on  influencers.", "Additionally, the Office for Accessions Policy within the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has taken specific steps to  coordinate among the components to attempt to increase the  effectiveness of DOD\u2019s advertising or to address shared challenges in  advertising that are crosscutting in nature and can affect all of the military  service components. For example, the Office coordinated a response to  media and congressional interest in recent activities conducted as part of  sports advertising that were questioned as being inappropriate. Further,  the Under Secretary responded to this crosscutting challenge in  September 2015 by issuing interim guidance for sports marketing that  applied to all service components to prevent inappropriate activities from  occurring as part of sports advertising. In addition, DOD officials stated  that, in an effort to improve the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s advertising, in  2008 the Office for Accessions Policy convened a cross-service working  group of military service component advertising officials to develop a set  of consistent performance measures that each military service component  could use to assess performance. However, DOD officials stated that  consensus was not reached, and thus the measures were not developed.", "Officials from the military service components stated that they meet about  quarterly with their counterparts at meetings held by JAMRS to obtain  their respective results from joint market research conducted by JAMRS,  and at these meetings they will on occasion discuss crosscutting issues  that affect the services\u2019 advertising programs. Military service component  advertising officials stated that these discussions have at times provided  an opportunity to engage in discussions on effective advertising practices  and lessons learned across service programs. Further, military service  officials stated that they have long-standing working relationships with  their counterparts among the services and that they do on occasion share  some information during these discussions. However, the officials stated  that they may not share comprehensive details of best practices or  lessons learned because of the competition for recruits among the  components and because they are not required to share information or  coordinate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have a Formal Process for Coordination among the Services, Which Can Result in Possible Unnecessary Duplication, Overlap, and Fragmentation", "paragraphs": ["The private sector executives and professional association  representatives we spoke with stated that while competition is an inherent  aspect of advertising, increasing coordination should be considered in  order to reduce inefficiencies and leverage resources effectively. Further,  we have found in prior work that mechanisms to coordinate programs that  address crosscutting issues may reduce the instances of potentially  duplicative, overlapping, and fragmented efforts. While DOD has taken  some steps to coordinate, the department has not established a formal  process to ensure that service component advertising officials have a  forum to share information and address crosscutting issues  systematically, and that these discussions are consistently occurring, to  help ensure an efficient use of resources in the competitive environment  for recruitment.", "In the absence of a formal process for coordination, we found examples  of possible unnecessary duplication, overlap, and fragmentation within  DOD\u2019s advertising activities.", "Risk of Increased Cost of Advertising Media Purchases. Industry  experts and various military service officials stated that as each  military service component purchases advertising space in the same  media market, such as the time to air an advertisement on radio or  television, competition among the services could increase the prices  of these purchases. Further, they stated that working together could  increase the buying power for certain activities. As such, from a  department-wide perspective, DOD is at risk of making duplicative  purchases in the same market with no coordination regarding the cost  and effectiveness of those purchases. Officials from one military  service component acknowledged that the competition for media  purchases most likely results in a more expensive manner of doing  business for the entire military.", "Multiple Contracts for Similar Functions. While each service  component\u2019s advertising agency works with the component to develop  a unique brand that differentiates the military services, the  components each contract for some functions that are not brand  specific. For example, service officials reported that each component  has advertising contracts that include services such as call centers  and website chat-function support that respond to requests for  information generated by advertising, and that screen potential  recruits against general criteria for military service. As such, there are  at least seven call center functions that the department uses to screen  potential recruits. Most of these call centers are staffed by contractors  from the general public and do not provide a service-specific function.  Thus the department is paying several different companies to provide  a similar service. Advertising industry experts pointed to functions that  are not brand specific as possible opportunities for obtaining  efficiencies through coordination or consolidation. However, military  service officials disagreed with this assessment and stated that  benefits that might result from consolidation of these types of  functions are unclear and that call centers may provide brand-specific  information. For example, officials from the Army National Guard  stated that trained individuals, sometimes Army National Guard  members, can offer state- or territory guard- specific information when  responding to calls from their contracted call center.", "As discussed below, we also found examples where better coordination  within and among the military service components could increase  efficiencies or effectiveness by addressing the fragmentation of these  advertising programs.", "Three Advertising Programs within the Air Force. The Air Force  has three components that each contract with a different advertising  agency to develop and implement three separate advertising  programs. Maintaining three separate programs can lead to  inefficiencies. For example, officials from the Air Force reserve and  guard components stated that they do not have the resources to do  marketing mix modeling. Marketing mix modeling is a best practice  employed by agencies to determine the most efficient and effective  allocation of a client\u2019s budget toward media buys including print,  television, and digital advertising. However, if the Air Force  components coordinated on similar advertising functions that are not  part of their unique branding, such as marketing mix modeling, they  could potentially afford to jointly contract for such functions. In  response to our questions about why they had not coordinated these  programs, officials from the components stated that both the reserve  component and Air National Guard need to focus on the geographic  location of potential recruits to fill vacancies, whereas this is not a  concern for the active duty components. However, they further stated  that there had been discussion of consolidating some components in  the past, possibly the guard and reserve components, but that this  was not pursued. Officials could not provide any further rationale for  requiring separate programs or for why further efforts for consolidation  were not pursued.", "Two Army Advertising Programs. There are two Army advertising  programs, one for the Army active duty and reserve components and  another for the Army National Guard. Better coordination between  these two programs could result in more effective use of resources for  a common purpose. Army National Guard officials stated that they do  not have the resources to fund some needed services that the active  Army could support. For example, Army National Guard officials  stated that they do not procure warehouse space for the storage of  advertising materials for guard units throughout the country or mobile  assets to deploy for National Guard campaigns, which the active Army  could potentially support. Army National Guard officials stated regular  coordination does not exist between these two programs and to  address these shortcomings they have begun to engage in  discussions with the active Army component to further explore  coordination for these activities. A January 2016 report from the  National Commission on the Future of the Army stated that separation  of the Army\u2019s recruiting programs and associated advertising is  inefficient and unproductive. The report recommended the  establishment of pilot programs that align the recruiting efforts of the  active duty Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve as  consolidating the administration and budgeting of recruiting,  advertising, and branding for all components will yield increased  effectiveness and efficiency.", "Army National and Local Advertising. We also found fragmentation  in the Army\u2019s active and reserve advertising programs resulting in  coordination and communication challenges. Within the active and  reserve Army components\u2019 advertising program, the Army has two  organizations that share some degree of responsibility for carrying out  advertising activities: its Army Marketing and Research Group  advertising office which directs the Army\u2019s national level advertising  and U.S. Army Recruiting Command which directs local advertising  for recruiting. Senior officials from both organizations stated their  organization is responsible for lead generation, and recruiters  generate leads at both national and local events.", "While we acknowledge the importance of maintaining a unique brand for  the service components, a formal process for coordination could allow the  military service components to more effectively share best practices. As  part of this process, a review of DOD\u2019s existing programs could potentially  identify opportunities to obtain efficiencies by reducing unnecessary  duplication, overlap, and fragmentation that may exist within and among  military service components\u2019 advertising programs. As numerous  department officials cited a lack of needed resources to appropriately  carry out advertising in order to best execute the difficult task of recruiting,  identifying and reducing unnecessary duplication, overlap, and  fragmentation could potentially free up additional resources.

Military service officials  stated that monitoring such data can help them to assess the  performance of both their advertising activities and contracted  advertising agencies.", "Each of the components also cited research conducted by DOD\u2019s  JAMRS program as a source of unbiased performance data. For  example, JAMRS conducts a quarterly advertising tracking survey,  evaluating the target audience\u2019s recall and reactions to the  components\u2019 television advertising campaigns, which service officials  stated can help the components assess the effectiveness of that  specific type of advertising.", "As each component contracts with a lead advertising agency, the  components typically adhere to this best practice as the agency fulfils  the coordinator role in conjunction with the component."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Components Vary in the Extent to Which They Meet Commercial Best Practices on Planning That We Identified", "paragraphs": ["While all of the military service components develop evaluation  frameworks that identify a target audience in accordance with the  commercial best practice, the goals set by the components vary in  measurability. In our prior work, we have also found that high-performing  organizations have goals that are aligned with performance  management. We found that almost all of the service components  typically develop an annual advertising plan, including information about  their target market and goals to be met by advertising that year. All of  the plans we reviewed demonstrated a detailed understanding of the  target market. For example, the Marine Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2015 plan  recognizes the varying levels of the propensity to join the military among  its target market and identifies an opportunity to focus on \u201cthe movable  middle\u201d\u2014the portion of prospective recruits who are not currently inclined  to join the military but might be willing to consider it. Likewise, reflecting  its organizational structure of 54 state and territorial units, the Air National  Guard\u2019s 2015 annual advertising plan emphasizes targeting advertising to  audiences located near units where career opportunities are available.", "However, the commercial best practice on planning that we identified also  calls for advertising plans to include measurable goals. In our review of  the most recent version of each component\u2019s annual advertising plan, we  found that the components\u2019 plans varied in the extent to which their goals  can be measured. For example, the Army plan we reviewed identifies a  series of marketing objectives supported by measurable, numeric goals  related to the public perception of the Army. In contrast, the Marine Corps  and active duty Air Force plans state goals that relate to emphasizing  positive aspects of the components, such as diversity and core values,  but these goals are not numeric and measurable with related  performance measures. For example, the most recent annual advertising  plan of the Marine Corps includes a goal to weave diversity into all  advertising efforts, while the Air Force annual plan contains a goal that all  advertising tells the Air Force a story in a way that highlights Air Force  core values. Neither plan includes information on how these goals would  be measured. We also found that the annual plans of the Air Force  National Guard and Air Force reserve had a mixture of the types of goals  identified, some of which could be measured. In addition, Army National  Guard officials stated that while it requires each state unit to create an  annual plan that includes goals, the Army National Guard headquarters  does not establish annual goals at a national level. Army National Guard  officials stated that there is not a national level annual advertising plan  with associated goals because each state unit has a unique recruiting  mission, including the types of positions that need to be filled and the  demographic makeup of the target audience. The absence of measurable  goals at the national level may limit Army National Guard headquarters\u2019  ability to determine the success of any national level advertising efforts or  to distribute advertising funds strategically and efficiently among the state  units. Military service officials stated that the annual advertising  campaigns and associated advertising plans for each component can  change considerably from year to year. Ensuring that future iterations of  each component\u2019s annual advertising plan contain measurable goals  could enhance their ability to demonstrate the success of their advertising  programs.", "The components also vary in their use of sophisticated modeling to  determine how to distribute available advertising funds across different  types of advertising (e.g., television, print, Internet, etc.), which was a key  planning best practice cited by industry experts. Specifically, industry  experts stated it is a best practice to use some form of modeling, such as  marketing mix modeling, to determine the optimum distribution of  advertising funds. Officials from the active duty Army, Marine Corps, and  Air Force active duty components stated that they use such modeling,  provided by their contracted advertising agencies, to determine how to  spend their advertising funds.

For example, to measure effectiveness of  awareness related advertising, such as television commercials or national  print advertisements, the components typically measure the number of  times an advertisement is viewed by a member of the audience, numbers  known as impressions. To measure engagement, the components use a  range of real-time digital analytics, including click-through rates and  social media \u201clikes,\u201d among others, when they conduct digital advertising.  According to military officials and representatives of their advertising  agencies, it is an industry standard to directly link the results  demonstrated by these analytics to the purchase of advertising for  awareness and engagement. The components rely on their advertising  agencies to negotiate these purchases with the intent of achieving a level  of performance that is consistent with industry standards for these forms  of advertising.", "In contrast, we found that the components varied in their ability to use  industry standard performance measures to assess the effectiveness of  advertising activities focused on lead generation.

Whereas military service officials stated that advertising focused on  generating awareness and engagement is generally executed at the  national level, lead generation activities are often carried out at the local  level and can depend on recruiters\u2019 familiarity and knowledge of their  local markets. For example, service officials stated that recruiters may  select high school populations to receive direct mailings or interact with  potential recruits at local events such as career fairs or sports games and  may also be responsible for identifying the number of leads generated by  such activities. As a result, the responsibility for measuring the  performance of locally executed lead generation advertising activities is  carried out, in part, at the local level, and some components do not obtain  or measure the performance data needed to assess the effectiveness of  these activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shortcomings in Measuring Lead Generation Contribute to Difficulties in Understanding How Outcomes Can Be Attributed to Advertising", "paragraphs": ["Insufficient data to measure the performance of local lead generating  activities has diminished some of the components\u2019 ability to understand  how to attribute outcomes to specific advertising activities.

In addition, the length and complexity of a  decision to enlist in the military necessitates the use of multiple types of  advertising throughout the recruiting process, and an individual may  ultimately decide to enlist months or years after first being exposed to  advertising by the military.

Specifically, in terms of  collecting this type of performance data, service component officials  stated the following:", "The Marine Corps\u2019 leads tracking system allows the Marine Corps to  link multiple exposures to advertising\u2014such as a direct mailing or  interaction with a recruiter at an event\u2014to a prospective recruit\u2019s lead  record, enhancing the ability to analyze performance in lead  generation.", "While the Navy requires that performance data for local advertising be  entered into its data systems, currently it does not have the capability  to analyze performance in the same manner and cannot attribute  potential leads to multiple exposures to advertising.", "Air Force active duty recruiting squadrons are not required to report to  their headquarters on the performance of their advertising activities,  including the performance of local advertising activities in lead  generation. However, Air Force officials stated they conduct and  assess the performance of the majority of their advertising at the  headquarters level, and a comparatively small portion of advertising  funds are distributed to the squadrons for local advertising activities.", "Both the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard require that  recruiters submit performance data, such as attendance and leads  generated for any local advertising activity and that headquarters  officials review these data in their lead tracking data systems.", "The Army National Guard does not routinely require state units to  provide headquarters with performance data related to advertising,  including lead generation.", "The Army requires in its policy that subheadquarters units submit  advertising performance data for headquarters review, but Army  advertising officials cited concerns with the reliability of these data for  lead generation.", "Regarding the Army\u2019s concerns regarding unreliable data, Army officials  stated that when leads are collected by recruiters at advertising events, in  many cases those leads are coded in their data system as \u201crecruiter  generated,\u201d rather than being attributed to the appropriate advertising  activity. As a result, Army officials stated that although they believe their  locally executed advertising activities are a good investment, they do not  have sufficient evidence to demonstrate their effectiveness. For example,  while Army Recruiting Command officials cited \u201cregister to win\u201d giveaways  for promotional items at local events as an effective lead generator, Army  Marketing and Research Group officials stated they do not have data to  support the effectiveness of this advertising activity and questioned the  quality of the leads produced. Army officials stated that they are currently  working to address this issue to ensure leads are properly coded and thus  improve the reliability of this data.

We found differences in the understanding of  rules and regulations that apply to digital advertising activities. The  government is restricted in tracking the digital behavior of those that  visit government websites. However, we observed differing opinions  and understanding among military service officials regarding what  types of digital tracking was permissible. Officials from the Air Force  active duty component\u2019s advertising program and representatives  from their contracted advertising agency stated that persistent  tracking would be used in their new website development and that  these plans adhere to relevant DOD guidance.

In our review of contracts from fiscal years 2013 and  2014, we found several contracts with a marketing firm that connects  brands to collegiate sports teams that included costs for honorary or  swearing in ceremonies and items that are personal in nature. For  example, we identified a contract spanning fiscal years 2013 and  2014 in which a major public university received $20,000 from a state  Army National Guard unit for two swearing in ceremonies of recruits  conducted at sporting events, and another state Army National Guard  unit contracted in fiscal year 2014 for a \u201cVIP experience\u201d at university  sporting events costing approximately $8,700."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Taken Some Steps to Improve Oversight but Does Not Have a Department-Wide Policy to Guide the Components\u2019 Advertising Programs", "paragraphs": ["Subsequent to the negative media reports in 2015 and resulting DOD  reviews in September 2015, the acting Under Secretary for Personnel  and Readiness issued interim guidance that provided more focused  direction and strengthened oversight of sports marketing and advertising  contracts. The interim guidance acknowledged the inappropriateness of  paying for recognition or swearing in ceremonies during sports events or  the inclusion of items that are personal in nature, typically sports tickets or  parking, for which the receipt of those items is not clear or controlled.  Specifically, this guidance (1) requires that a senior military component  reviewing official approve sports marketing contracts, (2) prohibits paying  for recognition ceremonies, (3) restricts items that are personal in nature,  and (4) requires reporting and analysis on the returns generated by larger  sports partnerships.", "While the issuance of the interim DOD-level sports marketing guidance is  a positive step, a senior DOD official acknowledged that the interim  guidance was vague regarding how some of these new requirements are  to be implemented, did not include some monetary thresholds that it could  have identified, and applied only to sports marketing and advertising  contracts. As such, in our discussions with service officials responsible for  carrying out local level advertising, we observed discrepancies in how the  guidance was being interpreted. For example, there were differences in  opinions among local level advertising officials about the inclusion of  honorary or swearing in ceremonies in contracts with sports teams. One  local level official stated that the recent interim guidance now restricts any  mention of an honorary ceremony in a contract, while other officials stated  that such activities could still be included in a contract as long as they  were listed with a cost of $0.00 and considered \u201cadded value.\u201d Further, as  the interim guidance only applies to sports advertising, it does not  address the procedures that the components should follow when carrying  out other types of advertising. For example, the components may contract  to carry out advertising at music concerts or festivals. These events are  similar in nature to sporting events as they may also allow for the  inclusion of tickets other premium items in advertising contracts, but  currently there is no DOD-wide advertising guidance that prevents the  inclusion of such items in contracts.", "DOD officials stated that they are currently in the beginning stages of  developing guidance for advertising that is more comprehensive to  replace and build upon the interim guidance that was focused solely on  sports-related advertising, but the details of what this proposed expanded  guidance will cover are not clear. These officials stated that the  department\u2019s process for development, coordination, approval, and  publication of new DOD guidance can be a lengthy one. Further, they  stated that they planned to review the implementation of the interim  guidance and incorporate any lessons learned from the issuance of the  September 2015 guidance, as well as incorporate the findings of our  report before moving forward to create a DOD-wide policy. Because DOD  officials were not able to provide us a draft of this proposed expansion of  guidance, and they stated that they are in the earliest stage of a lengthy  process, it is unclear when DOD will issue department-wide guidance for  advertising. Further, it is unclear whether the guidance will clearly define  DOD\u2019s role in oversight, clarify all remaining issues related to sports  advertising, and provide direction to other types of advertising such as  digital advertising and concerts or other types of event advertising.  Without a policy that clearly defines DOD\u2019s role in oversight of the  advertising activities of the military service components and outlines the  procedures the components should follow for all types of advertising  activities, DOD may not be able to ensure that the components are  carrying out other types of advertising in a manner that it considers  appropriate. More broadly, while it may be appropriate for the service  components to have variations in advertising policies given that they  operate separate programs in some instances and we are encouraged  that DOD officials stated that they will address current weaknesses such  as those we identify in this report, without a policy that defines procedures  for all types of advertising activities, DOD risks abuses or inappropriate  activities in other advertising in the future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Advertising activities provide information and seek to influence the beliefs  and understanding of potential recruits about each military service, and  the services conduct advertising to help meet their recruitment goals.

We interviewed officials from the  Accessions Policy office within the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Joint Advertising and  Marketing Research Service (JAMRS), and each of the military service  components\u2019 advertising programs to discuss the ways in which DOD has  taken steps to coordinate advertising activities as well as ways in which  the military service components coordinate with each other to achieve  efficiencies in advertising. Further, we discussed any methods used to  share best practices or lessons learned for advertising, either formally or  informally, among the military service components. We also conducted  interviews in Fort Knox, Kentucky, with officials from the U.S. Army  Recruiting Command, the U.S. Army Cadet Command, and the U.S.  Army Accessions Support Brigade, organizations that play a role in  advertising for the active and reserve Army components.

Specifically, the  private sector advertising experts we met with during the course of this  review stated that it is a best practice to consider an effective use of  coordination to increase efficiencies in advertising. As there are seven  advertising programs carried out by the military services as well as  JAMRS, we reviewed these programs against the evaluation and  management guide as it describes how to identify and evaluate instances  of fragmentation (more than one agency involved in the same broad  area), overlap (multiple agencies or programs with similar goals,  activities, or beneficiaries), and duplication (two or more agencies or  programs engaged in the same activities or services for the same  beneficiaries) among programs. Further, the guide can help identify  options to reduce or better manage the negative effects of fragmentation,  overlap, and duplication, and evaluate the potential trade-offs and  unintended consequences of these options.", "We took four major steps to determine the extent to which DOD has  followed commercial best practices to assess the effectiveness of  advertising activities. First, we interviewed officials from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and each of  the advertising programs of the military service components to determine  the types of advertising they conduct and how its effectiveness is  determined. Second, to identify existing best practices for assessing  effectiveness of advertising, we conducted a preliminary search, including  a literature review, and determined that a well-defined and widely  accepted list of best practices had not been established. Therefore, we  selected a nongeneralizable sample of advertising companies and  professional organizations using a \u201csnowball sampling methodology,\u201d  which consisted of interviewing advertising industry experts from an initial  set of organizations and requesting those experts to refer additional  contacts to participate in the review.

Based on the interviews, we identified key practices reported by each  expert or organization, including organizational structures to safeguard  against bias in performance evaluation, processes for planning and goal- setting in advance of advertising, and standard performance measures  used to assess advertising. We compiled these practices into a list and  provided the list to the organizations for review and comment. Although  the perspectives of the organizations included in our sample are not  generalizable to the advertising industry as a whole, we found a sufficient  degree of consensus among the sample for the purpose of developing  criteria for this review.", "Third, following the development of the best practices, we interviewed  officials from each of the military service components responsible for  advertising, as well as the components\u2019 contracted advertising agencies,  to determine the extent to which the components follow the practices we  identified.

We also considered regulatory requirements or  other potential barriers to government agencies following the best  practices we identified.", "Finally, to determine how performance data related to advertising  activities is collected and reviewed below the headquarters level, we  developed and administered a structured questionnaire to lower level  recruiting officials with responsibility for local advertising from two lower  level units per service component. Based on our discussions with the  components\u2019 headquarters-level advertising officials, we determined the  appropriate officials to participate in the semistructured interview were  located at the brigade level of the Army, district level of the Navy and  Marine Corps, squadron level of the Air Force active and reserve  components, and state level of the Army and Air National Guards. Given  the total population of 177 units, we chose to use a judgmental,  nonprobability sampling approach to select 2 subordinate units from each  of the seven components, for a total 14 interviews. We selected the units,  in consultation with service component headquarters officials, using  criteria intended to obtain a variation of perspectives within each of the  components. Due to the degree of differences among the components in  command structure and methods for allocating advertising funds across  subordinate units, we tailored the criteria to the characteristics of each  component. For several components, we selected units based on the size  of the budget received for local advertising, choosing a unit with a larger- than-average advertising budget and a unit with a smaller-than-average  advertising budget. If a component provided roughly equal local  advertising funding to all subordinate units, we used another selection  criterion to obtain varying perspectives, such as selecting two units that  represented regions with different propensities to serve or two units with  different recruiting missions such as an enlisted unit and a health  professionals unit. We relied on the headquarters officials from each of  the service components to identify states or units that matched our  selection criteria. Because we interviewed a nongeneralizable sample,  the results cannot be used to make inferences about the population as a  whole.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has oversight of its advertising  activities, we reviewed (1) department-level guidance on advertising and  recruiting and (2) service-level guidance on the review and approval  processes related to the services components\u2019 advertising programs. We  interviewed officials from the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness about the oversight provided to service advertising  programs and the role of JAMRS. In addition, to determine how the  military service components provide direction to and oversight of their  respective advertising programs, we interviewed officials from the  headquarters of each of the military services components\u2019 advertising  programs and we developed and administered a structured questionnaire  to lower level recruiting officials with responsibility for local advertising  from two lower level units per service component. We met with officials  from a judgmental, nonprobability sample of lower level units that  represent a geographic region or area of the United States, such as a  recruiting district, squadron, or brigade depending on the service.

Table 3 shows the DOD reported amounts allotted to the  military service components\u2019 respective advertising and marketing  activities from each component\u2019s annual operations and maintenance  appropriations for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. The Army has received  the highest allotments for its advertising programs. Specifically, the Army  has received about at least two to three times the amount that the other  active-duty components have received.", "In addition, each military service component sets annual goals for  recruitment and retention, for both enlisted servicemembers and officers,  in order to meet defined endstrength requirements. Recruits must meet  numerous standards before they are accessed into the military,  specifically physical, educational, and other standards (e.g., an  acceptable record of behavior). For the reserve and guard components,  the geographic location of vacancies is also important for understanding  and addressing recruitment and retention goals because these  components recruit from a geographic area to fill vacancies in that area  and recruits typically continue to live and work in that area. Conversely,  active duty components recruit from anywhere within the United States  and its territories to meet recruitment goals and recruits are assigned  subsequently to duty stations. Table 4 shows the recruitment goals by  fiscal year from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2016, as of March 1,  2016. The Army and the Army National Guard had the largest recruiting  missions over this time period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, key contributors to this report  were Margaret Best (Assistant Director), Serena Epstein, Mae Jones,  William Lamping, Felicia Lopez, Suzanne Perkins, Carol Petersen,  Ophelia Robinson, Andrew Stavisky, and Amie Lesser."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
