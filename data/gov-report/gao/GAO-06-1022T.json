To help ensure appropriate implementation, the act requires that agencies report annually to the Attorney General, providing specific information about their FOIA operations. In addition, a recent Executive Order directs agencies to develop plans to improve their FOIA operations, including, among other things, goals to reduce backlogs in FOIA requests. GAO has reported previously on the contents of these annual reports for 25 major agencies. For this hearing, GAO was asked to testify both on the annual reports for fiscal year 2005 and on the recently developed improvement plans for these 25 agencies. GAO based its testimony on its ongoing work on these topics. Upon completion of its ongoing review, GAO expects to make recommendations to improve agency implementation of the Executive Order, including efforts to reduce and eliminate backlog."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to data reported by agencies in their annual reports, the public continues to request and receive increasing amounts of information from the federal government through FOIA; however, excepting one case--the Social Security Administration (SSA)--the rate of increase has flattened in recent years. (SSA reported an additional 16 million requests in 2005, dwarfing those for all other agencies combined, which together total about 2.6 million; SSA attributed this rise to an improvement in its method of counting requests. However, Justice officials have suggested that SSA consider treating the bulk of these requests as non-FOIA requests and thus not include them in future reports.) When SSA's numbers are excluded, data reported by the other 24 major agencies show that the number of requests received increased by 27 percent from fiscal year 2002 to 2005, but by only about 2.5 percent from fiscal year 2004. As more requests come in, agencies also report that they have been processing more of them--25 percent more from 2002 to 2005 (but only about 2.0 percent more than from 2004). Despite processing more requests, agencies have not kept up with the increase in requests being made: the number of pending requests carried over from year to year has been steadily increasing, rising to about 200,000 in fiscal year 2005--43 percent more than in 2002. The rate of increase in requests pending is also growing: the increase from fiscal year 2004 to 2005 is 24 percent, compared to 11 percent from 2003 to 2004. Most of the agency improvement plans discussed reducing backlog, but not all consistently followed the Executive Order or implementing guidance provided by the Justice Department. Of the 25 agencies, 3 had not posted their plans in time to be included in this testimony, and 1 reported no backlog. Of the remaining 21 agencies, 12 followed the Executive Order's instruction to establish measurable, outcome-oriented objectives for reducing or eliminating their backlogs, as well as timetables with milestones for meeting these objectives. Nine agencies did not do this, although they accounted for a substantial fraction--about 29 percent--of the requests reported to be pending at the end of fiscal year 2005. (Most agencies did provide goals and timetables for other kinds of objectives, however, such as performing staffing analyses and reviewing progress.) In addition, agencies generally did not specify the dates or numbers they were using as the baselines for their existing backlogs, which will be important for measuring improvement. GAO's ongoing work suggests that factors contributing to these deficiencies include difficulties in coordinating responses among components in large, decentralized agencies and limitations in the systems that track FOIA processing. In addition, neither the Executive Order nor Justice guidance established a baseline date for measuring the backlog or directed agencies to establish such a date. Without clearly defined baselines, specific objectives, and timetables for reducing backlog, it could be challenging for agency heads, Justice, and the Congress to gauge progress in improving FOIA processes as intended by the Executive Order."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s  hearing on the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA).

Among other things, this order requires each agency to  review its FOIA operations and develop improvement plans; by June  14, 2006, each agency was to submit a report to the Attorney  General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) that summarizes the results of the agency\u2019s review and  includes a copy of its improvement plan. These plans are to include  specific outcome-oriented goals and timetables, by which the  agency head is to evaluate the agency\u2019s success in implementing the  plan.

We also  reviewed the Executive Order itself, implementing guidance issued  by OMB and the Department of Justice, other FOIA guidance issued  by Justice, and our past work in this area. Three agencies, the  Departments of State and Homeland Security and the Agency for  International Development, had not published their plans by June  30, and thus we could not analyze them for this hearing.

Public requests for disclosure of records are the best  known type of FOIA disclosure. Any member of the public may  request access to information held by federal agencies, without  showing a need or reason for seeking the information.", "Not all information held by the government is subject to FOIA. The  act prescribes nine specific categories of information that are  exempt from disclosure: for example, trade secrets and certain  privileged commercial or financial information, certain personnel  and medical files, and certain law enforcement records or  information (attachment 1 provides the complete list). In denying  access to material, agencies may cite these exemptions. The act  requires agencies to notify requesters of the reasons for any adverse  determination (that is, a determination not to provide records) and  grants requesters the right to appeal agency decisions to deny  access.", "In addition, agencies are required to meet certain time frames for  making key determinations: whether to comply with requests (20  business days from receipt of the request), responses to appeals of  adverse determinations (20 business days from filing of the appeal),  and whether to provide expedited processing of requests (10  business days from receipt of the request). Congress did not  establish a statutory deadline for making releasable records  available, but instead required agencies to make them available  promptly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The FOIA Process at Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Although the specific details of processes for handling FOIA  requests vary among agencies, the major steps in handling a request  are similar across the government. Agencies receive requests,  usually in writing (although they may accept requests by telephone  or electronically), which can come from any organization or  member of the public. Once received, the request goes through  several phases, which include initial processing, searching for and  retrieving responsive records, preparing responsive records for  release, approving the release of the records, and releasing the  records to the requester. Figure 1 is an overview of the process,  from the receipt of a request to the release of records.", "During the initial processing phase, a request is logged into the  agency\u2019s FOIA system, and a case file is started. The request is then  reviewed to determine its scope, estimate fees, and provide an initial  response to the requester (in general, this simply acknowledges  receipt of the request). After this point, the FOIA staff begins its  search to retrieve responsive records. This step may include  searching for records from multiple locations and program offices.  After potentially responsive records are located, the documents are  reviewed to ensure that they are within the scope of the request.", "During the next two phases, the agency ensures that appropriate  information is to be released under the provisions of the act. First,  the agency reviews the responsive records to make any redactions  based on the statutory exemptions. Once the exemption review is  complete, the final set of responsive records is turned over to the  FOIA office, which calculates appropriate fees, if applicable. Before  release, the redacted responsive records are then given a final  review, possibly by the agency\u2019s general counsel, and then a  response letter is generated, summarizing the agency\u2019s actions  regarding the request. Finally, the responsive records are released to  the requester.", "Some requests are relatively simple to process, such as requests for  specific pieces of information that the requester sends directly to  the appropriate office. Other requests may require more extensive  processing, depending on their complexity, the volume of  information involved, the need for the agency FOIA office to work  with offices that have relevant subject-matter expertise to find and  obtain information, the need for a FOIA officer to review and redact  information in the responsive material, the need to communicate  with the requester about the scope of the request, and the need to  communicate with the requester about the fees that will be charged  for fulfilling the request (or whether fees will be waived).", "Specific details of agency processes for handling requests vary,  depending on the agency\u2019s organizational structure and the  complexity of the requests received. While some agencies centralize  processing in one main office, other agencies have separate FOIA  offices for each agency component and field office. Agencies also  vary in how they allow requests to be made. Depending on the  agency, requesters can submit requests by telephone, fax, letter, or  e-mail or through the Web. In addition, agencies may process  requests in two ways, known as \u201cmultitrack\u201d and \u201csingle track.\u201d  Multitrack processing involves dividing requests into two groups:  (1) simple requests requiring relatively minimal review, which are  placed in one processing track, and (2) more voluminous and  complex requests, which are placed in another track. In contrast,  single-track processing does not distinguish between simple and  complex requests. With single-track processing, agencies process all  requests on a first-in/first-out basis. Agencies can also process FOIA  requests on an expedited basis when a requester has shown a  compelling need or urgency for the information.", "As agencies process FOIA requests, they generally place them in one  of four possible disposition categories: grants, partial grants,  denials, and \u201cnot disclosed for other reasons.\u201d These categories are  defined as follows:  \u25cf  Grants: Agency decisions to disclose all requested records in full.  \u25cf  Partial grants: Agency decisions to withhold some records in whole  or in part, because such information was determined to fall within  one or more exemptions.  \u25cf  Denials: Agency decisions not to release any part of the requested  records because all information in the records is determined to be  exempt under one or more statutory exemptions.  \u25cf  Not disclosed for other reasons: Agency decisions not to release  requested information for any of a variety of reasons other than  statutory exemptions from disclosing records. The categories and  definitions of these \u201cother\u201d reasons for nondisclosure are shown in  table 1.", "When a FOIA request is denied in full or in part, or the requested  records are not disclosed for other reasons, the requester is entitled  to be told the reason for the denial, to appeal the denial, and to  challenge it in court."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Privacy Act Also Provides Individuals with Access Rights", "paragraphs": ["In addition to FOIA, the Privacy Act of 1974 includes provisions  granting individuals the right to gain access to and correct  information about themselves held by federal agencies.

EPA\u2019s goal was to reduce its response backlog  to less than 10 percent of the number of new FOIA requests received  each year. Several agencies set goals to reduce backlog to various  percentages of their current backlog (for example, the CIA, Energy,  the Interior, Justice, and the Treasury). HUD set an absolute goal of  fewer than 400 pending requests.", "Although the remaining 8 agency plans discussed efforts to improve  FOIA processing, they did not contain goals for backlog reduction.  In two cases (GSA and NASA), agencies did not include such goals  because they did not include backlog reduction among the areas of  improvement on which they planned to focus. These agencies did  not consider their backlogs significant; nonetheless, the Executive  Order specifically instructed agencies to include goals and  timetables to address backlog.", "In other cases, agencies did address backlog reduction but did not  define goals. Many of these agencies did define process goals, such  as establishing means to monitor and report on backlog, reviewing  current processes, and identifying and reviewing tracking systems,  but these were not accompanied by goals for backlog reduction:   \u25cf  For example, the Department of Commerce\u2019s plan stated that, to the  extent possible, its components would use current backlog numbers  as a ceiling (these generally range from 9 to 13 percent of the  workload) and work aggressively to reduce these numbers, focusing  particularly on the 10 oldest requests in each component\u2019s backlog.  However, although the plan provided milestone dates for FOIA  officers to review progress in this area and assess any need to  pursue alternatives (such as contract support) for achieving goals,  the plan did not provide measurable targets for assessing success,  such as percentage of reduction.   \u25cf  Similarly, the Department of Defense set various process goals  (identifying those FOIA Offices with backlogs greater than 50 cases,  determining the staffing levels required to significantly reduce the  backlog, and seeking the necessary funding to provide this  additional staffing). However, it provided no measurable targets for  reducing backlog.", "In the timetables that agencies provided in their plans, 12 agencies  provided milestones for goals that they had identified. As mentioned  earlier, one agency (SSA) did not include a milestone for its goal of  eliminating backlog. SSA provided instead a timetable that  addressed process goals: reorganizing its Office of Public Disclosure  and developing a new information system. Like SSA, several  agencies provided timetables for various activities that they  included in their plans to reduce backlog, but these did not include  milestones for outcome-oriented goals (for example, Defense  provided milestones for the process goals described above).", "In addition to setting goals and milestones for those goals, in order  to demonstrate that goals are achieved, plans should also include  baselines against which results can be measured. In the case of  backlog, these numbers can differ from day to day, so specifying a  baseline is crucial. Baselines can be defined on the basis of a date  from which an agency intends to measure, the number it is using as  its baseline, or both. Publicly available baselines are important to  promote accountability as well as the transparency of government  processes.", "However, most of the agency improvement plans do not clearly  define baselines for their existing backlogs. An exception was OPM:  in describing its goal to eliminate backlog by December 31, 2006, it  specified its present backlog as 107 requests. Similarly, the  Department of Education referred to measuring its success in terms  of having fewer open cases at the end of each year, based on a  backlog that it specified as 480 as of June 2, 2006. In other cases,  agencies did not specify whether they planned to measure from the  date of their plans, from the end of fiscal year 2005, or from some  other baseline. Some agencies did, however, describe plans to  perform analyses that would measure their backlogs so that they  could then establish the necessary baselines.", "Our ongoing work suggests that factors contributing to these  deficiencies included difficulties in coordinating responses among  components in large decentralized agencies and limitations in the  way that agency systems track FOIA processing. In addition, neither  the Executive Order nor Justice guidance established a baseline  date for measuring the backlog or directed agencies to establish  such a baseline. Uncertainty regarding defined baselines could  hinder the measurement of progress in reducing backlog. Without  clearly defined baselines, specific objectives, and timetables for  reducing backlog, the risk is that agency heads, Justice, the  Congress, and the public could be hampered in determining whether  and how well agencies have achieved the Executive Order\u2019s aims of  improving FOIA processing and agency disclosure of information.", "When we complete our ongoing review and analysis, we expect to   make recommendations aimed at improving agency implementation  of the Executive Order, including efforts to reduce and eliminate  backlog.", "In summary, FOIA continues to be a valuable tool for citizens to  obtain information about the operation and decisions of the federal  government. Since 2002, agencies have received increasing numbers  of requests and have also continued to increase the number of  requests that they process. In addition, agencies continue to grant  most requests in full. However, the rate of increase in pending  requests is accelerating.", "Given these continuing trends, the President\u2019s Executive Order  creates, among other things, a renewed, results-oriented emphasis  on improving request processing and reducing the backlog of  pending requests. However, our ongoing work suggests that  agencies are not yet fully complying with the order\u2019s requirements  for measurable, outcome-oriented goals and associated timetables.  In addition, agencies have not all established clear baselines for  their existing backlogs. Without a baseline measurement and  tangible steps for addressing the accumulation of pending cases, the  heads of these agencies may be limited in their ability to measure  and evaluate success in implementing their plans as the President\u2019s  order requires. Accordingly, in moving forward, it will be important  for Justice and the agencies to continue to refine these plans so that  the goal of reducing backlogs can be fully realized and the federal  government can remain responsive to citizen needs. When we  complete our ongoing work, we expect to  provide  recommendations to help move this process forward.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
