However, GAO found that half of the six selected contracts it reviewed did not document the Navy's justification for selecting this contract type. Moreover, key documents that should describe the rationale for selecting contract elements varied across these contracts. Given the Navy's plans to invest billions of dollars in shipbuilding programs in the future, without adequate documentation on the rationale for use of an FPI contract and key decisions made about FPI contract elements, contracting officers will not have the information they need to make sound decisions at the negotiation table.", "Department of Defense (DOD) regulation suggests, as a point of departure for contract negotiations, that the government and shipbuilders share the cost risk equally and set a ceiling price 20 percent higher than the negotiated target cost. GAO found that, for most of the 40 ships on the contracts reviewed, these contract terms resulted in the Navy absorbing more cost risk, as shown below.", "Many factors inform the Navy's and shipbuilder's negotiation positions, including the stability of the supplier base and extent of competition. That said, guidance states that the FPI contract elements should be the primary incentive for motivating the shipbuilder to control costs. But GAO found that in five of the six contracts, the Navy added over $700 million in incentives.", "Of the 11 ships delivered as of December 2015 under the six contracts, 8 experienced cost growth. In one case, costs grew nearly 45 percent higher than the negotiated target cost. Further, it is unclear whether the additional incentives achieved intended cost and schedule outcomes, as GAO found a mixed picture among the contracts reviewed. Regulation, while not prescriptive, highlights the benefits of measuring the effectiveness of incentives. According to a senior Navy contracting official, the Navy has not measured incentive outcomes for its shipbuilding portfolio. Without assessing whether adding incentives is effective in improving shipbuilder performance, the Navy is missing an opportunity to better inform decisions about whether to include additional incentives in future awards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["For shipbuilding contract awards, the Navy should (1) document in the contract file its rationale for selecting an FPI contract and the basis for contract elements and (2) conduct a portfolio-wide assessment of its use of additional incentives on FPI contracts across its shipbuilding programs.

Recent  Department of Defense (DOD) initiatives have encouraged the increased  use of fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts as a way to obtain greater  efficiency and productivity in defense spending. In the past 10 years, the  Navy has obligated more than $72 billion in contracts for detail design  and construction. The first ship of a class, called a lead ship, is often  purchased with a cost-reimbursement type contract under which the  government generally bears the risk of cost, schedule, or ship  performance problems. After contracting for the first few ships in a class,  the Navy generally moves to an FPI contract because greater certainty  about costs and performance allows for the use of this type of contract.  FPI contracts provide the shipbuilder an incentive to control costs by  linking final profit realized to final negotiated and actual costs. FPI  contracts also mitigate the shipbuilder\u2019s cost risk in that the Navy shares  in cost increases up to a specified point, and conversely any cost savings  if actual final costs are less than the target cost. While FPI contracts  should motivate the shipbuilder to control costs, according to our past  work, cost and schedule growth remain a persistent problem in Navy  shipbuilding programs.", "For nearly a decade, we have encouraged the use of fixed-price type  contracts for Navy shipbuilding programs. In 2007, we reported that  because the Navy commonly experienced cost growth on lead and follow- on ships it could improve cost outcomes for shipbuilding programs by  increasing the use of fixed-price contracts. We also noted that the use of  fixed-price contracts require that technologies be demonstrated early, the  design be stabilized before construction begins, and that realistic  estimates for cost and schedule be made. In 2009, we also reported on  the Navy\u2019s use of contracts for detail design and ship construction, and  compared it to commercial practices. We found that leading commercial  shipbuilders and ship buyers exclusively employ firm-fixed-price contracts  with accompanying penalties for delays. In comparison, we found that the  Navy often relied upon contract structures that left a higher level of risk  with the Navy as the buyer\u2014such as cost reimbursement and FPI  contracts\u2014often because an incomplete understanding of the effort  needed to complete the ship translated into uncertainty about costs.", "A House Report on the Fiscal Year 2014 National Defense Authorization  Act included a provision for us to examine the Navy\u2019s use of FPI contracts  for shipbuilding programs.

No single  contract type will work for all shipbuilding programs in all cases. The  following is a brief description of each contract type used in Navy  shipbuilding programs:", "Cost-Reimbursement Contracts\u2014the government pays the  shipbuilder\u2019s allowable incurred costs to the extent specified in the  contract and may include an additional fee (profit). These contracts  establish an estimate of total costs and a ceiling that the contract may  not exceed without the approval of the government. The shipbuilder  must put forth its best efforts to perform the work within the estimated  costs. However, the government must reimburse the builder for its  allowable costs regardless of whether the work is completed.

In accordance with the share line, the government and  the shipbuilder share responsibility for cost increases, or decreases,  compared to the agreed upon target cost. The final negotiated cost is  subject to a ceiling price, which is the maximum that may be paid to  the contractor, except for any adjustment under other contract  clauses. Generally, the share line functions to decrease the  shipbuilder\u2019s profit as actual costs exceed the target cost. Likewise,  the shipbuilder\u2019s profit increases when actual costs are less than the  target cost for the ship. Since the shipbuilder\u2019s profit is linked to actual  performance, FPI contracts provide an incentive for the shipbuilder to  control costs. Incentive arrangements can be designed to achieve  specific objectives by motivating contractor efforts that might not  otherwise be emphasized and discouraging contractor inefficiency  and waste.", "Firm-Fixed-Price Contracts\u2014the government agrees to purchase a  ship for a set price and the shipbuilder is required to deliver a ship  regardless of their actual costs. The shipbuilder bears the full  responsibility for increases in the cost of construction and therefore  can earn a higher profit if actual costs are below the contract price.  The shipbuilder bears the maximum risk and full responsibility for all  costs and resulting profit or loss.

The structure of the share line establishes how cost  overruns (over target cost) and cost underruns (below target cost) are  shared between the government and shipbuilder, and is used to calculate  final profit earned by the shipbuilder. The ceiling price is the maximum the  government can pay under the contract, except for adjustments under  other clauses, and is expressed as a percentage of the target cost. The  share line is intended to be the primary incentive for the shipbuilder to  control costs.", "The Navy uses various share line structures under FPI shipbuilding  contracts. A commonly used share line utilizes the same share ratio  between the shipbuilder and the government for both under target and  over target performance. Figure 2 depicts a hypothetical example contract  with a 50/50 share line above and below the target cost, with the ceiling  price set at 120 percent of target cost. This means that the cost overrun  or cost underrun savings would be shared equally between the Navy and  shipbuilder.

The FAR  goes on to state that, if the contract also includes incentives on  technical performance and/or delivery, the performance requirements  should provide a reasonable opportunity for the incentives to have a  meaningful impact on the contractor\u2019s management of the work.  Further, the FAR specifies that FPI contracts are appropriate when  the parties can negotiate at the outset a firm target cost, target profit,  and profit adjustment formula that will provide a fair and reasonable  incentive and a ceiling that provides for the contractor to assume an  appropriate share of the risk.

Moreover, during the 1980s, FPI contracts became  the preferred contract type for detail design and construction of lead ships  and follow-on ship construction, with many of the contracts using a 50/50  share line. According to DOD officials, FPI contracts fell out of fashion  after the 1980s, with the Navy awarding more cost-type contracts  throughout the 1990s.

In contrast, in our prior work when we  examined commercial shipbuilding practices we found that ships are  usually delivered on time, at cost, and with expected quality. Our prior  work highlights differences in Navy and commercial shipbuilding  contracting practices, which reflect differences in the two environments:  In May 2009, we found: (1) for commercial shipbuilders and ship  buyers, only firm-fixed-price contracts were used for design and  construction activities, and the delivery date of the ship is clearly  established in the contract with accompanying penalties for delays; (2)  commercial buyers were able to choose from a competitive global  base of available shipyards and suppliers without generally needing to  consider the long-term health of any individual yard or supplier; and  (3) buyers and shipbuilders both made acquisition decisions based on  anticipated return on investment.", "In November 2013, we reported that as opposed to commercial  buyers, which typically operate in a robust, competitive environment,  the Navy has a limited industrial base to build its ships. We noted that  one result of the limited industrial base is that the Navy may award  sole source contracts in order to sustain workloads and the solvency  of the companies involved.

These factors  constrain the Navy\u2019s ability to award shipbuilding contracts competitively.

According to this same official, although the  directorate had not been consistent in completing a determination and  findings document for incentive-fee contracts, the general business  process in place within the directorate, even prior to the FAR change, was  to include discussion of contract type, including any applicable incentive  fees, in the business clearance memorandum or acquisition planning  documents.", "Navy contracting officials told us that business clearance memorandums,  specifically, are key documents for obtaining insight into decisions  regarding FPI elements (e.g., target cost, share line, and ceiling price).

Two of the six contracts we reviewed were initially sole  source awards. In these cases, generally all contract terms\u2014including  contract type\u2014were established through bilateral negotiations between  the Navy and the shipbuilder. Therefore, once the Navy selects an FPI  contract, the contract elements that are used to determine final contract  price\u2014including the share line and ceiling price\u2014are subject to  negotiations; the Navy cannot rely on competitive forces to strengthen its  negotiation position. The LPD 21 is an example of the reduced leverage  the government has in a sole source environment. During negotiations for  detail design and construction of LPD 21, the Navy agreed with the  shipbuilder\u2019s request to change from an FPI/award-fee contract\u2014as had  been specified in the RFP\u2014to a cost-plus-incentive-fee/award-fee  contract. Specifically, the shipbuilder informed the Navy that an  FPI/award-fee contract would require it to offer an excessively  conservative and unaffordable target cost. In light of this position, Navy  contracting officials believed that a cost-plus-incentive/award-fee contract  would be an acceptable solution. As a result, the program requested and  received approval from the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research,  Development, and Acquisition to proceed with cost-plus-incentive- fee/award-fee negotiations.", "Even under the inherent constraints posed by the U.S. shipbuilding  industrial base, competition can better position the Navy in negotiations  than in a sole source environment. In a competitive RFP, for example, the  contract type and other terms, including the share line and ceiling price,  that the Navy specifies in its RFPs generally remain the same through  negotiations and award in competitive acquisitions. Under this scenario,  competition can help ensure that the shipbuilders put forth their best offer.  For example, the Navy\u2019s RFP for DDG 114-116, which used limited  competition between the two builders of the DDG 51-class destroyers,  specified an FPI contract type, 50/50 share line, target profit, and ceiling  price.  These contract terms remained consistent throughout  negotiations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy and Shipbuilders Weigh Multiple Factors to Determine FPI Contract Elements", "paragraphs": ["During our discussions with Navy contracting officials and shipbuilder  representatives they emphasized that they consider multiple factors  during contract negotiations to determine their negotiating positions  regarding the various FPI contract elements. As shown in figure 6 below,  how these factors are balanced in a contract ultimately determines the  Navy\u2019s share of cost risk. Each contract is distinct with individual factors  that are weighed differently depending on the unique circumstances of  the acquisition. For example, if the contract is for a lead ship of a new  class, the Navy and shipbuilder may weigh factors differently than if the  contract is for a class where numerous ships have been delivered, since  as we have reported previously, cost growth and schedule delays can be  amplified for lead ships. The factors range from broad considerations\u2014 such as degree of competition and the health of the industrial base\u2014to  considerations specific to individual shipbuilding programs, such as the  number of ships expected to be procured under a contract.", "Across the six selected contracts we reviewed, several factors shaped the  structure of FPI contract elements. For example, one factor that shaped  the structure of the FPI contract for the ESD/ESB program was that  competition existed to build the ships, which enabled the Navy to issue a  competitive RFP for system design with options for ship construction  (lead ship and two follow-on ships) specifying an FPI contract type, share  line, and ceiling price. Two shipbuilders submitted offers; however, one of  the offerors withdrew and the contract was awarded to NASSCO. When  the Navy exercised the options for ship construction, NASSCO  representatives told us that NASSCO considered several factors in  developing its proposal, including the use of a commercial ship design  and the other workload NASSCO planned to have in the shipyard, which  impacts overhead rates. In response to the shipbuilder agreeing to the  Navy\u2019s contract terms, the Navy altered the underrun share line stated in  the RFP and agreed to allow the shipbuilder to receive a greater share of  the profit in the event actual costs were lower than expected.", "An important factor in determining FPI contract elements for the Navy and  shipbuilder is whether the contract will be a multi-year or block buy  contract. These special contracting methods, which can only be used if  Congress takes certain actions, allow DOD to acquire more than one  year\u2019s requirements under a single contract award without having to  exercise a contract option for each year after the first. Three of the six  contracts we reviewed were awarded as block buy or multi-year  procurement contracts. In 2010, the Navy awarded a block buy contract  for 10 ships to each of the two LCS shipbuilders, and the SSN 774 class  contract was awarded in 2008 as a multi-year contract. These contract  methods have the potential to create cost savings compared to a series of  annual contracts because the shipbuilder is given an expectation of future  workload, and allow for more economic procurement from suppliers and  more efficient production which can translate into lower ship prices for the  government. Under these contracting methods, the Navy and the  shipbuilder typically negotiate prices for construction of all the ships on  the contract at the same time, as well as the share line and ceiling price.  Under such negotiations, the shipbuilder and Navy need to make assumptions regarding the shipbuilder\u2019s efficiencies, learning, and  suppliers far into the future. For the three block buy or multi-year  contracts we reviewed, we found that the share lines and ceiling prices  did not change across the ships on each of these contracts, with target  costs generally lower for ships procured later in the build profile,  presumably to account for the shipbuilders\u2019 efficiencies and learning."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Structure of FPI Contract Elements Often Resulted in the Navy Absorbing More Cost Risk Than Guidance Advises, and Added Incentives Increased the Shipbuilders\u2019 Potential Profitability", "paragraphs": ["Although FPI contracts are intended to motivate the shipbuilder to control  costs by requiring the shipbuilder to assume a suitable share of the cost  risk, the Navy often structured the FPI contracts we reviewed such that it  shouldered more cost risk than guidance suggests as a starting point.

As  previously noted, DOD\u2019s Better Buying Power initiative also encourages  use of FPI contracts, when appropriate, as a means to achieve better cost  performance.

According to April 2016 DOD guidance, the target  cost should factor in the costs of known risks. Thus, to determine a target  cost that reflects anticipated costs of performance, the Navy and  shipbuilders need to evaluate and attempt to determine the cost of the full  risk involved in constructing a ship. As we have previously found, the  Navy has often proceeded to contract award with significant technical  risk, unclear expectations between buyer and builder, and cost  uncertainty. This was in part because the Navy had not allocated  sufficient time prior to contract award to retire technical risks. We found  that in two of the six contracts we reviewed\u2014the LPD 17 class and LCS  ships\u2014significant cost uncertainties made establishing a realistic target  cost challenging. While various considerations need to be taken into  account in negotiating target cost\u2014and, in the case of LPD 17 class,  Hurricane Katrina was an unusually disruptive factor\u2014the Navy\u2019s desire  to sustain the industrial base, as discussed earlier, was a key driver.", "LPD 22-25: There was significant uncertainty at the time of contract  negotiations for LPD 22-23. During the course of contract negotiations  in summer 2005, the lead ship, LPD 17, was delivered incomplete at a  cost of $800 million more than planned. Then in August 2005,  Hurricane Katrina caused major damage to the Gulf Coast area and  the shipbuilder\u2019s facilities, which resulted in the shipbuilder  withdrawing all of its proposals until operations resumed. The Navy  subsequently amended its solicitation to include options for two more  ships (LPD 24 and LPD 25). The shipbuilder increased its proposed  vessel labor hours for all 4 of the ships to account for increased use of  inexperienced labor, out of sequence work, and additional rework,  among other things, resulting from the hurricane. The contract was  negotiated even though these were the first LPD 17 class ships  beginning construction after Hurricane Katrina and there was still  considerable risk surrounding the ships\u2019 likely costs; the unique  circumstances posed by the hurricane made it difficult to know  whether the vessel labor hour increase would be representative of the actual impact on labor hours. In contrast, the Navy agreed to an  increase in the target cost for LPD 26 when compared to LPD 25  because outcomes for LPD 22-25 were better understood at that time  and because of unique schedule challenges with LPD 26.

Further, as we previously reported,  these ships were delivered in an incomplete state and had  outstanding technical issues. As a result, there was an incomplete  understanding of the costs on which to base the target costs when the  FPI contracts were awarded.", "In contrast, on the SSN 784-791 contract, the Navy had greater certainty  about the shipbuilder\u2019s ability to achieve its cost targets because the  shipbuilder had already delivered five ships at the time of contract award."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy and Shipbuilders Usually Shared Equally in Cost Overruns on the Share Line, but Navy Shouldered Additional Cost Risk by Setting Higher Ceiling Prices", "paragraphs": ["Another critical element of an FPI contract is how the burden of cost  overruns or underruns is shared between the Navy and the shipbuilder,  which is a function of the share line. The ceiling price, or the maximum  amount the government will pay as part of the FPI structure (excluding  other contract clauses), is also used to apportion risk between the Navy  and shipbuilder. It is a combination of both the share line and ceiling price  that determines the amount of cost risk placed on both the Navy and the  shipbuilder. We found that, for the six shipbuilding contracts we reviewed,  the share lines or ceiling prices, or both placed more cost risk on the  Navy than guidance and regulation recommends as a starting point, as  seen in figure 7.", "A memorandum issued by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for  Research, Development, and Acquisition in 2003 stated that Navy  contracting officials should consider at least an equal sharing  arrangement, or \u201c50/50 share line\u201d for most FPI contracts. This guidance  also states that the contracting officer should use \u201caggressive\u201d sharing  arrangements, requiring the shipbuilder to share a substantial portion of  both cost underruns and overruns whenever appropriate. The guidance  also states that the Navy should consider cost sharing arrangements that  increase the shipbuilder\u2019s share if cost overruns increase, rather than  sharing them equitably. For example, in many cases it may be  appropriate to use a 50/50 share line for cost outcomes that are within  plus or minus 5 percent of the target costs and 40/60 or 30/70 for other  cost outcomes. In addition, since 2011, the DFARS has stated that the  contracting officer shall pay particular attention to share lines with a 50/50  share ratio as the point of departure for establishing the incentive  arrangement. With the exception of two contracts, the selected  contracts we reviewed used a share line with a 50/50 share ratio. The  exceptions were (1) the LPD 22-25 contract, which had overrun share  lines that varied depending on target cost performance and that held the  Navy accountable on the share line for a greater degree of cost growth  than the shipbuilder and (2) the SSN 784-791 contract, which had an  overrun share ratio that held the shipbuilder accountable on the share line  for a greater degree of cost growth than the Navy.", "The ceiling price is also used to apportion risk between the Navy and  shipbuilder. The ceiling price is often expressed as a percentage of the  target cost; however, ceiling prices are dollar values, not percentages.  Since 2011, the DFARS has stated that for FPI contracts contracting  officers should consider a ceiling price of 120 percent of the target cost as  a point of departure for establishing the incentive arrangement, meaning  that the maximum the government could pay would be target cost, plus  an additional 20 percent. DOD recently reiterated this point in April 2016  guidance. The Director of Defense Pricing stated that the actual ceiling  price percentage to be used is a function of the perception of risk and  who should bear that risk on any particular contract. He noted that in most  instances, negotiated ceiling prices in contracts for major weapon  systems other than shipbuilding, have been less than 120 percent.", "In 38 of the 40 ships on the contracts we reviewed (the exceptions being  ESD 1 and ESB 4), the Navy shouldered additional risk by setting higher  ceiling prices than guidance suggests as a point of departure. In the case  of the LPD 26 contract, the Navy agreed to a higher ceiling percentage  than guidance suggests; the Navy believed this was appropriate given,  among other things, the increased risk due to a gap in construction with  the prior hulls and the shipbuilder assuming a greater degree of risk on  the share line.

Contract  file documentation states that the Navy\u2019s analysis of the shipbuilder\u2019s  performance on prior hulls indicated that there was a 50 percent  premium to complete heavy industrial work in the water; therefore, the  milestone-based incentives were structured to incentivize higher  levels of ship completion prior to launch.

As a  result, this public version of the original report does not contain certain  information deemed to be sensitive but unclassified by DOD, including  specific share lines, ceiling prices, and target costs of the Navy ships we  assessed, our assessment of the share of cost risk between the Navy and  shipbuilder on the 40 ships reviewed, specific dollar amounts of added  incentives on ships we assessed, and Navy and shipbuilder cost  outcomes on six delivered ships with significant cost growth. This report  uses data from December 2015 to be consistent with the report issued in  November 2016.", "To determine the Navy\u2019s use of FPI contracts over the last 10 years, we  compiled and analyzed Department of Defense (DOD) data on contracts  awarded for detail design and construction of new ships from November  2005 through November 2015. To ensure the reliability DOD data, we  compared it to data from DOD\u2019s Naval Vessel Registry to confirm the  award date of each ship, and for all contracts awarded during our 10-year  time frame, we reviewed the documentation available in DOD\u2019s Electronic  Document Access System to verify contract number, award date, and  contract type. As part of this process we determined that the data  provided by DOD was sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this audit.  Using this information, we identified the universe of Navy detail design  and construction contracts awarded on an FPI basis during our 10-year  time frame.", "To identify factors that influence the Navy\u2019s contracting approach when  awarding FPI contracts for ship construction and how the Navy apportions  risk between the government and the shipbuilder for these contracts, we  reviewed a non-generalizable sample of six FPI contracts for the detail  design and construction of five different shipbuilding programs using the  following characteristics:  contract award between November 1, 2005, and November 30, 2015; number of ships on the contract; at least one ship on the contract had previously been delivered or  would be delivered imminently; and  representative of the majority of U.S. shipyards that build Navy  vessels, including Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama; General Dynamics  Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine; General Dynamics Electric Boat in  Groton, Connecticut; General Dynamics NASSCO in San Diego,  California; Huntington Ingalls Industries in Pascagoula, Mississippi;  Marinette Marine Corporation in Marinette, Wisconsin.", "As shown in table 4, the five shipbuilding programs executed under the  six FPI contracts that met these criteria include 40 ships: one contract  with two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers (DDG 51 class),  one contract with two expeditionary transfer dock (ESD) and two  expeditionary mobile base (ESB) ships, two contracts each with 10  littoral combat ships (LCS), one contract for six San Antonio-class  amphibious transport dock ships (LPD 17 class), and one contract with  eight Virginia-class submarines (SSN 774 class).", "For our six selected contracts, we reviewed contract file documentation  including acquisition planning documents, requests for proposals (RFP),  business clearance memorandums\u2014key documents that explain the  rationale for contract selection and structure of FPI contract elements  including target cost, target profit, share line, and ceiling price, cost and  schedule data, and program briefings, among other documents. To  identify changes in FPI contract elements through contract modifications  over the life of the contract, we compared information in the base contract  at the time of initial award, including the target cost, share line, ceiling  price, and incentives, to this same information in the conformed contract,  or the most up-to-date contract as of December 2015, which reflects any  changes made to the contract since initial award. Note that ceiling prices  are often expressed as a percentage of the target cost in the contract  documentation; however, ceiling prices by definition are dollar values, not  percentages. Since target costs and ceiling prices can change through  modifications to a contract, the ceiling price and target cost indicated in  updated contract documentation may not equate to the previously  established ceiling price percentage denoted in the same documentation.  For consistency, we used the ceiling price percentage cited for each ship  when available to complete our analysis of this contract element.", "We also reviewed relevant guidance on contract selection and the use of  FPI contracts including Federal Acquisition Regulation, DOD and Navy  guidance on FPI contracts including the DOD and National Aeronautics  and Space Administration Incentive Contracting Guide, and memorandum  from DOD and Navy regarding the implementation of FPI contracts. We  supplemented our review of contract file information by interviewing Navy  program and contracting officials for each shipbuilding program  associated with our selected contracts, senior contracting officials in the  Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Contracts Directorate, officials  from the Navy\u2019s Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair  (SUPSHIP), officials from the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics) Office for Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy, and shipbuilding officials.", "To determine the extent to which FPI contracts led to desired outcomes,  we analyzed contract file information and cost data for ships delivered as  of December 2015 on our selected contracts to identify the delta (cost  overrun or underrun) between the target cost for each ship in the most  up-to-date contract as of December 2015, to SUPSHIP\u2019s estimated  construction cost of the ship at completion as of December 2015.  SUPSHIP officials agreed that the estimated construction cost of the ship  at completion is a reasonable estimate of ship construction cost at  delivery. According to SUPSHIP officials, the actual final cost of the ship  is determined when the contract is closed out which typically occurs  several years after the ship has been delivered, and none of our six  selected contracts had been closed out.", "We then calculated the price paid by the Navy and shipbuilder profit or  loss for ships delivered as of December 2015 in the following manner:  1.  We calculated the delta between the target cost for each ship in the  most up-to-date contract as of December 2015 and SUPSHIP\u2019s  estimated construction cost of the ship at completion as of December  2015 to identify if the ship was in a cost overrun or underrun scenario.  2.  Using the contract share lines, we calculated both the Navy and the  shipbuilder\u2019s financial responsibility for the cost overrun, or conversely  any cost savings.  3.  We then calculated profit earned by the shipbuilder, if any, and added  this amount to the total cost that the Navy was responsible for to  determine price to the Navy (cost and profit earned on the share line)  for detail design and construction of the ship.  4.  To determine profit or loss for the shipbuilder, we calculated the  difference between target profit and the shipbuilder\u2019s responsibility for  the cost overrun, or conversely any cost savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact name above, the following staff members made  key contributions to this report: Diana Moldafsky (Assistant Director),  Jennifer Echard, Nathan Foster, Laura Greifner, Julie Hadley, Kurt Gurka,  Julia Kennon, Jean McSween, Roxanna Sun, Abby Volk, Alyssa Weir,  and Andrea Yohe."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["The Navy buys ships using a certain contract type that outlines how it will share the burden of unexpected costs with shipbuilders, while also giving them additional money for constructing ships efficiently.", "However, in the 6 contracts we reviewed, we found the Navy bore the majority of additional costs.
