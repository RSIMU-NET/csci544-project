To be eligible to apply for rental assistance programs of the Departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Agriculture (USDA), or to live in units produced by the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, households must have incomes at or below a specific limit, generally 50 percent or 60 percent of the median household income for their area. At the 50 percent income limit, 20 percent of servicemembers who received BAH would have been eligible if BAH were excluded from income determinations, compared with 1 percent with BAH included. Most junior enlisted members would have been eligible if BAH were excluded, as would have small percentages of senior personnel. However, at all levels, many would not have been eligible if their households had even modest income from other sources. Agency and community officials cited factors that could limit the role of federal programs in building housing or helping servicemembers afford existing units near four installations that GAO examined. DOD officials said that servicemembers would be unlikely to need the programs because BAH payments provide for the median cost of market-rate housing. Some community officials said the tax-credit program, which spurs housing production, could be useful if more servicemembers qualified. But developers would have to compete for tax credits, and market factors--such as the financial feasibility of building units that junior enlisted members could afford--could limit their interest. The HUD and USDA programs might help some servicemembers rent existing units, but--because the programs are not entitlements--servicemembers could face lengthy waits, and eligible civilians might wait longer for assistance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As a result of base closings and realignments and other restationing  actions, some military installations will be experiencing growth in the next  several years, raising concerns about whether the nearby communities will  have an adequate supply of affordable housing for incoming military  personnel or whether communities can develop such housing. To help  make housing affordable to servicemembers, and in keeping with its policy  of relying on the private market as the primary source of housing for  servicemembers, the Department of Defense (DOD) pays a Basic  Allowance for Housing (BAH) to servicemembers stationed in the United  States who do not live in military housing. In fiscal year 2005, DOD made  about $11.6 billion in BAH payments to approximately 850,000 active-duty  servicemembers. DOD sets the housing allowance amounts annually to  cover the median cost of rent, including utilities and renter\u2019s insurance. The  housing allowance amounts vary according to the location and rank (pay  grade) of each servicemember, and also vary depending on whether the  servicemember has any dependents. Servicemembers may choose to spend  more or less than their allowance amounts on their actual housing  expenses.", "Although BAH is intended to allow servicemembers to acquire suitable  housing in the private market, some community leaders and housing  developers have argued that federal rental housing programs also offer the  potential to help provide affordable housing for servicemembers relocating  to growing installations. The federal programs include the Low-Income  Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and tax-exempt multifamily housing bond  programs, which are administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the states and support  development of rental housing. Other programs, including public housing  and programs that subsidize tenants\u2019 rents, are administered by the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the  Department of Agriculture (USDA). To be eligible to apply for these  programs, households must have incomes at or below a specific limit,  generally 50 percent or 60 percent of the median household income for  their area, adjusted for family size. (These programs are not entitlements,  however, and not all eligible households receive assistance.) To help  servicemembers meet these income eligibility restrictions, proponents of  using federal programs to address the military\u2019s housing needs have  proposed excluding BAH from servicemembers\u2019 incomes when  determining eligibility for the programs.", "Noting concerns about the availability of affordable private housing for  servicemembers, particularly in rural areas with growing installations, the  conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2006 Transportation,  Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of  Columbia, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act directed us to  report on the potential effect of excluding BAH from income when  determining eligibility for federal rental housing programs. Accordingly,  this report discusses (1) how excluding BAH from income determinations  would have affected the eligibility of servicemembers receiving BAH as of  December 2005 and (2) programmatic and market factors that could affect  eligible servicemembers\u2019 participation in the programs in selected  communities gaining military personnel.", "To address these objectives, we obtained DOD\u2019s personnel data for  December 2005 and analyzed 702,975 records of servicemembers who were  BAH recipients at that time to determine their potential eligibility for  federal rental housing programs. We included the following federal  programs: HUD\u2019s public housing, Housing Choice Voucher, and  project-based Section 8; USDA\u2019s Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Loans  and Section 521 Rural Rental Assistance; and IRS\u2019s LIHTC and tax-exempt  multifamily housing bonds. We compared potential eligibility for rental  housing programs by including and excluding BAH from income eligibility  determinations. Because data on spousal income and other sources of  income were unavailable, for this analysis we assumed that the primary  components of military pay were the only sources of income for the  servicemember households. We tested the data that we used in our analysis  and found it sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Furthermore, we  interviewed and reviewed relevant documentation from installation  officials, rental housing program officials, and community organization  representatives in the following four communities near installations  gaining military personnel: Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort  Drum, New York; and Fort Riley, Kansas. We cannot generalize the  information from these installations to all installations that will gain  military personnel. We conducted our work in and around Washington,  D.C., and Junction City and Manhattan, Kansas, between November 2005  and July 2006, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Regardless of whether they live in military-owned housing or receive BAH,  servicemembers receive basic pay and a Basic Allowance for Subsistence  (BAS). BAH and BAS are not subject to federal income tax. With the  addition of average BAH payments to the other two pay elements, regular  military compensation in 2006 starts at $26,401 for the lowest-ranking  enlisted servicemembers and culminates at $183,196 for the  highest-ranking officers, excluding consideration of any tax advantage  because the allowances are not subject to federal income tax (see fig. 1).", "In addition to the primary elements of military compensation shown in  figure 1, servicemembers with duty stations in more than 55 continental  U.S. locations, where nonhousing expenses exceed the national average by  at least 8 percent, receive a cost-of-living allowance. Servicemembers also  may receive other types of pay, allowances, or bonuses, depending on their  professional backgrounds, skills, or duties. For example, servicemembers  may receive special pay for hardship duty or exposure to hostile fire,  allowances when they are separated from their families because of a  change in station or a temporary duty assignment, and bonuses for  enlistment and reenlistment.", "According to DOD officials, in March 2006, about 950,000 personnel lived in  private housing (including privatized military family housing) and received  BAH\u2014including roughly 70 percent of active-duty servicemembers in the  United States, as well as some activated reservists and servicemembers  stationed overseas whose dependents lived in the United States. DOD  generally requires enlisted servicemembers in the lowest ranks who do not  have dependents to live on base in furnished living quarters, commonly  referred to as barracks. These enlisted servicemembers do not receive  BAH.", "Each year, DOD sets BAH rates (i.e., the allowances servicemembers  receive monthly) that are based on the median local monthly cost of  housing, including current market rents, utilities, and renter\u2019s insurance.  The amounts that servicemembers receive also are based on their pay  grades and whether they have dependents. To calculate BAH rates for  different pay grades, DOD uses six standard categories of  housing\u2014ranging from an one-bedroom apartment to a four-bedroom,  single-family detached house\u2014that are intended to match the housing  normally occupied by civilians with comparable incomes. DOD applies  separate categories to servicemembers with and without dependents, but  the number of dependents does not affect the BAH amount.", "BAH rates have increased since 2000 as DOD implemented an initiative to  reduce servicemembers\u2019 out-of-pocket housing costs. Prior to 2005, the  BAH rate for each area and pay grade was the local median monthly  housing cost minus a percentage of the national median monthly housing  cost. That deduction represented the amount that servicemembers would  have to pay out of pocket if their actual housing costs exactly matched the  median local housing cost for their pay grade. In 2000, the deduction was 19  percent of the national median housing cost. DOD gradually reduced the  deduction so that, by 2005, BAH rates equaled the median housing cost for  each area and pay grade. Furthermore, while the housing allowance is  calculated on the basis of the rental market, servicemembers may choose  to apply their allowance toward purchasing a home, and they are free to  spend more or less than their allowance on housing.", "We reported in April 2006 that the increases in BAH rates had made it  possible for more servicemembers to afford private housing in the local  market, thus reducing the need for privatized housing at installations. This  has recently contributed to lower-than-expected occupancy rates at some  privatized housing projects. If some privatized projects persistently  experience lower-than-expected occupancy rates, they could encounter  financial difficulties or, at worst, failures. To avoid such concerns in future  privatization projects, we recommended that DOD determine how  increased BAH rates would affect installations\u2019 housing requirements and  provide guidance on how the services should incorporate this information  into their assessments of the need for privatized family housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Than 100 Installations Will Gain Personnel through the 2005 BRAC Process", "paragraphs": ["The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 authorized a  new BRAC process in 2005.

In light of that  possibility, community officials near Fort Drum and Fort Riley stated that  excluding BAH could create opportunities to use the LIHTC program.  Specifically:  Community officials near Fort Drum indicated that some developers  were interested in building new rental housing but faced obstacles in  financing projects because of an estimated gap between current market  rents, which incoming junior enlisted personnel likely could afford, and  the higher rents that developers would need to charge to make new  apartments financially feasible without government subsidies. The  officials had been working with developers to seek financing assistance  through state programs, including New York\u2019s low-income housing tax  credit program, which serves households with incomes up to 90 percent  of AMI. However, because the state programs are relatively small, the  officials said that increasing servicemembers\u2019 eligibility for the larger  federal LIHTC program would provide more financing options for  developers.", "Community officials near Fort Riley noted that servicemembers make  up a substantial portion of the current and expected future rental  market in the area, particularly in the community of Junction City just  outside of the installation. They said that while some developers of  tax-credit projects have expressed interest in building more units in the  area, they would only do so if the pool of potential tenants included  more incoming servicemembers, because the demand for additional  tax-credit units among civilian families is limited.", "However, even if BAH were excluded from income when determining  eligibility and if developers proposed building tax-credit units,  LIHTC-funded development might be limited near growing installations  because the state agencies that award available tax credits have a variety of priorities. By law, each state must prepare an annual plan that identifies  its criteria for distributing its allocation of credits among proposed  developments. A state would have to weigh how a proposed property  would address the housing needs near growing installations against the  state\u2019s priorities and selection criteria. States must give preference to  projects serving the lowest-income tenants and projects that would serve  qualified tenants for the longest periods of time. The states\u2019 selection  criteria also must include other considerations, such as tenant populations  with special housing needs. For example, the priority housing needs in  Kansas\u2019s plan for allocating tax credits in 2006 include projects in  communities with populations of fewer than 5,000; preservation of housing  with Section 8 or Section 521 project-based rental assistance; projects for  special-needs populations, such as the homeless or people with disabilities;  and projects whose units would offer below-market-rate rents. Projects  addressing these priorities would receive extra points in the scoring  process used to evaluate proposals.", "Furthermore, officials in the four communities described market factors  that could influence whether developers would try to use the LIHTC  program to build housing near growing installations. In general,  developers would have limited incentive to compete for tax credits if  conditions for building market-rate housing were favorable, such as in  areas having a higher-income population. Generally, market-rate housing  allows developers to charge whatever rents the market will bear, without  other restrictions. In contrast, applicants for tax-credit financing must  agree to limit the rents charged for tax-credit units for at least 30 years and  must comply with other federal requirements for 15 years or risk losing the  right for investors to claim the tax credits. Thus, developers might be less  likely to propose new tax-credit units near a growing installation that  expected to receive more senior servicemembers with relatively high  incomes than near one that expected more junior members with relatively  low incomes. For example:  Aside from military students who would live on base, most of the  incoming military personnel at Fort Benning are associated with the  planned realignment of a training school with primarily senior-ranking  personnel. Community officials said that because these personnel likely  could afford to pay market rates for housing, they did not expect  developers to focus on providing new housing through the LIHTC  program.", "In contrast, on the basis of preliminary estimates from Fort Riley  officials, roughly 45 percent of the servicemembers that would  eventually be stationed there might be married members in pay grades  E-1 through E-6. As of early 2006, the communities near Fort Riley had  substantial market-rate development under way or in the planning  stages. However, community officials anticipated that enough additional  low-cost housing would be needed for servicemembers in these lowest  pay grades to justify building tax-credit units for them (assuming they  were to become eligible).", "In addition, developers might be more disposed to seek LIHTC financing in  areas where the cost to build new housing was high relative to the incomes  of junior enlisted members. For example:  Whereas officials in the Fort Benning area expected that developers  could build new market-rate housing within the price range that  incoming servicemembers could afford, officials in the rural Fort Drum  and Fort Riley areas stated that increasing construction, labor, and  infrastructure costs could make new market-rate units too expensive for  junior enlisted members or could make it difficult to secure financing  for market-rate units. For example, the cost of bringing materials and,  perhaps, workers into a rural area can contribute to relatively high  development costs.", "Near Fort Bliss, El Paso city officials said that the LIHTC program might  be an attractive financing alternative for developers if they could not  otherwise build housing that servicemembers with the lowest incomes  could afford. However, the officials did not yet know whether  developers might need subsidies. They planned to study the issue by  considering the expected incomes of servicemembers who would be  arriving at Fort Bliss, the supply and price of existing housing, and the  development costs and rents that would be charged for new market-rate  housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Waiting Time and Scarcity of Larger Units May Preclude Servicemembers from Renting Existing Units through HUD and USDA Programs", "paragraphs": ["Even if more servicemembers were to become eligible for HUD and USDA  rental housing assistance programs, waiting lists for units and the limited  availability of large units might limit servicemembers\u2019 participation in these  programs, according to officials from HUD, USDA, and the four selected  communities.", "Rather than financing new rental housing near growing installations, HUD\u2019s  Housing Choice Voucher, public housing, and project-based Section 8  programs and USDA\u2019s Section 515 and Section 521 programs primarily  would help servicemembers rent existing units if they obtained the  programs\u2019 assistance, typically by making up the difference between their  required contribution (generally 30 percent of adjusted monthly income)  and a unit\u2019s total rent. However, these programs are not entitlements, and  many of the HUD, USDA, and community officials said that the limited  number of units or limited supply of rental assistance may deter eligible  servicemembers from applying for these programs, especially in areas with  long lists of applicants already awaiting assistance. If they did join the  programs\u2019 waiting lists, servicemembers might find other private,  military-owned, or privatized housing; relocate to a different installation; or  become ineligible for the program because of a promotion before they rose  to the top of a list. In all four of the communities we reviewed, the Housing  Choice Voucher and public housing programs had waiting lists, with times  ranging from a few months to 2 years, according to officials from HUD field offices and the housing authorities that maintain the lists. For example, in  Columbus, Georgia, near Fort Benning, the waiting list for vouchers was  long enough that it was closed as of March 2006 and was not expected to  open to new applicants until 2008.", "In addition, servicemembers with large families may face obstacles to using  rental assistance programs because of the limited availability of units with  three or more bedrooms, according to some HUD, USDA, housing  authority, and installation officials. In the four communities, properties  with project-based Section 8 assistance and public housing developments  offered relatively few units with three or more bedrooms, thereby limiting  the options for families of five or more persons. For instance, in the Fort  Drum area, of 690 project-based Section 8 and public housing units  intended for families, 172 had three bedrooms and 43 had four bedrooms;  the remaining 475 had fewer than three bedrooms. Similarly, although  voucher recipients can seek housing in the broader private rental market,  some of the HUD field office officials noted that larger families could have  a hard time finding a sufficiently sized apartment or house that would meet  the program\u2019s quality and cost standards.", "If servicemembers did join the programs\u2019 waiting lists, HUD headquarters  and field office officials noted that housing authorities could adopt  preferences that would reduce servicemembers\u2019 wait for vouchers or  public housing, but some officials said that such a step could be  controversial. The housing authorities that administer vouchers and public  housing developments may establish local preferences for selecting  families from waiting lists, on the basis of local housing needs and  priorities. However, HUD and housing authority officials said that such  preferences\u2014for example, for victims of domestic violence or a single  homeless person\u2014have sometimes met opposition from those who would  face longer waits because they did not qualify for these preferences.", "Similarly, some HUD officials said that increasing servicemembers\u2019  eligibility for the programs or giving them preference on waiting lists could  create tensions with lower-income civilians who might have to face even  longer waiting periods for rental assistance as a result. On the basis of the  2006 pay rates for the primary elements of military compensation,  servicemembers in all pay grades would have substantially more income  than most existing Housing Choice Voucher recipients, even without their  BAH payments (see fig. 6). In light of that difference in incomes, some of  the officials also cited potential concerns about balancing any advantages  for servicemembers with the programs\u2019 current emphasis on targeting  assistance to households with extremely low incomes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As some military installations gain servicemembers, nearby communities  face opportunities for growth as well as potential challenges in providing  an adequate supply of housing that incoming servicemembers can afford.  Many of these incoming personnel may not have problems finding housing  they can afford\u2014for example, junior enlisted members without dependents  generally live in barracks; DOD has the ability to raise BAH rates for other  servicemembers to reflect any increases in housing costs near the growing  installations; and many servicemembers may have additional resources,  such as spousal income, that they can put toward housing costs. Where  communities lack enough housing for incoming personnel or where rents  are expensive for married junior personnel, federal rental housing  programs might help provide affordable housing for servicemembers  through the production of additional housing or through rental assistance  for existing housing. By excluding BAH from servicemembers\u2019 incomes  when determining eligibility, many of the lowest-ranking servicemembers  could qualify to apply for these programs.", "However, the effects of such a change are uncertain and could involve  trade-offs that warrant attention. For example, the LIHTC program (or,  similarly, tax-exempt multifamily housing bonds) could help increase the  supply of affordable rental housing for incoming servicemembers, if more  of the members were eligible to live in tax-credit units. However, even if  more servicemembers were eligible, the extent to which the LIHTC  program would play a role in increasing the supply of affordable housing  near growing installations would depend on local housing market  conditions, the income distribution of incoming servicemembers, and the  decisions of state agencies regarding whether to allocate tax credits to  projects near growing installations or to projects that might address other  state housing priorities. Furthermore, the rental assistance programs are  not entitlements and already do not assist all eligible households. While  some servicemembers might be deterred by the prospect of a lengthy wait  from applying for HUD and USDA rental assistance for existing units, those  who did apply would expand the pool of those waiting for a limited supply  of available assistance. Thus, making more servicemembers eligible by  excluding BAH from income determinations could cause these programs to  serve more servicemembers at the expense of eligible civilians."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["If the primary intent of excluding BAH from income determinations for  federal rental housing programs is to help increase the supply of rental  housing that servicemembers with the lowest incomes could afford,  Congress should consider first applying such a change only to programs  intended to stimulate production of such housing, such as LIHTC and  tax-exempt multifamily housing bonds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, HUD, IRS, Treasury, and USDA  for their review and comment.

However, DOD also noted that  servicemembers may have difficulty finding adequate housing if there are  substantial changes in the supply of or demand for housing in a local area,  at least until the private market has had time to adjust to the changing  conditions. DOD also observed that servicemembers with large families,  who seek larger housing than an average size family, may have difficulty  finding adequate housing using their BAH payments alone and may apply  for federal rental housing programs. However, DOD also stated that  servicemembers should be eligible for federal housing subsidies under the  same terms as their civilian counterparts. Furthermore, DOD commented  that excluding BAH from income determinations might transfer existing  scarce resources from low-income civilians to the military and generate  ill-will among civilians toward the military. Finally, DOD stated that, while  our draft report showed that excluding BAH from income determinations  might not have the desired effect of increasing the supply of rental housing  for servicemembers, there might be other ways in which the government  could assist the private market in responding to housing shortgages. Our  draft report discussed the particular difficulties of large families\u2014even  those receiving rental assistance\u2014in finding suitable housing.

We obtained personnel and pay data from the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Active Duty Personnel Master and Active  Duty Pay files for December 2005. We analyzed data on 702,975 active-duty  servicemembers who received BAH payments that month. We calculated  servicemembers\u2019 annual incomes on the basis of their December 2005  payments for basic pay; BAH; Basic Allowance for Subsistence; and, where  applicable, a cost-of-living adjustment for servicemembers in certain high- cost areas. We assumed that these elements of military pay were  servicemembers\u2019 sole sources of household income because data on other  income sources, such as spousal income, were unavailable. However, we  analyzed how other sources of income might have reduced  servicemembers\u2019 eligibility by calculating the median additional annual  income needed before married servicemembers\u2019 families would have  exceeded the income eligibility limit.", "To assess the reliability of the data used in our analysis, we interviewed  DOD officials who were familiar with the data, reviewed relevant  documentation, and tested the data for missing and apparently erroneous  values. DOD provided data on 708,548 active-duty members of the  Departments of the Army, Navy and Air Force and the Marine Corps. On the  basis of our tests of these data, we excluded 5,573 (about 0.8 percent)  records because we could not match the servicemembers\u2019 zip codes to the  geographic areas for which income limits were defined, because data on  family size were missing, or because anomalies in the monthly pay data  prevented us from calculating an annual income amount. As a result, our  servicemember population was 702,975 for this analysis. We concluded that  these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Nonetheless, our  analysis was limited because it provided a snapshot of servicemembers\u2019  potential eligibility to apply for the programs on the basis of their incomes  in December 2005. We could not predict the effects of a future change in  income determinations, because potential changes in servicemembers\u2019  incomes or duty locations and annual adjustments to programs\u2019 income  limits would also affect eligibility.", "To determine the programmatic and market factors that could affect  eligible servicemembers\u2019 participation in the programs in selected  communities gaining military personnel, we interviewed and reviewed  relevant documentation from military installation officials; rental housing  program officials (including officials from HUD and USDA field offices,  public housing authorities, and state housing finance agencies); and local  government or community organization representatives in four  communities near installations that will gain military personnel as a result  of the 2005 base realignment and closure (BRAC) process or other military  initiatives.
