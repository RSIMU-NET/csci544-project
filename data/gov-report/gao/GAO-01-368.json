To be successful in moving hard-to-employ Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients into the workforce within their 60-month time limit for federal benefits, states must develop programs and provide work and work-preparation activities tailored to the needs of their hard-to-employ recipients and they must ensure that recipients with characteristics that impede employment have access to programs and activities that meet their needs. Some states believe that they would be better able to accomplish this if they (1) had caseload data on the number and characteristics of hard-to-employ TANF recipients, particularly those who will reach their 60-month limit before they are able to work and (2) used a range of work and work-preparation activities that meet the needs of hard-to-employ recipients, including activities that extend beyond those that meet federal work participation requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity  Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), the Congress eliminated the legal  entitlement to cash welfare assistance and replaced it with Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grants to states. TANF  emphasizes work and responsibility over dependence on government  benefits. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) oversees  the TANF block grant program, which provides grants to states totaling up  to $16.5 billion per year through 2002 and requires states to maintain a  historical level of state spending on welfare-related programs. While the  welfare reform legislation specified some rules for states' receipt of federal  funds, states have the discretion to design their programs to meet their  goals.", "Caseloads have fallen dramatically since the passage of the welfare reform  legislation, from 4.4 million families in August 1996 to 2.2 million families in  June 2000. To avoid financial penalties, states must continue to ensure that  increasing proportions of their TANF caseloads are employed or involved  in other work activities. The 60-month limit on receipt of federally funded  TANF benefits heightens the urgency with which states must move  recipients into the workforce\u2014including those who might need extra  assistance to get and keep a job. This group is often referred to as hard-to- employ recipients.", "In light of the impending reauthorization of TANF in 2002, the Congress has  expressed an interest in better understanding the factors that make some  TANF recipients hard-to-employ, and the challenges states face in helping  them find and keep jobs. This report provides information on (1) the  participation of TANF recipients in work and work activities, the  characteristics of TANF recipients, and how those characteristics have  changed over time; (2) the strategies states are using to help hard-to- employ TANF recipients get and keep jobs; and (3) the challenges states  face in planning and implementing strategies for hard-to-employ recipients.", "To provide information on the participation of TANF recipients in work and  work activities and their characteristics, we drew on several sources of  data. These included two national surveys, the Census Bureau\u2019s Current  Population Survey (CPS) and the Urban Institute's National Survey of  America\u2019s Families (NSAF); HHS\u2019 compilation of TANF administrative data  from states; and 15 studies that were not national in scope.

Although the information we present concerning  these states is not intended to be representative of all TANF programs,  these states were selected because together they employ a range of  approaches to implementing the TANF program, including strategies for  the hard-to-employ, and have experienced various levels of caseload  decline. They include states with both county- and state-administered  TANF programs, states that began welfare reform under waivers prior to  enactment of PRWORA, and those that instituted reform after the law went  into effect. Finally, we included states in different regions of the country,  and with a range of population sizes.", "To obtain information on the strategies states are using to move their hard- to-employ recipients into the workforce and the challenges they face in  doing so, we conducted site visits in six of the nine states from which we  collected administrative data\u2014California, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland,  Michigan, and Washington. In each state, we interviewed state and local  TANF administrators and others involved in delivering services to TANF  recipients, and visited two or more local TANF agencies.

Under  TANF there are strong work requirements for recipients and there is a limit  on the number of months (60) that families can receive federally funded  TANF benefits.", "The number of families receiving cash assistance has declined dramatically  in recent years. More than 5 million families received cash assistance in  1994 but, as the economy improved and TANF work enforcement gathered  steam, fewer families received assistance. Caseloads have fallen  dramatically since the act went into effect, from 4.4 million families in  August 1996 to 2.2 million families in June 2000. Caseload declines slowed  toward the end of 1999 and in a few states rose slightly, but the most recent  data available from HHS indicate that, nationally, caseloads continue to  decline.", "Although there are no supporting data, many assume that as caseloads  have fallen the composition of the caseload has changed. Specifically, some  have speculated that those TANF recipients who could easily find and keep  jobs have left the rolls, and hard-to-employ recipients\u2014those with  characteristics that interfere with employment\u2014comprise an increasing  share of the remaining cash assistance recipients.

Adults are  required to participate in work activities within 2 years after they start  receiving assistance under the block grant. If recipients do not comply with  the work activity requirement, states must impose sanctions that reduce  cash assistance, and may opt to terminate the grant entirely.", "PRWORA allows states to exempt some TANF recipients from the work  activity requirement while still receiving benefits. States may exempt  parents with children under age 1 from work requirements, and may  disregard them in calculating participation rates. States may not penalize  parents with children under 6 for not working if child care is not available.  Recipients who are exempted by the state from work requirements are still  subject to the federal 60-month limit on receipt of benefits and may be  included in a 20-percent hardship exemption from the time limits.", "All states allow recipients to meet their work activity requirement through  paid employment. Many states have an earned income disregard that  allows recipients to earn some amount without losing cash assistance, and  many states raised the amount of this disregard after implementation of  TANF to give TANF recipients additional incentives to work. In states with  a higher earnings disregard, more employed persons may still be receiving  TANF benefits\u2014and thus remain part of the caseload\u2014than in states with  lower earnings disregards, where working recipients with lower earnings  levels are removed from the rolls.", "To avoid financial penalties, states must ensure that at least a specified  minimum percentage of adult recipients are participating in work or work- related activities each year that count for federal participation rate  purposes. These types of activities are not necessarily identical to the  activities the state allows recipients to engage in to maintain eligibility for  benefits. As specified in PRWORA, work activities that count for federal  participation rate purposes include employment (subsidized or  unsubsidized), work experience programs, on-the-job training and  community service. Providing child care for TANF recipients engaged in  work or work-preparation activities also counts for federal participation  rate purposes. Job search is considered a work activity for a recipient for  up to 6 weeks (or 12 weeks in high-unemployment areas), as are certain  types of education and training that are directly related to employment and  attendance at secondary school or in a course of study leading to a  certificate of general equivalence in the case of a recipient who has not  completed secondary school or received such a certificate.

The law also allows states to exempt families  with adult TANF recipients from the 60-month limit on federal assistance  based on hardship or if the family includes a victim of domestic violence. If  a state determines that a family meets one of these criteria, it can opt to  continue the family\u2019s federally funded cash assistance beyond 60 months.

States also have the flexibility to set a wide range  of program rules such as eligibility criteria, earned income disregard  amounts, and benefit levels. Most programmatic decisions are also left to  states. For example, states can choose to administer the TANF program  themselves or devolve responsibility for many of the program management  decisions to county or local TANF offices. States can deliver employment- related services to TANF recipients through their workforce development  or employment service agencies or through their TANF agencies.", "With few restrictions, states can also determine the typical pathway for  most new applicants. For example, in designing their TANF programs,  states have the flexibility to determine whether new applicants initially will  be referred to education, training, and work-preparation activities, or  whether they first will be encouraged to enter the workforce as quickly as  possible. Many states have chosen the latter approach, often referred to as  Work First, in part because of the emphasis PRWORA places on work.  Under a Work First approach, recipients are encouraged to find jobs as  quickly as possible and most recipients are placed in job search\u2014an  activity that involves looking for a job\u2014rather than in education or other  work preparation activities. Only recipients who fail to find jobs, or who  find jobs only to lose them immediately, are referred to education, training,  or other types of activities.", "States also have a great deal of flexibility in determining exactly what types  of education, training, or other work-preparation activities as well as what  types of support services they provide with their TANF funds.

HHS is also  responsible for conducting research on the benefits and effects of the  TANF program, and receives funding for welfare reform and social services  research and evaluation studies.

The small amount of data available to compare TANF  caseloads over time does not show statistically significant changes in the  characteristics of welfare recipients since welfare reform; however, these  data do not include measures of many of the characteristics that impede  employment. Officials in the states we visited reported that while caseloads  fell rapidly between 1995 and 1999, the declines slowed between 1999 and  2000; they attributed this slowing to the changing composition of the  caseload. They reported that new recipients who are the most job-ready  leave the welfare rolls relatively quickly, leaving behind recipients who  have greater difficulty obtaining and retaining jobs.

The state measured changes between August 1997 and  February 2000 in the percentages of recipients who had each of four  characteristics it found to limit a recipient's employment: less than a high  school education, limited English-speaking ability, a young child, and no  recent work experience. While Washington found that the percentage of  the caseload with the first three of these characteristics increased slightly  over this period, the proportion of the caseload with no recent work  experience and with two or more of these characteristics decreased.

Only recipients who are unsuccessful in finding a job  within a certain time period are reassessed and either exempted or referred  to targeted services and programs to address work-impeding  characteristics. Other states, including Connecticut and Maryland, reported  that they screen and assess all new applicants.

According to  officials in these states, this approach has two distinct advantages: first, by  allowing recipients to test the job market, the state does not prejudge or  label recipients as hard-to-employ when they may, in fact, be able to obtain  jobs; and second, this strategy sends a clear message that TANF is  temporary and that employment is the immediate goal.", "The states and localities we visited that use the job market to identify hard- to-employ recipients do some very limited up-front screening to identify  recipients who clearly meet the exemption criteria, but send most new  applicants directly to job search after they apply for TANF assistance. Case  managers in Michigan, for example, ask a few questions during the  application process to identify recipients who are clearly exempt from  work requirements, such as those who are victims of domestic violence,  but do not use a standardized questionnaire to screen new applicants.  Recipients are not further assessed or referred to job preparation activities  other than job search unless they fail to find a job within 30 days.

Strategies  ranged from conducting an in-depth assessment of every new applicant to  developing a series of increasingly detailed assessments for recipients who  cannot find employment quickly. Some of these programs are described  below:  Each local TANF agency in Maryland has developed an assessment  instrument to identify hard-to-employ recipients soon after they apply  for benefits.

Some examples follow:  Washington has implemented a statewide case management process  called case staffing. Case staffing consists of holding periodic meetings  that involve every member of the staff who has any interaction with a  recipient, including representatives from contractors and other agencies  that provide services to TANF recipients. Staff members consider each  recipient's history, current activities, and employment plan, and whether  past activities have yielded desired results.

The state also provides intensive  case management to recipients who are at risk of having a sanction  imposed for not complying with program rules, or who have reached  their lifetime limit on the TANF program. Intensive case management  services can include employee assistance programs for employers of  TANF recipients.", "In Grand Rapids, Michigan, the local TANF agency has stationed two  case managers at a large company that employs TANF recipients to help  hard-to-employ recipients retain their jobs. These on-site case managers  serve as a resource for both employees and the employer, helping  employees cope with crises that might otherwise cause them to lose  their jobs, and intervening on behalf of the employer at the first sign of  trouble. The company's retention rate for current and former TANF  recipients was 81 percent, as compared to only 33 percent for their non- TANF employees.

Officials and  advocates for welfare recipients in Maryland told us that case managers,  who for years served primarily as eligibility specialists, have had difficulty  changing their focus to employment preparation and planning. This is  especially true for those who continue to have responsibility for  determining eligibility for food stamps and other means-tested programs.  The difficulties case managers have encountered in learning new  responsibilities have been exacerbated in areas where caseload reductions  have been accompanied by disproportionate reductions in staff.

Officials in every state we visited told us  that a recipient with low educational attainment can often obtain an  unskilled job, particularly in a strong economy, but if she lacks the skills  required to deal with situations such as a chronic health problem, a child  with behavior problems, or a breakdown in child care or transportation  arrangements, she is likely to miss work and lose the job. Similarly, one  official stated that a recipient may have the skills and abilities needed to  function in a particular job, but if she does not know how to dress  appropriately, conduct herself in an interview, or fill out a job application  properly, she will not be able to get that job. In the six states we visited we  encountered several examples of programs designed to provide recipients  with the life skills needed to be successful in the workforce, often referred  to as soft-skills training:  In Baltimore County, Maryland, a private firm called Workforce  Solutions is under contract to run a 12-week program for TANF  recipients designed to address specific characteristics that may impede  employment\u2014such as low basic reading and math skills\u2014while also  providing participants with ways to cope with personality issues such as  antisocial behavior and inappropriate responses to authority.", "In Broward County, Florida, a soft-skills program for long-term TANF  recipients uses role-playing, simulated work activities, team-building  exercises, and other techniques to help recipients change their attitude  and feelings about work. The program focuses on helping recipients  develop positive attitudes, coping skills, critical thinking, workplace  ethics, and confidence.", "In Butte County, California, the TANF agency has coordinated with a  nonprofit organization that manages a boutique that provides  makeovers and professional clothing for interviewing and working.

Intensive, highly supervised, hands-on work experience  allows recipients to experience a workplace environment first hand.  However, most localities we visited rarely, if ever, referred recipients to  these types of programs, in part because they felt that such programs were  unnecessary in a strong economy with ample job opportunities. While a  few of the work experience programs in the states we visited were very  specialized and targeted to certain subgroups of hard-to-employ recipients  such as immigrants with limited English skills, most served a broader range  of hard-to-employ recipients. TANF worksite activities differ in who is  required to participate and in how much the activities mirror unsubsidized  employment. Some examples of work experience programs follow:  Community Rehabilitation Industries offers a targeted work-experience  program to refugees in Los Angeles, California. The program is designed  to provide hands-on experience at a manufacturing business and a range  of supplemental services, including English as a Second Language (ESL)  classes, sobriety support, parenting skills instruction, and basic skills  remediation. These programs are provided at the work-site and  participants are paid to attend.", "Washington has a statewide internship and training program, called  Community Jobs (CJ), that provides hard-to-employ recipients who  have various work-impeding characteristics with 20 hours of paid work  experience per week for up to 9 months. The program provides  intensive case management to help participants cope with the demands  of their work experience positions. The program also requires  participants to enroll in a complementary work activity, such as basic  education or substance abuse or mental health treatment, for an  additional 20 hours per week.

Most states relied primarily on non-TANF government agencies and other  community organizations with expertise and experience in providing  services to address these problems rather than developing new programs  specifically for TANF recipients. States used TANF as well as a variety of  other funding sources to pay for these services, including funding from  other federal, state, and private programs. Some examples include the  following:  Domestic violence: The policy in every state we visited is to refer  victims of domestic violence to emergency housing and other services,  including counseling and legal assistance, although in some locations  officials reported that the availability of such services was limited. In  most cases, these services are provided by nonprofit organizations,  public health agencies, and privately funded legal assistance programs.", "Low educational attainment/limited English proficiency: All of the states  we visited had policies to refer recipients to adult basic education, ESL  courses, and high school equivalency programs offered by local school  districts, community adult education programs, colleges and  universities, or nonprofit organizations.", "Poor health/disability: Most of the states we visited had policies to refer  recipients with physical or mental impairments that might make them  eligible for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, for  assistance in applying for SSI benefits.

Few states  compile and analyze data on those characteristics that make recipients  hard to employ, making it difficult for them to estimate the number of  recipients likely to reach their 60-month limit on federal benefits, and to  develop strategies to help them become employed before their federally  funded benefits run out. In addition, as a group, hard-to-employ recipients  may need more time to be integrated into the workforce; time limits shorter  than 60 months may decrease the likelihood that they will acquire the skills  they need for work before their assistance ends. Finally, some states tend  to place recipients only in work and work-preparation activities that count  when calculating federal work participation rates.

Although ACF has  annually sponsored conferences on evaluating welfare reform since 1998,  at the time of our site visits, none of the six states we visited had sufficient  data to allow them to identify the share of their caseload that is hard-to- employ. Of the nine states we asked for data on the number of adult TANF  recipients with learning disabilities, substance abuse issues, exposure to  domestic violence, other mental or psychological conditions, limited  English proficiency, physical impairment, poor physical health,  developmental disabilities, and criminal history\u2014characteristics that  impede employment\u2014only two provided statewide data on some of these  characteristics. Most states reported that these data were not available.", "States could not provide these data, in part, because they are not required  to collect them, and because identification of such characteristics is  inherently difficult. In addition, widely accepted screening and assessment  tools that can be used to determine the presence of those characteristics  are lacking. State officials also indicated that they lack the computer  systems necessary to aggregate and analyze such data for managing their  caseloads as a whole.", "PRWORA requires states to collect and report specific caseload  information such as marital status, citizenship, and ages of family members  to HHS on a quarterly basis, but states also have the flexibility to collect  any additional data they deem necessary to manage their TANF programs.  Only two of the states we visited\u2014Connecticut and Washington\u2014had  begun to use this flexibility to systematically collect statewide data that  would enable them to identify recipients with characteristics that make  them hard-to-employ. As we noted earlier, Washington and Connecticut  each developed a standardized screening instrument to identify applicants  with characteristics\u2014such as low literacy, limited English proficiency, and  learning disabilities, as well as mental health, substance abuse, domestic  violence, and physical health problems\u2014that may interfere with  employment. However, they have been collecting these data only since July  and August 2000, respectively.  Other states do some screening of  applicants, but screening tools may vary by locality within the states, as in  California, Florida, and Maryland; or may consist of just a few basic  questions on the TANF application, as in Michigan. Even where states  identified hard-to-employ recipients, they did not necessarily have this  information in databases that allowed states and localities to use it to  manage their caseloads.", "Some of the reasons states gave for not identifying applicants with  characteristics that could interfere with employment included the lack of  widely accepted screening and assessment tools, difficulties in eliciting  information from recipients, and a lack of skills among case managers in  conducting screenings and assessments. The few states and localities that  had questionnaires available to screen all new applicants, including  Washington, Connecticut, and counties in Maryland and California, had  developed the screening tools themselves, in part because they were  unable to identify existing screening tools. Even among those states and  localities that used screening and assessment tools, however, case  managers faced a myriad of obstacles in identifying recipients who have  characteristics that impede employment. For example, state and local  officials reported that recipients are sometimes reluctant to reveal certain  characteristics, such as substance abuse or domestic violence, because  they fear losing custody of their children or triggering reprisals from the  abuser. Cultural issues and privacy concerns can also prevent recipients  from sharing information with case managers. Also, some recipients may  be unaware that they have specific problems or may be in denial regarding  the problems. Furthermore, some case managers may hesitate to ask about  recipients' physical limitations for fear of violating the Americans with  Disabilities Act. Case managers may also have concerns about privacy  and confidentiality and about the impact of labeling recipients as hard-to- employ before they have had a chance to prove themselves as job-ready.", "Such difficulties are especially challenging for case managers not trained in  screening and assessing TANF recipients. Few of the states we visited  provided training to case managers in how to use screening tools or  identify recipients who have characteristics that could impede  employment.", "HHS and other federal agencies have initiatives under way to either  develop tools or evaluate available screening and assessment tools. ACF at  HHS contracted with the Urban Institute to conduct a study of existing  screening and assessment tools. The final report for this study is scheduled  to be completed in 2001, but a preliminary report confirms that there are  few existing screening tools for TANF programs to draw upon. HHS is also  collaborating with the Departments of Labor and Education to develop a  publication on screening tools to identify persons with disabilities. HHS  also funded publication of guides, published in July 2000, on screening  TANF recipients for mental illness and substance abuse. However, HHS  has done little so far to encourage state efforts to compile data that identify  hard-to-employ recipients, or can be used to estimate the number of TANF  recipients who will reach their 60-month limit before joining the workforce.", "Officials in the states we visited reported that states and localities not only  lack data but also lack computer systems sophisticated enough to process  statewide data on caseload characteristics. These findings are consistent  with our recent study on TANF information systems, which reported that  10 of 15 localities surveyed indicated that their automated systems provide  about half or less of the information needed for case management. Eight  of 15 states and only 6 of 15 localities reported that their systems provided  all or most of the data needed for service planning.", "The lack of comprehensive caseload data and adequate computer systems  has made it difficult for states to make plans for recipients likely to reach  their time limits. Not all of the states we visited have conducted analyses to  determine how many would likely reach their time limits, the  characteristics of those most likely to reach their time limits, or the impact  of various strategies to deal with those who have reached their time limits.  HHS is doing little to encourage states to collect and analyze data on the  characteristics of TANF recipients likely to reach their time limits.  PRWORA provides states with several strategies to deal with recipients  who reach their time limits. States are able to exempt recipients from the  60-month limit on federal assistance in cases that involve hardship or  domestic violence. It is up to each state to define hardship, and states can  extend this exemption to no more than 20 percent of their TANF caseload.  All the states we visited plan to exercise this option, but none had decided  what criteria (other than domestic violence) they would use to determine  who would qualify for this exemption.", "However, based on their analysis of statewide data, both Washington and  Maryland have concluded that, at some point, this exemption will not allow  them to extend benefits to all qualified recipients who reach their 60-month  limit. This is because, as the caseload continues to fall, the number the  state can provide with extended benefits (20 percent of the caseload) will  also fall. Meanwhile, each month more recipients will reach their time  limits. Analyses conducted in Washington and Maryland indicate that, at  some point, even families facing severe hardship will have their federal  benefits terminated because they cannot be served under the current 20- percent hardship exemption policy. Officials in all of the states we visited  told us that they had not yet estimated the cost of other strategies, such as  continuing benefits to all recipients who reach their time limits using state  funds, or providing federal assistance to such families through subsidized  employment programs.", "Inadequate data management information systems have also made it  difficult for states to develop mechanisms for holding local public and  private service providers accountable for delivering needed services to  hard-to-employ recipients. Advocates for welfare recipients in five of the  states we visited noted that hard-to-employ recipients with similar  characteristics could receive vastly different services depending on their  case manager, local TANF office, or program provider. Advocates in  Maryland and Florida reported that recipients in some localities have  access to a wide range of programs and services tailored to meet their  needs, whereas such specialized programs are not provided in other  localities. For example, Baltimore County, Maryland, contracts with a  number of service providers to deliver specialized work preparation  programs, while recipients in the city of Baltimore have little access to  such programs.
