GAO reviewed DOD documents, policies, and studies, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OSD, the Joint Staff, and the military services have undertaken efforts to reduce mobility energy demand in weapons platforms and other mobile defense systems. For example, OSD created a departmentwide Energy Security Task Force in 2006 that is monitoring the progress of selected energy related research and development projects. The Joint Staff updated its policy governing the development of capability requirements for new weapons systems to selectively consider energy efficiency as a key performance parameter--a characteristic of a system that is considered critical to the development of an effective military capability. The Army is addressing fuel consumption at forward-deployed locations by developing foam-insulated tents and temporary dome structures that are more efficient to heat and cool, reducing the demand for fuel-powered generators. The Navy has established an energy conservation program to encourage ships to reduce energy consumption. The Air Force has developed an energy strategy and undertaken initiatives to determine fuel-efficient flight routes, reduce the weight on aircraft, optimize air refueling, and improve the efficiency of ground operations. The Marine Corps has initiated research and development efforts to develop alternative power sources and improve fuel management. While these and other efforts are under way and DOD has identified energy as one of its transformational priorities, DOD lacks elements of an overarching organizational framework to guide and oversee mobility energy reduction efforts. In the absence of an overarching organizational framework for mobility energy, DOD cannot be assured that its current efforts will be fully implemented and will significantly reduce its reliance on petroleum-based fuel. GAO found that DOD's current approach to mobility energy lacks (1) a single executive-level OSD official who is accountable for mobility energy matters; sets the direction, pace, and tone to reduce mobility energy demand across DOD; and can serve as a mobility energy focal point within the department and with Congress and interagency partners; (2) a comprehensive strategic plan for mobility energy that aligns individual efforts with DOD-wide goals and priorities, establishes time frames for implementation, and uses performance metrics to evaluate progress; and (3) an effective mechanism to provide for communication and coordination of mobility energy efforts among OSD and the military services as well as leadership and accountability over each military service's efforts. GAO also found that DOD has made limited progress in incorporating fuel efficiency as a consideration in its key business processes--which include developing requirements for and acquiring new weapons systems. DOD has established new organizational frameworks to address other crosscutting issues, such as business systems modernization and corrosion control and prevention. Establishing an overarching organizational framework for mobility energy could provide greater assurance that DOD's efforts to reduce its reliance on petroleum-based fuel will succeed and that DOD is better positioned to address future mobility energy challenges--both within the department and as a stakeholder in national energy security dialogues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is the nation\u2019s single largest consumer  of energy and relies heavily on petroleum-based fuel for mobility energy\u2014 that is, the energy required for moving and sustaining its forces and  weapons platforms for military operations. U.S. military forces, for  example, require vast quantities of fuel to operate combat and support  vehicles; generate power at forward-deployed locations; and move troops,  equipment, and supplies. In 2007, more than 55 million gallons of fuel, on  average, were supplied by DOD each month to support the U.S. forces in  Iraq and Afghanistan. Mobility energy accounts for about three-fourths of  DOD\u2019s total energy consumption. DOD incurs billions of dollars each year  in fuel costs, and these costs have been rising in recent years as oil prices  have increased. Moreover, high fuel requirements on the battlefield can  place a significant logistics burden on military forces; limit the range and  pace of operations; and add to mission risks, including exposing convoys  to attack.", "This report responds to a request by the Subcommittee on Readiness,  House Committee on Armed Services, that we assess DOD\u2019s efforts to  reduce its reliance on petroleum-based fuel.

To identify key departmental  and military service efforts to reduce mobility energy demand, we  reviewed documentation on the objectives and status of ongoing  initiatives. In assessing the extent to which DOD has established an  overarching organizational framework for mobility energy, we analyzed  DOD and military service policies and other documents and reviewed  relevant DOD-sponsored studies. We also discussed mobility energy issues  with agency officials to gain their perspectives. We conducted our review  from September 2007 through March 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Details on our scope and  methodology are contained in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Energy, and specifically petroleum-based fuel, will be a key issue facing  the nation during the 21st century. The United States accounts for only 5  percent of the world\u2019s population but about 25 percent of the world\u2019s oil  demand. The Department of Energy projects that worldwide oil demand  will continue to grow, reaching 118 million barrels per day in 2030, up  from 84 million barrels per day in 2005. Although countries such as China  and India will generate much of this increased demand, the United States  will remain the world\u2019s largest oil consumer. World oil production has  been running at near capacity in recent years to meet rising consumption,  putting upward pressure on oil prices. The potential for disruptions in key  oil-producing regions of the world, such as the Middle East, and the yearly  threat of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have also exerted upward  pressure on oil prices. Crude oil prices almost tripled from 2003 through  the beginning of 2008, rising from $36 a barrel to as high as $100 a barrel.", "In 2007, about 67 percent of the oil consumed in the United States was  imported, and the increased energy dependence on other countries raises  concern about international turmoil in the Middle East and elsewhere. In  addition, worldwide supplies of oil from conventional sources remain  uncertain. U.S. oil production peaked around 1970, and worldwide  production could peak and begin to decline, although there is great  uncertainty about when this might happen. Moreover, there are  differences of opinion as to how long the nation can rely on petroleum- based fuel to meet the majority of its energy needs. As a result, we have  previously reported that, in addition to expanding production, the United  States may need to place more emphasis on demand reduction strategies  as well as developing alternative or renewable energy supplies and  technologies.", "DOD is the single largest energy consumer in the United States, and it  consumes about 90 percent of the petroleum-based fuel used by the U.S.  government. Jet fuel constitutes more than half of DOD\u2019s total energy  consumption. Other types of petroleum-based fuels used by DOD include  marine and auto diesel. According to the Department of Defense Annual  Energy Management Report for fiscal year 2006, DOD consumed  approximately 4.6 billion gallons of mobility fuels in fiscal year 2006, down  from 5.17 billion gallons in fiscal year 2005. However, spending on mobility  fuels increased 26.5 percent, from $7.95 billion in fiscal year 2005 to     $10.06 billion in fiscal year 2006. DOD attributed this cost increase to the  rise in fuel prices. For example, the price of jet fuel increased from $1.70  per gallon in fiscal year 2005 to $2.34 per gallon in fiscal year 2006.  Congress, in fiscal year 2006, provided DOD more than $2 billion in  supplemental funds to cover increased fuel costs. In fiscal year 2007, DOD  reported that the department consumed almost 4.8 billion gallons of  mobility fuel and spent $9.5 billion. Although fuel costs represent less than  3 percent of the total DOD budget, they have a significant impact on the  department\u2019s operating costs. DOD has estimated that for every $10  increase in the price of a barrel of oil, DOD\u2019s operating costs increase by  approximately $1.3 billion.", "Fuel presents an enormous logistical burden for DOD when planning and  conducting military combat operations. For current operations, the fuel  logistics infrastructure requires, among other things, long truck convoys  that move fuel to forward-deployed locations while exposed to the  vulnerabilities of operations, such as enemy attacks (see figs. 1 and 2).  Army officials have estimated that about 70 percent of the tonnage  required to position its forces for battle consists of fuel and water. An  armored division can use 600,000 gallons of fuel a day, and an air assault  division can use 300,000 gallons a day. In addition, combat support units  consume more than half of the fuel the Army uses on the battlefield.  Aircraft also burn through fuel at rapid rates; a B-52H, for example, burns  approximately 3,500 gallons per flight hour. Of the four military services,  the Air Force consumes the greatest amount of petroleum-based fuels.", "DOD has existing policies and organizational responsibilities for managing  energy commodities, including petroleum, natural gas, coal, and  electricity, to support peacetime and wartime missions and to permit  successful and efficient deployment and employment of forces. Its  overarching policy directive on managing energy commodities and related  services establishes policy on standardizing fuels, minimizing inventory  levels, maximizing use of alternative fuel sources from host nations and  commercial sources, and privatizing energy infrastructure at military  installations. The Defense Energy Support Center, within the Defense  Logistics Agency, finances fuel purchases through a defense working  capital fund. The military services purchase fuel from the Defense Energy  Support Center using funds appropriated for their operation and  maintenance accounts. Various DOD components have a role in planning  for fuel demand and managing fuel storage and delivery.", "DOD has been exploring issues surrounding its reliance on petroleum  through a number of studies sponsored by various offices within OSD. In  2001, the Defense Science Board issued the results of its study on  improving the fuel efficiency of weapons platforms, in response to a  tasking from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,  and Logistics. In 2006, the Office of the Director, Defense Research and  Engineering, sponsored a study by The JASONs, an independent defense  advisory group under The MITRE Corporation, to assess ways to reduce  DOD\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels. Under the sponsorship of the Office of  Force Transformation and Resources, within the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy, LMI issued a 2007 report on an approach  to establishing a DOD energy strategy. During the period in which we  were conducting our review, the Defense Science Board, at the direction  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics, issued a new report on DOD\u2019s energy strategy.

The integrated product team reports to a senior steering group,  consisting of principal deputy secretaries of defense and service under  secretaries and assistant secretaries. Among other activities, the task force  recommended funding in fiscal year 2008 for several military service-led  energy-related research and development projects, and it is monitoring  their progress (see table 1).", "In addition to focusing on research and development initiatives, DOD has  recognized a need to factor energy efficiency considerations into its  acquisition process. In 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense included  energy in DOD\u2019s list of the top 25 transformational priorities for the  department, as part of its initiative to pursue targeted acquisition reforms.  Also, in April 2007, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics established a DOD policy to include  the fully burdened cost of fuel\u2014that is, the total ownership cost of buying,  moving, and protecting fuel in systems during combat\u2014for the acquisition  of all tactical systems that create a demand for energy. To incorporate  the fully burdened cost of energy into acquisition decisions, OSD initiated  a pilot program that includes three systems: the Army and Marine Corps\u2019  Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, the Navy\u2019s new CG(X) cruiser, and the Air  Force\u2019s Next-Generation Long-Range Strike aircraft. To further facilitate  the implementation of this policy, OSD\u2019s Program Analysis and Evaluation  office developed a methodology for assessing the fully burdened cost of  fuel and completed its initial analyses of the first system, the Joint Light  Tactical Vehicle, last fall. According to the DOD policy, the results of the  pilot program are expected to be used as the basis for implementation  across all relevant acquisition programs.", "In another initiative, the Joint Staff added language to its guidance in May  2007 requiring that an energy efficiency key performance parameter be  selectively considered in the development of capability requirements for  new systems. The guidance defines a key performance parameter as an  attribute or characteristic of a system that is considered critical or  essential to the development of an effective military capability. For  example, a survivability key performance parameter is applicable for  manned systems designed to enhance personnel survival when employed  in an asymmetric threat environment. In general, a key performance  parameter represents a system attribute that is so significant that failure to  meet its minimum threshold could be a reason for DOD or the military  services to reevaluate the concept or system or terminate the program.", "In response to the work conducted by the DOD Energy Security Task  Force, the Joint Staff has also been directed to lead an assessment of  simulator capability and capacity across the department. This effort is  expected to analyze whether the increased use of simulators could  substitute for live training without degrading operational capability. The  study will also identify barriers to implementation and needed policy  changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Is Examining Ways to Reduce In-Theater Fuel Demand", "paragraphs": ["The Army has begun a number of efforts to reduce mobility energy  demand. These activities include undertaking initiatives to reduce fuel  consumption in theater, determining the total costs of delivering fuel, and  developing an Army energy strategy. The Army, through the office of the  Army Rapid Equipping Force, created the Power Surety Task Force in  2006 to address a joint urgent operational needs statement from a U.S.  commander in Iraq that called for alternative energy sources to reduce the  amount of fuel transported to supply power generation systems at  forward-deployed locations. The Power Surety Task Force aims to foster  the development of projects and programs that are deployable within 18  months. Two of the Power Surety Task Force\u2019s initiatives\u2014foam-insulated  tents and temporary biodegradable dome structures that are more efficient  to heat and cool\u2014are expected to reduce the number of generators  required to produce power at forward-deployed locations. Another  initiative is the development of a transportable hybrid electric power  station, which uses wind, solar energy, a diesel generator, and storage  batteries to provide reliable power with fewer fuel requirements.  According to Army Rapid Equipping Force officials, the power station  could potentially replace about half of the current generators at forward- deployed locations. Moreover, they estimated that annual savings in Iraq  from some of these initiatives could be at least $1.7 billion, and that other  benefits could include a reduction in the number of trucks required in  supply convoys, potentially saving lives and reducing vehicle maintenance  requirements. We did not validate the Army Rapid Equipping Force\u2019s cost  savings estimate.", "Another ongoing Army activity is its effort to determine the total costs of  delivered energy for Army systems. The Army\u2019s \u201cSustain the Mission  Project\u201d was started in 2004 to institutionalize a fully burdened cost  methodology in the Army. The methodology uses existing Army and DOD  databases, metrics, and processes to calculate the fully burdened cost of  fuel and to facilitate \u201cwhat if\u201d analyses for different assumptions and  scenarios. It is also aimed at enabling decision makers to perform cost- benefit analyses of investments in alternative energy and weapons systems  technologies. The Army has scheduled a demonstration of this tool in late  March 2008.", "The Army will also sponsor a study that officials expect will lead to the  development of a tactical fuel and energy strategy for the future modular  force. The contract for the 1-year study was expected to be awarded in  2008. Army officials told us that they plan to update the Army\u2019s energy  regulation following completion of the study.

Awards are given quarterly to ships that use less  than the Navy\u2019s established baseline amount of fuel, and fuel savings  achieved during the quarter are reallocated to the ship for the purchase of  items such as paint, coveralls, and firefighting gear. The ship energy  conservation program receives $4 million in funding annually, and Navy  officials told us that they achieved $124.6 million in cost avoidance in  fiscal year 2006. They said that some other benefits of this program  include more available steaming hours, additional training for ships,  improved ship performance, reduced ship maintenance, and conservation  of resources.", "The Navy has undertaken other mobility energy reduction efforts as part  of its ship energy conservation program, such as ship alterations. Two key  ship alterations are the use of stern flaps and the modification of boiler  boxes. A stern flap alters the water flow at the stern to reduce a ship\u2019s  resistance and increase fuel efficiency. According to Navy officials,  preliminary tests of stern flaps on guided missile destroyers showed an  annual fuel reduction of 3,800 to 4,700 barrels, or about 6 to 7.5 percent  per ship, which DOD estimated would result in potential savings of almost  $195,000 per year per ship. Boiler box modifications for amphibious  assault ships, one of the Navy\u2019s largest fuel-consuming ships, are expected  to decrease the amount of fuel expended by 2 percent per ship. Navy  officials told us that this alteration has been approved and that most  alterations would be completed in fiscal year 2009.

These concerns, coupled with an increased national and congressional  interest in reducing fossil fuel dependence and exploring alternative  energies, will likely necessitate an increased leadership focus on long-term  energy issues, both within DOD and in its role as a stakeholder in  interagency and national dialogues. The Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007, for example, requires a variety of national-level  actions, including that the President submit to Congress an annual report  on the national energy security of the United States. It also requires DOD  to examine energy and cost savings in nonbuilding applications, including  an examination of savings associated with reducing the need for fuel  delivery and logistical support.

While we did  not evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of these organizational  frameworks as part of this review, they nonetheless provide DOD  examples to consider in determining how best to establish an overarching  organizational framework for mobility energy. For example, the Business  Transformation Agency, which addresses business systems modernization,  involves top DOD leadership by operating under the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics but  reporting directly to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Business  Transformation.

Once the capabilities are identified, DOD\u2019s  acquisition process produces equipment that can meet those requirements.  DOD-sponsored studies on fuel reduction, such as the 2007 LMI report,  note that the requirements development and acquisition processes provide  opportunities for DOD to consider energy efficiencies while considering  capabilities. Moreover, the 2001 Defense Science Board report noted that  fuel efficiency benefits are not currently valued or emphasized in DOD\u2019s  requirements development and acquisition processes. While DOD has  recently begun to take some steps to integrate fuel considerations into  these processes, these considerations are not factored in a systematic  manner and cannot be fully applied.", "For example, DOD\u2019s requirements development process does not  systematically include energy efficiency considerations, and the capability  gap assessments associated with the process do not include fuel-related  logistics, thus leaving these types of issues to be resolved after systems are  fielded. As described earlier, in May 2007, the Joint Staff established an  energy efficiency key performance parameter that would require fuel  considerations during capabilities development. However, because DOD  has not developed a methodology to determine how best to employ the  energy efficiency key performance parameter, implementation of this key  performance parameter remains uncertain.", "DOD has also taken steps to inform its acquisition process with its pilot  program to determine the fully burdened cost of fuel for three mobile  defense systems. While the pilot program represents a step toward  providing visibility over the total logistics costs associated with delivered  fuel and DOD has set a fall 2008 deadline to issue guidance for applying  the fully burdened cost of fuel in acquisition programs, DOD has not yet  developed an approach for determining how it would incorporate this  information into its acquisition decision-making process. Moreover, the  2008 Defense Science Board report presented some concerns about how  fully burdened costs are being calculated. Specifically, the report cited a  concern that the analysis focused on peacetime costs and did not  adequately consider wartime costs, even though the fully burdened cost  analysis is intended to be a wartime capability planning factor. Until the  pilot program is completed and the results are assessed, DOD is not in a  position to apply a fully burdened cost analysis to its acquisition process.  Thus, the department is unable to promote greater visibility over its  acquisition decisions or more fully consider the operational and cost  consequences of the fuel burden on the logistics infrastructure.", "Other key DOD business processes, such as those that address repair,  recapitalization, and replacement of mobile defense systems also present  opportunities to incorporate fuel efficiency measures during system  upgrades. However, OSD officials told us that the department generally  makes decisions about system upgrades without regard to fuel efficiency,  including the fully burdened cost, in part because such decisions require  greater up-front costs. Although DOD recognizes that by reducing energy  demand it can provide its forces greater flexibility and reduce their  dependence on the logistics infrastructure, some OSD officials told us that  DOD\u2019s budget process promotes a short-term outlook and does not  encourage the purchase of fuel-efficient systems or upgrades that may  initially cost more but could reduce life cycle and logistics costs over the  long term. Moreover, the 2008 Defense Science Board report noted that  DOD\u2019s lack of tools to assess the operational and economic benefits of fuel  efficiency technologies is a major reason why DOD underinvests in the  development and deployment of these technologies. In addition, OSD  officials told us that DOD does not systematically assess how making fuel  efficiency upgrades to systems would affect other logistics issues\u2014for  example, how reducing the weight of an Army vehicle would affect the  amount of fuel the Air Force transports to the battlefield for that vehicle.

For example, LMI  reported that DOD\u2019s increasing fuel demand furthers the nation\u2019s reliance  on foreign energy sources and limits the department\u2019s ability to establish a  more mobile and agile force.
