This report (1) identifies and describes AOA best practices, (2) determines the extent to which DOE requirements and guidance for conducting an AOA conform to AOA best practices, and (3) determines the extent to which NNSA conformed to best practices and followed certain DOE requirements and guidance in conducting the AOAs for recent NNSA projects.", "To do this work, GAO examined relevant AOA guidance from the public and private sectors and DOE's AOA requirements and guidance, sought input from AOA experts, and interviewed agency officials. GAO reviewed three AOAs that NNSA completed or was scheduled to complete between November 2010 and September 2014."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified 24 best practices for analysis of alternatives (AOA)\u2014a process that is a key first step in capital asset acquisition. The process entails identifying, analyzing, and selecting a preferred alternative to best meet the mission need by comparing the operational effectiveness, costs, and risks of potential alternatives. Because no single set of best practices for AOAs was broadly recognized by government and private-sector entities, GAO developed a set of practices by reviewing AOA policies and guidance used by seven public and private-sector entities with experience in the AOA process, and verified these practices with subject matter experts. These best practices include, among other things, defining functional requirements based on mission need, conducting the AOA without a predetermined solution, including the status-quo alternative, and conducting an independent review of the entire AOA process. These practices can be applied to a wide range of activities, projects, and programs.", "The Department of Energy's (DOE) requirements and guidance\u2014found in the agency's orders and associated guides\u2014for conducting an AOA do not conform to the 24 best practices GAO identified. Therefore, DOE does not have assurance that applying these requirements and guidance may lead to reliable AOAs. GAO's review of DOE's requirements for AOAs found that they conform to only 1 of the 24 best practices: the practice of defining functional requirements based on mission need. GAO's review of DOE's requirements combined with associated guidance\u2014which includes nonmandatory approaches for meeting requirements\u2014found that they conform to 9 of the 24 best practices. For example, DOE's guidance suggests identifying and considering at least three viable alternatives, including the status quo\u2014a best practice that is not included in the requirements. Federal standards for internal control related to risk assessment call for agency management to decide on actions to mitigate identified risks. Without developing a reliable AOA process, DOE may not be successful in mitigating the risk it has identified related to this process.", "DOE's requirements and guidance for AOAs also apply to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency in DOE. For three recent NNSA projects that GAO reviewed, NNSA did not conform to most of the best practices GAO identified for conducting AOAs, therefore, raising concerns about the reliability of these AOAs. Specifically, for the three projects' AOAs, NNSA conformed to 6, 8, and 11 of the 24 identified best practices, respectively. For all three projects, NNSA consistently followed the one DOE requirement that conformed to a best practice\u2014to define functional requirements based on mission need. DOE and NNSA officials acknowledge that unreliable AOAs are a risk factor for major cost increases and schedule delays for NNSA projects. As GAO has previously reported, NNSA has spent billions of dollars designing and partially constructing projects with an estimated cost of $750 million or more, only to later reassess alternatives. Without a process to develop reliable AOAs, NNSA may continue on this path and continue to have limited assurance that it is selecting alternatives that best meet its mission needs and will not result in major cost increases and schedule delays in the future."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOE incorporate best practices into its AOA requirements.

When NNSA is acquiring such assets, the use of the analysis of  alternatives (AOA) process included in DOE\u2019s requirements and guidance  is a key first step to help ensure that the selected alternative best meets  the agency\u2019s mission need. In 2009, we defined the AOA process as an  analytical study that is intended to compare the operational effectiveness,  cost, and risks of a number of potential alternatives to address valid  needs and shortfalls in operational capability. This process helps ensure  that the best alternative that satisfies the mission need is chosen on the  basis of the selection criteria, such as safety, cost, or schedule.", "In recent years, as we previously reported, NNSA has used its  requirements and guidance to select preferred alternatives for many  projects, and then spent billions of dollars designing and partially  constructing several major capital asset projects (facilities with an  estimated cost of $750 million or more), only to later reassess alternatives  for each project.

We finalized the set of 24 best practices for the AOA process by  incorporating the experts\u2019 comments. We developed this set of best  practices because no one single set of practices existed that was broadly  recognized by government and private-sector entities.

We then  confirmed these requirements with DOE and NNSA officials. We  performed two sets of analysis: we compared the best practices to (1)  DOE\u2019s requirements and (2) DOE\u2019s requirements combined with the  guidance. We used a five-point scoring system to determine the extent to  which DOE\u2019s AOA process conforms to best practices. We first used this scoring system to determine how well DOE\u2019s requirements and  guidance conform to each best practice. We then used the average of the  scores for the best practices in each of the four categories to determine  an overall score for each category, and we then used the average of the  scores for the four categories as the final score for the overall DOE AOA  process. If the score for each best practice, the average score for each  category, or the final score for the AOA process was \u201cfully met\u201d or  \u201csubstantially met,\u201d we concluded that the AOA process conformed to  best practices and therefore could be considered reliable. In contrast, if  the score was \u201cpartially met,\u201d \u201cminimally met,\u201d or \u201cnot met,\u201d we concluded  that the AOA process did not conform to best practices and therefore  could not be considered reliable.", "To determine the extent to which NNSA conformed to best practices and  followed certain DOE requirements and guidance in conducting the AOAs  for recent NNSA projects, we chose projects for which NNSA completed  the AOA process since November 2010, when DOE\u2019s most recent version  of the project management order came into effect, or for which NNSA was  scheduled to complete the AOA process by the end of fiscal year 2014.  We identified these projects by examining DOE\u2019s data from its February  2014 Monthly Project Portfolio Status Report. The three projects that met  our criteria were (1) the High Explosive Science, Technology and  Engineering Project at NNSA\u2019s Pantex site in Texas, (2) the Radioactive  Liquid Waste Treatment Facility at NNSA\u2019s Los Alamos National  Laboratory in New Mexico, and (3) the Uranium Processing Facility at  NNSA\u2019s Y-12 site in Tennessee.and NNSA officials, reviewed recent GAO reports, and compared the data  in the project status report with information received from NNSA on the  projects to assess the reliability of the data in this status report, and we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to ensure these projects  met our criteria.

In addition, one of these reviews is not an independent  review because it is conducted by the program office, which is on the  project\u2019s chain of command. Table 5 lists these required reviews.

For example, as mentioned above in the  description of the AOAs conducted at these projects, NNSA conducted  the risk analysis differently for each project. The different ways that NNSA  conducted the AOAs for the projects we examined may be due to the  nonprescriptive nature of the Order 413.3B requirements. NNSA project  officials stated that the AOA requirements in Order 413.3B are very high  level and do not prescribe specific methods to follow. According to these  officials, Order 413.3B provides a very general set of requirements for  what the AOA process should accomplish. For example, DOE\u2019s Order  413.3B states that life-cycle cost assumptions should be included in the  conceptual design report. The word \u201cassumptions\u201d leaves room for  interpretation because it could be interpreted as requiring the inclusion of  life-cycle cost estimates for all alternatives or as requiring a life-cycle cost  estimate for only the selected alternative after completion of the AOA  process. In the absence of specific requirements, each AOA team  developed its own approach to conducting an AOA. For example, NNSA  officials who worked on the AOA for the High Explosive, Science,  Technology and Engineering Project stated that they had to develop  much of the AOA process themselves and that they based their process  on historical AOAs conducted at the Pantex site in Texas. Officials  working on the AOA for the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility  project at Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory told us that they also used site- specific guidance including the laboratory\u2019s engineering standards  manual as well as their own professional experience. In contrast, officials  working on the Uranium Processing Facility project stated that they  conducted the AOA based on guidance contained within a commercially  available, off-the-shelf software suite.", "In addition, there may be some confusion about roles and responsibilities  for leading the AOA process at NNSA. NNSA officials in the Office of  Acquisition and Project Management, who are responsible for managing  the construction process, stated that their office does not have lead  responsibility for the AOA process. However, the NNSA Concept of  Operations for the Office of Acquisition and Project Management states  that, while the program offices lead the development of the mission need  and functional requirements and the selection of the preferred  alternatives, the NNSA Office of Acquisition and Project Management has  the lead for the development of the analyses of alternatives. NNSA  officials stated that they will reexamine the Concept of Operations to  clarify who has responsibility for the AOA process. The officials explained  that NNSA APM has begun looking at, among other things, DOE\u2019s current  directives and guidance and NNSA\u2019s policies and procedures relating to  AOA, the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidance relating to AOAs,  and the legislation Congress has enacted in response to other federal  agencies\u2019 AOA challenges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NNSA Did Not Consistently Follow Certain DOE AOA Guidance for Its Projects", "paragraphs": ["For the three AOAs we examined, NNSA consistently followed the DOE  AOA requirement that conformed to best practices but did not consistently  follow the elements of optional guidance that conform to best practices.

For example, the AOA for  NNSA\u2019s High Explosive, Science, Technology and Engineering Project  followed the DOE guidance that suggests identifying and considering at  least three viable alternatives, including the status quo; the AOA identified  nine alternatives, including one that represented the status quo.

The AOAs for the  three recent NNSA projects we reviewed\u2014the High Explosive Science,  Technology and Engineering Project, the Radioactive Liquid Waste  Treatment Facility, and the Uranium Processing Facility\u2014did not conform  to best practices overall and may therefore not be reliable. DOE and  NNSA officials acknowledge that unreliable AOAs are a risk factor for  major cost increases and schedule delays for NNSA projects. Federal  standards for internal control related to risk assessment call for  management to decide on actions to mitigate identified risks. Developing  requirements that incorporate best practices would help DOE mitigate the  risk for major cost increases and schedule delays by creating a  framework to ensure a reliable AOA process. Developing reliable AOAs is  particularly important at this time because NNSA has recently reassessed  or is in the process of reassessing alternatives for all its major  construction projects, after spending billions of dollars on designing and  partially constructing these projects.

The three projects listed in this  report that met our criteria were: (1) the High Explosive Science,  Technology and Engineering Project at NNSA\u2019s Pantex site in Texas, for  which NNSA was scheduled to finish the AOA process by the end of  September 2014 at the time of our project selection; (2) the Radioactive  Liquid Waste Treatment Facility at NNSA\u2019s Los Alamos National  Laboratory in New Mexico, for which NNSA completed its most recent  reassessment of alternatives in September 2013; and (3) the Uranium  Processing Facility at NNSA\u2019s Y-12 site in Tennessee, for which NNSA  completed its most recent reassessment of alternatives in June 2012.", "We checked with knowledgeable DOE and NNSA officials, reviewed  recent GAO reports, and compared the data in the project status report  with information received from NNSA on the projects to assess the  reliability of the data in this status report, and we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable to ensure these projects met our criteria. For  each of these projects, we reviewed project documentation, and we  interviewed NNSA and contractor officials in charge of the AOA to  compare the process followed by NNSA with best practices. To score  each AOA process, (1) two GAO analysts separately examined the AOA  documentation received from the agency and then agreed on a score for  each of the 24 best practices, then, (2) an AOA specialist independent of  the engagement team reviewed the AOA documentation and the scores  assigned by the analysts for accuracy and cross-checked the scores in all  the analyses for consistency. After completing this process for each  individual best practice in all the analyses, we calculated the scores for  each category\u2014(1) general principles, (2) identifying alternatives, (3)  analyzing alternatives, and (4) selecting a preferred alternative\u2014and the  overall score for each analysis. We sent our analyses to DOE and NNSA  for review twice, and we used the same scoring process when we revised  the scores based on their technical comments and any additional  evidence received.", "In April 2014, as we were conducting our engagement, NNSA released a  peer review report that recommended a new alternative for the Uranium  Processing Facility. We examined whether this peer review reflected any  characteristics of an AOA by interviewing NNSA officials and comparing  the peer review with the AOA best practices. In addition, as part of this  objective, we determined the extent to which NNSA conformed to certain  DOE requirements and guidance\u2014those DOE requirements and  guidance that conformed to best practices\u2014in conducting the AOAs for  these projects. We used the results of the earlier analysis comparing  DOE\u2019s requirements and guidance to best practices to determine which  DOE requirements and guidance conformed to best practices. We then  reviewed project documentation and interviewed NNSA and contractor  officials in charge of the AOA process to assess the extent to which  NNSA projects followed DOE\u2019s requirements and guidance that  conformed to best practices.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2014 to December  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The four categories of best practices  address the entire analysis of alternatives (AOA) process from defining  the mission need and functional requirements to independently reviewing  its results. On the basis of our reviews and experts\u2019 comments, we  believe that these best practices can be generally applied from the  beginning of the AOA process with practices from the general principles  category, through practices in the identifying and analyzing alternatives  categories, and ending with practices in the selecting a preferred  alternative category. We also believe that these best practices do not  necessarily have to be followed in order and that some of them can be  applied concurrently with other best practices. For example, the best  practice of defining the selection criteria based on the mission need in the  selecting a preferred alternative category could be addressed at the same  time as the best practice of creating a study plan in the general principles  category.", "Table 12 below provides a complete list of best practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: DOE\u2019s AOA Requirements and Guidance Compared with Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) requirements for analysis of  alternatives (AOA) in Order 413.3B minimally meet the best practices we  identified.
