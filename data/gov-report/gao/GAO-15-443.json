First, oceanic surveillance is limited, and an aircraft's position may not be precisely known. For example, MH370 continued to fly for several hours outside of radar coverage after onboard communications equipment were no longer working, according to investigators. Additionally, communication and coordination between air traffic control centers in oceanic regions pose challenges. Finally, these accidents show that investigators may have difficulty locating and recovering flight recorders, which are used to determine accident causes, because of the ocean's depth and terrain. For instance, locating AF447's flight recorders took 2 years at a cost of approximately $40 million.", "Proposals to enhance aircraft tracking: Following the disappearance of MH370, the international aviation community developed voluntary performance standards to establish a near-term aircraft tracking capability using existing technologies and a long-term comprehensive aircraft tracking concept of operations.", "Near-term voluntary aircraft tracking performance standards : An industry task force called for automatic position reporting to airlines every 15 minutes and faster reporting when triggers, such as an unusual change in altitude, are met. According to stakeholders, existing technologies can meet this standard, and many domestic long-haul aircraft are equipped to do so, although some additional ground infrastructure may be needed. However, some airlines may face costs to equip aircraft with these technologies. In the longer term, technologies like satellite-based surveillance may provide global aircraft tracking.", "Long-term global aeronautical distress system : The International Civil Aviation Organization has proposed a long-term framework, which is designed to ensure an up-to-date record of aircraft progress and, in the case of emergency, the location of survivors, the aircraft, and its flight recorders.

To determine the various  government and industry proposals to enhance aircraft tracking and flight  data recovery, we reviewed recommendations and reports from  government investigative agencies, working papers and reports from  industry meetings held by international organizations, technology  presentations from avionics manufacturers, and industry white papers.We requested information from vendors and airlines regarding costs of  various technology proposals. However, cost data were not available in  some cases, and in other cases we were unable to obtain specific costs  due to concerns about the sensitivity of proprietary information.  Therefore, we provide broad estimates of potential costs where possible  and discuss the types of costs that may be incurred, such as installation,  data transmission, and maintenance costs.

The  United States air transport system, in particular, is experiencing one of  the safest periods in its history. The FAA, an agency of the Department of  Transportation, is primarily responsible for the advancement, safety, and  regulation of civil aviation, as well as overseeing the development of the  air traffic control (ATC) system. The FAA\u2019s stated mission is to provide  the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world. Air traffic  control on a global level is coordinated by ICAO, which establishes global  standards for air navigation, air traffic control, aircraft operations,  personnel licensing, airport design, and other issues related to air safety.", "FAA collaborates with ICAO in setting standards and procedures for  aircraft, personnel, airways, and aviation services domestically and  throughout the world.", "Air navigation service providers (ANSPs) are organizations authorized to  provide air navigation services. For example, FAA\u2019s Air Traffic  Organization is responsible for providing safe and efficient air navigation  services in U.S. airspace. Air traffic services units provide air traffic  control, flight information, and alerting services in portions of airspace  called flight information regions. According to Annex 11 to the Convention  on International Civil Aviation, air traffic control is provided to prevent  collisions and expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic, among  other things. Surveillance plays an important role in air traffic control as  the ability to accurately and reliably determine the location of aircraft has  a direct influence on how efficiently a given airspace may be utilized.  Additionally, according to ICAO, surveillance can be used as the basis for  automated alert systems, as the ability to actively track aircraft enables air  traffic control to be alerted, for example, when an aircraft deviates from its  altitude or route. Radar is a surveillance technology that provides the air  traffic controller with an on-screen view of aircraft position. Air traffic  control uses radar to determine the position of aircraft and the aircraft\u2019s  reported altitude at a given time when traveling over land or coastlines.  An aircraft\u2019s transponder automatically transmits a reply when it receives  an interrogation radio signal from ground radar stations. During the cruise  portion of a flight within radar coverage, the aircraft\u2019s position is reported  at least every 12 seconds, depending on the rotational speed of the  ground radar antenna. FAA and its aviation counterparts in other parts of  the world\u2014including Europe, Asia, and Australia\u2014are in the process of  transitioning from radar-based surveillance to a system using Automatic  Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), which once implemented, is  expected to provide air traffic controllers and pilots with more accurate  information to help keep aircraft safely separated in the sky and on  runways.", "In areas without radar or ADS-B coverage\u2014including oceanic airspace,  remote geographic regions such as the North and South Poles, and some  areas in Africa, Asia, and South America\u2014pilots use radio communications systems to report the position of their aircraft to air traffic  control. According to FAA guidance for oceanic and international  operations, aircraft are to report their position to the ANSP responsible for  the airspace where the aircraft is operated and should do so before  passing from one flight information region to another. On routes that are  not defined by designated reporting points, aircraft should report as  soon as possible after the first 30 minutes of flight and at hourly intervals  thereafter, with a maximum interval between reports of 1 hour and 20  minutes. On oceanic routes, aircraft should report their position at all  designated reporting points, as applicable; otherwise, flights should report  their position at designated lines of latitude and longitude. Aircraft flying in  oceanic airspace may be equipped with additional avionics and satellite  communications capabilities, such as the Future Air Navigation System  (FANS), which creates a virtual radar environment to allow air traffic  control to safely place more aircraft in the same airspace.", "ICAO requires that, at a minimum, aircraft operating over oceans must have a  functioning two-way radio to communicate with the appropriate air traffic control unit. FAA  requires Part 121 operators (i.e., scheduled commercial air carriers) to carry certain  communication and navigation equipment for extended over-water operations. For  example, aircraft of these operators must have at least two independent long-range  navigation systems and at least two independent long-range communication systems to  communicate with at least one appropriate station from any point on the route. software, which is integrated with an aircraft\u2019s flight management system,  provides a means for digital transmission of short messages between the  aircraft and ATC using radio or satellite communication systems. To fly at  optimum altitudes in the North Atlantic\u2014the busiest oceanic airspace in  the world\u2014operators were required to equip with FANS by February 5,  2015. Aircraft equipped with FANS can transmit Automatic Dependent  Surveillance-Contract (ADS-C) reports, which may include information on  the plane\u2019s current position and intended path to air traffic control.  Position reports sent through ADS-C transmit at defined time intervals,  when specific events occur such as a sudden loss of altitude, or based on  a request from air traffic control.", "In addition to the role of surveillance in air traffic control, FAA requires  commercial airlines conducting scheduled and nonscheduled operations  under part 121 of federal aviation regulations to have a flight following  system in place to ensure the proper monitoring of the progress of each  flight from origin to destination, including intermediate stops and  diversions. Major airlines monitor the progress of flights from their  operational centers using technologies such as the Aircraft  Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), a  communications system used predominantly for transmission of short text  messages from the aircraft to airline operational centers via radio or  satellite communication.", "When an aircraft is in distress, or does not communicate as expected, air  traffic control\u2019s responsibility for providing alerting services is provided in  Annex 11 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. There are 3  phases intended to notify search and rescue services to take appropriate  measures, including:", "Uncertainty phase: Established when communication has not been  received from the crew within the 30-minute period after a  communication should have been received.", "Alert phase: Established when subsequent attempts to contact the  crew or inquiries to other relevant sources have failed to reveal any  information about the aircraft.", "Distress phase: Established when more widespread inquiries have  failed to provide any information, and when the fuel on board is  considered to be exhausted.", "ICAO members establish search and rescue regions to provide  communication infrastructure, distress alert routing, and operational  coordination for supporting search and rescue services.and rescue regions, aeronautical rescue coordination centers are  responsible for the search and rescue operations prompted by an aviation  accident. ICAO encourages countries, where practicable, to combine their  search and rescue resources into a joint rescue coordination center with  responsibility for both aeronautical and maritime search and rescue.", "Search and rescue authorities may be alerted to distress situations by  satellite constellations operated by the International Cospas-Sarsat  Program that detect transmissions from an aircraft\u2019s emergency locator  transmitter. The emergency locator transmitter may be automatically  activated by the shock typically encountered during an emergency or  manually by a member of the flight crew. Satellites detect an activated  transmitter and send the signals to ground stations, which determine the  transmitter\u2019s position and report to search and rescue authorities.  Individual countries are responsible for providing these services.", "In the rare event of a disaster, after any survivors have been rescued,  physical recovery of the aircraft\u2019s wreckage and the flight data recorder  (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR)\u2014commonly referred to as the  black boxes\u2014from the crash site is a priority in order to determine the  cause of and circumstances surrounding the accident. After recovering  the recorders, each about 20 pounds and roughly the size of a shoebox,  investigators from civil accident investigation authorities\u2014such as the  NTSB in the United States or the French Bureau d\u2019Enqu\u00eates et  d\u2019Analyses (BEA)\u2014download and analyze data on flight conditions and  the cockpit\u2019s audio environment.

Over land,  radar monitors aircraft position in real time but coverage diminishes more  than 150 miles from coastlines or in remote airspace such as the polar  regions. In non-radar environments, flight crews rely on procedural  surveillance by periodically reporting their position to air traffic control  when passing certain waypoints on their flight plan. Intervals between  position reports vary, but aircraft in oceanic and remote airspace should  report their position at least every 80 minutes, according to FAA guidance  for oceanic operations. According to one avionics manufacturer, it may  take a flight crew 10 to 20 minutes to report their position using high  frequency (HF) radio due to the disruptions caused by weather and  atmospheric conditions over the oceans. Given that an aircraft cruises at  speeds of more than 500 miles per hour (depending on altitude), an  aircraft could travel more than 167 miles between 20-minute position  reports, in comparison to radar\u2019s ability to determine an aircraft\u2019s location  at least every 12 seconds. An aircraft reporting every 80 minutes could  travel more than 600 miles between position reports. In airspace with less  air traffic, such as remote oceanic regions, air traffic control does not  require continuous contact with aircraft to maintain safe separation. Even  more frequent position reports may not provide precise information on the  aircraft\u2019s location. For example, during its scheduled flight to Paris on  June 1, 2009, AF447\u2019s last regular ACARS position report was sent at  02:10 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)maintenance messages were transmitted between 02:10 and 02:15, the  approximate time of the plane\u2019s crash. Based on the time the last ACARS  message was received, investigators established a search area of more  than 17,000 square kilometers, more than 500 nautical miles from any  coastline, with a radius of 40 nautical miles centered on the plane\u2019s last  known location. MH370\u2019s communications systems also included ACARS,  but as discussed below, this system and other onboard systems stopped  transmitting data during flight.", "Additionally, air traffic control and airline operation centers may be unable  to determine an aircraft\u2019s location if communications equipment onboard  the plane is damaged, malfunctioning, or has been manually turned off.  For example, MH370 departed from Kuala Lumpur at 16:42 UTC on  March 8, 2014 on a scheduled flight to Beijing, China. According to the  Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the agency leading the search for the  plane, MH370\u2019s flight path includes three distinct sections:  1.  an initial stage after takeoff in which the aircraft was under secondary  radar, the transponder was operational, and ACARS messages were  being transmitted;  2.  a second stage in which onboard communications equipment were no  longer working and the plane was only being tracked by military radar;  and  3.  a final stage in which the only available information on the flight\u2019s path  comes from satellite communications log data.", "At 17:07, the aircraft transmitted its final automatic ACARS message,  which included the weight of the fuel remaining on board. The flight  crew\u2019s last radio contact with Malaysian air traffic control occurred at  17:19 and then MH370 lost contact with air traffic control during a  transition between Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace at 17:22. At  18:22, Malaysian military radar tracked MH370 flying northwest along the  Strait of Malacca; this was the final radar data indicating the airplane\u2019s  position. After disappearing from military radar, MH370\u2019s satellite  communications system exchanged seven signaling messages\u2014also  referred to as \u201chandshakes\u201d\u2014with the ground station, a satellite over  the Indian Ocean, and the aircraft\u2019s satellite communications from 18:25  until 00:19. According to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the  final signaling message, a log-on request from the aircraft, indicates a  power interruption on board that may have been caused by an exhausted  fuel supply. At 01:15, MH370 did not respond to the signaling message  from the ground station. Using the handshake data to determine that it  continued to fly for several hours after disappearing from radar and  estimates of the aircraft\u2019s range based on the fuel quantity included in the  final ACARS message, investigators placed MH370\u2019s final location  somewhere in Australia\u2019s search and rescue region on an arc in the  southern Indian Ocean. The current phase of the search is focused on an  area of approximately 60,000 square kilometers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communication and Coordination among ATC, Operators, and Search and Rescue Authorities in Oceanic Areas Can Be Challenging", "paragraphs": ["Communication and coordination between air traffic control centers can  be difficult in oceanic and remote areas. As discussed previously,  responsibility for global air traffic control is divided geographically by flight  information region. Over the course of an oceanic flight, an aircraft may  transition frequently between flight information regions in areas in which  the ability to communicate with air traffic control can be limited. With  respect to AF447, the TASIL waypoint in the Atlantic Ocean is located on  the boundary between the Brazilian and Senegalese flight information  regions. According to the final report on the investigation of the AF447  accident, controllers from the Atlantico Area Control Center in Brazil\u2014 which had been in contact with the aircraft\u2014and the adjacent Dakar  Oceanic Area Control Center in Senegal\u2014which never established  contact with the aircraft\u2014stated that the quality of the HF radio reception  was poor the night of the accident, resulting in recurring communication  problems. The report found that there were powerful cloud clusters on the  route of AF447, which may have created notable turbulence. The  Atlantico controller last had contact at 01:35, when the crew read off their  altitude and flight plan. Over the next minute, the controller asked the  crew three times for its estimated time to cross the TASIL waypoint but  received no response. The flight, however, did not encounter serious  problems until 02:10 and the accident occurred in the Atlantico region at  approximately 02:14. The crew should have established contact with  Dakar air traffic controllers at approximately 02:20 when the aircraft was  due to pass the TASIL waypoint. Dakar controllers stated that they were  not concerned about the absence of radio contact with AF447 given the  HF problems that night and since aircraft frequently crossed all or some  of the Dakar flight information region without making radio contact. The  AF447 final report concluded that the radio communication problems and  meteorological conditions resulted in the controllers considering the  situation (i.e., no contact with the flight) as normal. Furthermore, there  were several communications breakdowns at critical junctures.  Specifically, the report noted the lack of contact between the Atlantico  controller and the flight crew before the transfer to the Dakar controller  and the lack of contact between the Atlantico and Dakar controllers after  AF447\u2019s projected passage of the TASIL waypoint, both of which  indicated that air traffic control had not effectively monitored the aircraft.  The report also noted that a timely alert was not triggered because the  controller in each region failed to communicate with the other as each  individual controller anticipated. See figure 2 for a timeline of the AF447  accident.", "Furthermore, according to the AF447 final report, information inquiries  regarding the aircraft were not coordinated, resulting in air traffic control,  search and rescue, and the operators questioning each other without  making a decision about what action to take. Although the last contact  with AF447 occurred at approximately 01:35, it took more than 9 hours for  search teams to take off from Senegal and Brazil. The first search plane  arrived at the TASIL waypoint approximately 13 hours after the crash.  Contrary to ICAO standards and recommended practices, Brazil and  Senegal did not have a search and rescue protocol. Consequently, the  Brazilian and Senegalese rescue coordination centers were not aware of  each country\u2019s available resources, and the report stated that it was not  possible to quickly identify one aeronautical rescue coordination center to  lead the search and rescue mission. In the absence of a protocol, the  report noted that the rescue coordination centers wasted considerable  time gathering information and determining whether to trigger a search.  The report also noted that there was a lack of coordination within the  French aeronautical rescue coordination center and with its foreign  counterparts in organizing the search and rescue. After being informed by  Air France about a series of failure messages issued by the aircraft to its  maintenance center in France, authorities from the French aeronautical  rescue coordination center considered themselves not competent to  intervene in a zone outside their area of responsibility. The report noted  that this belief could be explained by ineffective training for search and  rescue agents, particularly in terms of coordination with foreign  counterparts. The French aeronautical rescue coordination center also  provided key information to organizations that were not, according to the  final report, competent in search and rescue; for example, one of the  organizations failed to forward the last known position of the aircraft from  an ACARS message.", "MH370 also highlights the complexities of coordinating search and rescue  activities in areas with multiple flight information regions when the final  location of the plane is unknown. As noted earlier, MH370 departed from  Kuala Lumpur at 16:42 UTC on March 8, 2014. At 17:19, Kuala Lumpur  air traffic control instructed MH370 to contact Ho Chi Minh air traffic  control, and the flight crew acknowledged this request over the radio.  According to the interim report issued by the Malaysia Ministry of  Transport\u2019s Safety Investigation Team for MH370, another contact should  have occurred at about 17:22 when MH370 passed the IGARI waypoint,  but MH370 lost contact with ATC during the transition between Malaysian  and Vietnamese airspace. The Ho Chi Minh City air traffic control center  contacted the Kuala Lumpur air traffic control center at 17:39 to inquire   Thereafter, according to the report,  about the whereabouts of MH370.Kuala Lumpur initiated efforts involving the Malaysia Airlines operations  center and Singapore, Hong Kong, and Phnom Penh air traffic control  centers to establish MH370\u2019s location, a process that lasted nearly 4  hours. The Kuala Lumpur aeronautical rescue coordination center  transmitted the first distress message related to MH370 at 22:32\u2014more  than 5 hours after the last message expected from the crew\u2014to begin  search and rescue operations in the South China Sea based on the  aircraft\u2019s last known position.

In two instances\u2014AF447 and MH370\u2014search and  recovery efforts for the recorders exceeded 1 year. In these cases,  recovery of the flight recorders was hampered because investigators did  not know the precise location of the crash site. The search for AF 447  involved a 17,000 square kilometer area, and the ongoing search for the  wreckage of MH370 is focused on 60,000 square kilometers in the  southern Indian Ocean. Additionally, the complexities of the underwater  environment may hamper efforts to retrieve recorders. While authorities  located some debris from AF447 in a remote section of the Atlantic  Ocean within a few days of the accident on June 1, 2009, they were  unable to locate the recorders during that time. The first phase of the  BEA\u2019s search for the recorders focused on the underwater locator  beacons. Batteries in the current beacons are designed to allow the  signal to be transmitted for at least 30 days and its range is typically  limited to less than 3 nautical miles depending on water\u2019s depth,  underwater topography, and surrounding conditions. If the location of the  crash cannot be determined within 30 days, the time available to search  for the recorders while the beacons\u2019 batteries have life is limited. The  search for AF447\u2019s beacons using a towed pinger locator followed the  airplane\u2019s projected trajectory in the Atlantic but was unable to detect an  acoustic signal within the minimum 30-day transmission period. From July  2009 to April 2011, the BEA attempted to locate the wreckage and  recorders in several search phases using sonar detection, evaluation of  aircraft debris drift, and satellite-tracked buoys, each time unsuccessfully.  After identifying the wreckage site at a depth of more than 12,000 feet,  investigators ultimately found the flight recorders in May 2011 amid  aircraft debris scattered on the seafloor. The BEA subsequently  determined that the cockpit voice recorder\u2019s beacon was damaged on  impact while the beacon on the flight data recorder separated and was  never found.

The Task Force developed a  set of voluntary performance standards to establish a baseline aircraft   The  tracking capability for all commercial passenger aircraft worldwide.key aircraft tracking performance standards proposed by the Task Force  include:", "Position reporting every 15 minutes, with capability to increase the  reporting rate in response to an emergency. This performance  standard calls for regular and automatic transmission of aircraft  position information. The 15-minute frequency reflects the optimal  balance between the benefit of knowing flight location with greater  precision and the costs of transmitting data, as well as the cost of  search and rescue operations, according to the Oceanic Position  Tracking Improvement and Monitoring Initiative. The Task Force  also called for any aircraft tracking system to have the capability to  report more frequently when certain circumstances are met, such as  unusual change in the trajectory, vertical speed, or altitude of the  aircraft. The purpose of the increased position reporting rate is to  narrow the search zone for an aircraft in distress.", "Position reports should include latitude, longitude, altitude, and time  information. This performance standard calls for position reporting in  four dimensions. Latitude and longitude provide the aircraft\u2019s location  on a map, while altitude and time provide other data points to pinpoint  the precise position of the aircraft at any stage of the flight.", "Communications protocols between the airline and air traffic service  provider to facilitate coordination in case of an emergency situation.  The Task Force recognized that there is a need both to amend  existing procedures and to develop new or improved communications  protocols between airlines and air traffic service providers. The  purpose of this performance standard is to establish communication  procedures and protocols to better respond to instances of missing  position reports or other unexplainable developments.", "In order to achieve this baseline aircraft tracking standard, the Task Force  recommended that aircraft operators evaluate their capabilities,  implement measures to meet the performance standards within 12  months, and exchange best practices. According to the Task Force, these  standards and recommendations are designed to improve the collective  ability of the airline industry to identify and track aircraft globally. The  Task Force also recognized that near-term procedures are just first steps  in a longer-term, integrated concept of operations for aircraft tracking  during all phases of flight. This concept of operations is discussed further  below.", "Several technologies could be used to meet the recommended aircraft  tracking performance standards, according to the Task Force and aviation  stakeholders we interviewed. For instance, ACARS- and FANS-equipped  aircraft can be configured to report aircraft position information, even  though ACARS is not specifically designed for that function and FANS is  designed to report to air traffic control, not to airlines. According to the  Task Force, ACARS uses information derived from the aircraft\u2019s flight  management system to report the aircraft\u2019s position, and ACARS is  configurable for enhanced reporting triggered by unanticipated altitude  changes or flight levels below a predetermined altitude. For aircraft that  are equipped with FANS, the airline ground systems can be configured to  access information about the position of the aircraft, using Automatic  Dependent Surveillance-Contract (ADS-C)\u2014an application that allows the  airline or air traffic control to establish a contract with the FANS system  onboard the aircraft to deliver four dimensional position and other data at  single, periodic, or event-based intervals. In addition, other benefits of  FANS include reduced separation between aircraft, more direct routings  leading to reduced fuel consumption, and improved communication clarity  between the pilot and air traffic control. Other commercially available  systems, including FLYHT Aerospace Solution\u2019s Automated Flight  Information Reporting System, would also meet the proposed  performance standards by providing operators with precise information  about the aircraft\u2019s position in real-time, according to the manufacturer.Passenger Wi-Fi systems, which utilize satellite connectivity, could also  be used to facilitate aircraft tracking, according to representatives from  one domestic airline.", "The level of equipage for these various technologies differs across the  U.S. and global fleet. According to one of the major air transport  communications service providers, almost all commercial passenger jet  aircraft operators in the U.S. install and use ACARS, including nearly all  regional airlines. Three major domestic passenger airlines that we spoke to also confirmed that their entire fleets are equipped with ACARS.  Generally, airlines based outside the U.S. use ACARS, except some low- cost airlines that have avoided the cost of installing ACARS avionics and  use only very high-frequency (VHF) voice radio or other solutions,  according to one air transport communications service provider.", "According to some aviation stakeholders we spoke to\u2014including FAA,  two domestic airlines, and one of the major air transport communications  service providers\u2014fewer airlines have equipped with FANS because it is  only beneficial to the airlines when flying in certain, higher density oceanic  airspace. FAA officials we spoke to estimated that approximately 70\u201480  percent of the aircraft operating in the busy North Atlantic airspace are  currently FANS-equipped because it is required to access the optimal  routes. According to one air transport communications service provider,  FANS equipage on short-haul aircraft is very low, but is expected to  increase because aircraft will need FANS avionics to be able to  communicate with certain components of FAA\u2019s Next Generation Air  Transportation System (NextGen) in the future. Airlines that wish to take  advantage of the optimal flight paths between North America and Europe  will need to be FANS-equipped by 2015; therefore, FANS equipage is  expected to increase in the future, according to FAA. Representatives  from one large domestic airline said they are installing FANS on all of  their aircraft used for international operations largely because of its  operational and safety benefits. Another airline that we spoke to is also  planning to equip its aircraft that operate from the U.S. West Coast to  Hawaii because of the operational efficiencies expected by using FANS.  Finally, two major airframe manufacturers told us that all new aircraft  typically come equipped with the latest communications, navigation, and  surveillance avionics, including ACARS and FANS, but the operator  chooses to enable the system depending on where the aircraft is used.", "Despite their benefits, the technologies that could be used to achieve the  Task Force\u2019s baseline aircraft tracking standard in the near term do not  address all the challenges associated with locating flights. For example,  according to one major airframe manufacturer, neither ACARS nor FANS  is tamper-proof, which means that a knowledgeable individual could  disable both systems and the aircraft\u2019s transponder. Should those  systems and the transponder be turned off, the aircraft would be  incapable of sending position data. Aviation stakeholders told us that  there are legitimate engineering and operating reasons for the flight crew  to have total control over all on-board systems. According to one major  airframe manufacturer, aircraft are designed with the assumption that the  pilot and flight crew are trusted and should have complete control over  the aircraft. In certain situations, air traffic control may ask a pilot to turn  the transponder off and back on to identify an aircraft. Other stakeholders  we spoke to said that the pilot\u2019s ability to turn off any system on board the  aircraft is based first and foremost on safety considerations.  Nevertheless, at least two major international airlines have called for a  tamper-proof aircraft tracking solution.", "Should they choose to adopt the technologies described above, airlines  that currently do not meet the Task Force aircraft tracking performance  standards would face some costs. Estimates of those costs across the  fleet are difficult to determine with any precision because data on the  level of aircraft equipage were not consistently available and the contracts  between the airlines, avionics manufacturers, and air transport  communications service providers to provide such services are  proprietary. Costs to equip with ACARS using VHF radio could be up to  $100,000 per aircraft. Additionally, ACARS using satellite  communications would cost another $60,000 to $150,000 per aircraft for  Iridium or Inmarsat equipment, according to one air transport  communications service provider. However, according to the airframe  manufacturers we spoke with, most long-haul aircraft that fly in oceanic  and remote regions are already equipped with those units. For aircraft  without FANS, there would be an additional cost of up to $250,000 for a  new FANS-capable flight management system, according to one air  transport communications service provider. Costs for FLYHT Aerospace  Solution\u2019s Automated Flight Information Reporting System, a commercial  system that could, among other things, provide aircraft position data,  were approximately $70,000 per system, including installation labor per  aircraft but not the cost of data transmission, according to company  representatives.", "In order to more frequently report position information using ACARS or  FANS, airlines may have to pay for increased data transmission, but we  were unable to determine the extent of these costs to industry. According  to one air transport communications service provider, ACARS data  transmission costs per month can range from $500 per short-haul aircraft  using VHF radio systems, to approximately $1,000 per aircraft for long- haul aircraft using satellite communications over oceans. According to  one domestic airline, airlines pay for ACARS messages through plans  similar to cellular text messaging, and therefore, it is not clear whether  more frequent position reports would be covered under existing plans, or  would require new plans at a higher cost.", "To help mitigate these costs and enhance tracking capabilities in the near  term, aviation stakeholders have offered a number of proposals to  enhance flight tracking. One proposal offered by the satellite  communications provider Inmarsat would provide four free position  reports per hour using FANS ADS-C capability. To take advantage of this  proposal, aircraft would need to be equipped with FANS and Inmarsat  satellite communications. A separate proposal from SITA, a major  provider of ACARS data, aims to provide ADS-C reports to airlines.  According to SITA, the company\u2019s proposal may help improve  coordination between the airline and the air navigation service provider,  especially if there is an unexpected event onboard the aircraft. Rockwell  Collins, the other major providers of ACARS data, unveiled a flight  tracking service in March 2015 that utilizes several data sources,  including ADS-B, ADS-C, and ACARS. Over the longer term, other  aircraft surveillance systems may become available that build on FAA\u2019s  transition to NextGen. Aireon, a joint venture between four air navigation  service providers\u2014Nav Canada, ENAV (Italy) and the Irish Aviation  Authority, and Naviair (Denmark)\u2014as well as the satellite service provider  Iridium, aims to use ADS-B technology on satellites to provide a global  aircraft surveillance system. According to Aireon representatives, its  space-based ADS-B system is scheduled to be fully deployed in 2017,  although the system would not be operational until after a test and  validation phase is completed, which is currently planned for early 2018.  The real-time surveillance costs provided by this system are being  discussed with individual air navigation service providers at this time.  Aviation stakeholders we spoke to recognize the potential of this spaced- based surveillance system in terms of enhancing aircraft tracking in  oceanic and remote regions. Aireon has also announced a free service to  be offered using the space-based ADS-B system\u2014Aircraft Locating and  Emergency Response Tracking (ALERT)\u2014that would provide the last  known or current location of any aircraft equipped with ADS-B technology  to search and rescue teams in emergency situations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ICAO\u2019s Long-Term Framework for Aircraft Tracking during All Flight Phases Proposes Tamper- Proof Autonomous Distress Tracking, but Poses Several Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In parallel with the Aircraft Tracking Task Force, an ICAO-led Ad-Hoc  Working Group on Flight Tracking developed a long-term framework\u2014 called the Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS)\u2014to  ensure that accurate information about the aircraft\u2019s location is known  during the sequence of events before and after an accident. Both industry  and ICAO worked to harmonize their proposals, according to  stakeholders involved in the process, and at ICAO\u2019s High-Level Safety  Conference in February 2015, delegates from over 120 nations endorsed  the GADSS framework for aircraft tracking.

According to the Ad-Hoc Working Group, an  autonomous distress tracking system operates independently from the  regular aircraft tracking system and may be automatically or manually  activated at any time. This system could be automatically triggered by  unusual attitude, speed or acceleration, failure of the regular aircraft  tracking system or surveillance avionics, or a complete loss of engine  power. aircraft power or other systems, and be tamper-proof.", "In addition, the system would operate independently of", "Automatic deployable flight recorder: The GADSS proposal currently  calls for an automatically deployed flight recorder. This device is  designed to automatically separate from the aircraft in the event of an  accident. At the February 2015 High-Level Safety Conference, ICAO  proposed the use of deployable recorders or an alternative for data  retrieval. Additional information about deployable flight recorders is  provided later in this report.", "Procedures and information management: The final component of the  GADSS aircraft tracking framework recognizes that the effectiveness  of any search and rescue service is only as good as the weakest link  in the chain of people, procedures, systems, and information.  Therefore, in addition to the technology, the GADSS identifies key  areas of improvement, such as existing procedures, improved  coordination and information sharing, and enhanced training of  personnel in reacting to emergency circumstances.", "According to ICAO, the performance specifications for the in-flight triggering criteria and  broadcasting rate to be used are still under development.", "System Wide Information Management consists of standards, infrastructure, and  governance enabling air traffic management information and its exchange between  qualified parties via interoperable services, according to ICAO. assessment of the shortcomings in coordination and information sharing  between air navigation service providers and search and rescue  authorities is needed.

Additionally, the  NTSB has also recently issued a related recommendation. First, to help  address the challenges posed by the limited time that search and rescue  authorities have to detect the ULB signal, the BEA recommended  extending the ULB battery life from 30 to 90 days. In February 2012, the  FAA issued a Technical Standard Order (TSO) for a 90-day battery ULB  effective March 1, 2015, at which point the previous TSO for a 30-day  battery would be revoked. The FAA issued a TSO authorization to one  manufacturer in December 2014 and to another in February 2015.  However, on March 10, 2015, the FAA delayed the effective date of the  TSO until December 1, 2015, to provide a major aircraft manufacturer  additional time for testing and analysis of the device\u2019s installation.  Underwater locator beacons manufactured on or after the December 1,  2015, effective date must meet the new requirements. The FAA is not  requiring U.S. airlines to retrofit aircraft with a 90-day battery immediately.  Instead, airlines are expected to replace 30-day ULB batteries through  attrition on their normal replacement schedule of approximately every 6  years so as not to introduce additional costs associated with taking  aircraft out of service outside of regular schedules. We estimate that all  U.S. domestic aircraft should have a 90-day battery ULB installed by the  end of 2021. Related international standards will become effective by  2018.", "Second, to help search and rescue authorities locate the aircraft  wreckage underwater, the BEA recommended adding a mandatory  second underwater locating device with a greater transmission range.  The FAA issued a TSO, effective June 26, 2012, that allows  manufacturers to add a second optional device directly attached to the  airframe. This second device would emit a low-frequency acoustic signal  with a range of approximately 5 miles, which is about four times the range  of the ULBs attached to the flight recorders. This additional device is  optional for airlines and manufacturers. In January 2015, NTSB issued a  recommendation for a low-frequency device attached to the airframe that  will function for at least 90 days and that can be detected by equipment  available on military search and rescue, and salvage assets commonly  used to search for and recover wreckage.", "Stakeholders we spoke with, including airframe manufacturers, a trade  association, and an avionics manufacturer, generally agreed that  extending the ULB battery life made sense and could improve flight data  recovery for oceanic accidents at a low cost to the airlines; however,  there was no consensus on the need for a second underwater locating  device. One airframe manufacturer told us that it was taking steps to  prepare for attaching a low-frequency device to the airframe, whereas  another told us that this might not be necessary if an aircraft tracking  solution could meet the same performance of providing an aircraft\u2019s last  known location within 6 nautical miles. However, ocean currents can  move aircraft wreckage from its initial point of impact, and therefore, it is  unclear whether a tracking solution would provide the same function as a  second device.", "While both the 90-day battery ULB and the low-frequency underwater  locating device are intended to help locate the flight recorders and aircraft  wreckage in oceanic regions and potentially mitigate some costs with an  underwater sonar search, they do not address all the potential challenges  of flight recorder retrieval in remote oceanic regions. For example,  investigators must still know the general location of impact. Otherwise,  the search area would be too large, hampering the location and retrieval  of the flight data for the accident investigation despite these longer-life  and longer-range devices. The flight tracking proposals discussed  previously address this concern to a certain extent. In addition,  underwater conditions\u2014including depth, topography, and surrounding  conditions\u2014can still affect ULB performance. Range can also be reduced  if the device is covered or blocked by aircraft wreckage. Finally, locating  the signal is only one step.

Deployable  recorders, which have been used for decades on U.S. military aircraft,  including military versions of commercial aircraft, and helicopters,  combine an FDR/CVR with an emergency locator transmitter in one  crash-survivable unit. The deployable recorder is designed to separate  automatically from an external section of the tail or leading edge of the  aircraft when sensors detect an imminent crash. After separation, the  deployable recorder is designed to avoid the crash impact zone and,  when over oceanic regions, to float indefinitely. These recorders are  designed to deploy and emit alert messages even if the aircraft loses  power. The embedded emergency locator transmitter would send  Cospas-Sarsat satellites an alert every 50 seconds, including the aircraft  tail number, country of origin, location of aircraft at separation, and the  recorder\u2019s current location.", "Several aviation stakeholders\u2014including airframe manufacturers, trade  associations, and U.S. domestic airlines\u2014are divided in their support for  implementing deployable recorders on the commercial fleet. Boeing and  Airbus, for example, have publicly taken different positions. At the NTSB\u2019s  forum on flight recorder technology in October 2014, Airbus  representatives announced the company\u2019s tentative plans to install  deployable recorders on its future A350 and A380 long-haul fleets as a  second complementary system to a fixed combination FDR/CVR, though  specific timing is unknown. However, at the same forum, Boeing  representatives stated that the company had no plans to add deployable  recorders to its fleet and that the risk for unintended consequences  needed to be studied further.", "Deployable recorders would offer several potential benefits, according to  stakeholders, including the following:", "Faster and easier flight data location and retrieval: Since a  properly deployed and undamaged deployable recorder floats  indefinitely on the ocean surface and transmits an alert message  directly to Cospas-Sarsat for up to 150 hours, it may be easier for  searchers to locate and retrieve than a fixed recorder located on the  seabed. In the case of AF447, if equipped with a deployable recorder  that operated correctly, the device could have alerted searchers to its  location, and once found on the ocean\u2019s surface, investigators would  have recovered the flight data more quickly than the 2 years it took to  locate and retrieve the fixed recorders from the ocean floor. Similarly,  if MH370 had a deployable recorder which operated correctly in the  event of a crash, investigators would generally know the location at  impact and could have recovered the flight data from the ocean\u2019s  surface.", "Updated location information: The alert messages transmitted from  the recorder after deployment could help investigators pinpoint the  crash site. Additionally, satellites can track the device\u2019s drift pattern  from these messages for up to 150 hours, giving investigators  information on ocean currents that may move survivors and debris  away from the initial crash site.", "No recurring service fees: Data transmission of the emergency  locator transmitter signals from a deployable recorder would be free  because Cospas-Sarsat has no service fees.", "However, some stakeholders highlighted a number of concerns with  introducing deployable recorders into the commercial fleet:", "Safety: A range of stakeholders that we spoke to, including an  airframe manufacturer, avionics manufacturers, and faculty from an  academic institution, identified potential safety risks to the aircraft,  passengers, maintenance technicians, and others on the ground from  inadvertent deployment. According to one manufacturer, even if the  industry had met its standard failure rate of less than one incident per  10 million flight hours for civil airborne systems and equipment, there  would have been an estimated five incidents involving deployable  recorders with the 54.9 million total commercial fleet hours in 2013.  These types of incidents could potentially cause damage to both  people and property. An airframe manufacturer and an avionics  manufacturer told us that the system would need to be designed to  ensure the safety of those on the ground and in the air, especially  given the infrequency of aviation accidents in which a deployable  recorder would be useful.", "Infrequency of accidents and success of fixed recorder recovery:  One avionics manufacturer and two U.S. domestic airlines that we  spoke with questioned the need for deployable recorders given the  safety concerns discussed above and the infrequency of aviation  accidents. Additionally, when accidents do occur, investigators  typically locate and recover the flight data even for accidents  occurring over water. Investigators located and recovered the flight  recorders in 15 of the 16 commercial accidents, approximately 94  percent of cases that occurred over water since 2000.", "Mixed recovery record in military aircraft: According to one  stakeholder, flight data recovery rates are actually better on fixed  FDRs compared to deployable recorders based on experience with  one military aircraft model. For instance, according to industry data of  a certain military aircraft that we reviewed from 2004 through 2014,  there was a 100 percent flight data recovery for fixed recorders  compared to 75 percent with deployable recorders. The causes of  those failures included instances in which the recorder did not deploy,  was not located, or did not have data on the memory card.", "Does not mitigate the need to recover the aircraft wreckage and  fuselage, or human remains: While the flight recorders are an  important part of the accident investigation, investigators still want to  recover the aircraft wreckage and fuselage to help determine the  cause of the accident. Therefore, there would still be costs for an  underwater search and recovery even if investigators had the  deployable recorder.", "Hardware costs: Deployable recorders would require adding more  equipment on the commercial fleet and, according to the FAA and two  avionics manufacturers, would result in additional costs to airlines.  The estimated cost is $50,000\u2014$60,000 per unit, according to an  avionics manufacturer. We found that the total cost of equipage could  be as much as $29 million, and any additional costs associated with  certifying each aircraft type model, if this cost per unit were incurred  for the current total U.S. long-haul transoceanic fleet. However, for  several reasons it is difficult to extrapolate the per-unit cost estimate  to obtain a cost estimate for the total fleet. First, costs could vary  based on the type of aircraft, the regulatory environment, and other  engineering factors, so when widely deployed these factors may affect  the costs for varied contexts. Additionally, if a technology becomes  mandated or, even if voluntary, becomes widely adopted, unit costs  might decline due to the efficiencies of mass production and also  possibly due to a greater number of providers entering the market.", "Given the safety concerns, costs of equipage, and the uncertain benefits  associated with deployable recorders, certain stakeholders, including one  airframe manufacturer, one trade association, and one avionics  manufacturer, suggested additional study is needed on the use of  deployable recorders in commercial aircraft. Additionally, several  stakeholders raised concerns about prescribing a specific technology\u2014in  this case automatic deployable flight recorders\u2014as opposed to a  performance-based approach when implementing or enhancing flight data  recovery capabilities, which is the preferred approach of both FAA and  the airline industry. Several stakeholders told us that industry needs the  flexibility of performance standards over prescriptive solutions due to the  diversity of the fleet and to allow for technological advances. FAA officials  described their position on deployable recorders as fluid and told us that  they did not have plans to mandate a deployable recorder, but also would  not prevent an operator from installing one provided the operator  adequately demonstrated an acceptable level of safety and  performance. In the GADSS framework, ICAO identifies the need to  develop performance-based standards for deployable recorders.

NTSB\u2019s approach, if adopted by FAA, allows airlines  to choose a solution that fits best with their operations.

The cost of the FLYHT\u2019s  Automated Flight Information Reporting System described above is  estimated at $70,000 per unit for parts and installation, according to  the manufacturer. Assuming that as an average cost, we found that  the total cost for the current U.S. long-haul transoceanic fleet could  approach $35 million. As noted above, however, extrapolating the  current per-unit cost estimate to estimate the cost for the entire fleet  has certain limitations. Furthermore, it would cost between $5\u2014$10  per minute for data streaming during emergencies, according to the  manufacturer.", "The FAA and other stakeholders told us that most aircraft could gather  similar data using existing systems, so adding additional equipment to  gather and transmit such information may not have an operational benefit  for airlines. Representatives from one U.S. domestic airline that we spoke  with told us that they did not see the need to equip their fleet with a new  device since their system for monitoring aircraft performance could  provide engine information through ACARS. Similarly, one airframe  manufacturer representative told us that ACARS has helped provide  information for accident investigations before FDR recovery. As noted  above, ACARS, which is equipped on all new aircraft, can be  programmed to transmit some aircraft operations data, including position  information, when certain triggers are met."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ICAO and NTSB Have Endorsed Cockpit Recorder Enhancements to Aid Accident Investigations, Though Privacy Issues Are Unresolved", "paragraphs": ["ICAO announced support for extending the duration of the audio captured  by the CVR, and NTSB has reiterated its recommendation for installing a  cockpit image recorder.

According to a representative from one avionics  manufacturer, 2 hours is insufficient and voice recordings should cover  the full duration of the flight like the FDR. Several manufacturers that we  spoke with stated that they could make CVRs with additional recording  time.

Numerous technologies\u2014including  communications systems onboard most commercial aircraft today, flight  recorders that deploy from aircraft, devices capable of streaming flight  recorder data in real time, and global satellite surveillance systems under  development\u2014have the potential to enhance aircraft tracking and  expedite flight data recovery in the event of an oceanic accident, and  industry continues to develop solutions for these tasks. However, some  industry stakeholders we spoke with cited concerns about these  technologies, such as the cost to equip the fleet and safety implications.  Additionally, as AF447 and MH370 make clear, global air traffic control\u2019s  preparedness and capability to effectively monitor oceanic flights and  provide timely alerts in exceptional situations are important elements in  the debate. At the international level, ICAO is finalizing its Global  Aeronautical Distress and Safety System based on input from the 2015  High-Level Safety Conference, with formal adoption targeted for 2016.  These developments may represent the foundation for a comprehensive,  global approach to ensure that the location of an aircraft during all phases  of its flight is known to authorities. However, stakeholders expressed  concerns that international standards could prescribe adoption of certain  solutions, such as deployable recorders. They preferred a performance- based approach that encourages voluntary adoption because of the  flexibility such an approach affords industry in an era of rapidly evolving  technology. Additionally, the safety record in the National Airspace  System may make it difficult to demonstrate that the benefits of new  equipage on U.S. airlines outweigh the costs as part of a regulatory  analysis. Given the scope of the international processes that are  underway, we are not making any recommendations to FAA or NTSB  related to aircraft tracking or flight data recovery at this time. Ultimately,  we believe it is important for FAA to remain active through the ICAO  process to ensure that any new international standard for aircraft tracking  and flight data recovery is consistent with a performance-based approach  and is implemented in a globally harmonized manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOT and NTSB for review and  comment.

As we reported in 2010,  federal agencies and aviation industry stakeholders gather and analyze  aviation data for a variety of purposes. Federal agencies, including the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation  Safety Board (NTSB), gather and analyze aviation data primarily to  improve safety. In addition, as we reported in 2010, the aviation industry  gathers quantitative and narrative data on the performance of flights and  analyzes these data to increase safety, efficiency, and profitability.  Aviation industry stakeholders are required to report some data to FAA\u2014 such as data on accidents, engine failures, and near midair collisions\u2014 and they have agreements with FAA and other agencies to share other  data voluntarily.", "For decades, the aviation industry and federal regulators, including FAA,  have used data reactively to identify the causes of aviation accidents and  incidents. In recent years, FAA has shifted to a more proactive approach  to using data to manage aviation safety risk. The FAA continues to use  data to analyze past accidents and incidents, and is also using data  proactively to search for risks and address potential concerns in the  National Airspace System (NAS) before accidents occur or to improve  NAS efficiency. According to FAA officials, there is more safety data than  ever before, and these data provide the agency with the opportunity to be  more proactive about safety. FAA also recognizes that today\u2019s aviation  safety, information-sharing environment is not adequate to meet the next  generation needs of the NAS. According to FAA, capabilities need to be  developed that can continuously extract operationally significant, safety- related information from large and diverse data sources; identify  anomalous events or trends; and fuse relevant information from all  available sources.", "The FAA and the aviation industry have sought additional means for  addressing safety problems and identifying potential safety hazards. The  FAA has developed a number of programs to encourage the voluntary  sharing and industry-wide analysis of operational flight data. In addition to  enabling a more proactive approach to addressing safety concerns in the  NAS, according to FAA, these programs could potentially enable it to  predict the situations under which accidents could occur and take actions  to help prevent them before occurring.", "Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA): FOQA is a voluntary  safety program designed to improve aviation safety through the  proactive use of recorded flight data. Operators use these data to  identify and correct deficiencies in all areas of flight operations,  according to FAA. FAA officials told us that if properly used, FOQA  data can reduce or eliminate safety risks, as well as minimize  deviations from regulations. Through access to de-identified  aggregate FOQA data, FAA can identify and analyze national trends  and target resources to reduce operational risks in the NAS, air traffic  control, flight operations, and airport operations, according to FAA.  The value of FOQA programs, according to FAA, is the early  identification of adverse trends, which, if uncorrected, could lead to  accidents.", "FOQA is a program for the routine collection and analysis of flight  data generated during aircraft operations. FOQA programs provide  more information about, and greater insight into, the total flight  operations environment. FOQA data are unique because they can  provide objective information that is not available through other  methods, according to FAA. FAA officials told us that a FOQA  program can identify operational situations in which there is increased  risk, allowing the airline to take early corrective action before that risk  results in an incident or accident. For example, according to  representatives from one airline, FOQA analysis and findings are  incorporated into flight crew training as well as airline policies and  procedures. The FOQA program is another tool in the airlines\u2019 overall  operational risk assessment and prevention programs. As such,  according to the FAA, it must be coordinated with the airlines\u2019 other  safety programs, such as the Aviation Safety Action Program and pilot  reporting systems, among others.", "Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS): FAA  and the aviation community have initiated a safety analysis and data  sharing collaboration to proactively analyze broad and extensive data  to advance aviation safety, according to FAA. The initiative, known as  ASIAS, leverages internal FAA data, airline proprietary safety data,  publicly available data, manufacturers\u2019 data, and other data. FAA  officials told us that the airline safety data are safeguarded by the  MITRE Corporation, a federally funded research and development  center, in a de-identified manner to foster broad participation and  engagement. According to FAA, ASIAS fuses various aviation data  sources in order to proactively identify safety trends and assess the  impact of changes in the aviation operating environment.", "ASIAS resources include both public and non-public aviation data.  Public data sources include, but are not limited to, air traffic  management data related to procedures, traffic, and weather. Non- public sources include de-identified data from air traffic controllers and  aircraft operators, including recorded flight data and safety reports  submitted by flight crews and maintenance personnel. According to  FAA, governance agreements with participating airlines and owners of  specific databases provide ASIAS analysts with access to safety data.  Governed by a broad set of agreements, ASIAS has the ability to  query millions of flight records and de-identified reports via a secure  communications network, according to FAA.", "Under the direction of the ASIAS Executive Board, which includes  representatives from government and industry, ASIAS conducts  studies, safety assessments, risk monitoring, and vulnerability  discovery. In the interest of enhancing aviation safety, the results of  these analyses are shared with the ASIAS participants, according to  FAA. ASIAS has also established key safety benchmarks so that  individual airlines may assess their own safety performance against  the industry as a whole. According to aviation industry stakeholders  we spoke with, the key benefit of participating in this program for the  airlines is the opportunity to benchmark their individual performance  against the aggregate performance of the industry. Furthermore,  according to FAA, ASIAS serves as a central conduit for the exchange  of data and analytical capabilities among program participants. The  ASIAS vision is a network of at least 50 domestic and international  airlines over the next few years, making it the only such center of its  kind in the world.", "System Safety Management Transformation (SSMT): This FAA  effort, which uses ASIAS and other data, seeks to move FAA from a  post-hoc, reactive assessment of aviation safety to a more predictive,  risk-assessment process. According to FAA, the SSMT project is  developing data analysis and modeling capabilities that will enable  FAA analysts to both determine how NextGen-related operational  improvements will affect safety and evaluate potential risk mitigation  strategies. One of the safety analysis methodologies the SSMT team  is developing is called the Integrated Safety Assessment Model. The  goal of this model is to 1) provide a risk baseline against which to  measure future system changes and 2) forecast the risk and safety  impacts of implementing changes to the NAS, including FAA\u2019s  NextGen initiative. According to FAA, the model has been published,  but continues to evolve and efforts are currently under way to refine  and update its various components. The model is available as a web- based platform accessible through a user login account. According to  FAA, the goal of this work is to describe in a standard format the  causes and consequences of aviation accidents since 1996 as well as  to describe the precursor events that contributed to these accidents.  Using event sequence diagrams, FAA can describe the sequence of  events led to an accident. According to FAA, current results indicate  positive trends in overall impact as a means to analyze and assess  baseline risks as well as emerging risks.", "Airlines and airframe manufacturers also use flight data, but primarily to  improve the efficiency of operations and increase profitability. As  described above, domestic airlines use data collected through FOQA  programs to enhance operations and proactively address maintenance  issues. Airlines also use data provided through the Aircraft  Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), a  communications system that transmits short text messages via radio or  satellite, to monitor aircraft and engine performance. According to  representatives from one airline we spoke with, these data can show  when certain systems and equipment need repair, and help the airline to  schedule repairs in order to keep the plane in service. Another airline  attributed their very low in-flight engine failure rate, in part, to proactive  analysis of airplane health data. Aviation stakeholders said that this type  of analysis can help identify the precursors to engine failure and help the  airline address problems before the entire aircraft has to be taken out of  service.", "Finally, airframe manufacturers, such as Airbus and Boeing, have also  developed airplane health management programs, which are offered as a  service to the airlines. According to Boeing, Airplane Health Management  gives airlines the ability to monitor airplane systems and parts and to  interactively troubleshoot issues while the plane is in flight. Data collected  through these types of programs are captured in flight and transmitted in  real time to the airline\u2019s ground operations. Airbus representatives told us  that their program is also designed to collect information from various  aircraft systems and determine probabilities and likelihood of equipment  failure. According to Boeing, airlines can use this service to make  maintenance decisions before the plane has landed and be ready for any  needed repairs as soon as the airplane arrives at the gate. This  information is used by airlines to support operational decisions to \u201cfix-or- fly,\u201d which result in reduced schedule interruptions and increased  maintenance and operational efficiency, according to Boeing. Boeing\u2019s  Airplane Health Management was first introduced with the 747 and 777  aircraft models, but it has been thoroughly embedded in the design of the  787 model. To support the Airplane Health Management service for the  787, Boeing has a control center where each plane is tracked and its  systems are monitored. Similarly, Airbus representatives said their  airplane health management program supports the most recent aircraft  models."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: List of Commercial Aviation Accidents and Recovery over Water from 2000\u20142015", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "No. 1", "paragraphs": ["Airbus A320  Karimata Strait,  Java Sea (off the  coast of Pangkalan  Bun, Indonesia)", "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370   Boeing B777  Southern Indian  Ocean west of  Australia  (Presumed)", "Ethiopian Airlines Flight 409  Boeing B737  Mediterranean Sea  (Beirut, Lebanon)", "Airbus A310  Moroni, Comoros  Islands (off the  coast of West  Africa)", "Airbus A320  New York, USA  (Hudson River)", "Off the coast of  Moorea, French  Polynesia  Boeing B737  Makassar Strait (off  the coast of  Sulawesi,  Indonesia)", "Airbus A320  Black Sea (off the  coast of Sochi,  Russia)", "Off the coast of  Palermo, Italy  Boeing B747  Taiwan Strait  (northeast of  Makung, Penghu  Islands)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No. 15", "paragraphs": ["Pacific Ocean (north  of Anacapa Island,  California)", "Airbus A310  Abidjan (Off the  Ivory Coast, West  Africa)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following individuals made  important contributions to this report: Andrew Von Ah, Assistant Director;  Amy Abramowitz; Nabajyoti Barkakati; Jonathan Carver; Leia Dickerson;  Chris Falcone; Geoff Hamilton; Bert Japikse; Delwen Jones; Josh  Ormond; Madhav Panwar; Justin Reed and Elizabeth Wood."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
