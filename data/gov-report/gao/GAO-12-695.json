This progress has been the result of hard work throughout IRS and sustained commitment at the top levels of the agency. However, IRS still faces significant financial management challenges in (1) resolving its remaining material weaknesses and significant deficiency in internal control, (2) developing outcome-oriented performance metrics, and (3) correcting numerous other control deficiencies, especially those relating to safeguarding tax receipts and taxpayer information. At the beginning of GAO\u0092s audit of IRS\u0092s fiscal year 2011 financial statements, 77 recommendations from prior audits remained open because IRS had not fully addressed the underlying issues. During the fiscal year 2011 financial audit, IRS took actions that GAO considered sufficient to close 38 recommendations. At the same time, GAO identified additional control deficiencies resulting in 30 new recommendations. In total, 69 recommendations remain open. GAO has also identified numerous control deficiencies and made recommendations related to information security that have been reported separately and are not included in this report because of the sensitive nature of many of those control deficiencies.", "To assist IRS in evaluating and improving internal controls, GAO categorized the 69 open recommendations by various internal control activities, which, in turn, were grouped into three broad control categories. The continued existence of control deficiencies that gave rise to these recommendations represents a serious challenge for IRS.

At the same time, IRS  continues to face significant financial management challenges in  achieving the overarching goals of effective federal financial  management\u2014accountability and useful management information. To  achieve its goals of effective financial and operational management, IRS  needs to (1) address its remaining material weaknesses and its significant  deficiency in internal control, (2) fully integrate cost- and revenue-based  outcome-oriented decision making into its tax collection enforcement  operations, and (3) implement corrective actions to address other  identified control deficiencies.", "An agency\u2019s internal control serves as the first line of defense in  safeguarding its assets and in preventing and detecting errors and fraud,  as well as in helping to effectively manage its stewardship over public  resources.

During our audit of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2011 financial statements, we found  that IRS continued to be challenged with two long-standing material  weaknesses in internal control that are at the heart of its operations\u2014 weaknesses in internal controls over unpaid tax assessments (unpaid  assessments) and over information systems security. We also found that  IRS continued to have a significant deficiency in internal control over the  processing of manually prepared tax refunds and claims for the First-time  Homebuyer Credit (FTHBC) that led to erroneous refund disbursements.

Internal control in this important area should be designed to provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or prompt detection of  unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of an agency\u2019s assets.

Examples include security for  and limited access to assets such as cash, securities, inventories, and  equipment which might be vulnerable to risk of loss or unauthorized  use. Such assets should be periodically counted and compared to  control records.", "Of the trillions of dollars in taxes that IRS collects each year, hundreds of  billions is collected in the form of checks and cash accompanied by tax  returns and related information. IRS collects taxes both at its own  facilities as well as at lockbox banks. IRS acts as custodian for (1) tax  payments it receives until they are deposited in the General Fund of the  U.S. Treasury and (2) tax returns and related information it receives until  they are either sent to the Federal Records Center or destroyed. IRS is  also charged with controlling many other assets, such as computers and  other equipment. IRS\u2019s legal responsibility to safeguard tax returns and  the confidential information taxpayers provide on those returns makes the  effectiveness of IRS\u2019s internal controls over physical security essential to  accomplishing its mission.", "While effective physical safeguards over receipts should exist throughout  the year, such safeguards are especially important during the peak tax  filing season. Each year during the weeks preceding and shortly after   April 15, an IRS service center or lockbox bank may receive and process daily over 100,000 pieces of mail containing returns, receipts, or  both. The dollar value of receipts each service center and lockbox bank  processes increases to hundreds of millions of dollars a day during this  time frame.", "The following 13 open recommendations in table 2 are designed to  improve IRS\u2019s physical controls over vulnerable assets. They include  recommendations for IRS to improve controls over physical security at its  Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TAC) and courier activities. We consider  all of these recommendations to be correctable in the short term.", "Internal control standard: Key duties and responsibilities need to be  divided or segregated among different people to reduce the risk of error  or fraud. This should include separating the responsibilities for  authorizing transactions, processing and recording them, reviewing the  transactions, and handling any related assets. No one individual should  control all key aspects of a transaction or event.", "As discussed previously, IRS employees process hundreds of billions of  dollars in tax receipts in the form of cash and checks. Consequently, it is  critical that IRS maintain appropriate separation of duties so that no single  individual would be in a position of causing an error or irregularity, or  potentially converting the asset to personal use, and then concealing it.  For example, when an IRS field office receives taxpayer receipts and  returns, it is responsible for depositing the cash and checks in a  depository institution and forwarding the related taxpayer information  received for further processing, including updating the taxpayer\u2019s tax  account records. In order to adequately safeguard receipts from theft, the  person responsible for recording the information from the taxpayer  receipts on a voucher should not also update the taxpayer\u2019s tax records.", "Implementing the following recommendation in table 3 would help IRS  improve its separation of duties, which will in turn strengthen controls over  tax receipts. This recommendation is correctible in the short-term.", "Internal control standard: Access to resources and records should be  limited to authorized individuals, and accountability for their custody  and use should be assigned and maintained. Periodic comparison of  resources with the recorded accountability should be made to help  reduce the risk of errors, fraud, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.", "Because IRS is responsible for maintaining accountability over a large  volume of cash and checks, it is imperative that it maintain strong controls  to appropriately restrict access to those assets, the records relied on to  track those assets, and sensitive taxpayer information. Our financial  audits over the years have identified control deficiencies related to   (1) individuals having direct access to cash and checks receiving  appropriate background investigations before being granted access to  taxpayer receipts and information and (2) maintaining effective access  security control. The following four short term recommendations in table 4  are intended to help IRS improve its access restrictions to assets and  records.", "IRS has a number of control deficiencies related to recording  transactions, documenting events, and tracking the processing of  taxpayer receipts or information. IRS has outstanding recommendations  in the following three control activities related to proper recording and  documenting of transactions: (1) appropriate documentation of  transactions and internal controls, (2) accurate and timely recording of  transactions and events, and (3) proper execution of transactions and  events.", "Internal control standard: Internal control and all transactions and other  significant events need to be clearly documented, and the  documentation should be readily available for examination. The  documentation should appear in management directives, administrative  policies, or operating manuals and may be in paper or electronic form.  All documentation and records should be properly managed and  maintained.", "IRS collects and processes trillions of dollars in taxpayer receipts  annually both at its own facilities and at lockbox banks under contract to  process taxpayer receipts for the federal government. Therefore, it is  important that IRS maintain effective controls to ensure that all  documents and records are properly and timely recorded, managed, and  maintained both at its facilities and at the lockbox banks. In this regard, it  is critical that IRS adequately document and disseminate its procedures  to ensure that they are available for IRS employees. IRS must also  document its management reviews of controls, such as those regarding  refunds and returned checks, document transmittals, and reviews of  Taxpayers Assistance Center (TAC) operations. To ensure future  availability of adequate documentation, IRS must ensure that (1) its  systems, particularly those now being developed and implemented, have  appropriate capability to identify and trace individual transactions and (2)  all critical steps in its accounting processes are adequately documented.
