In 2006, GAO found weaknesses in program oversight that increased the risk of grantees' improperly using grant funds and failing to comply with U.S. laws. In 2008, misuse of grant funds at organizations with the program's two largest grants was detected. GAO was asked to examine (1) actions that USAID has taken since 2006, or plans to take, to improve its award and oversight of the Cuba Program's grants and (2) actions that USAID has taken in response to the recently detected misuses of grant funds. GAO analyzed USAID and grantee records, conducted limited reviews at five grantees, and interviewed agency and grantee officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2006, USAID has taken a number of steps to address identified problems with the Cuba Program's awards of democracy assistance and improve oversight of the assistance. For example, USAID has competitively awarded all Cuba Program grants since 2006, compared with 5 percent of grants awarded in 1995-2006; has hired more staff for the program office since January 2008; and contracted in April 2008 for financial services--such as reviews of grantee internal controls and procurement systems--to enhance oversight of grantees. USAID also has worked to strengthen program oversight by, for instance, ensuring preaward and follow-up reviews, improving grantee internal controls and implementation plans, and providing guidance and monitoring about permitted types of assistance and cost sharing. However, USAID has not staffed the Cuba Program at the level the agency has determined is needed for appropriate oversight; as of October 2008, the program office had five staff, compared with the 11 recommended in two USAID assessments. Further, because many of USAID's actions to improve oversight were initiated recently, their impact on the risk of the program grantees misusing grant funds or failing to comply with U.S. laws and regulations is not yet evident. In June 2008, for example, USAID's new financial services contractor found unsupported purchases at the organization with the program's largest grant. In response to the misuse of funds at organizations with the two largest Cuba Program grants, USAID suspended the two grantees in March and July 2008, respectively, pending the results of criminal investigations. To detect financial vulnerabilities at other grantees, USAID announced in mid-July 2008 that it would accelerate planned reviews of program grantees' procurement systems and initiate audits of their incurred cost, and it partially suspended two additional grantees pending the results of the procurement reviews. The program's other grants remained active pending the results of these reviews and audits. The procurement reviews--completed in August 2008 by the new financial services contractor--identified internal control, financial management, and procurement weaknesses at three grantees; USAID is working with the grantees to correct these weaknesses. The USAID Inspector General will oversee the incurred cost audits, which USAID expects to be completed by November 2008 under a separate contract with another firm."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Working through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)  and the Department of State (State), the U.S. government provides  assistance intended to support human rights and to promote nonviolent  democratic change in Cuba through the development of Cuba\u2019s civil  society.

The  responsibilities of the Cuba Program office include cochairing an  interagency working group, developing assistance strategies and  programs, recommending Cuba democracy assistance awards, and  monitoring the implementation of USAID grants. Because of the absence  of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, USAID does  not have staff in Cuba and its Washington-based staff have been unable to  obtain visas to visit the island since 2002.

USAID\u2019s Cuba Program relied on unsolicited proposals to award  about 95 percent (about $62 million) of its democracy assistance, although  agency policy generally encourages competition for such awards. USAID\u2019s  Cuba Program also frequently modified the amounts and length of existing  grants, increasing the aggregate value of these initial agreements from  about $6 million to about $50 million.

Weaknesses in USAID\u2019s oversight of its assistance grants  during the preaward, award, implementation, and closeout phases  increased the risk of grantees\u2019 improper use of grant funds and  noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. Preaward audits of  some grantees were not always completed before grant award, and USAID  did not follow up adequately to correct deficiencies identified by these  audits. Standardized language in grant agreements lacked the detail  necessary to support program accountability and the correction of grantee  deficiencies identified during preaward reviews. Moreover, the Cuba  Program office did not adequately identify, prioritize, or manage at-risk  grantees and did not have critical review or oversight procedures in place  to monitor grantee activities or cost sharing. Additionally, USAID did not  appear to routinely follow prescribed closeout processes to identify and  recover inappropriate expenditures or unexpended funds. Our limited  review of 10 grantees\u2019 financial records identified questionable  expenditures and significant internal control weaknesses, which USAID  had not detected, at 3 of the grantees; we referred these problems to the  USAID Office of Inspector General.", "Figure 2 shows our 2006 recommendations to strengthen USAID\u2019s  oversight of the Cuba Program\u2019s democracy grants.

Since January 2007, the Cuba  Program, working though the Cuba project and internal management  committees, has worked to provide sufficient lead time for preaward  reviews and tracked the resolution of preaward review issues. In March  2007, USAID\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Assistance issued an agencywide  bulletin that stressed the importance of (1) providing sufficient lead time  for the completion of preaward reviews and (2) timely follow-up and  resolution of deficiencies identified in those reviews. In 2007, USAID also  developed revised grant agreement language linking resolution of issues  and findings of preaward reviews and follow-up reviews to the obligation  of incremental grantee funding; to date, this language has been used in  grant agreements as appropriate. According to the Chief of the Contract  Audit Management Division within USAID\u2019s Office of Acquisition and  Assistance, the Cuba Program\u2019s planned use of the new financial review  services contract will help ensure timely follow-up on the results of  preaward reviews.

The cost-share policy is reflected in Cuba democracy  grant agreements. In January 2007, the Cuba project committee  recommended that the Cuba Program obtain detailed cost-share  records from grantees and submit these records to the Office of  Acquisition and Assistance for review. As of mid-June 2008, USAID had  completed its review of the cost-share records for all nine then-current  grantees with cost-share obligations and had found that three grantees  had not met a substantial share of their cost-share obligations. USAID  reduced one grantee\u2019s cost-share obligation from $1,065,860 to  $523,450 and was following up with the other two grantees regarding  their failure to meet their cost-share obligations.

USAID is assessing whether to lift the other partial suspension based on  grantee corrective actions, a change in grantee management, and other  factors. GAD, the third grantee where the review found weaknesses,  remains suspended. As of October 2008, the acceleration of the  procurement reviews had used nearly half (about $450,000) of the $1  million set aside for the 2-year financial services contract signed in April.  Further, USAID had not committed the additional funds needed to  continue the planned reviews of grantees\u2019 internal controls, procurement  practices, and expenditures\u2014key elements of the program\u2019s approach to  reducing grantee risks\u2014over the contract\u2019s remaining 18 months.", "Audits of grantees\u2019 incurred cost. The USAID Inspector General will  oversee the audits of grantees\u2019 incurred cost, to be conducted under a  separate contract with another firm. Initial work on the first three of these  audits began in mid-September 2008; the Inspector General expects to  complete nine audits by November 2008. USAID officials said that they  would take steps, as appropriate, to address weaknesses identified by  these audits.

However, some  planned actions have not yet been implemented. As recommended in our  November 2006 report, USAID took steps to improve the timeliness of  preaward reviews and resolve issues identified during those reviews and  has provided more specific guidance on permitted types of humanitarian  assistance and cost sharing. To provide resources and expertise, USAID  also contracted with a financial review services firm to follow up on audit  findings; review grantees\u2019 internal controls, procurement practices,  expenditures, and cost sharing; and provide grantees needed technical  assistance. In addition, the Cuba Program now requires grantees to  develop implementation plans and has developed a structured approach to  monitoring grantees. However, staffing of the program office has not  reached the level USAID determined is needed for effective grant oversight  and, as a result, the office has taken only preliminary steps to implement a  key part of its risk management approach\u2014that is, to systematically  analyze site visit and other grantee data to identify at-risk grantees and  prioritize its monitoring.", "Moreover, the impact of USAID\u2019s actions to improve the Cuba Program\u2019s  risk management on grantee risk is uncertain because most of the actions  were taken recently. This uncertainty is underscored by the recent  findings\u2014similar to those we reported in 2006\u2014of grantees\u2019 misusing  funds and of weaknesses in grantees\u2019 internal control, financial  management, and procurement systems that have not yet been resolved.

USAID also concurred  with our recommendation to periodically assess the Cuba Program\u2019s  overall efforts to address and reduce grantee risk. The agency said that the  Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean would take specific steps to  assess the risks associated with the Cuba Program\u2019s grantee pool in its  ongoing risk assessment work.

We reviewed and analyzed USAID budget, staffing, and  procurement records. With regard to staffing, for example, we analyzed  agency staffing assessments and related records; with regard to USAID  Cuba Program awards and modifications, we analyzed agency grant  documents and related records. We verified our analysis of these records  with agency officials. In June 2008, we observed two quarterly grantee  monitoring visits and one orientation visit to a grantee with a new award  conducted by Cuba Program office staff. In addition, we conducted limited  follow-up reviews of financial and other records at 5 of the 10 grantees  that we had analyzed in our November 2006 report. In conducting these  follow-up reviews, we employed the same methodology that we had used  for our 2006 report. We also reviewed audit reports issued by the State  and USAID Inspectors General in July and September 2007, respectively.  We interviewed agency officials, including the current and former Cuba  Program Directors, contracting officials, and auditors, about the actions  taken in response to our report and actions taken in response to reported  misuse of grant funds at two grantees. Additionally, we interviewed  officials from the DMP Group, to which USAID awarded a contract in April  2008 to conduct a range of financial reviews of its Cuba Program grantees,  and we reviewed DMP\u2019s work papers and draft and final reports.
