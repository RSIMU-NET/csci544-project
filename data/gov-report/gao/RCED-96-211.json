In the 1970s, these producers recognized that using fuels derived from hazardous waste to supplement the coal, oil, and natural gas that they typically burn to make cement could substantially reduce their fuel costs. The producers can reduce their costs because, instead of paying suppliers for traditional fuels, they are themselves paid by fuel blenders to burn hazardous waste fuels. Fuel blending facilities process many types of hazardous waste\u2014such as paints, solvents, and used oil\u2014into fuels that can be burned in cement kilns, which are regulated as a type of industrial furnace. The facilities that blend hazardous waste into fuels and the cement production facilities that burn these fuels are both governed by regulations established under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), which is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and certain states.", "You expressed concerns about whether the facilities that blend hazardous waste fuels and the cement production facilities that burn these fuels are operating in a manner that protects human health and the environment. Therefore, as agreed with your offices, we are providing you with information on the results of recent inspections of these facilities in five states\u2014Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. These inspections assessed the facilities\u2019 compliance with RCRA\u2019s (1) treatment, storage, and disposal regulations for the processing of hazardous waste fuels by fuel blenders and (2) boiler and industrial furnace regulations for the burning of these fuels by cement producers. Specifically, we focused on the results of the states\u2019 recent inspections of the 34 facilities that blend fuels and EPA\u2019s and the states\u2019 inspections of the 11 cement production facilities that burn hazardous waste fuels in these five states.", "Under RCRA, both of these sets of regulations must ensure the protection of human health and the environment. To verify that fuel blenders and cement producers are complying with the regulations, state and EPA hazardous waste management officials are required to conduct periodic inspections. If an inspection identifies a violation at a facility, EPA or the state can take a number of actions to bring the facility back into compliance with RCRA\u2019s regulations, including working with the facility\u2019s operator to resolve the problem and imposing a fine. When an inspector believes that a violation poses an imminent threat to human health or the environment, the inspector can initiate an action that will shut down any waste management activity at the facility."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["RCRA requires EPA to establish regulations governing the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal of hazardous waste. Facilities that blend fuels derived from hazardous waste are subject to RCRA\u2019s treatment, storage, and disposal regulations. Furthermore, because EPA classifies cement production facilities as industrial furnaces, such facilities that burn hazardous waste fuels must comply with special regulations\u2014known as the boiler and industrial furnace rule\u2014developed under RCRA in 1991 to regulate the combustion of hazardous waste. Both sets of regulations require facilities to meet standards for emissions and other environmental requirements. The principal regulations applying to the fuel blending and cement production facilities that burn hazardous waste fuels are discussed in greater detail in appendixes I and II, respectively.", "EPA is primarily responsible for inspecting hazardous waste management facilities and taking enforcement actions as necessary against the owners and operators of facilities that are not complying with RCRA\u2019s requirements. Under RCRA, however, EPA may authorize a state to administer its own hazardous waste program if its program is consistent with the federal program established by EPA and other authorized state programs. An authorized state assumes the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing RCRA\u2019s hazardous waste regulations while EPA oversees the state\u2019s activities.", "EPA has authorized the five states included in our review to implement their own treatment, storage, and disposal program in lieu of the federal RCRA program, but it has authorized only one of the five states\u2014Texas\u2014to implement the boiler and industrial furnace program. RCRA requires that hazardous waste management facilities requiring a permit, including fuel blenders and cement production facilities burning hazardous waste fuels, be inspected periodically. In conducting their inspections, EPA and the five authorized states do not classify violations as minor or significant. However, these officials told us that, generally, they consider a violation to be minor if it does not pose a serious threat to human health or the environment and the facility agrees to correct it promptly. An action or deficiency that poses a serious threat to human health or the environment or a persistent minor violation is considered to be significant.", "Although RCRA\u2019s regulations establish general operating practices and procedures with which fuel blending facilities must comply, they place few restrictions on the types of hazardous waste that can be blended. According to EPA officials, facilities can blend wastes that are not reactive providing safety standards are met. In addition, some states prohibit the blending of certain wastes, such as those containing pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) into fuel. Beyond these restrictions, the specifications for the hazardous wastes that are blended into fuels are primarily determined by the cement producers, whose operations must meet the regulations\u2019 standards for emissions and other requirements. RCRA\u2019s boiler and industrial furnace rule places limits on cement kilns\u2019 emissions. These limits are implemented by restricting the types of hazardous waste that are blended into fuels. Cement producers can burn only waste blends that allow them to meet the established limits on the amounts of regulated constituents\u2014such as metals\u2014that can be fed into the kiln. Furthermore, EPA does not permit the burning of certain inorganic hazardous wastes that contain metals and have a low heating value. In addition, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, a cement producer must obtain EPA\u2019s approval to burn fuel containing PCBs.", "As of early 1996, nationwide 142 fuel blenders were processing fuels derived from hazardous waste and 22 cement production facilities were burning such fuels in their kilns.

The significant violations included having waste containers in poor condition, storing waste that was not approved under the facility\u2019s operating permit, and having inadequate backup systems for containing leaks of hazardous waste. According to hazardous waste management officials in these states, some violations, which would normally be considered minor, would be classified as significant because they either recurred at the same facility or had not been corrected since the previous inspection.

The standards for facilities operating in interim statusconsist primarily of practices that owners and operators must follow to properly manage hazardous waste before they obtain an operating permit. The interim status standards include general administrative and nontechnical requirements for securing a site, training personnel, ensuring construction quality, testing and maintaining equipment, and keeping records. In addition, the interim status standards include certain technical requirements that are intended to minimize the potential for threats to the environment and public health. These technical requirements include general standards that apply to several types of facilities, including those for (1) monitoring groundwater, (2) closing a facility and managing the site after the facility is closed, and (3) providing financial assurance. The requirements also include specific standards that apply to each waste management method, including requirements for waste analysis, monitoring and inspection and general operating requirements.", "The standards for facilities with an operating permit consist of performance standards and design and operating criteria that are included in the permit for each facility. These standards include administrative and nontechnical requirements. In addition, facilities with a permit must comply with detailed technical requirements. Each permit must include conditions that are necessary for the facility to comply with RCRA and its regulations. The facility\u2019s compliance with RCRA is measured against the conditions included in the permit. The permit may incorporate these requirements by referring to RCRA and EPA\u2019s implementing regulations, or it may include specific requirements based on the act and regulations. For example, each facility\u2019s permit specifies the hazardous substances that must be monitored in the groundwater near the facility. Groundwater-monitoring requirements are included in the regulations, but many aspects of the monitoring program depend on the site and, therefore, are developed for each facility\u2019s permit.", "To ensure compliance with their requirements for operating in interim status or with a permit, RCRA requires treatment, storage, and disposal facilities to be inspected at least once every 2 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cement Production Facilities Are Regulated Under RCRA as Boiler and Industrial Furnace Units", "paragraphs": ["EPA classifies cement production facilities that burn hazardous waste fuel as industrial furnaces.

In addition, the rule subjects the owners and operators of these facilities to the standards that govern hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities in general.", "Facilities that were using or had committed themselves to using hazardous waste as a supplemental fuel before the effective date of the rule were allowed to obtain \u201cinterim status.\u201d This status allows them to continue burning hazardous waste fuels while obtaining the permit required under the rule. In addition to applying for a permit, the owners and operators of interim status facilities were required to submit (1) by August 21, 1991, a report (certification of precompliance) providing information and certifying that emissions of individual metals, hydrogen chloride, chlorine gas, and particulate matter were not likely to exceed allowable levels and (2) by August 21, 1992, a report (certification of compliance) certifying, on the basis of testing, that emissions of individual metals; hydrogen chloride, chlorine gas, and particulate matter; carbon monoxide; and where applicable, hydrocarbons, dioxins, and certain other chemicals did not exceed allowable levels.", "During interim status, limits on a facility\u2019s operating parameters are established and, after submitting the required certifications, the owner or operator must comply with these limits.

Facilities with a permit must also meet corrective action requirements and demonstrate that they can destroy and remove at least 99.99 percent of the principal organic hazardous constituents in the waste stream. This means that out of 1 ton of such elements put into the system, less than 4 ounces can actually be emitted in the stack gas.", "EPA makes information from compliance tests by facilities operating both in interim status and with a permit available to the public. Public notification is not required for compliance testing conducted by interim status facilities as part of their periodic certification of compliance with emission standards. However, an EPA regulation that became effective on June 11, 1996, generally requires that the public be notified of a new or interim status facility\u2019s trial burn. A trial burn is a test conducted as part of the permitting process to determine the limits on a facility\u2019s operating parameters.", "Because a cement production facility typically recycles cement kiln dust and feeds it back into the kiln, the concentration of toxic metals in the dust and the total amounts of toxic metals entering the kiln could increase over time. Therefore, the rule requires that the facility take steps, either by monitoring stack emissions or by other means, to ensure that the metals\u2019 concentration during certification testing does not change over time and is representative of the highest concentration of metals being fed into the kiln at any time. In addition, a cement production facility in interim status must feed hazardous waste directly into the kiln to ensure the complete destruction of the waste. Cement kiln dust produced by a kiln burning hazardous waste as fuel may be considered hazardous waste unless the kiln owner or operator demonstrates that the levels of hazardous constituents in the dust are either (1) similar to those found in the dust from kilns that burn conventional fuels or (2) within specified health-based limits.", "To ensure compliance with its requirements for operating in interim status or with a permit, RCRA requires hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities\u2014including cement production facilities burning hazardous waste fuels\u2014to be inspected periodically. According to EPA officials, one of the primary deficiencies that the agency noted during nationwide inspections of cement production facilities burning hazardous waste fuels from 1991 through 1995 was the facilities\u2019 inadequate analysis of hazardous waste. To assist the facilities in analyzing their waste, EPA is preparing guidance for incinerators, boilers, and industrial furnaces, which explains in more detail sampling techniques that the facilities can use to analyze their hazardous waste. In early August 1996, EPA was internally reviewing the draft guidance, and EPA officials expected to make the final guidance available to the public by the end of the month.", "On April 19, 1996, EPA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register that would set more stringent emission limits for hazardous waste incinerators, lightweight aggregate kilns, and cement production facilities burning hazardous waste fuels. According to EPA, the new standards are designed to reduce dioxin and furan emissions from these sources by 98 percent, mercury emissions by 80 percent, and lead and cadmium emissions by 95 percent. The proposed rule would also place stringent limits on the amounts of hydrochloric acid, chlorine, certain toxic metals, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons that facilities burning hazardous waste fuels can emit. The proposal would exempt cement kilns from the new emission standards if their hazardous waste fuels are similar in composition to fossil fuels and pose no greater risks. It would also require the monitoring of emissions. The proposed rule had a 60-day comment period.
