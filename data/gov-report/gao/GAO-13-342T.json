For example, incompatible procedures and lack of clear roles for the Bureau of Indian Education and the Indian Affairs' Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management (DAS-M), which provides administrative functions to BIE, such as human resources and acquisitions, contribute to delays in schools acquiring needed materials and resources. According to BIE officials, some DAS-M staff are not aware of the necessary procedures and timelines to meet schools' needs. For instance, delays in contracting have occasionally affected BIE's ability to provide services for students with disabilities in a timely manner. A study commissioned by Indian Affairs to evaluate the administrative support structure for BIE and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)--also under Indian Affairs--concluded that organizations within Indian Affairs, including DAS-M, BIA, and BIE, do not coordinate effectively and communication among them is poor. Similarly, preliminary results from GAO's work suggest that lack of consistent leadership within DAS-M and BIE hinders collaboration between the two offices.", "Although BIE's responsibilities to operate Indian schools are in some respects similar to those of state educational agencies (SEAs), BIE's influence is limited because most schools are tribally-operated. Like an SEA, BIE administers, monitors, and provides technical support for a number of programs funded by the Department of Education. Yet, in contrast to states that can impose a range of reforms on schools, in most BIE schools tribes retain authority over key policies. For example, BIE cannot require most schools to adopt or develop their own teacher and principal evaluation systems. Further complicating reform efforts, many small individual BIE schools function as their own school districts.

These schools serve about 41,000 Indian students living on or near  reservations, or about 7 percent of the Indian student population. There  are significant gaps in educational outcomes for students in BIE schools  compared with public schools.

The director is responsible for the direction and management of all  education functions, including the formation of policies and procedures,  supervision of all program activities, and approval of the expenditure of  funds for education functions. BIE is comprised of a central office in  Washington, D.C.; a major field service center in Albuquerque, New  Mexico; 3 associate deputy directors\u2019 offices located regionally (1 in the  east and 2 in the west); 22 education line offices located near Indian  reservations; and schools in 23 states. Of the 183 schools and  dormitories BIE administers, 58 are directly operated by BIE (BIE- operated), and 125 are operated by tribes (tribally-operated) through  federal contracts or grants.", "BIE schools are primarily funded through Interior. Similar to public  schools, BIE schools receive formula grants from Education.

(See fig. 1)", "BIE and its predecessor, the Office of Indian Education Programs, have  been through a number of restructuring efforts. Prior to 1999 BIA\u2019s  regional offices were responsible for most administrative functions for  Indian schools. In 1999, the National Academy of Public Administration  issued a report, commissioned by the Assistant Secretary of Indian  Affairs, which identified management challenges within BIA. The  report concluded that BIA\u2019s management structure was not adequate to  operate an effective and efficient agency. The report recommended  centralization of some administrative functions. According to BIE officials,  for a brief period from 2002 to 2003, BIE was responsible for its own  administrative functions. However, in 2004, in response to the NAPA  study, its administrative functions were centralized under the DAS-M.", "More recently, in 2011, Indian Affairs commissioned another study\u2014 known as the Bronner report\u2014to evaluate the administrative support  structure for BIE and BIA. The report, issued in March 2012, found that  organizations within Indian Affairs, including DAS-M, BIA, and BIE, do not  coordinate effectively and communication among them is poor. The study  recommended that Indian Affairs adopt a more balanced organizational  approach to include, among other things, shared responsibility, new  policies and procedures, and better communication, with increased  decentralization. the process of developing a plan to address these recommendations, but  they have not yet finalized a proposal for reorganization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management Challenges Continue to Impede BIE\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fragmented Administrative Structure Negatively Affects Schools", "paragraphs": ["Bronner Group, Final Report: Examination, Evaluation, and Recommendations for  Support Functions (March 2012). instance, is critical to ensure that all supplies and textbooks are delivered  before the start of the school year.

Likewise, delays in contracting have occasionally affected BIE\u2019s ability to  provide timely services for students with disabilities.", "Communication is especially difficult because of Indian Affairs\u2019  fragmented administrative structure. For example, school officials we  spoke with said that their correspondences are often lost and that there  appears to be little coordination between Indian Affairs offices. For  instance, the Bronner report found that the responsibility for facilities  management is scattered between three divisions within DAS-M. First,  the Property Management Division in the Office of the Chief Financial  Officer (OCFO) is responsible for maintaining the real property inventory.  Second, the Acquisition Office in the OCFO manages the leasing of  buildings for the BIA and BIE. Finally, maintenance and construction of all  Indian Affairs\u2019 buildings is under the purview of the Office of Facilities,  Environmental and Cultural Resources, and Office of Facilities  Management and Construction. This fragmented administrative structure  directly impact schools. For instance, the Little Wound School on the Pine  Ridge reservation in South Dakota closed for a few days because Indian  Affairs initially did not respond to their request for funds to replace a  broken boiler. Tribal school officials in Mississippi told us they are unsure  whether they should invest in repairs or rent additional modular  classrooms as they have not been told when or if the department will  construct new facilities.", "The Bronner report found that although DAS-M is tasked with supporting  both BIE and BIA, its staff is not structured in a way that effectively  supports both bureaus. Although the contracting needs of schools are  different than those of a federal agency, DAS-M does not have a specific  acquisition team assigned to BIE. The report also found that DAS-M\u2019s  acquisition services were slow and not customer focused and that there  was a disconnect between programs and support.", "Further, DAS-M staff may not have the requisite expertise needed for  working on BIE-related tasks. The Bronner report found that key staff  positions, such as budget analysts, were not assigned responsibilities in a  manner that would help them develop expertise on the goals, funding  history, and performance of BIE programs. Despite a request from BIE,  DAS-M has not conducted a workforce analysis to determine the number  and skill set of staff supporting the mission of BIE.", "According to BIE officials, DAS-M staffs\u2019 focus on supporting BIA rather  than BIE hinders DAS-M from seeking and acquiring expertise in  education issues and from making the needs of BIE schools a priority.

Currently, there are  no regularly scheduled meetings between BIE and DAS-M leadership to  discuss issues, priorities and goals. Additionally, BIE officials reported  having difficulty obtaining timely updates from DAS-M on its responses to  requests for services from schools. According to BIE officials, they used  to have regularly scheduled meetings with DAS-M leadership to discuss  operations, but the meetings were discontinued in September 2012.

Like an  SEA, BIE administers, oversees, and provides technical support for a  number of programs funded by Education. These include grants for  disadvantaged children, students with disabilities, and teacher quality  improvement. BIE also acts in the capacity of an SEA by monitoring,  overseeing, and providing technical support to BIE schools. Yet, in  contrast to states that can impose a range of reforms on schools, in  tribally operated schools, which form the majority of BIE schools, tribes  retain authority over key policies. This means that BIE must seek  cooperation from tribal officials to implement reform. For example, BIE  cannot require tribally-operated schools to adopt or develop their own  teacher and principal evaluation systems. Also, although BIE could  implement a curriculum for the schools it operates, BIE cannot implement  a bureau-wide curriculum that would apply to tribally-operated schools. In  contrast, some SEAs may be granted this authority through their state\u2019s  laws.", "According to BIE correspondence submitted to Education in June 2012,the accountability system BIE is required to use, as a condition of  receiving funding under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act (ESEA), as amended, is onerous. Like SEAs, BIE is  accountable for the academic achievement of students in its schools.  However, BIE schools must use the accountability measures of the 23  respective states where the schools are located unless an alternative has  been approved. As a result, BIE calculates proficiency\u2014the extent to  which schools have made adequate yearly progress meeting  performance goals\u2014using the states\u2019 accountability systems. In 2008, we  reported that BIE officials told us that, given the work involved, it was  challenging to calculate and report proficiency levels to schools before the  start of the subsequent school year. However, under ESEA, if schools  do not make adequate yearly progress toward specific proficiency levels  set by the states in reading, math, and science, they may be required to  pursue reforms that are best implemented at the beginning of the school  year. Recently, Education allowed 16 of the 23 states where BIE schools  are located to change their assessments and methodology for calculating  proficiency. Consequently, this has affected BIE\u2019s ability to calculate  proficiency for its schools in a timely manner. Currently, BIE is seeking to  revise its regulations that require it to use the 23 states\u2019 accountability  systems.", "Further complicating reform efforts, both BIE and Education consider BIE  schools, unlike public schools, to have the responsibilities of both school  districts and schools. BIE, unlike an SEA, treats each school as a public  school district. According to BIE and Education officials, many of these  individual schools are small in size and lack the organizational capacity to  function as a school district. We have previously reported that smaller  school districts face challenges acquiring special education services or  providers because they lack the same capacity, resources, knowledge, or  experience necessary to provide those services as larger-sized school  districts. BIE and Education officials acknowledge that this represents a strain on BIE\u2019s capacity to function in this manner.", "BIE is one of two federal entities that directly oversees the management  and operation of schools. The Department of Defense is the only other  federal agency that operates elementary and secondary schools, and it  does so to meet the educational needs of military dependents and  children of some civilian employees. The Department of Defense  Education Activity (DODEA) oversees the management and operation of  194 schools in seven states; Puerto Rico and Guam; and 12 foreign  countries. Unlike BIE, DODEA has considerable autonomy over its own  internal management, budget, and operations. According to the Director  of DODEA, the DODEA headquarters office is responsible for setting  general policy guidelines, while schools and local DODEA administrative  offices are charged with overseeing day-to-day operations.
