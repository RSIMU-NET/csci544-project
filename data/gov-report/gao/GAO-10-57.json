In 2007, Education created the Risk Management Service (RMS) to work with all components of the department to ensure that each office has an effective risk management strategy in place. Effective monitoring protocols and tools based on accepted control standards are key to ensuring that waste, fraud, and abuse are not overlooked and program funds are being spent appropriately. Such tools include identifying the nature and extent of grantee risks and managing those risks, having skilled staff to oversee grantees to ensure they are using sound financial practices and meeting program objectives and requirements, and using and sharing information about grantees throughout the organization. Our review of Education's current grant monitoring processes and controls found that it: (1)Has made uneven progress in implementing a department-wide, risk-based approach to grant monitoring. Education has not disseminated department-wide guidance on grantee risk assessment, but it has planned some new efforts in this area. In the absence of guidance on a department-wide risk assessment strategy, individual program offices have developed their own strategies for assessing and managing risk that vary in rigor. (2) Has limited financial expertise and training, hindering effective monitoring of grantees' compliance with financial requirements. Education has monitoring tools that aid in reviewing basic financial compliance, but the lack of staff expertise limits the ability to probe more deeply into grantees' use of funds. (3) Lacks a systematic means of sharing information on grantees and promising practices in grant monitoring throughout the department.

Currently, there are 18,650 grantees with open grant  awards from Education. In addition, as part of the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), Congress dramatically  increased Education\u2019s grant funding by an additional $97 billion. However,  in a series of reports between 2002 and 2009, the Department of  Education\u2019s Office of Inspector General identified a number of problems  related to the management of grant funding by state and local educational  agencies and institutions of higher education. Such findings raise  questions about Education\u2019s ability to monitor its grantees, particularly  when coupled with such a large increase in funding from the Recovery  Act. How well Education, or any agency, can oversee grantees depends on  the management and accountability tools and controls it has in place to  properly implement monitoring in order to prevent or detect abuses by  grantees. Such tools and controls include identifying the nature and extent  of risks and managing those risks, having skilled staff to implement  oversight activities to ensure that program objectives are fulfilled, and  using and sharing relevant information throughout the organization. If any  of the tools or controls are weak or not in place in a grant monitoring  process, there is heightened risk of the program not fully meeting its  objectives.", "Because of the Office of Inspector General\u2019s findings and other reports on  the improper use of funds by grantees and the implications for how well  Education monitors its grants, you asked us to review Education\u2019s grant  monitoring process. In meeting with your staff, we agreed to examine  various aspects of Education\u2019s grant monitoring. Specifically, our  objectives were to determine: (1) What progress has Education made in  implementing a risk-based approach to grant monitoring? (2) To what  extent do Education\u2019s program offices have the expertise necessary to  monitor grantees\u2019 compliance with grant program requirements? (3) To  what extent is information shared and used within Education to ensure the  effectiveness of grant monitoring?", "To answer these questions, we used information collected from current  and past GAO engagements related to grant monitoring, and held  additional discussions with department officials to gain an understanding  of grant monitoring at Education. We documented our understanding of  Education\u2019s grant monitoring process and asked department officials to  review the document and provide comments. They confirmed that our  understanding was consistent with their grant monitoring practices and  procedures. We based our evaluation of Education\u2019s grant monitoring  process on GAO\u2019s standards for internal control in the federal government.  We selected 12 of the department\u2019s 34 program offices from which to  obtain more detailed information about their grant monitoring activities  (see table 1). We selected these program offices because they encompass a  wide variety of grant programs and they administer approximately 91  percent of grant funds in the department. Nine of the 12 program offices  reside in four of the principal offices, which collectively administer the  department\u2019s largest grant programs in terms of total funding. To ensure  that we included programs from all seven of the principal offices  administering grants to entities that provide education or education- related services to students, we also selected the program offices that  administered the largest amount of grant funds in the other three principal  offices.

In smaller offices, we interviewed all the  program specialists who were available to meet with us.

The principal offices focus on specific areas of education, such as  special education, elementary and secondary education, and  postsecondary education. Within each of these principal offices, there are  individual program offices responsible for one or more specific grant  programs.

Each program office has the flexibility to tailor its monitoring to its  respective grant programs. For example, program offices that oversee  formula grants to state agencies generally conduct on-site monitoring on a  3-to-5-year cycle but can make more frequent visits if necessary. For  discretionary grants, site visits to the recipients are generally less frequent,  in part because of the relatively small size of the awards and the relatively  large number of discretionary grant awards made by the department.   Relatively more desk-top monitoring is used in monitoring discretionary  grants. In general, recipients of grants from Education must:    conform to the approved grant application and approved revisions;    adhere to laws, regulations, conditions of the grant, and certifications;    share progress on established performance measures; and    manage federal funds according to federal cash management  requirements.", "Education\u2019s grant monitoring practices and procedures require that  program office staff undertake numerous activities to monitor grantees for  compliance with administrative, financial, and performance regulations  and requirements to protect against fraud, waste, and abuse of federal  resources. These activities include on-site visits and desk reviews of  grantees, review of annual reports submitted by grantees, and evaluation  of grant projects with respect to performance. For example, some  financial monitoring activities that program office staff perform include  reviewing reports generated in the Grant Administration and Payment  System, Education\u2019s primary information system and tool for financial  oversight, and available audit reports. In cases where technical assistance  and normal monitoring do not improve grantee performance, special grant  conditions may be imposed on the grantee such as requiring the grantee to  obtain prior approval for certain expenditures. Findings of material  noncompliance are reported to other offices in Education, such as the  Office of General Counsel, while findings of potential illegal activity  involving fraud, waste, and abuse are reported to the Office of Inspector  General for further action.

The Secretary created RMS in October  2007 to work with all components of the department to ensure that each  office has effective procedures in place to assess and mitigate risk among  its grantees. Specifically, RMS is to develop tools to assess grantee risk for  use throughout the department and train department staff to use the  tools. RMS has not yet issued department-wide guidance on assessing  grantee risk, and key guidance, such as the updated discretionary grant  handbook, does not provide information on how to develop a risk-based  approach to monitoring grants. Program officials said that such guidancewould be a valuable tool for program offices in developing their own risk  assessment procedures. RMS is currently testing software it developed  that would assist Education staff in evaluating grantee risk. For exampl e,  the new software collects financial information from Dun and Bradstreet, among other sources, and uses that information to calculate a score  reflecting the financial stability of grantees.

In discussing how program  offices assess grantees\u2019 financial risk, we noted there was an indicator that  program offices routinely reviewed to assess a grantee\u2019s financial risk: the  rate at which a grantee draws down grant funds, known as the drawdown  rate. Although staff we met with in all of the offices that disburse funds  through periodic drawdowns reported checking the drawdown rate, the  frequency varied from office to office, with some checking the rate  monthly and others checking it quarterly. Further, the drawdown rate is  limited as an indicator of the soundness of a grantee\u2019s financial  management practices because it only shows when the grantee is using  funds and does not show what the funds are used for.", "In addition to monitoring the grantees\u2019 drawdown rates, staff in three of  the offices we met with OPE, Student Achievement and School  Accountability (SASA), and Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP)  described using more rigorous risk assessment procedures than those  developed in the other offices we visited. As discussed above, OPE  worked with RMS to develop new risk assessment procedures. Staff in  SASA have recently moved to risk-based monitoring procedures; they use  a risk assessment procedure that incorporates an extensive list of risk  indicators and numerous sources of information to determine an  individual grantee\u2019s level of risk and whether grantees are meeting  performance expectations. These indicators include program performance  data, the grantee staff\u2019s level of experience, the size of the grant and the  population served, and issues raised by the Office of Inspector General.  Once the program specialists in that office collect and analyze the  information, they tailor monitoring and technical assistance accordingly.  The staff routinely track major compliance or performance issues, and  also conduct staff briefings before site visits to share information the  office has developed about the grantee and issues that may arise, and  afterwards, to discuss findings and possible corrective action plans.", "Specialists in OSEP reported that they categorize grantees based on such  factors as audit findings, data indicating how well the grantee is  accomplishing its objectives, and special conditions attached to the grant.  Based on this information, they categorize the level of risk for the grantee  and the level of monitoring and technical assistance the grantee requires.  For example, a grantee that has high staff turnover or recurring problems  in external audits, or is unable to meet its performance expectations,  would be monitored more closely and receive more technical assistance  than a grantee with experienced staff that is consistently meeting the  program\u2019s administrative, financial, and performance requirements.", "Program specialists from OPE, Parental Options and Information, and the  Continuation and Professional Grants Division told us that their risk  assessment process begins when they first contact grantees and provide  expectations for reporting performance and financial information. This  early contact gives these program specialists a sense of the level of  experience the grantee has in managing federal grants. In developing those  assessments, the program specialists and supervisors said they can tailor  their monitoring to provide additional technical assistance, for example, or  reach out more frequently than they might otherwise to grantees that  appear likely to have compliance problems.", "While some of Education\u2019s program offices are making progress assessing  and managing grantee risk as discussed above, staff in three other program  offices described significant limitations of the risk assessment process in  place for their grant programs:    Program specialists in one office told us that experienced program  specialists rely on their skills and experience to determine what to look  for. However, without a formalized risk assessment process, they said a  new hire might miss key issues while monitoring a grantee. They added  that a more formal risk assessment process would be helpful.", "The program specialists in another office said they are not able to review  all possible risk indicators that may pertain to grantees or do more in- depth risk assessments because of competing demands on their time. For  example, one program specialist described a situation in which grant  funds were improperly paid out to a grantee because the program  specialist did not have time to check whether the grantee was in good  standing. He added that the office was able to recover the funds, but he  was concerned this could happen again and result in losses.", "One program office director told us that the large number of grantees  makes it impossible to conduct routine risk assessments of them all.
