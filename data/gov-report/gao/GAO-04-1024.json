Information collected from monitoring by other federal and state agencies does not, by design, provide an overall assessment of the Great Lakes because it is collected to meet specific program objectives or limited to specific geographic areas. Multiple restoration goals have been proposed through efforts by EPA and other organizations. EPA developed basin-wide goals through its Great Lakes Strategy 2002 and goals for plans addressing individual lakes. Other organizations have also identified basin-wide restoration goals and priorities. Monitoring of progress toward goals is generally limited to tracking specific action items proposed in the Great Lakes Strategy 2002; other proposed goals are generally not monitored to determine progress. Efforts to coordinate basin-wide goals and a monitoring system face several challenges. The lack of clearly defined organizational leadership poses a major obstacle. Both EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO) and a newly created interagency task force have coordination roles raising uncertainty as to how leadership and coordination efforts will be exercised in the future. Second, coordinating existing restoration goals and monitoring activities among the many participating organizations within the United States, and between the United States and Canada is a significant challenge. Third, centralized information from monitoring activities is not yet available, making it difficult to assess restoration progress. In addition, an inventory system developed by EPA and Canada may not have adequate controls on voluntarily provided information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Great Lakes, the largest system of freshwater in the world, is  recognized by the United States and Canada as a natural resource that is  threatened on many environmental fronts.

While the two countries have made  some progress in protecting and restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem\u2014the  air, water, land, and living organisms within the basin\u2014polluted beaches  are frequently closed to swimmers, fish are unsafe to eat for high-risk  individuals, and raw sewage is still being dumped into the lakes. While  some information on environmental conditions of the Great Lakes is  available, questions remain as to overall conditions and the progress of  restoration.", "As concern increased over the contamination of the Great Lakes, the  United States and Canada signed the first international Great Lakes Water  Quality Agreement (GLWQA) in 1972. In the agreement, the United States  and Canada agreed to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and  biological integrity of the Great Lakes Basin. The overall goals of the  GLWQA are to restore and enhance water quality in the lakes. In 1978, the  parties signed another Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that  reaffirmed their determination to restore and enhance water quality and  called for increasing control of toxic substances throughout the Great  Lakes Basin. Subsequently, amendments were made to the 1978 agreement  in 1983 and 1987. The 1987 Protocol amendments added several annexes  that focused on specific environmental concerns and amended one, Annex  11, on surveillance and monitoring. Annex 11 requires the two countries to  undertake a joint program to, among other things, monitor restoration  progress and assess the degree to which the parties are complying with the  requirements and objectives of the agreement. Monitoring is accomplished  through various sampling methods, such as using air monitoring  equipment to measure the deposition of toxic chemicals. Monitoring may  help identify the source and extent of problems and aid decision makers in  setting restoration goals, taking action, and determining the extent to  which goals are being met. Goals should be stated in measurable terms in  order to monitor progress. In an effort to establish restoration strategies to  meet the overall goals of the GLWQA, the U.S. Policy Committee  (USPC)\uf8e7a forum of senior level representatives from the federal, state,  and tribal government agencies that share responsibility for environmental  protection and resource management in the Great Lakes\uf8e7developed the  Great Lakes Strategy 2002. EPA efforts in establishing goals also include  helping to develop Lakewide Management Plans (LaMP) for each of the  individual Great Lakes.", "In addition, a joint effort by the two countries to assess and report on  environmental conditions in the Great Lakes began in 1994, with the first  State of the Lakes Ecosystem Conference (SOLEC). The conference has  convened every 2 years thereafter and its proceedings are used as a basis  for reporting on the state of the lakes. In the late 1990s, SOLEC began  developing a comprehensive set of indicators on the condition of the Great  Lakes ecosystem. SOLEC\u2019s reports have described indicators such as  chemical contaminants in edible fish tissue and toxic chemical  concentrations in offshore waters.", "The Clean Water Act charges the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) with leading the effort to meet the requirements of the GLWQA. The  act also statutorily established the Great Lakes National Program Office  (GLNPO) within EPA, charging it with, among other things, cooperating  with federal, state, tribal, and international agencies to develop and  implement specific action plans to carry out the U.S. responsibilities under  the agreement. In addition to the various governmental agencies involved  in Great Lakes restoration, several nongovernmental organizations have  established restoration goals. In 2003, we reported that an overall strategy  was needed to guide numerous ongoing restoration activities and that  indicators and a monitoring system were needed to measure overall  restoration progress.", "You asked us to (1) determine the extent to which current EPA monitoring  efforts provide information for assessing overall conditions in the Great  Lakes Basin and what information is provided by other organizations  conducting monitoring in the Great Lakes, (2) identify existing restoration  goals and whether monitoring is done to track goal progress, and (3)  identify the major challenges to setting basin-wide restoration goals and  developing a monitoring system for the Great Lakes.", "To address the extent to which information derived from monitoring is  useful for assessing overall conditions in the Great Lakes Basin, we  reviewed information on monitoring activities conducted by U.S. and  Canadian federal agencies and the eight states and two Canadian  provinces that share the basin. We also examined the monitoring  requirements included in the GLWQA and compared these requirements  with ongoing monitoring and SOLEC activities. To identify existing  restoration goals, we reviewed the goals and monitoring efforts contained  in the Great Lakes Strategy 2002 and EPA\u2019s LaMPs for four of the five  Great Lakes. We also examined the restoration goals of several  organizations participating in the restoration of the Great Lakes. To  identify major challenges to setting restoration goals and developing a  monitoring system for the Great Lakes, we obtained and analyzed  information on several barriers to progress and focused on four major  challenges involving organizational leadership, coordinating goals and  monitoring, centralized information on monitoring activities, and  environmental differences between the lakes. We conducted our work  from August 2003 to May 2004 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

Spanning more than 750 miles from  west to east, the basin encompasses nearly all of the state of Michigan and  parts of Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,  Wisconsin, and the Canadian province of Ontario. Parts of the St.  Lawrence River, the connecting channel between Lake Ontario and the  Atlantic Ocean, flow through the provinces of both Ontario and Quebec.", "Recognizing their mutual interests in the Great Lakes and other boundary  waters, the United States and Great Britain signed the Boundary Waters  Treaty in 1909, which provided the United States and Canada with a  framework for dealing with future issues along the border. The treaty  established the International Joint Commission (IJC), comprising three  commissioners each from the United States and from Canada, to help the  two governments resolve and prevent disputes concerning their shared  boundary waters. Among other things, the IJC also assists the  governments in the implementation of the GLWQA, reports every 2 years  on implementation progress, and offers nonbinding recommendations to  the two governments. Signed in 1972, the GLWQA focused on restoring  and enhancing water quality in the lakes and controlling phosphorous as a  principal means of dealing with eutrophication in the lakes. Under the  terms of the GLWQA, the two governments are required to conduct a  comprehensive review of the operation and effectiveness of the agreement  every 6 years. The next review is scheduled to begin in 2004, and based  upon the results, the two countries may decide to amend the agreement.  The last review in 1999 found that certain sections of the agreement were  outdated and revisions were needed.", "As amended, the GLWQA has 17 annexes that define in detail the specific  programs and activities that the two parties have agreed upon and  committed to implement. Most of the annexes specify pollution prevention  strategies. Annex 11 of the GLWQA calls for the parties to implement a  joint surveillance and monitoring program that, among other things,  evaluates water quality trends, identifies emerging problems, and supports  the development of remedial action plans for contaminated areas\u2014- referred to as areas of concern\u2014-and LaMPs for the open waters of each  of the five lakes to reduce critical pollutants and to restore and protect  beneficial uses. Specifically, Annex 11 calls for the monitoring program to  include baseline data collection, sample analysis, and evaluation and  quality assurance programs to assess such things as whole lake data  including that for open waters and nearshore areas of the lakes as well as  fish and wildlife contaminants; inputs from tributaries, point source  discharges, atmosphere, and connecting channels; and total pollutant  loadings to and from the Great Lakes system.", "The monitoring program under Annex 11 is to be based on the Great Lakes  International Surveillance Plan (GLISP) developed before the current  requirements for a surveillance and monitoring system. Developing the  surveillance plan, which involved developing a separate plan for each lake,  required extensive efforts by U.S. and Canadian officials over several  years. However, according to one Canadian official involved in the  process, the plans were not completed to the point where they could be  implemented. The IJC\u2019s Water Quality Board was involved in the  management and development of the GLISP, but according to a binational  review of the GLWQA in 1999, the IJC\u2019s role was reduced after the GLQWA  amendments of 1987 placed more of the responsibility for data analysis  and reporting on the state of the Great Lakes environment with the two  governments. IJC\u2019s role today is one of assisting in the implementation of  the agreement and evaluating the actions of the two governments in  meeting the objectives of the GLWQA. After the GLISP effort, the  governments reduced support for the surveillance and monitoring called  for in the agreement, and abandoned the organizational structure created  to implement the monitoring plan, leaving in place only one of the plan\u2019s  initiatives, the International Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN), a  network of 15 air-monitoring stations located throughout the basin  developed in response to the GLWQA requirement of a monitoring  program to allow assessment of inputs from the atmosphere affecting the  Great Lakes. In addition, under a separate annex in the GLWQA (Annex 2),  LaMPs are required to include, among other things, a description of the  surveillance and monitoring to be used to track the effectiveness of  remedial measures and the elimination of critical pollutants. The  agreement requires that updates to the LaMPs be submitted to the IJC for  review and comment. IJC is considering whether to conduct a review of  the LaMPs in 2004.", "The Water Quality Act of 1987 amended the Clean Water Act to state that  EPA should take the lead and work with other federal agencies and state  and local authorities to meet the goals in the agreement. It also established  within EPA, GLNPO, to among other things, coordinate EPA\u2019s actions  aimed at improving Great Lakes water quality both at headquarters and at  the affected EPA regional offices, and to coordinate EPA\u2019s actions with the  actions of other federal agencies. As of 2003, GLNPO\u2019s budget was $16  million, including $5 million allocated for program costs, which includes  47 full-time EPA staff and 13 non-EPA staff. The remaining costs included  about $4.3 million per year for monitoring and monitoring-related  reporting, which included about $1.4 million to operate GLNPO\u2019s research  vessel, the Lake Guardian. For Canada, Environment Canada (EC) is the  lead agency, which works in cooperation with the provinces of  Ontario\uf8e7in which parts of four of the lakes are located\uf8e7and Quebec,  which administers the St. Lawrence River. Coordination between EPA and  EC is achieved through the Binational Executive Committee (BEC).  Subsequent to the GLQWA amendments of 1987, the BEC was formed to  coordinate programs and policies of the two parties to facilitate GLWQA  implementation. BEC, co-chaired by EPA and EC, meets twice a year and  membership includes federal, state, and provincial officials from  organizations involved in Great Lakes activities. The BEC does not have  authority to direct that projects or programs be implemented but rather  makes recommendations regarding certain activities, such as the  development of SOLEC. Funding provided for BEC operations is limited,  and it relies on funding from other organizations to implement its  recommendations.", "In addition to the BEC, several organizations serve coordinating roles,  offer policy perspectives, or financially support restoration activities for  the Great Lakes, including the following:    Council of Great Lakes Governors, a partnership of governors from the  eight Great Lakes states and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and  Quebec, encourages and facilitates environmentally responsible economic  growth throughout the Great Lakes region.", "Great Lakes Commission, an organization promoting the orderly,  integrated, and comprehensive development, use, and conservation of  water and related natural resources of the Great Lakes Basin and the St.  Lawrence River, includes representatives from the eight Great Lakes states  and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.", "Great Lakes United, an international coalition group dedicated to  preserving and restoring the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River ecosystem,  promotes effective policy initiatives, carries out education programs, and  promotes citizen action and grassroots leadership for Great Lakes  environmental activities.

This program,  however, has not been fully developed. Instead, officials from GLNPO look  upon SOLEC as the process by which indicators will be developed to  monitor environmental conditions and measure restoration progress in the  Great Lakes. However, as we reported in 2003, the SOLEC process of  holding conferences every 2 years to develop Great Lakes indicators and  monitor environmental conditions for subsequent reporting on the state of  the lakes falls short in several areas. First, indicators assessed through the  process do not provide an adequate basis for making an overall  assessment of Great Lakes restoration because they rely on limited  quantitative data and subjective judgments. Second, the SOLEC process is  dependent on the voluntary participation of officials from federal and state  agencies, academic institutions, and other organizations. As a result, their  future commitment to providing information on indicators and monitoring  results, along with their future participation, is not assured. Finally, most  of the stated objectives for SOLEC do not align with the surveillance and  monitoring program envisioned in the GLWQA.

However, it is the only ongoing effort to provide an overall  assessment of the Great Lakes and, according to 23 federal, state, and  other environmental program officials, a surveillance and monitoring  system is still needed. For example, a Michigan state official explained  that a monitoring system developed with the involvement of all  stakeholders and focused on the differences in individual lakes is needed.  Appendix III contains the specific comments from the officials we  contacted regarding the need for a monitoring system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SOLEC\u2019s Monitoring Information Is of Questionable Value in Decision Making", "paragraphs": ["The monitoring information developed and reported by SOLEC is of  questionable value to officials responsible for making restoration  decisions for several reasons. First, the information is not based on their  decision-making needs. State and federal agency officials stated that the  SOLEC process is not connected with the policy-making process. For  example, a Minnesota Pollution Control Agency official stated that the  SOLEC process is oriented toward the needs of researchers and has not  connected with the policy-making process for which indicators are  needed. A Michigan Department of Environmental Quality official stated  that SOLEC provides information based on data from only one or two  sampling locations and is not relevant from a state program perspective.  Canadian program officials shared these opinions, and one official added  that SOLEC data does not address local community questions or program  objectives.", "The comments by program officials are supported by results from a peer  review of SOLEC in 2003 by an international panel of experts in large  indicator systems. While the panel had many favorable observations of  SOLEC, they noted a disconnect between the development of the  indicators and their usefulness to policy makers. The peer review stated  that, to be effective, the actual users must define indicators, with policy  makers and environmental managers involved in the early stages of  indicator development. In addition to these observations, in the latest  report on the state of the Great Lakes, one of the management challenges  discussed is how to better assist managers given the large number of  indicators. Specifically, the challenge is to find a method of indexing  indicators that better assists managers and leads to more useful, informed  decision making. The disconnect between SOLEC and decision makers is  further illustrated by the fact that only two of the eight Great Lakes states  we contacted were reporting information from local monitoring efforts to  support the SOLEC process and that none of the states reported using the  monitoring information published by SOLEC to describe conditions of its  local water bodies or to measure restoration progress. One Minnesota  official stated that the former head of the state environmental agency  viewed SOLEC information as irrelevant to describe conditions within the  state.", "A GLNPO official working on SOLEC stated that developing effective  indicators requires that you first ask what is to be measured, what the best  indicator is for this measurement, how much data are needed, who will  collect and handle the data for consistency, and how often the  measurement will take place. He stated that the need to ask these  questions dates back to the early 1980s, but actions to implement this  indicator-monitoring program never materialized. Instead, different  indicators and monitoring programs are being conducted by various  agencies using different sampling methodologies and protocols, and this  inconsistent local program information cannot, after the fact, be used to  make decisions about system-wide needs or environmental conditions.", "Second, SOLEC information is based on limited data that further detracts  from its usefulness to decision makers. For example, of the 80 SOLEC  indicators reported to describe the Great Lakes Basin in 2003, evaluative  data were only available for 43 of them. Often this data was geographically  limited and did not address conditions within the entire basin.  Additionally, the IJC reported in its 2002 biennial report that sufficient  data were not being collected from around the Great Lakes and that the  methods of collection, the data collection time frames, the lack of uniform  protocols, and the incompatible nature of some data jeopardized their use  as indicators.", "Third, there is no guarantee that SOLEC information will be consistently  collected or will be available in the future. As we reported earlier, the  SOLEC process involves individuals providing information on a voluntary  basis with the indicator data residing in a diverse number of sources with  limited control by SOLEC organizers. Therefore, there is no assurance  that the information will continue to be collected or consistently reported  over time. Environmental program officials from federal, state, and  provincial agencies stated that the process lacks sufficient and consistent  monitoring information to measure environmental restoration progress.  The SOLEC peer review group found that the SOLEC process has serious  flaws regarding lack of repeatability and transparency. According to  GLNPO officials, SOLEC organizers attempted to address the issue of  repeatability and transparency in 2003 by issuing a technical report, which  provides additional information on data sources. Further, the process is  lacking in standard methodology, and SOLEC has yet to establish standard  protocols to improve data comparability and reliability.", "One attempt to measure restoration progress in the basin using SOLEC  indicators is presented in EPA\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget justification. To  measure progress, a single quantitative score is derived based on a formula  using eight SOLEC indicators. Each indicator is given a score from 1 to 5  based on the professional judgments of individuals providing the indicator  information. A score of 1 is considered poor, and 5 is considered good.  Totaling the individual indicator scores resulted in a score of 20 based on a  total 40-point scale for the Great Lakes. While this is an attempt to  measure overall progress, the scoring process is based on a limited  number of indicators, and the point scores are based on subjective  judgment. Further, the indicators described in the budget justification do  not align with the ones used in developing the scores.

First, GLNPO conducts annual monitoring of open lake water areas for the  specific purpose of gathering information on water quality and biological  conditions. The information gathered includes toxic pollutant levels of  persistent substances, such as phosphorous. These sampling efforts are  generally conducted twice each year, once in spring and once in summer,  when the Lake Guardian travels to various fixed sampling sites on each of  the lakes (see fig. 2). Sampling information collected during these  assessments is stored in an automated database and is limited to assessing  long-term trends in open lake waters. GLNPO officials stated that it takes  about 6 to 7 years of data before enough information is available to  identify a long-term trend.", "Second, GLNPO conducts monitoring of sediment contaminants in the  nearshore areas of the Great Lakes that involves biological and chemical  sampling for benthic-bottom soil-contamination. Data is collected from  several sampling stations throughout the lakes to assess, among other  things, the presence of small invertebrates in bottom sediments. These  data are assessed with open lake data to determine possible adverse  impacts on the food web that ultimately pose a human health risk. The  scope of sediment monitoring is limited to certain areas, and GLNPO  officials stated that they believe their main responsibility is open lake  monitoring under the GLWQA and that the Great Lakes states are  responsible for inland and tributary monitoring. Third, GLNPO conducts  the U.S. portion of IADN for the specific purpose of monitoring toxic  substances deposited through the air. Monitored toxic substances include  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and trace metals, such as lead and  cadmium, that have entered the watershed. While GLNPO is responsible  for monitoring in the United States, EC is responsible for Canadian  locations. IADN consists of 5 master sampling stations and 10 satellite  stations located throughout the basin and is limited to identifying  substances deposited through the air. Fourth, GLNPO conducts an annual  fish program to monitor concentrations of contaminants in Great Lakes  fish.

Task force members include representatives from EPA, eight  other federal agencies with Great Lakes program responsibilities, and the  Council on Environmental Quality. Under the Executive Order, one of the  purposes of the task force is to coordinate government action associated  with the Great Lakes. The EPA Administrator chairs the task force that is  also charged with developing outcome-based goals and collaborating with  Canada and its provinces and with other binational bodies involved in the  Great Lakes region regarding policies, strategies, projects, and priorities  for the Great Lakes.

The coordination role for the task force under the  Executive Order is very similar to GLNPO\u2019s coordination role under the  Clean Water Act.

Moreover, under the  Clean Water Act, GLNPO is required to not only develop but also  implement specific action plans to carry out the responsibilities under  GLWQA. However, according to the Executive Order, GLNPO will  participate on a Great Lakes Regional Working Group that is responsible  for coordinating and making recommendations for implementing the task  force polices and strategies, but it will be the task force that actually  implements recommendations.", "Existing coordination activities of USPC are also uncertain in light of the  Executive Order. The USPC is focused on coordinating federal, state, and  tribal government activities related to fulfilling the GLWQA, and it  developed the Great Lakes Strategy 2002 to set restoration goals and  actions.

Coordinating and prioritizing research is also an activity of the IJC\u2019s  binational Council of Great Lakes Research Managers. This council,  established in 1984, proposes priority research areas for the Great Lakes,  and some of the proposals are priorities for GLERL, in part, because the  council is currently co-chaired by the GLERL Director. Future councils,  however, may not be co-chaired by the GLERL Director, and priority  research areas may not be addressed because research managers are not  bound to follow council priorities.", "Finally, the creation of the task force and working group by the Executive  Order also raises questions about the permanency of this organizational  structure for addressing the long-term restoration needs of the Great  Lakes. Executive orders, such as the one creating the task force, stay in  effect despite changes in administrations, but they may be amended or  rescinded by a subsequent President. Moreover, the Executive Order  cannot be enforced in court, unlike statutory provisions that can often be  judicially enforced.

One attempt to  coordinate monitoring involving research vessels on the Great Lakes  began in 1997, by the IJC\u2019s Council of Great Lakes Research Managers. The  impetus for this effort was that over 60 research vessels were operating  independently in the basin without coordination or collaboration and with  limited monitoring funds. Since that time the IJC has been developing an  inventory of Great Lakes research vessels that was placed on a Web site  designed to identify the ships, scientific equipment, general research  schedules, and points of contact to aid in coordinating operations and  sharing resources. The extent that this inventory has facilitated  coordination has yet to be determined, however, coordination has begun  through sharing of information on research vessels, according to an IJC  official.", "Further, existing agreements on restoration goals and monitoring between  Canada and its provincial governments of Ontario and Quebec will need to  be considered in developing basin-wide goals if a joint U.S.-Canada  monitoring system is to be developed as required under the GLWQA. Four  of the five Great Lakes are shared by the United States and Canada and  share many of the same environmental problems. The restoration goals  and monitoring efforts developed in Canada to address these problems are  important for a coordinated effort by the two countries. One set of goals to  consider are in an agreement reached in 2002, between the governments of  Canada and Ontario on overall goals and actions to be taken to protect,  restore, and conserve the Great Lakes Basin ecosystem. This  agreement\uf8e7the Canada-Ontario agreement\uf8e7contains four annexes that  address areas of concern, harmful pollutants, lakewide management,  monitoring, and information management. Each annex contains overall  goals to be achieved over a 5-year period and results that the parties have  agreed to achieve together or individually.

Since the first 5-year plan in 1988,  subsequent 5-year agreements, referred to as phases, have focused on  specific environmental priorities. The most recent agreement, Phase III,  also referred to as the St. Lawrence Vision 2000, has three major  objectives: protecting ecosystem and human health, involving riverside  communities in the process of helping to make the St. Lawrence more  accessible, and recovering its former uses. An updated agreement, Phase  IV, was being developed as of July 2004.", "In addition to agreements, Canada and the two provinces have ongoing  monitoring activities that provide information on environmental  conditions in the Great Lakes Basin that will need to be considered in  developing a joint basin-wide monitoring system. For example, the  Ministry of the Environment, Ontario, conducts a Great Lakes nearshore  monitoring and assessment program that contains five monitoring efforts.  One of these involves sampling water quality at 66 sites within the basin on  a rotating basis to determine how water quality is changing over time.  Another component of the Ontario program is monitoring of Great Lakes  tributaries for toxic contaminants. This monitoring is done to identify  those tributaries to each lake having significant concentrations of  persistent bioaccumulative substances, such as pesticides. In addition to  monitoring conducted by the province of Ontario, monitoring and  reporting is done by Conservation Authorities within the province. The  Authorities consist of 36 local community-based organizations established  by provincial legislation that manage watersheds throughout Ontario. The  Authorities\u2019 monitoring efforts are concentrated on tributary, stream, and  inland areas of the Great Lakes Basin, and reports are issued to the public  on the state of the watersheds.", "For the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, a monitoring component for the St.  Lawrence Vision 2000 plan was developed by two Canadian federal  agencies, the Quebec Ministry of Environment and a nongovernmental  organization, to provide information on the environmental conditions in  the St. Lawrence River Basin. The program began in 2003, with the four  parties agreeing to conduct 21 monitoring activities until 2010, to analyze  and report on the results. The 21 activities are ongoing activities by  governmental organizations and were selected based on the descriptive  information provided on St. Lawrence conditions. Several environmental  issues are addressed, such as contamination of water, sediments, and  biological resources by toxic substances. To better integrate the ongoing  monitoring activities of the different organizations, the parties agreed to  improve the spatial and temporal coverage of certain indicators, develop  new indicators, and strive for better collaboration.", "In addition to efforts conducted by the provinces and others, EC conducts  monitoring in open lake waters, connecting channels, and tributaries of  the Great Lakes Basin. Open lake monitoring is conducted at various sites  for ensuring compliance with GLWQA water quality objectives, evaluating  trends, and identifying emerging issues. The monitoring focuses on two  lakes each year, with the exception of Lake Michigan where it is the  responsibility of the United States, to gather information on contaminants,  nutrients, metals, and physical parameters at specific locations in each  lake. Other monitoring programs involve pesticides and emerging  chemicals monitoring in selected watersheds and embayments, and water  quality monitoring of the Niagara, St. Lawrence, St. Clair, and Detroit  Rivers.

The physical  magnitude of the basin is often recognized as a daunting challenge for  setting measurable restoration goals. Although the Great Lakes are  connected through rivers and channels, they are not one contiguous water  body but rather distinct lakes with unique environmental conditions. The  Great Lakes Basin area spans 750 miles and has multiple environmental  challenges. This presents challenges to setting goals and developing a  monitoring system that can be used to describe restoration progress  across the basin and also capture the uniqueness of each lake. The distinct  physical characteristics of the lakes are illustrated by the differences  between Lakes Superior and Erie. (See fig. 3.)", "Lake Superior is a larger, deeper lake with a relatively sparse human  population within its watershed. Most of the shoreline of Lake Superior is  forested and not host to the extensive urban development along its shores  that Lake Erie has. For Lake Superior, the overarching concern is to  preserve current conditions and keep pollutants and invasive species from  entering the lake. Lake Erie has other unique environmental problems, the  most recent being the reemergence of a dead zone in the central basin of  the lake that is void of oxygen and cannot support aquatic life. Recently,  the phosphorus levels of the lake have exceeded acceptable levels as the  result of unknown causes. Research efforts are now focused on  determining the cause of the rise in phosphorous levels, which cause  harmful algae blooms. Because Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great  Lakes and is subject to urban pressures, it is sometimes cited as the lake  that first develops environmental problems within the Great Lakes Basin.", "The differences between the Great Lakes pose a challenge to setting basin- wide goals. While goals are needed to determine basin-wide progress,  goals for each lake are also needed to address specific problems or public  concerns for each lake. For Lake Superior, a major concern is stopping  pollutants from entering the lake, which is addressed through a program  that established a goal of zero-discharge for point source pollutants. For  Lake Erie, goals developed by the Lake Erie Commission address other  problems, such as how remediating contaminated sediments in Lake Erie\u2019s  harbors and tributaries.

Overall goals developed for the program are stated in a general fashion  similar to many developed for the Great Lakes and are to (1) address  water quality and clarity problems caused by excess nutrients, sediments,  and toxics; (2) maintain and restore living resources of the bay, such as  controlling exotic species and protecting crabs and oysters; (3) protect  and restore vital habitats, such as wetlands and submerged aquatic  vegetation; (4) make sound land use decisions, such as land conservation;  and (5) engage the community through education and outreach. However,  the general goals are further defined as specific commitments that are  used to measure program progress.", "As of December 2003, the program was endorsing over 40 measurable  environmental commitments for the watershed.

For example, one  keystone commitment for the overall goal of maintaining and restoring  living resources in the bay, is that by 2010, at a minimum, a tenfold  increase in native oysters should be achieved in the Chesapeake Bay,  using a 1994 baseline. In addition, this commitment involves developing  appropriate research and management strategies for attaining this  increase.", "According to program officials, defining measurable goals and  commitments up front is the key to the success of the Chesapeake Bay  Program. If the goals are developed first, then they can be linked to the  appropriate measurement and tracking activities and indicators to  evaluate progress. Once program officials analyze the data collected from  monitoring, modeling, and tracking programs to determine progress, they  can decide on the appropriate actions to take to maintain or improve  conditions. Officials from organizations involved in the restoration and  protection of the bay agree that defining goals up front is important to the  restoration effort and that the Chesapeake Bay Program has done a good  job in this regard. For example, an official from the Chesapeake Bay  Foundation\uf8e7the largest conservation organization dedicated to saving the  Chesapeake Bay watershed\uf8e7stated that the Chesapeake Bay Program  does a good job in establishing clearly defined goals and commitments and  linking them to indicators and monitoring to reflect the current overall  conditions of the bay.

According to one program official, the  controversy highlights the need for reaching consensus on appropriate  measurement approaches and the need for peer review of all monitoring  and modeling protocols.", "Finally, the program is an example of how a permanent organizational  structure was established to set measurable goals and to coordinate  restoration efforts. The organizational structure of the Chesapeake Bay  Program is founded on an agreement between three states, the District of  Columbia, and EPA with an executive council leading the program. This  council consists of three governors, the Mayor of the District of Columbia,  EPA\u2019s Administrator, and a representative from the Chesapeake Bay  Commission. The council establishes measurable program goals and  commitments in such areas as water clarity after receiving input from  several program committees and subcommittees.

The required  monitoring system has not been fully developed and the vision of having  information to guide restoration efforts remains unfulfilled. While the  recent Executive Order creates a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force  within EPA to develop measurable goals and coordinate federal activities,  it is uncertain whether this task force will provide definitive, stable  leadership needed over time because it may be readily changed by future  executive orders. Additionally, while GLNPO has existing statutory  responsibility for coordinating Great Lakes activities, it is unclear how its  responsibilities and those of other organizations fit with the coordination  activities of the new task force. EPA is now taking steps to implement the  Executive Order; however, it is unclear whether this fulfills its  responsibilities under the Clean Water Act.

EPA stated that the inventory of monitoring activities is a  critical component for monitoring and reporting efforts, and adequate  controls are needed to ensure that data are accurate, current, and  complete in order to facilitate users\u2019 efforts to coordinate monitoring  activities. Accordingly, EPA stated it has begun taking steps to develop  these controls. Specifically, GLNPO will lead the U.S. efforts to track  entries into the inventory database to ensure that data from all agencies  are included. GLNPO will also request annual verification and updating by  organizations of their information to ensure that the database is accurate  and current. If effectively implemented, these steps should help ensure the  accuracy and usefulness of the inventory for coordination purposes.  Regarding our matter for the Congress to consider clarifying leadership  responsibilities, EPA stated that it believes the responsibilities for  organizational leadership in the Great Lakes for both GLNPO and Great  Lakes Interagency Task Force are clearly stated in the Clean Water Act  and the Executive Order, respectively. While EPA describes the overall  structure and responsibilities of the task force and GLNPO to support its  position, it does not address our concern that similar coordination  responsibilities are assigned to different organizations under the  Executive Order and the Clean Water Act. EPA states that the Executive  Order appoints the Great Lakes National Program Manager as chair of the  Great Lakes Regional Working Group and that this will enhance GLNPO\u2019s  ability to meet its statutory obligation to coordinate federal restoration  activities. However, this does not address our point that the Clean Water  Act assigns GLNPO the responsibility of implementing specific action  plans to carry out U.S. responsibilities under the act, while under the  Executive Order, it is the task force, not GLNPO that will implement  recommendations of the working group. Further, EPA did not address our  concern that the task force does not provide the definitive, stable  leadership that is needed over time given that its responsibilities may be  changed by future executive orders.

Each of the objectives have  two to four subobjectives that along with the objectives, are not expressed  in quantitative terms, priorities, or with established time frames. One  subobjective under the contaminants objective is that toxic substances  shall not exist in amounts detrimental to human health or wildlife and that  exotic species should be prevented from colonizing the ecosystem,  controlled where feasible, and reduced to a point where they do not impair  the ecological function of Lake Erie.

According to the plan, indicators were discussed but not selected  by a LaMP working group, and tracking progress toward goals will not  begin until indicators are selected.

For example,  reducing mercury sources 60 percent by 2000, 80 percent by 2010, and a  100 percent by 2020. Similar goals are set for the other pollutants. While  the goals are specific, the description of the monitoring process to  measure progress is less specific with little detail on the monitoring  required to measure progress toward goals. For the critical pollutants, a  menu of possible monitoring activities is mentioned, and the LaMP states  that more work is needed to develop a coordinated monitoring program to  evaluate progress toward goals and that data from state sources is needed  for measuring progress.
