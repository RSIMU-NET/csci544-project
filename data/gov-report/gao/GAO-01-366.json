Oversight of this large pool of grantees has proven to be difficult. Some grantees have spent all of their grant funds but completed only a portion of the work required in the grant agreement. In addition, some grantees, particularly nonprofit organizations with inexperienced staff, may not have adequate controls in place to ensure that funds are spent as intended or allowed. The wide- ranging problems with grant oversight have been identified in congressional hearings and EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG) reviews. These problems included spending funds for unallowable activities such as lobbying. In recognition of these problems, EPA had identified grants oversight as an agency-wide material weakness and is now in the process of validating whether the steps taken by EPA have addressed the weakness.", "To address this material weakness, EPA has issued and periodically updated a post-award policy to require proactive grant monitoring by agency staff after grants had been awarded. The monitoring is designed to ensure that grantees are meeting the conditions required by agreements, statutes, and regulations. In June 2000, EPA established agency-wide targets for performing on-site and off-site reviews of grantees. In addition to the reviews by EPA, grantees may be required to have an annual audit of their operations. Under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, grantees that spend $300,000 or more federal dollars annually must be audited. In conducting these audits, auditors select which federal program expenditures made by the grantees to review, based on criteria that combine level of expenditure and perceived risk.", "In light of problems highlighted in congressional hearings and the fact that EPA grants to nonprofit entities have increased to about $250 million annually, you asked us to determine the extent to which (1) EPA\u2019s post- award management policy, as implemented, helps identify whether EPA\u2019s nonprofit grantees are incurring unallowable costs and (2) reviews under the Single Audit Act help EPA ensure proper expenditure of its grant dollars by these grantees. In making these determinations, we gathered information on the implementation of EPA\u2019s oversight policy and single audits, both in general and specifically for nonprofit grantees."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["EPA\u2019s administration and oversight of grants is conducted by its Grants Administration Division within the Office of Grants and Debarment, by its approximately 3,000 grant project officers, and by its 10 regional grants management offices (GMO), all acting in partnership. The Grants Administration Division develops overall grants policy and is responsible for the review, award, and management of headquarters\u2019 grants. The grants project officers are responsible for oversight of the technical or programmatic aspects of the grants. The GMOs are responsible for providing oversight in the following four phases of the grant process:   pre-award\u2014EPA reviews the application paperwork and makes an award   award\u2014EPA prepares the grant documents and instructs the grantee on technical requirements, and the grantee signs an agreement to comply with all requirements;   post-award\u2014the GMO provides technical assistance, oversight, and payments to the grantee; the grantee completes the work; and the project ends; and   closeout of the award\u2014the project officer ensures project completion, the GMO initiates grant closeout documents, and the grant closeout letters are issued to the grantee.", "In the pre-award phase, the GMO reviews the grantee\u2019s application for costs that may be unallowable. EPA officials stated that reviewing the detailed listing of the costs for which the grantee proposes to seek reimbursement from EPA is the primary means used by GMOs to identify unallowable costs. EPA\u2019s revised oversight policy for GMOs focuses on the post-award phase, when an EPA project officer is responsible for each grant and provides ongoing grant oversight.", "Various audits by EPA\u2019s OIG have disclosed problems with EPA\u2019s oversight of grantees, including nonprofit grantees. For example, the OIG found that a nonprofit organization had spent all of EPA\u2019s grant funds but had completed only a small portion of the work required under the grant.In November 1999, the OIG noted several weak areas in EPA\u2019s oversight during testimony before the Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Emergency Management, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The OIG pointed out that many of the recent audits disclosed the same problems as reported in 1996, prior to EPA\u2019s new post- award policy. In November 2000, the OIG identified the use of grants to accomplish EPA\u2019s mission as one of ten key management challenges confronting EPA. Specifically, the OIG noted that recent audits of EPA\u2019s grant recipients disclosed that some grantees did not have adequate financial and internal controls to ensure federal funds were managed properly. As a result, EPA had limited assurance that grant funds were used properly and accomplished the intended results. The OIG has ongoing work related to grants oversight, and for one review it noted that EPA headquarters and one regional office had undertaken several initiatives designed to improve the grants administration process.", "The Single Audit Act, as amended, requires each nonfederal entity that expends $300,000 or more federal dollars in a year to be audited. The single audit of the entity as a whole replaces multiple grant audits. The objectives of the Single Audit Act, as amended, are to   promote sound financial management, including effective internal controls, with respect to federal awards;   establish uniform requirements for audits of federal awards;   promote the efficient and effective use of audit resources;   reduce audit and administrative burdens on state and local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit organizations; and   ensure that federal departments and agencies, to the maximum extent practicable, rely on and use audit work done pursuant to the act. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133 details how single audits are to be conducted. During a single audit, generally not all of the programs receiving federal dollars are audited. Auditors use criteria based on level of expenditure and risk to determine which programs to include in the scope of a single audit. This gives auditors greater freedom in targeting risky programs and allows for more efficient use of auditing resources.", "To assist federal agencies, the Chief Financial Officer Council\u2019s Grant Management Committee (GMC) has addressed various financial issues relevant to efficiently managing the federal government\u2019s approximately $300 billion in grant awards. The GMC, which was first convened in 1997, is composed of federal chief financial officers and other financial personnel. Currently, the GMC\u2019s primary task is to coordinate and oversee the government-wide implementation of the provisions of the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-107, Nov. 20, 1999). Two of the act\u2019s purposes are to improve the effectiveness and performance of federal financial assistance programs and to simplify the application and reporting requirements for federal financial assistance. As part of its efforts, the GMC is working on issues relating to the single audit process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Oversight of Nonprofit Grantees Is Limited and Is Not Focused on Identifying Unallowable Costs", "paragraphs": ["EPA has taken several actions to improve its oversight of nonprofit and other grantees. However, on-site reviews of nonprofit grantees are limited and do not directly address the issue of unallowable costs. Any such identification is incidental to the activities conducted at the grantee\u2019s offices, in part because EPA believes that there is greater value in assessing a grantee\u2019s system for safe-guarding EPA funds than in examining for unallowable costs. Another limiting factor in identifying unallowable costs for nonprofit grantees is the small number of times that such entities are selected for post-award monitoring. Because a large amount of grant dollars may be one of the criteria for selecting grantees for in-depth review, nonprofit grantees face a very low risk of being selected. EPA data indicate that annually the average grant amount awarded to nonprofit grantees was less than 5 percent of the average amount awarded all other grantees during fiscal years 1994 through 1999, and the average number of grants to nonprofit grantees represented less than 16 percent of all EPA\u2019s grant awards. Moreover, the on-site review teams often are not trained to identify unallowable costs. In addition, some GMO officials believe that EPA\u2019s OIG is responsible for identifying unallowable costs. While OIG officials do conduct reviews involving unallowable costs, OIG officials stated that neither GMO officials nor project officers are precluded from conducting unallowable cost reviews during their grantee on-site reviews. EPA is making efforts to improve its oversight of grantees; however, like other federal agencies, it has not been able to identify best practices for testing for unallowable costs during grant oversight."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Grantee Oversight Strategy Does Not Focus on Unallowable Costs", "paragraphs": ["EPA\u2019s grant oversight policy for GMOs prescribes basic monitoring activities, requires GMOs to develop biennial grant monitoring plans, and establishes guidance for an on-site review of at least one grantee each year. The policy classifies activities as \u201cTier I\u201d or \u201cTier II\u201d and calls for different levels of monitoring for each tier. The GMOs implement the policy according to risk-based priorities described in the biennial monitoring plans. In general, Tier I includes 10 monitoring activities relating to the grantees\u2019 administrative compliance with the laws, rules, regulations, and procedures for administering grant funds. These activities do not address unallowable costs. The GMOs review grantees\u2019 documents during these activities and do not need to conduct on-site reviews. Tier II activities comprise on-site reviews of the grantees\u2019 procurement, property, and financial systems; on-site training or technical assistance; and in-depth reviews of selected procurement, property, or financial issues. These activities also do not focus on unallowable costs.", "Both Tier I and Tier II reviews are intended to provide oversight information to EPA and assistance to the grantee. Appendix I contains a detailed description of activities associated with each tier. EPA\u2019s policy specifically states that the reviews serve as a customer-service mechanism and are not geared toward disallowing costs. Rather, the reviews are designed to verify that the grantee has systems in place that allow expenditures to be identified, captured, and traced to the appropriate ledgers and other financial records. GMO officials stated that only the most obvious unallowable costs are identified during the review process. Grant recipients are, however, notified of any unallowable costs identified during a review and are given an early opportunity to resolve the problem. EPA also works with grantees to improve or correct expenditure tracking systems as necessary.", "EPA officials believe that post-award monitoring and oversight is a responsibility of both the GMOs and program offices.  As a result, in 1999, EPA issued a second and companion policy focusing on the post-award responsibilities of EPA\u2019s program offices.  In June 2000, EPA modified both of these policies and established the grantee compliance assistance initiative, which in part established agency-wide targets of 5 to 10 percent for performing evaluative on-site and off-site visits of EPA grant recipients. EPA is currently developing a new policy on post-award monitoring that will consolidate and build upon existing policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "On-Site Reviews Are Seldom Conducted for Nonprofit Grantees", "paragraphs": ["EPA has conducted very few on-site reviews of nonprofit organizations\u2014 only a total of 36 out of approximately 900 nonprofit grantees available for reviews each year received such a review between May 1, 1998, and July 6, 2000, the period representing the most recent data available when we conducted our review. One on-site nonprofit grantee review was conducted during the last 5 months of fiscal year 1998, 14 were conducted in fiscal year 1999, and 21 during the first 9 months of fiscal year 2000.  The number of nonprofit grantees available for review in each of these years was 969, 915, and 811, respectively. EPA officials stated that they plan to increase on-site reviews of nonprofit grantees in fiscal year 2001. EPA officials also said that between October 2000 and February 2001, the Grants Administration Division performed on-site reviews of 10 nonprofit organizations and that an additional 10 such reviews are scheduled between March and September, 2001. The grantees were selected by headquarters and regional office officials based on the criteria indicated in the agency\u2019s policy, including dollar size of the grants and the officials\u2019 judgments as to which grantees posed the greatest risk of noncompliance with grant requirements. For example, because of the need to focus their resources on problems involving tribal grants, two regional GMOs had each visited only two nonprofit grantees between May 1998 and July 2000. Furthermore, the nonprofit grantees are only a small proportion of EPA\u2019s grantee population. The number of grants awarded by EPA headquarters and regions for fiscal years 1998 through 2000 is shown in appendix II. According to EPA data for fiscal years 1994 through 1999, the average dollar value of awards to nonprofit grantees\u2014about $172,000\u2014amounted to less than 5 percent of average awards to other grant recipients.", "Even though the allowability of grantee costs was not focused on during EPA on-site visits, questions concerning the allowability of costs arose for 5 of the 36 nonprofit grantees that received the on-site reviews. For two of the grantees, the questioned costs involved small claims for potentially unallowable meal costs in which the grantees were requested to repay the funds. One grantee agreed to repay the funds. Whether the questioned meal costs for the other grantee were, in fact, unallowable is not known because EPA did not follow up on the report. Action involving two other cases of questioned costs was still pending as of March 2001, and the last case was dropped pending follow-up during the next on-site review. Table 1 contains details on the number of nonprofit grantees, on-site reviews, and questioned costs by the GMOs.", "In reference to the low number of on-site reviews of nonprofit grantees, EPA officials stated that the post-award policy is just one of the tools intended to assist in the management and oversight of grant funds.

Members of this compliance team have special experience or training in accounting or auditing techniques. According to EPA officials, the headquarters team is qualified to review transactions and perform tests to identify unallowable costs. Compliance team personnel conducted all 26 of the headquarters\u2019 GMO on-site reviews, and these accounted for 4 of the 5 grant cases that questioned spending by nonprofit grantees.", "On-site reviews of nonprofit grantees within the regions are generally conducted by teams consisting of a grant specialist, project officer, and if available, a staff member from the regional finance or budget office.

Furthermore, the system does not generate the management reports needed to effectively monitor the agency\u2019s oversight activities. EPA has recently developed a new Integrated Grants Management System (IGMS) that is expected to capture administrative information on grant awards such as funding amounts and project periods. The database is expected to become fully operational in January 2003, at which time all offices will directly enter grant information into the database. EPA\u2019s OIG plans to review the IGMS once it is fully implemented. In addition to the IGMS, EPA has developed a grants compliance database that will generate management reports showing, among other things, the number of on-site and off-site reviews and technical assistance reviews conducted by each GMO. An example of this type of information is contained in appendix III. The database will also provide the GMOs with data on grantee performance and will allow the users direct access to key information such as funds used for a particular grant and grantee single audit information. The database, however, does not indicate whether a single audit was conducted for a particular grantee.

EPA\u2019s training covers all aspects of the grant process requirements, and EPA requires all project officers to attend the course. As of February 2001, about 4,800 project officers had received the training, but EPA has not assessed the impact of this training on grant oversight. In addition, EPA issued a policy in 1999 that specifically addresses the post-award responsibilities of project officers. EPA is hindered in its efforts to improve its grant oversight in part because of a lack of available best practices in other federal agencies.

The audits also assess whether grantees are complying with laws and regulations that have a material effect on their major programs. However, EPA is unable to readily identify grantees that yearly expend $300,000 or more in either EPA funds or total federal funds, requiring a single audit. EPA relies on other sources to identify grantees requiring a single audit, but limited staff training and inaccurate grantee identifying information hamper these efforts. Other federal agencies have similar difficulties in determining whether their grantees must have a single audit.

Of the approximately 400 audit reports the OIG received from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000, only 50 involved nonprofit grantees. For these 50, EPA contacted the grantees to determine how findings and recommendations were addressed. We reviewed 41 of the 50 audit reports; 7 of the reports questioned the allowability of costs totaling approximately $76,000. The questions were resolved in five cases by the grantees providing additional documentation. In two cases, representing about $6,000 of the questioned costs, the grantees adjusted their accounts to reflect the correct charges to the government. Forty of the 41 audit reports contained nonfinancial findings, which varied from audit to audit but were in three general categories: segregation of duties, timely submittal of reports, and policies and procedures. Problems associated with segregation of duties included having the same person preparing invoices for payment and balancing the accounts, or having one person responsible for requesting, approving, and receiving purchases.

Communicate with the project officer and the recipient: GMOs must communicate with each grant recipient and the project officer for each grant at least once during the life of the grant award. 3.  Monitor payments and drawdowns: GMOs should work with project officers to monitor the rate of payments and drawdowns by recipients. 4.  Assess the need for audits: GMOs should assess the need for audits under the Single Audit Act and other provisions. 5.  Monitor unliquidated obligations: GMOs should remove unobligated funds from the grants as soon as possible after the grants are no longer active. 6.  Monitor compliance with reporting requirements: GMOs should determine whether recipients are submitting required reports, such as interim and final financial status reports. 7.  Respond to relevant findings in audit reports: GMOs should ensure implementation of audit follow-up recommendations. 8.  Ascertain the need for changes to the grant agreements and initiate such action: If baseline checklists reveal the need for change, the GMOs must take steps to ensure action is taken. 9.

If on-site reviews are not feasible or cost effective, however, other available tools include desk reviews, telephone surveys, project officer questionnaires, and technical assistance reviews. The following tools and techniques are used during in-depth monitoring activities. 1.  On-site reviews: On-site review involves a GMO visit to review the grantee\u2019s entire operations including, among other things, property management, procurement, financial management, and general administration. As part of the on-site review, it is suggested that transaction testing be conducted in at least one of several areas, namely travel, payroll, purchases, procurement or property. Transaction testing involves reviewing a judgmental sample of source documents to verify that systems and procedures are in place to trace financial transactions. 2.  Desk reviews: These reviews reflect a combination of the activities under Tier I and Tier II. These tasks, however, are performed largely by telephone. 3.

We did not test the reliability of data from the Federal Audit Clearinghouse. In 2000, we reported that based upon OMB\u2019s request, the Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Inspector General performed a review of the database to assist OMB, the Census Bureau, and other users in assessing the accuracy of audit report information in the database. At that time, we reviewed the office\u2019s sampling and methodology, monitored the audit scope and the progress of the review, and discussed the preliminary results with OMB and Office of Inspector General officials. In addition, we obtained a list of all single audits that EPA\u2019s Office of Inspector General had received for fiscal years 1997-2000 that required EPA follow-up, and with the assistance of EPA\u2019s National Single Audit Coordinator, we identified those that pertained to nonprofit grantees.
