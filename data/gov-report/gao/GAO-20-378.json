Most patients get hospice care at home, which typically includes use of controlled substances, including opioids such as oxycodone, to provide pain relief. When hospice patients die at home, they often leave behind unused controlled substances, which can be diverted and misused by anyone with access to them. The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act), enacted in 2018, allows employees of qualified hospice programs to dispose of unused controlled substances by collecting and destroying the drugs in patients' homes. In addition, some states had laws allowing hospice employees to dispose of patients' unused controlled substances prior to 2018.", "Three of the seven hospices GAO contacted operate in states without such laws. Officials from two of these hospices told us their hospices began disposing of patients' controlled substances in their homes following the enactment of the SUPPORT Act in 2018. However, one hospice had not begun disposing of these medications because the state department of health directed it not to do so until a state law granting disposal authority to hospices had been enacted. An official from that hospice said that it continued the practice of leaving the controlled substances in the home and educating family members about how to dispose of the drugs themselves.", "Hospice officials we spoke to identified best practices for preventing diversion and disposing of controlled substances. Best practices include prescription drug counts performed by hospice employees to determine if controlled substances are being used properly, use of lock boxes to limit access to controlled substances in situations where diversion is suspected to be a risk, and having a witness for the disposal of unused controlled substances.", "The officials also identified challenges their hospice employees have faced when disposing of controlled substances in patients' homes. Challenges include the cost of certain disposal methods, a lack of a witness to the disposal process, and inconsistencies between state laws and federal law concerning which hospice employees may dispose of controlled substances.", "The Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Misuse of controlled substances continues to be a serious public health  problem in the United States. National survey data from the Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration show that in 2017, 53  percent of people 12 years of age and older in the United States who  misused prescription pain relievers in the past year, obtained the drugs  from friends and family. The most commonly misused controlled  substances include opioids (such as oxycodone), which are used to treat  pain, and central nervous system depressants (such as diazepam), which  are used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders. These types of drugs are  prescribed for a large proportion of patients in hospice care. Patients  select hospice care when they no longer want treatment for their terminal  illness, but rather choose a hospice team to provide symptom  management and control. In 2017, approximately 1.5 million Medicare  beneficiaries received hospice services, and 56 percent of those patients  received care in the patient\u2019s home. Medicare is the largest payer for  hospice services.", "When hospice patients die, any unused drugs left in the home create a  potential for diversion. One way to combat diversion of controlled  substances in home hospice settings is to ensure they are properly  disposed of when no longer needed by the patient. The Substance Use- Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for  Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act), enacted in October 2018,  amended prior law to allow licensed medical and nursing employees of  qualified hospices to handle patients\u2019 controlled substances for the  purpose of disposal as long as the disposal occurs onsite in accordance  with all applicable laws. The SUPPORT Act included a provision for GAO  to review the disposal of unused controlled substances in home hospice,  including federal oversight and the experiences of home hospices. In this  report, we describe selected hospices\u2019 experiences disposing of and  preventing the diversion of controlled substances in home settings.", "To describe what is known about the selected hospices\u2019 experiences  disposing of and preventing the diversion of controlled substances in  home settings, we interviewed officials from 11 selected state hospice  associations and seven selected hospices. Of the 11 selected state  hospice associations, we interviewed officials from five operating in states  with laws on the disposal of controlled substances in home hospices and  six operating in states without such laws. The information obtained from  these interviews is not generalizable, but provided us with valuable  examples of hospices\u2019 experiences with the disposal of controlled  substances. The 11 states were chosen for this review because they had  state hospice associations that were involved in disposal discussions with  national hospice associations or they had higher opioid-related death  rates than most states. The seven selected hospices whose officials we  interviewed were located in six of the 11 states. We interviewed officials  from four hospices in three of the selected states with disposal laws and  officials from three hospices in three of the selected states without  disposal laws. The hospices were chosen based on recommendations  from the national or state hospice associations with which we spoke. All  seven hospices are Medicare certified. We also spoke with officials from  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA); the National Association for Home  Care and Hospice; the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization;  the National Partnership for Hospice Innovation; the Hospice and  Palliative Nurses Association; and the Visiting Nurses Association of  America.

Most patients get hospice care at home, which  typically includes use of controlled substances, including opioids such as  oxycodone, to provide pain relief. According to CMS, hospice teams are  required to include a physician, nurse, social worker, and pastoral or  other counselor; and may also include hospice aides, trained volunteers,  and speech, physical, and occupational therapists. The patient selects a  primary caregiver when first admitted into home hospice, and this person  becomes a member of the home hospice team.

According to officials we interviewed from  the selected hospices and state hospice associations, hospices utilize  various strategies or best practices to attempt to mitigate diversion risks,  including, but not limited to, the following:", "Education on controlled substance use and disposal. Hospice  policies may include disposal education for patients and their  caregivers. Specifically, officials from five hospices and five state  hospice associations said that patient and family member education  on controlled substances and their disposal begins or should begin  upon the patient\u2019s admission into hospice care or as soon as possible  thereafter. According to officials from three hospices, their staff may  use written agreements or acknowledgements that must be signed by  the patient or their caregiver. An official from one hospice association  told us the association made an agreement template available to their  hospice members that can be used to ensure patients understand  how to properly use prescribed controlled substances, agree to use  them properly, and will not give them to anyone else.", "Prescription drug counts. Officials from four hospices and two state  hospice associations told us that, in general, nurses conduct  prescription drug counts at every visit to check if the proper amounts  of medications remain. Officials from two of these hospices said that  drug counts should require the family\u2019s acknowledgement or be  witnessed. Officials from three other state hospice associations  mentioned that their members use drug counts as well but did not  specify if this occurred at every visit. These counts can be used to  recognize possible drug misuse or diversion. If there is an indication  that diversion may be the cause of an incorrect count, hospices can  put additional drug diversion risk reduction practices in place.", "Lockboxes. If diversion is suspected to be a risk or if there are  children present in the patient\u2019s home, a hospice may choose to use a  lockbox to store the patient\u2019s medications and limit access to only an  alert patient or their caregivers. Officials from five hospices and five  state hospice associations mentioned that their employees and  members use lockboxes for such purposes. One hospice official  explained that lockboxes may also be used as an accountability tool  so that those with access cannot accuse others of stealing if drugs are  unaccounted for.", "Pharmacy cooperation. A hospice may choose to have the  pharmacy mail a prescribed controlled substance in smaller quantities  and with greater frequency. For example, an official from one of the  selected hospices explained that the pharmacy they use will deliver  medications as often as daily if needed to reduce the risk of controlled  substances being diverted. Similarly, an official from a state hospice  association explained that some pharmacy managers and benefits  managers note when a refill for a prescription is requested sooner  than it should have been and alert the hospice.", "Witnessed disposal or assisted disposal. Pursuant to some state  disposal laws and according to officials from five hospices and four  state hospice associations, controlled substance disposal and  assisted disposal must or should be performed with a witness present.  The state disposal laws may specify who the witness must be. For  example, according to two state laws, a family member or a second  hospice employee may witness disposal.", "In-home disposal products. Hospices may have varying  preferences for how they dispose of controlled substances; officials  from four of the selected hospices mentioned using in-home disposal  products, and two specifically explained they believed these to be the  safest disposal method, even though, according to the officials, it can  be costly. Officials from another hospice told us they receive their in- home disposal products through a grant program.", "Documentation. Officials from four selected hospices told us their  employees document the completion of certain tasks, such as  diversion risk assessments, drug counts, drug disposal, and the  refusal of drug disposal. An official from one of these hospices told us  their staff perform and document a diversion risk assessment of the  patient\u2019s home. While officials from four hospices told us their  employees perform drug counts, only one official specified that  employees from their hospice document the drug counts. Another  hospice official explained that disposal documentation includes the  name, dosage, form, and administration method of the medication.  One hospice official told us that if a patient\u2019s family members refuse  disposal, they must sign a form stating they declined to allow the  nurse to dispose of the patient\u2019s remaining drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Home Hospices\u2019 Challenges with Disposing of Controlled Substances", "paragraphs": ["Officials from selected hospices and state hospice associations in our  review described various challenges associated with disposing of  controlled substances in patients\u2019 homes. The challenges described by  the selected hospices and state hospice associations include but are not  limited to the following:", "Certain disposal methods may be too costly. An official from one  state hospice association said that most of its members do not use a  drug disposal process, which may include a mail-back program or in- home disposal product, because it is an extra expense, and an official  from one hospice said that after pricing an in-home disposal product,  their hospice decided it was cost prohibitive. One state hospice  association official explained that although most of its in-home  hospice members use an in-home disposal product, in instances  when the hospice employee is disposing of 40 to 50 vials, the  expense of this disposal method can be burdensome. The official told  us the product costs approximately $6 each and fits four to five vials  of pills in each.", "Disposal can be time consuming. One hospice official said that  disposal can sometimes be a time-consuming and resource-intensive  activity. According to two state hospice association officials,  sometimes a patient\u2019s family will ask the disposing hospice employee  to dispose of all of the patient\u2019s unused prescription drugs that remain  in the home, not only controlled substances or drugs prescribed under  hospice care. Officials from two of our selected hospices and two  state hospice associations told us that it is not atypical for a hospice  patient to have bags or boxes full of unused medications, though the  officials did not describe this as a disposal challenge for hospices.", "Lack of a witness. One hospice official told us that it is a challenge  when a witness is not available or is unwilling to participate in a drug  count or disposal. Another hospice official indicated that the patient\u2019s  primary caregiver is not always the family member present at the time  of a drug count or disposal. This can create a challenge, as the  hospice employee must either wait for the patient\u2019s primary caregiver  to arrive, or for that person to agree to witness a count, disposal, or  both.", "Family members and caregivers sometimes refuse to dispose of  controlled substances. Officials from two hospices and three state  hospice associations indicated that a family\u2019s refusal to dispose of a  patient\u2019s remaining medications can be a challenge, though one  hospice official said it occurs infrequently. An official from another  hospice said that if a family initially refuses disposal, hospice staff  return after two weeks to complete the disposal process.", "Inconsistencies between state laws and federal law. Hospices  must comply with applicable federal and state laws governing  controlled substances, and to the extent state law is inconsistent with  the Controlled Substances Act, hospices must follow federal law.  Hospice officials told us that inconsistencies between state laws and  federal law can cause challenges. For example, the SUPPORT Act  limits disposal to only physicians, physician assistants, nurses, or  other hospice employees who are licensed to provide medical or  nursing services. An official from one hospice stated that the hospice  used the help of social workers and volunteers to dispose of  controlled substances. Regulations in this state do not specify which  types of hospice employees are permitted to assist with disposal.  According to the official, social workers and volunteers helped dispose  of patients\u2019 controlled substances when disposal occurred at a later  time, rather than immediately following a patient\u2019s death. Since the  SUPPORT Act limits disposal to home hospice personnel with specific  qualifications, it is unclear whether hospices are able to allow social  workers and volunteers to help in that capacity.", "As another example, under the SUPPORT Act, only a hospice  patient\u2019s DEA-registered physician can dispose of the patient\u2019s  controlled substances if the plan of care has been modified.  However, some state laws allow other types of hospice employees to  perform disposal in this circumstance. Officials from two hospices in  these states indicated it will be a challenge for disposal to be limited to  physicians when a patient\u2019s plan of care is modified. Similarly, officials  from two other selected hospices in states without disposal laws also  stated that this would be a challenge. For example, one hospice  official explained that their hospice does not have many physicians,  and it would be unlikely for a physician to be able to visit a patient\u2019s  home solely to handle disposal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Justice and  Health and Human Services for review.
