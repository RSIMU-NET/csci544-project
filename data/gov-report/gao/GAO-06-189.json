In addition, Congress is considering legislation to establish a grant program to help tribes improve telecommunications services on their lands. This report discusses 1) the status of telecommunications subscribership for Native Americans living on tribal lands; 2) federal programs available for improving telecommunications on these lands; 3) barriers to improvements; and 4) how some tribes are addressing these barriers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on the 2000 decennial census, the telephone subscribership rate for Native American households on tribal lands was substantially below the national level of about 98 percent. Specifically, about 69 percent of Native American households on tribal lands in the lower 48 states and about 87 percent in Alaska Native villages had telephone service. While this data indicates some progress since 1990, changes since 2000 are not known. The U.S. Census Bureau is implementing a new survey that will provide annual telephone subscribership rates, though the results for all tribal lands will not be available until 2010. The status of Internet subscribership on tribal lands is unknown because no one collects this data at the tribal level. Without current subscribership data, it is difficult to assess progress or the impact of federal programs to improve telecommunications on tribal lands. The Rural Utilities Service and the FCC have several general programs to improve telecommunications in rural areas and make service affordable for low-income groups, which would include tribal lands. In addition, FCC created some programs targeted to tribal lands, including programs to provide discounts on the cost of telephone service to residents of tribal lands and financial incentives to encourage wireless providers to serve tribal lands. However, one of FCC's universal service fund programs that supports telecommunications services at libraries has legislatively based eligibility rules that preclude tribal libraries in at least two states from being eligible for this funding. FCC officials told GAO that it is unable to modify these eligibility rules because they are contained in statute and thus modifications would require legislative action by Congress. The barriers to improving telecommunications on tribal lands most often cited by tribal officials, service providers, and others GAO spoke with were the rural, rugged terrain of tribal lands and tribes' limited financial resources. These barriers increase the costs of deploying infrastructure and limit the ability of service providers to recover their costs, which can reduce providers' interest in investing in providing or improving service. Other barriers include the shortage of technically trained tribal members and providers' difficulty in obtaining rights of way to deploy their infrastructure on tribal lands. GAO found that to address the barriers of rural, rugged terrain and limited financial resources that can reduce providers' interest in investing on tribal lands, several tribes are moving toward owning or developing their own telecommunications systems, using federal grants, loans, or other assistance, and private-sector partnerships. Some are also focusing on wireless technologies, which can be less expensive to deploy over rural, rugged terrain. Two tribes are bringing in wireless carriers to compete with the wireline carrier on price and service. In addition, some tribes have developed ways to address the need for technical training, and one has worked to expedite the tribal decision-making process regarding rights-of-way approvals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The telephone subscribership rate for Native Americans living on tribal  lands has historically lagged behind the overall national rate.

In the  Communications Act, Congress directs the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) to base policies for the preservation and advancement  of universal service on principles that include, among other things, making  quality services available at reasonable rates and providing access to  advanced services throughout the nation. Specifically mentioned in this  regard are low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high-cost  areas\u2014categories that include many Native Americans living on tribal  lands in rural or remote locations. To help develop and improve  telecommunications service on tribal lands, Congress is considering  authorizing a grant program specifically for federally recognized tribes. To  assist Congress, you requested that we examine several aspects of  telecommunications on tribal lands. Accordingly, we reviewed 1) the status  of telecommunications subscribership (telephone and Internet) for Native  Americans on tribal lands in the lower 48 states and Alaska; 2) federal  programs available for improving telecommunications on tribal lands; 3)  the barriers that exist to improving telecommunications on tribal lands;  and 4) how some tribes are addressing these barriers.", "To determine the status of telecommunications subscribership for Native  Americans on tribal lands in the lower 48 states and Alaska (there are no  federally recognized tribal lands in Hawaii), we analyzed 2000 decennial  census data for federally recognized reservations and trust lands. We did  not include Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Areas (OTSAs) in our analysis. We  also interviewed officials representing individual tribes, tribal  organizations, telecommunications providers, industry organizations, and  federal agencies. To determine the availability of federal programs that  provide financial and technical assistance to improve telecommunications  services on tribal lands, we interviewed officials from several federal  agencies and obtained information on federal programs. To determine the  barriers that exist to improving telecommunications services on tribal  lands and how some tribes have addressed these barriers, we interviewed  tribal officials, tribal organizations, service providers, equipment  manufacturers, federal agencies, and others. We reviewed previous studies  that discussed telecommunications services on tribal lands. Additionally,  we conducted interviews with officials of 26 tribes and 12 Alaska regional  native nonprofit organizations, chosen on the basis of demographic and  other information, such as actions being taken to improve  telecommunications on their land. For our site visits, we then selected 6  tribes that had taken some action to overcome one or more of the most  frequently cited barriers to improving telecommunications. During the  visits, we interviewed tribal officials and observed the tribes\u2019  telecommunications systems, ongoing improvement efforts, and  challenges. While the interviews and site visits cannot be projected to all  tribes, the information gathered allows us to describe a range of barriers  and how tribes are addressing these barriers. For more detailed  information on how tribes were chosen for both the interviews and the site  visits, and other aspects of our review, see appendix I.", "We conducted our audit work from August 2004 through December 2005 in  Washington, D.C., and at the Coeur D'Alene Tribe of the Coeur D'Alene  Reservation, Idaho; Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation,  Washington; Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina; Oglala  Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota; Mescalero  Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Reservation, New Mexico; and Navajo  Nation in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.

Our work was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to the 2000 Census, approximately 588,000 Native Americans  were residing on tribal lands. Tribal lands vary dramatically in size,  demographics, and location. They range in size from the Navajo Nation,  which consists of about 24,000 square miles, to some tribal land areas in  California comprising less than 1 square mile (see figure 1). Over 176,000  Native Americans live on the Navajo reservation, while other tribal lands  have fewer than 50 Native residents. The population on a majority of tribal  lands is predominantly Native American, but some tribal lands have a  significant percentage of nonNative Americans. In addition, while most  tribal lands are located in rural or remote locations, some are located near  metropolitan areas. Tribes are unique in being sovereign governments  within the United States. The federal government has recognized the  sovereign status of tribes since the founding of the United States. The U.S.  Constitution, treaties, and other federal government actions have  established tribal sovereignty. To help manage tribal affairs, tribes have  formed governments or subsidiaries of tribal governments that include  schools, housing, health, and other types of corporations. In addition, the  Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior has a  fiduciary responsibility to tribes and assumes some management  responsibility for all land held in trust for the benefit of the individual  Native American or tribe.", "In Alaska, federal law directed the establishment of 12 for profit regional  corporations, 1 for each geographic region comprised of Natives having a  common heritage and sharing common interests, and over 200 native  villages. These corporations have become the vehicle for distributing land  and monetary benefits to Alaska Natives to provide a fair and just  settlement of aboriginal land claims in Alaska. The Native villages are  entities within the state that are recognized by BIA to receive services from  the federal government. The 12 regional corporations have corresponding  nonprofit arms that provide social services to the villages.", "Native American tribes are among the most economically distressed groups  in the United States. According to the 2000 Census, about 37 percent of  Native American households have incomes below the federal poverty  level\u2014more than double the rate for the U.S. population as a whole.  Residents of tribal lands often lack basic infrastructure, such as water and  sewer systems, and telecommunications services. According to tribal  officials and government agencies, conditions on tribal lands have made  successful economic development more difficult than in other parts of the  country. A study done for the federal government, based on research  gathered in 1999, found that the high cost and small markets associated  with investment in tribal lands deter business investment.", "The federal government has long acknowledged the difficulties of  providing basic services, such as electricity and telephone service, to rural  areas of the country. The concept of universal telephone service has its  origins in Section 1 of the Communications Act, which states that the  Federal Communications Commission was created \u201cfor the purpose of  regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and  radio so as to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the  United States a rapid, efficient, nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio  communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges\u2026.\u201d  The goal of universal service is to ensure that all U.S. residents have access  to quality telephone service regardless of their household income or  geographic location. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 reaffirmed the  commitment to universal service and expanded it to include not just  traditional telephone service but access to advanced telecommunications  services (such as high-speed Internet access) for schools, libraries, and  rural health care providers.", "A 1995 report by the Census Bureau based on 1990 census data noted that  about 47 percent of Native American households on tribal lands had  telephone service, compared to about 95 percent of households  nationally. In June 2000, the FCC Chairman noted that the Commission\u2019s  universal service policies \u201chad yielded a remarkable rate of telephone  subscribership, above 90 percent for the nation as a whole.\u201d However, he  also noted that telephone subscribership among the rural poor was roughly  20 percent lower than the rest of the nation, while Native Americans living  on tribal lands were only half as likely as other Americans to subscribe to  telephone service. In August 2000, FCC identified certain categories of  Americans, including Native Americans, who were having difficulty  obtaining access to advanced telecommunications services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tribal Telephone Subscribership Rate Is Substantially Below the National Level and Internet Subscribership Rate Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["According to data from the 2000 decennial census, the rate of telephone  subscribership for Native American households on tribal lands was  substantially below the national rate of 97.6 percent.

Figure 2 shows the  number of tribal lands within various percentile ranges of telephone  subscribership for Native American households, based on our analysis of  2000 decennial census data. We have separated Alaska Native tribal lands  from the tribal lands in the lower 48 states because telecommunications  infrastructure in Alaska differs from that of the lower 48 states due to  Alaska\u2019s weather and terrain. The data is shown for 198 tribal lands in the  lower 48 states and 131 tribal lands in Alaska. Tribal lands with fewer than  100 people are not included in the data available from the Census Bureau.  In these areas, there must be at least 100 people in a specific group,  including American Indian and Alaska Native tribal groupings, before data  will be shown.", "As figure 2 shows, there was considerable variation among tribes regarding  telephone subscribership rates, with some comparable or higher than the  national rate but most below it\u2014and many substantially so. We found, for  example, that the Kalispel tribal land in Washington had a telephone  subscribership rate of 100 percent, while the tribal lands of the Kickapoo  Traditional Tribe of Texas had a rate of 34 percent. To get a better  understanding of telephone subscribership rates by individual tribe and  population size, we reviewed data for the 25 tribal lands with the highest  number of Native American households. These 25 tribal lands represent  about 65 percent of all Native American households, as shown in Census  2000 data. The lands vary greatly in the number of Native American  households located on them (from about 46,000 for the Navajo Nation to  about 1,100 for Fort Berthold) and in geographic size, with the Navajo  Nation\u2019s lands comprising about 24,000 square miles and the Eastern Band  of Cherokee\u2019s land comprising about 83 square miles.", "As shown in figure 3, the Native American household telephone  subscribership rates for these most populous tribal lands were all below  the national rate of 97.6 percent. Nine of the 25 tribal lands, representing  about 44 percent of Native American households on tribal lands in the  lower 48 states, had telephone subscribership rates at a level below 78  percent\u2014which is about what the national rate was over 40 years ago when  the 1960 decennial census was taken. The subscribership rate for the most  populous tribal land\u2014the Navajo\u2014was only 38 percent.", "Because the 2000 decennial census is the most current data available on  telephone subscribership rates on tribal lands, it is not known whether  these rates have changed between 2000 and the present. To help improve  the accuracy of the next decennial census and collect demographic,  socioeconomic and housing data in a more timely way, the Census Bureau  developed the American Community Survey (ACS), which includes a  question on telephone service. In January 2005, the Census Bureau began  sending out the ACS questionnaire to households. Annual results will be  available for populations on all individual tribal lands by summer 2010, and  sooner for tribal lands with populations over 20,000. This schedule is based  on the time it will take to accumulate a large enough sample to produce  data for areas with populations as small as 600 people."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Federal Data Available on Internet Subscribership Rates For Tribal Lands", "paragraphs": ["The status of Internet subscribership on tribal lands is unknown because  no federal survey has been designed to track this information. Although the  Census Bureau and FCC currently collect some national data on Internet  subscribership, and FCC also collects some state level data, none of their  survey instruments are designed to estimate Internet subscribership on  tribal lands. In addition, officials of both agencies told us that to the best of  their knowledge, no other federal agency collects data on Internet  subscribership.", "Unlike telephone subscribership data, the 2000 decennial census did not  collect information on Internet subscribership, nor is the Census Bureau  currently collecting it on the ACS. The Census Bureau does collect some  national data on Internet subscribership through the Current Population  Survey (CPS). However, this monthly survey of households conducted by  the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics is designed primarily  to produce national and state estimates for characteristics of the labor  force. To obtain national and state estimates on Internet subscribership  rates, supplemental questions on Internet and computer use have been  added to the CPS questionnaire. According to a Department of Commerce  report, based on October 2003 CPS data, the Internet subscribership rate  for U.S. households was about 55 percent. However, Commerce  Department officials told us that the CPS sample cannot provide reliable  estimates of Internet subscribership on tribal lands because there are not  enough tribal land households in the sample to provide a reliable measure.", "FCC collects data on the deployment of advanced telecommunications  capability in the United States, but this data cannot be used to determine  Internet subscribership rates for tribal lands. Pursuant to section 706 of  the Telecommunications Act of 1996, FCC is required to conduct regular  inquiries concerning the availability of advanced telecommunications  capability for all Americans. To fulfill its mandate, FCC has issued four  reports, starting in January 1999, on the availability of advanced  telecommunications capability in the United States. To obtain data for  these reports, FCC requires service providers to report the total number of  high-speed lines (or wireless channels), broken down by type of  technology, for each state. For each of the technology subtotals, providers  also report additional detail concerning the percentage of lines that are  connected to residential users and a list of the zip codes where they have  at least one customer of high-speed service. Because the providers are not  required to report the total number of residential subscribers in each zip  code to whom they provide high-speed service, and because tribal lands do  not necessarily correspond to zip codes, this data cannot be used to  determine the number of residential Internet subscribers on tribal lands.  Finally, data on the availability of \u201cdial-up\u201d Internet access is not provided  in these reports for any areas in the country because it is not considered an  advanced telecommunications capability.", "The FCC has acknowledged that the zip code data present an elementary  view of where high-speed Internet service subscribers are located. In  particular, its data collection method does not fully describe some  segments of the population, such as Native Americans residing on tribal  lands. FCC has recognized that its section 706 data collection efforts in  rural and underserved areas need improvement to better fulfill Congress\u2019  mandate. Without current subscribership data, it is difficult to assess  progress or the impact of federal programs to improve telecommunications  on tribal lands.", "In a September 2004 letter to the Census Bureau, the FCC Chairman at that  time stated that in order to better implement section 706 of the  Telecommunications Act, FCC needs to know the rate of Internet  subscribership, and particularly, the rate of Internet subscribership in  smaller and more sparsely populated areas of the country, that would  include tribal lands. Given the limitations of the current Census Bureau and  FCC data collection efforts, FCC requested the Census Bureau add a  question to the ACS regarding Internet subscribership. The ACS is designed  to collect information for communities across the country, including small  geographic areas such as small towns, tribal lands, and rural areas.", "Both FCC and Census Bureau officials told us that if a question is added to  the ACS, it would provide Internet subscribership data for the nation and  smaller geographic areas. An FCC official also noted that a comparative  survey like the ACS, one that shows the differences of Internet  subscribership between tribal lands and other geographic areas, is far more  valuable than a survey that only collects Internet subscribership data on  tribal lands. Census Bureau officials mentioned to us, however, that there  are several methodological issues related to making changes to the ACS.  Because adding questions would lengthen the ACS and could result in a  reduced response rate, the Census Bureau\u2019s current practice is to add a  question to the ACS only if it is mandated by law. They told us that section  706 of the Telecommunications Act mandates that FCC, not the Census  Bureau, be responsible for collecting data on advanced  telecommunications. Therefore, Congress would need to pass legislation  mandating that the Census Bureau collect Internet subscribership data.

Enhanced Link-Up provides qualified participants with one-time discounts  of up to 100 dollars on installation fees. Enhanced Lifeline provides  ongoing discounts on basic local telephone service that enable some  qualified participants to pay as little as 1 dollar a month.

This data can be broken out by  state, but not by tribal land, because the reporting form does not ask  service providers to indicate the number of participants and amount of  funding by tribal land. State-level data, however, has limited use in  measuring the performance of these programs with respect to individual  tribal lands. Nearly all the states containing tribal lands have more than one  of them, as shown earlier in figure 1, so their data is a sum total of multiple  tribal lands.

As defined by the Communications Act, service providers  must be designated as an ETC in order to participate in FCC\u2019s universal  service programs. The Act gives the individual states the primary  responsibility for designating ETCs. Initially, the Act made no provision for  cases where a service provider might not be subject to state jurisdiction,  such as those operating on tribal lands. In 1997, Congress amended the Act  by requiring FCC to determine a service provider\u2019s eligibility to receive  federal universal service funds in cases where a state lacks jurisdiction to  make an ETC determination. In response, FCC developed a process by  which a service provider seeking ETC status for serving a tribal land may  petition the Commission to determine whether the provider is subject to  the state commission\u2019s jurisdiction. If the FCC finds that the state does not  have jurisdiction, FCC can make the ETC determination.", "To date, FCC has received ten applications for ETC designations involving  tribal lands. Six of the applications were from tribally-owned wireline  service providers, and four were from non-tribally-owned wireless service  providers. FCC provided the tribally-owned wireline providers with ETC  status within a few months of their application. Two different non-tribally  owned wireless service providers petitioned FCC for ETC designation on  three separate tribal lands. As indicated in table 7, FCC granted one of  these three petitions in 10 months. Another was withdrawn by the provider  after more than three years with no FCC decision, while the third has been  pending at FCC for more than 3 years.", "FCC has noted that determining whether a state or FCC has ETC  jurisdiction regarding a tribal land is \u201ca legally complex and fact specific  inquiry, informed by the principles of tribal sovereignty, federal Indian law,  treaties, as well as state law.\u201d When we asked about the long timeframes  involved with the first and third items in table 7, FCC officials explained  that they must conduct a case-specific inquiry for each application to  determine whether the Commission has the authority to make an ETC  designation. In its 2001 Western Wireless decision, FCC noted that it would  resolve the Western Wireless ETC decision in light of the guidance  provided by the Supreme Court in Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544  (1981). This case sets out the guiding principle that Indian tribes lack  jurisdiction to regulate nonmembers on the reservation, but it recognized  two exceptions. Applying this framework to the service agreement  between the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Western Wireless, FCC granted  Western Wireless ETC status over its service to tribal members living  within the Pine Ridge reservation.", "FCC has not issued any further guidance on how it will make its ETC  decisions on tribal lands. FCC officials told us that the information needed  to make a determination may change from application to application. They  said that they try to complete these designations in a timely fashion, but  applicants may not provide sufficient information, and staff normally  dedicated to these issues may need to focus on other issues facing FCC. In  2000, FCC sought public comment on the creation of a 6-month timeline for  the resolution of jurisdictional issues surrounding an ETC designation on  tribal lands. However, in 2003 FCC formally decided against creating this  timeline because determining FCC\u2019s jurisdiction over ETC designation on  tribal lands \u201cis a legally complex inquiry that may require additional time to  fully address.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tribal Libraries\u2019 Eligibility for E-rate Funding", "paragraphs": ["Some tribal officials we spoke with emphasized the importance of tribal  libraries as a means for members to have Internet access and expressed  concern about their difficulty in obtaining E-rate funding for their libraries.  Under current eligibility requirements, tribal libraries can apply for  universal service fund support through the E-rate program provided they  meet eligibility requirements. The Communications Act defines E-rate  eligible libraries as those eligible for assistance from a state library  administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology Act  (LSTA), which provides federal grant funds to support and develop library  services in the United States. LSTA has two types of library grants that  primarily relate to governmental entities: one for states and one for  federally recognized tribes and organizations that primarily serve and  represent Native Hawaiians.To be eligible for E-rate funds, a tribal library  must be eligible for state LSTA funds and not just tribal LSTA funds.", "The eligibility criterion has practical implications for tribal libraries.  Although we did not survey all the states on this issue, officials in two  states told us that their state laws preclude tribal libraries within their  states from being eligible to receive state LSTA funds, which has the effect  of making them ineligible to receive E-rate funds. Officials in Oklahoma  said that only county and city libraries are eligible for state funding such as  LSTA monies. Tribal libraries are not county or city libraries and therefore  not eligible for Oklahoma\u2019s state LSTA funds. One former tribal librarian in  Oklahoma told us that she did not apply for E-rate funding because the  state library administrative agency provided her with documentation  indicating that the tribe was not eligible for state LSTA funds. Montana  officials told us that their state law also has similar limitations regarding  tribal libraries\u2019 eligibility for state LSTA funds.", "The eligibility criterion also has practical implications for the E-rate  program. Libraries applying for LSTA funds must self-certify their  eligibility. As part of its integrity process, USAC requires a third party  verification of the eligibility requirement. Thus, USAC verifies a library\u2019s  eligibility for E-rate funds by asking state library administrative agencies to  provide written certification of a library\u2019s eligibility for state LSTA funds.  This process has prompted a number of comments from several of those  we interviewed. Some tribal and state library agency officials noted that the  current eligibility criterion infringes on tribal sovereignty by involving the  state in tribal library E-rate funding. One state librarian, for example,  expressed discomfort at being put in the position of acting on behalf of a  sovereign tribe and expressed the strong belief that eligibility for E-rate  funding should be a matter between the tribe and USAC, without  involvement by state government agencies. USAC officials told us that they  have received some E-rate applications from tribal libraries. In those  cases, a USAC board member successfully worked with the states in  question to obtain the certifications. However, USAC officials and the  USAC board member emphasized the time-consuming nature of these  resolution efforts.", "In fall 2002, FCC, USAC, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services  (IMLS) officials met to discuss possible remedies for this situation. These  discussions produced a consensus that a change to the E-rate eligibility  requirement for libraries defined in the Communications Act could  facilitate tribal libraries\u2019 eligibility for E-rate funding. These discussions  focused on a modification to the Act that would allow tribal libraries  eligible for funding from either a state library administrative agency or  tribal government under the LSTA to be eligible for funding under the  E-rate program.

These two barriers were also cited by representatives of  service providers and federal agencies. These two barriers are interrelated,  can deter providers from investing in infrastructure on tribal lands, and  contribute to the low levels of subscribership on many tribal lands.", "Tribal lands are mostly rural and characterized by large land areas, rugged  terrain such as mountains and canyons, low population density, and  geographic isolation from metropolitan areas. Figure 4, from the Pine Ridge  Indian Reservation in South Dakota, illustrates some of these  characteristics.", "Generally, these factors make the cost of building and maintaining the  infrastructure needed to provide service higher than they would be in  urban settings. For example, more cable per customer is required over  large, sparsely populated areas, and when those areas are mountainous, it  can be more difficult and costly to install the cable. The Rural Task Force,  formed by the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service,  documented the high costs of serving rural customers in a report issued in  January 2000, which stated that the average telecommunications  infrastructure cost per customer for rural providers was $5,000, while the  average infrastructure cost per customer for non-rural providers was  $3,000. Officials from 17 tribes and 11 Alaska regional native non-profit  organizations we interviewed told us that the rural location of their tribe is  a telecommunications barrier.", "Tribes\u2019 limited financial resources are also seen as a barrier to improving  telecommunications services on tribal lands. Many tribal lands\u2014including  some of those we visited such as the Navajo, the Mescalero Apache, the  Yakama and the Oglala Sioux\u2014have poverty rates more than twice the  national rate, as well as high unemployment rates. The 2000 U.S. Census  showed that the per capita income for residents on tribal lands was $9,200  in 1999, less than half the U.S. per capita income of $21,600. Officials of 33  of the 38 Native American entities we interviewed told us that lack of  financial resources was a barrier to improving telecommunications  services. Several of these tribal officials told us that their tribal  governments must use their tribes\u2019 limited financial resources on other  priorities such as water and sewer lines, housing, and public safety. In  addition, high levels of poverty on many tribal lands may also make it less  likely that tribal residents will subscribe to those telephone and Internet  services that are available, particularly when geographic barriers have  increased the costs of those services. For example, a Yakama Nation tribal  official told us that many residents cannot afford a computer or Internet  access; some cannot even afford telephone service.", "These two factors, the rural location of tribal lands (which increases the  cost of installing telecommunications infrastructure) and tribes\u2019 limited  financial resources (which can make it difficult for residents and tribal  governments to pay for services) can combine to deter service providers  from making investments in telecommunications on tribal lands. This lack  of investment can result in a lack of service, poor service quality, and little  or no competition. With regard to a lack of service, an official with the  Yakama Nation told us that while many tribal residents in the more heavily  populated areas have access to telephone service, the tribe\u2019s service  provider has not built additional infrastructure to reach less populated  areas and has no plans to do so in the near future. A representative of the  company that provides service to the Coeur d\u2019Alene tribe told us that  high-speed Internet was only available in certain areas of the Coeur d\u2019Alene  tribal land, that there were no immediate plans to expand the service area,  and that there were cost issues in providing service to the more remote and  less densely populated parts of the reservation. Another provider\u2019s  representative told us that providing digital subscriber lines (DSL) to  most parts of the Eastern Band of Cherokee\u2019s reservation would not be  profitable because the land is rugged and to connect many of those who  live out in remote rural areas would require an investment that would be  difficult to justify. With regard to service quality, of the 38 tribes and tribal  representatives we interviewed, 9 mentioned service quality as a barrier to  improved telecommunications. One tribe told us that their local provider  has no local service office and few technicians, so that the company may  take days to repair or respond to a problem. With regard to the lack of  competition, officers of 2 tribes told us that because there is only 1  provider, they have no choice but to pay the prices being charged for  services, even though they think the prices are too high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Technically-Trained Tribal Members Can Impede Planning and Was the Third Most Commonly Cited Barrier", "paragraphs": ["The third barrier most commonly cited by tribal representatives was the  lack of tribal members trained in or knowledgeable about  telecommunications technologies. Officials of 13 of the 38 Native American  tribes and tribal organizations we interviewed told us that lack of  telecommunications training and knowledge among tribal members is a  barrier to improving their telecommunications. Some of these officials said  they needed more technically trained members to plan and oversee the  implementation of telecommunications improvements, as well as to  manage existing systems. For example, one tribal official told us that he is  currently understaffed and is running a multi-tribe wireless network with  just one other person. Another tribal official told us that there is only one  tribal member with formal training in telecommunications and that the  tribe needs a well trained person to take charge of the tribe\u2019s  telecommunications needs. An official of the Coeur d\u2019Alene tribe, who has  technical training, told us that the tribe does not have a sufficient number  of technically knowledgeable staff members to develop and maintain  needed telecommunications systems.", "The same Coeur d\u2019Alene tribal official also told us that tribes without  technically trained staff would be at a disadvantage in negotiating with  service providers. This official added that having tribal members trained in  telecommunications was necessary to ensure that a tribe\u2019s planned  improvements included the equipment and technology the tribe wanted  and needed. In addition, one non-tribal stakeholder mentioned that a lack  of training prevented tribes from choosing appropriate technologies for  their specific needs. One industry stakeholder mentioned that tribes  needed a better understanding of the range and capacity of shared  spectrum wireless technology so they would not be disappointed by its  limitations. A 1995 Office of Technology Assessment study of  telecommunications on tribal lands stated that most Native American  reservations, villages, and communities would benefit from developing a  plan or vision of how telecommunications could best meet their  educational, health, economic development, and cultural needs. In 1999,  the Department of Commerce estimated that very few tribes had  telecommunications plans. Of the 38 tribes and tribal organizations we  interviewed, 14 told us they have some type of technology plan and 7 more  said they had a plan in development.", "Industry stakeholders also told us that having tribal staff knowledgeable in  telecommunications policies improves the process of deploying services on  tribal lands. One service provider told us that if tribes delegated  telecommunications decisions to a tribal governmental committee, the  company could provide service more effectively and efficiently. Instead,  when a company has to bring telecommunications decisions before the full  tribal council, the process can be very time consuming because the full  tribal council meets infrequently and telecommunications issues are often  not at the top of the agenda. Another provider told us that having staff  knowledgeable in telecommunications policies and procedures, such as  rights of way and contract issues, allows providers to more quickly and  effectively deploy services because time is not spent negotiating over  unfamiliar terms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rights-of-Way Issues Were Also Cited as a Barrier to Improved Telecommunications Services on Tribal Lands", "paragraphs": ["According to several service providers and tribal officials, obtaining a  right-of-way through Indian lands is a time-consuming and expensive  process that can impede service providers\u2019 deployment of  telecommunications infrastructure. The right-of-way process on Indian  lands is more complex than the right-of-way process for non-Indian lands  because BIA must approve the application for a right-of-way across Indian  lands. BIA grants or approves actions affecting title on Indian lands, so all  service providers installing telecommunications infrastructure on Indian  lands must work with BIA or its contractor (realty service provider) to  obtain a right-of-way through Indian lands. To fulfill the requirements of  federal regulations for rights-of-way over Indian lands and obtain BIA  approval, service providers are required to take multiple steps and  coordinate with several entities during the application process. These steps  must be taken to obtain a right-of-way over individual Indian allotments as  well as tribal lands. Several of the steps involve the landowner, which could  be an individual landowner, multiple landowners, or the tribe, depending  on the status of the land. For example, the right-of-way process requires a)  written consent by the landowner to survey the land; b) an appraisal of the  land needed for the right-of-way; c) negotiations with the landowner to  discuss settlement terms; d) written approval by the landowner for the  right-of-way; and e) BIA approval of the right-of-way application.", "Service providers told us that a lack of clarity in federal regulations for  rights-of-way over Indian lands can also slow down the right-of-way  approval process. During the right-of-way approval process, BIA has a  responsibility to ensure that the right-of-way suits the purpose and size of  the equipment being installed on the land. However, federal regulations do  not have guidance or descriptions for advanced telecommunications  infrastructure, which would assist BIA in evaluating telecommunications  rights-of-way applications. According to a Department of the Interior  official, descriptions and guidance for advanced telecommunications  infrastructure are absent because the regulations were created prior to the  advent of modern telecommunications equipment. For example, the federal  regulations have guidance and descriptions for the size of the right-of-way  needed and voltage levels of electrical equipment that can be installed for  commercial purposes, but similar descriptions and guidance are not  available for advanced telecommunications rights-of-way. According to  service providers, this lack of clarity can cause grey areas for BIA when it  attempts to classify the type of advanced telecommunications  infrastructure the service provider intends to install and whether it is for  commercial or residential purposes. This adds time to the right-of-way  approval process because BIA has to determine if the regulations allow for  the installation of the applicant\u2019s infrastructure. A BIA official  acknowledged that portions of the federal regulations, including the  section on telecommunications infrastructure, are outdated. As a result,  BIA is currently revising the regulations to better apply to modern utility  technologies, including advanced telecommunications infrastructure, but  timeframes for completion of this work have not been established.", "As mentioned above, BIA requires that service providers obtain approval  from the individual landowner or the tribe for a right-of-way. Service  providers told us that obtaining landowner consent for a right-of-way  across an individual Indian allotment is time consuming and expensive,  which can delay or deter deployment of telecommunications infrastructure  on tribal lands. For example, one service provider told us that an individual  Indian allotment of land can have over 200 owners, and federal regulations  require the service provider to gain approval from a majority of them. The  official stated that the time and cost of this process is compounded by the  fact that a telecommunications service line often crosses multiple  allotments.

Following this approval  process, NNTRC intends to implement this policy.", "In addition, NNTRC officials stated that there is a more feasible price  structure for telecommunications rights-of-way that better reflects the  market value of telecommunications rights-of-way. This price structure  would include an upfront payment covering the market value of the land  plus an additional percent of future earnings from the equipment. The  officials told us that this type of arrangement would assist the service  provider\u2019s business case because the provider would have to release less  capital in the beginning of the project, while offering telecommunications  services to Navajo residents.

The current statutory provision does not  allow tribal libraries to obtain E-rate funding for libraries unless the tribal  library is eligible for assistance from a state library administrative agency  under LSTA. In at least two cases, tribes have not applied for E-rate funds  because their tribal libraries are not eligible for state LSTA funds.
