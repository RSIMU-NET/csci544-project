To be eligible for a direct loan, a borrower must be unable to obtain commercial credit at reasonable rates and terms. To obtain a guaranteed loan, a lender must certify that it is unwilling to make the loan without a government-backed guarantee. Direct loans are made at lower interest rates and for longer repayment periods than guaranteed loans. When direct loan borrowers demonstrate financial progress, they are to graduate to commercial credit. If properly implemented, this process enforces FmHA\u2019s mission to supply temporary credit and makes direct loan funds available for other high-risk farmers needing financial assistance.", "Although FmHA has traditionally provided more direct loans than guaranteed loans, it began to use more guaranteed loans in the mid-1980s.

County office officials are to thoroughly evaluate these borrowers\u2019 financial position by considering their financial strengths, income capabilities, and other characteristics that relate to meeting local lenders\u2019 criteria. For those identified as candidates for commercial credit through this process, FmHA requires that they be requested to graduate or to provide information documenting why they cannot graduate.", "However, FmHA\u2019s field office officials do not always conduct the reviews to identify which borrowers are potential candidates for graduation. Almost 200 borrowers, or about 17 percent, of the approximately 1,160 borrowers who FmHA should have reviewed for graduation potential during fiscal years 1991 and 1992 at the 12 county offices we visited were not reviewed. County office supervisors said they did not review the borrowers because they believed other pressing work was more important, such as servicing delinquent borrowers. In addition, another 310 borrowers, or about 27 percent, at these 12 offices were removed from consideration without any reasons annotated in the county offices\u2019 records for their removal. County office supervisors could not explain why the borrowers were removed from consideration.", "Of 115 direct loan borrowers identified for graduation to commercial credit at these county offices, the FmHA supervisors did not take the additional steps required to graduate 54 borrowers or to conclude that they could not graduate. For 32 borrowers, the county office supervisors said they did not try to graduate them because they believed the borrowers could not meet local lenders\u2019 credit standards. For the remaining 22 borrowers, the county office loan files showed that the borrowers had not responded to the county offices\u2019 request to graduate and that the county office supervisors had not taken any further action. If a borrower fails to respond, the county office supervisor may consider the borrower to be in default as provided for in the loan agreement. A county office supervisor may then initiate action to accelerate repayment of the loan or legal action to foreclose on the loan. In taking such actions, the county office supervisor must obtain the concurrence of the FmHA district and state office officials and, if legal action is involved, USDA\u2019s Office of General Counsel. However, some county office supervisors said they did not pursue more forceful action with borrowers who did not provide the requested financial information because they did not believe that higher-level officials would support their efforts.", "Our review indicates that some of the borrowers who did not graduate to commercial credit had financial circumstances indicating that they could have moved from the direct loan program if the county office supervisors would have followed through as required. For example, a borrower obtained a $28,000, 40-year soil and water loan in 1987 and paid off $1,300 by June 1993. According to June 1989 financial information in his FmHA loan file, the borrower had a net worth of over $400,000 and liabilities of about $116,000. The borrower did not comply with the county office\u2019s request for financial information during the 1991 graduation review. In early 1993, the borrower was again asked to provide updated financial information, but no response had been received as of August 1993. The county office\u2019s supervisor acknowledged that FmHA should have taken further action to force this borrower to graduate.

The loan classification system is designed to record FmHA\u2019s current judgment of all borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans. The objectives of the system are to assess the overall quality of FmHA\u2019s loan portfolio, estimate loan losses to the government, assess the need for any special loan servicing, and improve the management of the loan program. Classifications are to be assigned when loans are made and updated whenever a borrower\u2019s financial condition changes significantly. As shown in table 3.2, borrowers are classified on a 1-to 5-scale, with the highest-quality loans described as \u201ccommercial\u201d (category 1) and the lowest quality described as a \u201closs\u201d (category 5).", "However, in many cases, FmHA\u2019s county offices did not assign a correct classification, and in other cases they did not keep the classifications current, as required. As of September 30, 1993, FmHA\u2019s records showed that about 27,000, or about 20 percent, of FmHA\u2019s approximately 140,000 direct loan borrowers were classified in the two highest loan categories, indicating that they should be candidates for graduation. Of these, 4,856 were classified as commercial, and 22,331 were classified as standard. In reviewing 171 borrowers who were classified as commercial quality borrowers at the 12 county offices we reviewed, county office officials told us that 112 borrowers, or about 66 percent, were improperly classified because they had insufficient income or inadequate loan security to meet minimum commercial credit standards.", "County office supervisors explained that many borrowers were simply categorized incorrectly when originally classified. They stated that when the system was implemented in 1988, they had only a limited time to classify all borrowers. In their haste to meet the deadline to classify each borrower, county office supervisors relied on personal knowledge in lieu of supporting financial documents. Moreover, they said that in some cases, they did not update the borrowers\u2019 classifications because they do not view the information as useful to them.", "In accordance with congressional requirements, FmHA is developing a plan to improve its graduation process. In December 1993, 8 months after the date established in the Agricultural Credit Improvement Act of 1992 for implementing such action, FmHA published a proposal in the Federal Register to improve the graduation process and plans to implement it in November 1994. The principal change in the proposed regulations strengthens the process by identifying potential graduation candidates on the basis of their financial condition as recorded in FmHA\u2019s loan classification system. Specifically, borrowers classified in the top two categories\u2014i.e., commercial and standard quality\u2014are to be reviewed each year for graduation.

For example, FmHA plans to issue regulations requiring that borrowers\u2019 loan classifications be updated at least every 2 years and that borrowers who are classified as commercial or standard grade borrowers be referred to commercial lenders every 2 years. However, FmHA did not provide specifics on how it plans to ensure that county office officials perform the required review of borrowers\u2019 loan classifications and their potential for graduation or graduating those borrowers who qualify.

Specifically, eight commercial lenders suggested that the interest rate that FmHA charges should be increased over time so that the rates eventually match commercial rates. Such increases could cause borrowers to start looking elsewhere for financing as the advantage of below-market rates is eliminated.

According to the ABA, because there is no interest rate adjustment mechanism in place for FmHA\u2019s direct loans, borrowers are encouraged to remain in the program, particularly when the rates remain low in relation to commercial rates. For example, while interest rates on guaranteed operating loans made in 1992 averaged 9.8 percent, FmHA\u2019s direct loans were often made at 7 percent.", "On the other hand, implementing a proposal that routinely causes interest rates to increase without considering the borrowers\u2019 financial condition could adversely affect some borrowers\u2019 abilities to repay their loans on schedule and thus result in defaults.", "With respect to the suggestion for shortening FmHA\u2019s farm ownership loan terms, which typically run 40 years, some of the commercial lenders we interviewed and the ABA Task Force agreed with the need for shorter terms. The ABA emphasized that having a maturity date preceding the amortization date of the loan would enforce FmHA\u2019s purpose of being a temporary lender. Likewise, 10 of the lenders we interviewed told us that longer repayment terms act as a disincentive to get borrowers to move from the direct loan program.

While these revisions should result in a lessening of the paperwork required for some lenders, many of the lenders that we interviewed did not know that FmHA was attempting to streamline the loan application process.", "On the related suggestion that FmHA should stop requiring lenders to obtain and submit financial and production history data for borrowers when applying for guaranteed loans to repay existing direct loan debts, ABA officials and some of the lenders we interviewed questioned the need to submit such data, which the county offices should already have. Also, the lenders said that while FmHA requires 5 years of historical data, some lenders usually consider only the past 3 years in deciding on an application. ABA officials further recommended that if a commercial lender was willing to repay a borrower\u2019s outstanding direct loan debt with a guaranteed loan, then FmHA should simply \u201cpass through\u201d the person\u2019s outstanding debt to the bank without the need to submit any new or additional paperwork. In such cases, the ABA officials said that there is no need for an entire application package as with a new applicant/borrower. Fifty-eight percent of the 53 lenders we interviewed told us that eliminating this requirement could result in an increase in the use of the guaranteed farm loan program to repay applicants\u2019 outstanding direct loan debts.", "The third change suggested by lenders was that they, rather than FmHA\u2019s county committees, should be allowed to certify applicants\u2019 eligibility to receive guaranteed loans. Specifically, county committees, which consist of two members elected by local farmers and one designated by FmHA, decide on the eligibility of applicants to participate in FmHA\u2019s farm loan programs. Among other things, two of the lenders who had guaranteed loans said they have encountered personal bias by some county committee members against their loan applicants, and six others said that county committees have been slow in making decisions on guaranteed loan applications. One lender illustrated the situation as follows: The bank makes lending decisions on a daily basis, but it is delayed in making guaranteed loans if the applications do not arrive in time for a county committee meeting or if the committee requests additional information.

The Con Act currently limits the guarantee to 90 percent for all loan-use purposes. Forty of the 53 lenders we interviewed said that such a change would increase their use of the guaranteed loan program to repay an applicant\u2019s outstanding direct loan debt. Twenty-seven of these lenders suggested a 100-percent guarantee, and 12 others suggested a 95-percent guarantee (one did not suggest a specific percentage above 90 percent). Furthermore, one lender said that FmHA\u2019s guarantee percentage should be reduced over time, after a borrower demonstrates a record of loan repayment. FmHA has a 100-percent exposure with direct loans. If a 95-percent guarantee was provided on a loan for repaying outstanding direct loan debt, then the government\u2019s risk exposure would be reduced by 5 percent. If a 100-percent guarantee was provided on a loan for that purpose, then FmHA would only have the additional risk for any accrued interest and liquidation costs over what those costs would be to the agency.", "Another proposed change was for FmHA to remove the guaranteed loan fee for borrowers whose direct loan debts were being refinanced with guaranteed loans. FmHA charges lenders a 1-percent loan origination fee for the federal guarantee, which lenders usually pass on to borrowers. For example, if a loan is for $200,000 and the guarantee is for 90 percent, then the guaranteed amount is $180,000, and the fee is $1,800. Removing this fee when any part of a guaranteed loan is being used to repay direct loan debt could be an added inducement for borrowers to seek guaranteed loans. Five lenders suggested removing the fee on loans involving the repayment of direct loan debt in order to make the guaranteed program more viable. For example, one lender said that the fee adds to a borrower\u2019s cost, and another said that borrowers can use the added cost as an excuse for not seeking to move from their direct loans. Although FmHA requires county supervisors to waive this fee when more than half of the guaranteed loan funds are being used for refinancing direct loan debt, two county office supervisors we interviewed said they do not waive the fee on any guaranteed loan.", "The third change that some commercial lenders and county supervisors suggested was that FmHA\u2019s authority for making subsidized loans under the Interest Assistance Program should be increased. Under this program, which is an interest subsidy program, a lender is reimbursed by FmHA for charging a borrower an interest rate that is less than the lender\u2019s regular rate. Some lenders and county supervisors told us that this program has helped some direct loan borrowers obtain guaranteed farm operating loans. However, the agency has not been authorized to use the program for farm ownership loans.

The exact number, while unknown, probably would not be a high percentage of FmHA\u2019s approximately 140,000 direct loan borrowers because many have marginal production and financial histories. Nonetheless, moving any portion of the outstanding direct loan borrowers to the commercial sector is desirable if the government\u2019s risk exposure can be adequately protected.
