Members of Congress have questioned whether federal health care programs' payment practices create incentives for providers to prescribe these drugs.", "GAO was asked to examine public programs' and private health insurers' payment practices for compounded drugs. GAO examined (1) Medicare's, Medicaid's, and private health insurers' payment practices for compounded drugs and (2) the extent to which these payment practices for compounded drugs affect their use. GAO reviewed the payment policies of CMS, the five largest state Medicaid programs, five of the largest insurers that offer both Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans as well as private plans, and the two largest Medicare Part D-only sponsors.

These programs and plans use claims information to determine whether compounded drug ingredients are products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or are bulk drug substances\u2014usually raw powders\u2014that are generally not approved by FDA. Two of the five insurers and one of the two Medicare Part D-only sponsors we spoke with generally do not pay for these substances in their Medicare Part D plans. Four of the five state Medicaid programs and three of the five insurers offering private health plans we spoke with generally do not pay for ingredients that are bulk drug substances in their respective plans.", "For drugs administered in outpatient physician office settings, claims lack information to identify compounded drugs because there are no specific billing codes for most of these drugs. Therefore, Medicare, most state Medicaid programs, and most private health insurers pay for these compounded drugs. Some public programs and private health insurers conduct further claims reviews for compounded drugs billed under nonspecific codes, including obtaining information that can be used to determine FDA-approval status of compounded drug ingredients, and make payment decisions based on this information.", "Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for administering the Medicare program\u2014has a national payment policy for compounded drugs under Medicare Part B, but this policy is unclear. The policy generally states that drugs must be FDA-approved to be paid for under Medicare. Payment may be available for compounded drugs, but the policy does not stipulate whether payment is available for ingredients that are bulk drug substances, which are generally not FDA-approved. CMS contractors who process Part B claims do not collect information on the FDA-approval status of drug ingredients and, therefore, may be paying for ingredients that are not FDA-approved products. Thus, it is uncertain whether Medicare payments are inconsistent with Part B policy.", "Payment practices of public programs and private health insurers may affect the use of compounded drugs when specific payment exclusions exist, such as those for bulk drug substances; however, other factors also affect the use of compounded drugs. For example, insurers that restrict payment for compounded drugs dispensed in pharmacy settings in their private health plans to only ingredients that are FDA-approved products saw significant decreases in both the number of claims and the amount of payments for these drugs after they implemented these restrictions. Individual patient need, such as the need for custom dosages, and drug shortages also affect the use of compounded drugs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS clarify its Medicare Part B payment policy to either allow or restrict payment for compounded drugs containing bulk drug substances and align payment practices with this policy.

Drug compounding is typically used to prepare prescription  drugs that are not commercially available; for example, a pharmacist may  prepare a liquid formulation for a patient who has trouble swallowing pills  or tailor a drug for a patient who is allergic to an ingredient in a  commercially available prescription drug. Drug compounding is practiced  in a variety of pharmacy settings, including retail pharmacies, mail-order  pharmacies, and home infusion pharmacies, as well as hospital  pharmacies. Compounded drugs may be dispensed directly to patients in  pharmacy settings, or administered to patients in inpatient or outpatient  settings, such as hospitals or physician offices.", "FDA regulations define a bulk drug substance as any substance that is represented for  use in a drug and that, when used in the manufacturing, processing, or packaging of a  drug, becomes an active ingredient or a finished dosage form of the drug, but the term  does not include intermediates used in the synthesis of such substances. 21 C.F.R.   \u00a7 207.3(4)(2014). compounded drugs without prescriptions for individual patients and selling  those drugs to facilities in multiple states with no assurance of their  having met the safety and legal requirements with which drug  manufacturers must comply. In addition, in 2012, an outbreak of fungal  meningitis linked to contaminated compounded drugs raised concerns  about the safety and quality of compounded drugs. In July 2013, we  reported on FDA\u2019s oversight of entities that compound drugs and found  that FDA\u2019s oversight was limited.", "Questions have also been raised about the cost of compounded drugs.  The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists estimates that  the compounding industry makes up 1 to 3 percent of the $300 billion  retail prescription drug market in the United States in 2014. Pharmacy  benefit managers (PBM)\u2014companies that contract with health insurers to  manage prescription drug benefits and process and pay claims\u2014have  expressed concerns that, while these drugs make up a small percentage  of prescription drug claims, costs for compounded drugs, particularly  those made with bulk drug substances, are increasing. For example, one  PBM reports that the number of claims it received for compounded  prescription drugs from retail pharmacies in one of its health insurer\u2019s  plans increased 35 percent over a 12-month period between 2012 and  2013. Additionally, members of Congress have raised questions about  potential financial incentives for providers to prescribe or dispense these  drugs that may be inadvertently created by the coverage and  reimbursement practices of public health care programs, such as  Medicare and Medicaid, and private health plans. For example, in 2004,  one congressional committee attributed the growth of the compounded  drug industry to payments for these drugs under Medicare Part B\u2014the  part of the Medicare program that covers certain physician, outpatient  hospital, laboratory and other services, and medical equipment and  supplies. In addition, this committee raised concerns that the coverage  and payment practices of Medicare Part D sponsors\u2014that is, those health  insurers that administer the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit\u2014 might be interpreted the same way as Medicare Part B policies and lead  to increased use of compounded drugs under the benefit. In 2006,  another congressional committee raised similar concerns about Medicare  Part B and Part D benefits.", "You asked us to examine public programs\u2019 and private health insurers\u2019  payment practices for compounded drugs, as well as any possible  financial incentives created by these practices.

However, in July 2014, the Part D-only  sponsor that currently pays pharmacies for bulk drug substances  announced its plans to discontinue payments for most of these  substances by March 2015. This decision to cease paying for bulk  drug substances was a result of the sponsor\u2019s internal analyses  showing that pharmacies have been increasing their billed amounts  for the ingredients not covered by Part D, including bulk drug  substances, used to make compounded drugs; as a result, the  sponsor\u2019s costs for these ingredients began to exceed its costs for the  ingredients covered by Part D in compounded drug claims in early  2014.", "Under Medicaid, CMS provides federal matching dollars to states that  opt to pay for compounded drugs under the prescription drug benefit,  including those that contain bulk drug substances, and has issued a  notice to the states informing them of this policy.

As a result, most of these public programs and private  health insurers pay for compounded drugs, including both the FDA- approved products and bulk drug substances that comprise these drugs,  because they may be unable to identify whether compounded drugs were  administered and what individual ingredients were used to make the  compounded drugs. For drugs administered in outpatient settings, public  programs and private health insurers generally rely on specific codes for  individual drugs in the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System  (HCPCS)\u2014a standardized coding system used by public programs and  private health insurers to help ensure medical claims are processed in a  consistent manner\u2014to indicate whether a beneficiary received a  prescription drug, including a compounded drug, on an insurance claim.

Officials from two of the insurers we spoke  with that offer Medicare Advantage plans told us that they review all  claims with compounded drugs billed under the nonspecific code and  request additional information. Officials from one of these insurers told  us that the insurer requires providers to submit NDCs for each  ingredient to determine which ingredients are FDA-approved products  and does not pay for bulk drug substances, unless the insurer  determines that they are medically necessary. Officials from the other  insurer told us that the insurer requires providers to submit supporting  documentation, including invoices that list the name and amount of  each ingredient in the compounded drug. A third insurer reviews  claims and requests additional documentation only when the amount  for a drug billed under the nonspecific HCPCS code on a claim  exceeds a certain dollar amount but does not require NDCs to  determine which ingredients are FDA-approved products. For these  claims, the insurer uses NDCs primarily to calculate payments, likely  for all ingredients in the compounded drug.

However,  neither state uses NDCs to determine which ingredients are FDA- approved products. Both states pay for compounded drugs, including  those that contain bulk drug substances, if they determine the drugs  are medically necessary. Officials from two other state Medicaid  programs told us that the states require providers to submit NDCs for  every HCPCS drug code and not just the nonspecific code, and  providers may not submit more than one NDC with the nonspecific  code. For one of these states, officials told us that providers may not  bill compounded drugs as single line items on claims; rather,  providers must bill each ingredient with the nonspecific code and the  ingredient\u2019s NDC. This state uses the NDCs to determine which  ingredients are FDA-approved products and does not pay for bulk  drug substances. Officials from the other state told us that the state  assigns a short list of NDCs for FDA-approved products to the  nonspecific HCPCS code and updates it annually when CMS updates  the HCPCS code database. Officials told us that the state\u2019s claims  processing system will automatically reject those claims with the  nonspecific code that are accompanied by an NDC that is not on the  state\u2019s list. Two insurers offering Medicaid managed care plans  process claims for compounded drugs billed under nonspecific  HCPCS codes in a similar manner as they do for compounded drugs  billed in their Medicare Advantage plans.

Medicare contractors calculate payments for compounded drugs  based on the invoice price submitted by the provider, which may also  include taxes and shipping fees. Officials from the state Medicaid  program that requires NDCs for each ingredient and pays only for FDA- approved products told us that they calculate payment based on either  the Medicare Part B rate or the pharmacy rate of reimbursement for each  FDA-approved product. The state that allows for the use of the  nonspecific HCPCS code with only certain NDCs calculates payment  based on the wholesale acquisition cost. Four insurers that offer Medicare  Advantage, Medicaid managed care, and private health plans calculate  payments based on either (1) the provider-submitted price for the drug,  which may include payment for non-FDA-approved bulk drug substances;  (2) common drug pricing benchmarks, such as wholesale acquisition cost,  for the NDC of each FDA-approved product; or (3) the state Medicaid  program\u2019s fee schedule.

Because Medicare Part B policy for compounded  drugs is unclear, it is uncertain whether payment for such ingredients is  consistent with that policy.", "In addition to having unclear policies, CMS does not know how much it  has paid for compounded drugs under Part B, the number of  compounded drug claims it paid, or whether compounded drugs paid for  under Part B were made using bulk drug substances. Having access to  such information may help ensure that payment for such drugs is  consistent with CMS policy. CMS lacks this information because the  agency does not collect any information that the contractors responsible  for processing Medicare Part B claims obtain during their review of claims  with the nonspecific HCPCS code, including amounts paid to providers for  compounded drugs based on the invoice price, which CMS officials  attributed to limitations in claims processing systems. In April 2014, HHS  OIG reported on payments for compounded drugs in Medicare Part B and  found that neither CMS nor its contractors track compounded drug claims  and confirmed what CMS officials told us about neither the agency nor  the contractors being able to determine the total number of these claims,  or CMS\u2019s payments, for compounded drugs. HHS OIG recommended that  CMS establish a method specifically to identify compounded drugs on  those Part B claims that contain the nonspecific HCPCS code in order to  track compounded drug claims, as these claims undergo manual review  because of the code and not because they are for compounded drugs.  HHS OIG also found that, while most Medicare contractors require  providers to list the individual ingredients that made up a compounded  drug billed under the nonspecific HCPCS code in a text field on a claim,  they do not require NDCs for these ingredients. NDCs could be used to  (a) identify whether an ingredient is an FDA-approved product or a bulk  drug substance and (b) help determine ingredient price for the purposes  of calculating payment. In August 2014, CMS officials told us that the  agency was working to implement HHS OIG\u2019s recommendation regarding  a compounded drug indicator for Part B claims. Without specific  information indicating whether a beneficiary received a compounded drug  in an outpatient setting or what ingredients made up the compounded  drug, CMS may be may be paying for such drugs in a manner that is  inconsistent with its policy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Payment Practices, among Other Factors, May Affect the Use of Compounded Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the public programs and private health insurers we spoke  with generally agreed that payment practices for compounded drugs may  affect the use of these drugs. Officials from CMS, one state Medicaid  program, three of the five insurers, the two Part D-only sponsors, and the  three PBMs with whom we spoke stated that payment practices for  compounded drugs did affect their use, specifically when public programs  and private health insurers excluded payments for bulk drug substances  in retail pharmacy settings. In most cases, payment exclusions for bulk  drug substances resulted in a decreased use of compounded drugs in  these insurers\u2019 plans, particularly for compounded drugs dispensed in  pharmacy settings. For example, according to CMS, a 2012 analysis of  Part D data showed that compounded drugs comprised less than one  percent of all Part D claims in that year, which is likely due at least in part  to Part D drug rules that exclude payment for bulk drug substances. CMS  officials told us that the small number of claims for compounded drugs is  a result of the law limiting Medicare Part D payment to FDA-approved  drugs. The Part D sponsor that pays for bulk drug substances in  compounded drugs saw its costs for these bulk drug substances increase  significantly between January 2012 and March 2014 and, as a result, will  cease payments for these substances by March 2015. In contrast to this  sponsor, officials from two insurers that do not pay for bulk drug  substances in their Medicare Advantage plans that include Part D  benefits told us that payments for compounded drugs have remained  generally steady, with no significant increases or decreases. The  experiences of the Part D sponsor and the two insurers suggest that   Part D payment practices may affect the use of compounded drugs.  Further, officials from one of the three insurers that pay for ingredients  that are FDA-approved products only and do not pay for bulk drug  substances in their private health plans in the commercial market told us  that these practices have resulted in a decrease in compounded drug  claims and payments. For example, officials from one of the insurers told  us that, in 2011, the insurer\u2019s payments for compounded drugs decreased  by 205 percent in the quarter after it ceased paying for bulk drug  substances.", "Officials from one insurer that limits payment to only FDA-approved drugs  in its private health plans in the commercial market and officials from one  PBM expressed concern that manufacturers of bulk drug substances and  outsourcing facilities are inflating the AWP of the bulk drug substances  used to make compounded drugs. Further, these officials, as well as  officials from two other PBMs, told us that outsourcing facilities are  actively marketing their products to physicians, who may not know what  ingredients these products contain or be sure of the compounded  products\u2019 clinical benefits. Officials from one PBM said several of these  outsourcing facilities are pushing certain compounded drugs onto the  market through partnerships they have established with physicians who  own shares in these facilities.", "Officials from the majority of associations representing health care  providers we spoke with cited factors other than payment practices that  affect the use of compounded drugs\u2014primarily individual patient need  and drug shortages. Officials from CMS and some of the states and  insurers we spoke with also told us that these factors affected the use of  compounded drugs. For example, officials from CMS, 11 associations,   3 insurers, and 2 pharmaceutical standards-setting organizations told us  that physicians primarily prescribe compounded drugs due to individual  patient needs such as (1) the lack of a commercially available product for  a patient\u2019s specific treatment needs; (2) a patient\u2019s allergy to an inactive  ingredient, such as a dye or a filler, in an available FDA-approved drug;  (3) a patient\u2019s need for a different delivery format for the drug, such as a  patient who cannot swallow pills and needs a liquid formulation; or (4) a  patient\u2019s need for custom dosage requirements, such as a pediatric  patient who needs a lower dosage of a commercially available drug. In  addition to individual patient need, officials from 7 of the 11 associations  and 2 state Medicaid programs we spoke with also cited shortages of  certain FDA-approved drugs as a significant factor contributing to the  need to prescribe and use compounded drugs.from one association told us that nutrition drugs that need to be  administered intravenously are frequently in shortage. Patients who need  these nutrition drugs sometimes require a combination of more than 20  drugs, all of which are FDA-approved. However, according to officials  from this association, many of these FDA-approved nutrition drugs have  been in shortage since 2010 and, therefore, clinicians have to use  compounded intravenous nutrition drugs made with bulk drug substances  instead."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Compounded drugs account for a small but likely growing percentage of  all prescription drugs dispensed in retail pharmacies, but the number of  these drugs administered in outpatient settings\u2014as well as how much  public programs and private health insurers are paying for them\u2014is  unknown. The lack of information about use and payments results from  the fact that, unlike retail claims, outpatient health insurance claims,  including Medicare Part B claims, may not contain information specific  enough to identify whether a compounded drug was administered or what  ingredients were used to make it. Medicare Part B policy for payment for  compounded drugs is also unclear and instructs CMS contractors to deny  payment for non-FDA-approved drugs but is silent with respect to whether  payment is available for ingredients\u2014namely, bulk drug substances\u2014in a  compounded drug that are not FDA-approved. In addition, CMS may be  unable to appropriately apply Medicare payment policy because CMS\u2019s  Medicare contractors do not collect information needed to determine  whether each ingredient used to make a compounded drug administered  in an outpatient setting is FDA-approved. As a result, CMS may have paid  for compounded drugs containing bulk drug substances in outpatient  settings inconsistently with its payment policy and incurred additional  expenses in the process.

For example, CMS should consider updating the Medicare  Part B payment policy to either explicitly allow or restrict payment for  compounded drugs containing bulk drug substances and, as appropriate,  develop a mechanism to indicate on Medicare Part B claims both whether  a beneficiary received a compounded drug and the drug\u2019s individual  ingredients in order to properly apply this policy and determine payment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review, and its comments  are reprinted in appendix I. In its comments, HHS disagreed with our  recommendation that CMS clarify the Medicare Part B payment policy  and align payment practices with the policy as necessary. HHS also  provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In disagreeing with our recommendation to clarify the Medicare Part B  payment policy, HHS stated that it did not believe that clarifying the policy  to specifically address payments for bulk drug substances was necessary  at this time. HHS commented that the Part B payment policy does not  currently distinguish between compounded drugs that contain bulk drug  substances and compounded drugs that contain FDA-approved products  but, rather, recognizes differences between compounded drugs and FDA- approved manufactured drugs. According to HHS, the policy allows for  payment for compounded drugs prepared in a manner that does not  violate the FDCA and does not permit payment for drugs manufactured or  otherwise prepared in a manner that is inconsistent with the FDCA. As we  state in the report, the Part B policy indicates the agency\u2019s view that, to  be eligible for Medicare coverage, FDA must have approved the drug for  marketing, while at the same time indicating that payment is available for  compounded drugs. We also note that neither bulk drug substances nor  compounded drugs, regardless of their ingredients, are generally  approved by FDA. Based on HHS\u2019s comments, CMS does not consider  the FDA-approval status of compounded drug ingredients in making   Part B payment determinations and focuses on whether the drug was  prepared in a manner consistent with the FDCA. We appreciate HHS\u2019s  explanation of this distinction; however, we maintain that the Part B policy  should be clarified to explicitly contain this exception for compounded  drugs.", "With regard to HHS\u2019s comment that payment is not made for drugs  manufactured or otherwise prepared in a manner that is inconsistent with  the FDCA, including cases in which FDA has determined that a company  is producing compounded drugs in violation of the FDCA\u2014such as a  company compounding drugs on a large scale that resembles  manufacturing\u2014the extent to which CMS ensures compliance with this  policy is unclear. As noted by HHS OIG in its April 2014 report on  Medicare Part B payments for compounded drugs, Medicare contractors  generally review claims for compounded drugs to determine payment  amounts and assign payments on the basis of the description of the drug  given by the provider on the claim. The HHS OIG report was silent on  whether the contractors also review these claims to determine who  produced the compounded drug but noted that CMS contractors, whose  specific policies and requirements for claims vary, do not necessarily  require providers to submit this information. As we note in the report, and  as the HHS OIG report confirmed, CMS does not collect information from  the Medicare contractors on payments for compounded drugs, and  neither CMS nor its contractors track claims or payment amounts for  these drugs. Therefore, CMS does not know what compounded drugs the  contractors paid for or whether the contractors were able to determine  whether the company that produced the compounded drug had been  found by FDA to be in violation of the FDCA for the purposes of denying  payment in adherence with the Part B policy. In addition, it is unclear  whether CMS contractors are collecting sufficient information to identify  specific bulk drug substances used to make compounded drugs. This  information will be necessary for the contractors to make payment  determinations when FDA finalizes its lists of bulk drug substances that  may or may not be used for compounding under the FDCA.", "In addition, HHS commented on the limitations of the Part B claims  systems that would prevent CMS from collecting detailed information,  such as NDCs of drug ingredients, from claims. However, HHS noted that  CMS concurred with the HHS OIG recommendation to develop a modifier  or other mechanism to identify claims for compounded drugs, which is  consistent with our recommendation. In light of CMS\u2019s inability to obtain  detailed information about compounded drug ingredients collected by its  contractors, we remain concerned that the agency is unable to ensure  that payments are made in accordance with the Part B policy.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
