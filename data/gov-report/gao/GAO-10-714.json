GAO and the Office of Personnel Management have developed strategic workforce guidance that recommends, among other things, that agencies (1) assess workforce needs, such as foreign language needs; (2) assess current competency skills; and (3) compare workforce needs against available skills. However, DHS has done little at the department level, and individual components' approaches to addressing foreign language needs and capabilities and assessing potential shortfalls have not been comprehensive. Specifically: (1) DHS has no systematic method for assessing its foreign language needs and does not address foreign language needs in its Human Capital Strategic Plan. DHS components' efforts to assess foreign language needs vary. For example, the Coast Guard has conducted multiple assessments, CBP's assessments have primarily focused on Spanish language needs, and ICE has not conducted any assessments. By conducting a comprehensive assessment, DHS would be better positioned to capture information on all of its needsand could use this information to inform future strategic planning. (2) DHS has no systematic method for assessing its existing foreign language capabilities and has not conducted a comprehensive capabilities assessment. DHS components have developed various lists of foreign language capable staff that are available in some offices, primarily those that include a foreign language award program for qualified employees. Conducting an assessment of all of its capabilities would better position DHS to manage its resources. (3) DHS and its components have not taken actions to identify potential foreign language shortfalls. DHS officials stated that shortfalls can affect mission goals and officer safety. By using the results of needs and capabilities assessments to identify foreign language shortfalls, DHS would be better positioned to develop actions to mitigate shortfalls, execute its various missions that involve foreign language speakers, and enhance the safety of its officers and agents. DHS and its components have established a variety of foreign language programs and activities but have not assessed the extent to which they address potential shortfalls. Coast Guard, CBP, and ICE have established foreign language programs and activities, which include foreign language training and award payments. These programs and activities vary, as does DHS's ability to use them to address shortfalls. For example, foreign language training programs generally do not include languages other than Spanish, and DHS officials were generally unaware of the foreign language programs in DHS's components. Given this variation and decentralization, conducting a comprehensive assessment of the extent to which its programs and activities address shortfalls could strengthen DHS's ability to manage its foreign language programs and activities and to adjust them, if necessary."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS comprehensively assess its foreign language needs and capabilities and identify potential shortfalls, assess the extent to which existing foreign language programs are addressing foreign language shortfalls, and ensure that these assessments are incorporated into future strategic planning.

DHS\u2019s components are located on our coastlines and  land borders and throughout the country and abroad. In carrying out their  daily responsibilities, many of the men and women at DHS frequently  interact with individuals who do not speak English, or rely on information  that needs to be translated from another language to English. DHS staff  encounter a wide array of languages and dialects, under sometimes  difficult and unpredictable circumstances, including arrests, surveillance,  and interviewing individuals.

Our work  has examined (1) the use of foreign language skills as well as (2) the  nature and impact of foreign language shortages at federal agencies,  particularly those that play a central role in national security. We have  reported that lack of foreign language capability at some agencies,  including the Departments of Defense and State as well as the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI), have resulted in backlogs in translation of  intelligence documents and other information, adversely affected agency  operations, and hindered U.S. military, law enforcement, in counterterrorism, and diplomatic efforts. We and the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) have developed strategic workforce planning  guidance that has formed the basis for our prior reviews on foreign  language capabilities at other departments. We recommended that these  agencies adopt a strategic, results-oriented approach to manage foreign  language capabilities, including setting a strategic direction, assessing  agency gaps in foreign language skills, and taking actions to help ensure  that foreign language capabilities are available when needed, among other   Most recently, in September 2009, we reported that Department of  things.

The earliest assessment was conducted in 1999,  and the most recent assessment was conducted in 2009. We selected the  Coast Guard, CBP, and ICE to review because they comprise a broad  representation of program areas whose missions include law enforcement  and intelligence responsibilities. We then selected locations based on  geographic regions, border locations, and language use. The locations we  visited were San Antonio and Laredo, Texas; Artesia, New Mexico; New  York City and Buffalo, New York; Miami, Florida; and San Juan, Puerto  Rico.

For  example, Coast Guard Maritime Safety and Security Teams conduct  patrols and monitor migration flow from countries neighboring the  Caribbean Basin, including Colombia, Venezuela, Haiti, and the Dominican  Republic. In fiscal year 2009, the Coast Guard increased its presence in the  vicinity of Haiti to deter mass migration and interdicted nearly 3,700  undocumented persons attempting to illegally enter the United States.  Additionally, during fiscal year 2009, the Coast Guard reported screening  over 248,000 commercial vessels and 62 million crew and passengers for  terrorist and criminal associations prior to arrival in U.S. ports, identifying  400 individuals with terrorism associations.

Annually, CBP reports that it has direct contact  with approximately 1 million people crossing borders through ports of  entry each day. It is through these contacts that CBP has a potential  likelihood of encountering non-English speakers. As a result, foreign  language skills are needed to assist CBP federal law enforcement officers  in enforcing a wide range of U.S. laws. In 2009, CBP encountered over  224,000 undocumented immigrants and persons not admissible at the ports  of entry. CBP employs over 45,000 employees, including border patrol  agents stationed at 142 stations with 35 permanent checkpoints, Air and  Marine agents and officers, and CBP officers and agriculture specialists  stationed at over 326 ports of entry located at airports, seaports, and land  borders along more than 5,000 miles of land border with Canada, 1,900  miles of border with Mexico, and 95,000 miles of U.S. coastline.

According to Coast Guard officials, they face difficulty  in meeting their foreign language needs because of the difficulties  experienced by personnel in obtaining qualifying proficiency scores on the  Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT). To meet foreign language  program requirements, DLPT testing results are used to make allocation  decisions for foreign language speakers. For example, according to the  Foreign Language Program Manager, at one of its offices near Brownsville,  Texas, the Coast Guard has native Spanish-speaking personnel who  successfully use Spanish during operations but are not testing high enough  on the DLPT and thus are not considered during allocation decisions for  foreign language needs.", "CBP.

According to the Foreign Language Program Manager, a challenge  exists in assigning foreign language speakers while aligning their foreign  language proficiencies per the DLPT to the operational needs in the field.  As a result, personnel who speak a foreign language are being utilized but  are not considered part of Coast Guard\u2019s foreign language capabilities and  are unable to receive foreign language award payments.

For example, according to ICE intelligence analysts, existing foreign  language capabilities in ICE\u2019s Office of Intelligence are not systematically  identified in the lists, but the specialists are aware of colleagues who have  proficiencies in Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Haitian-Creole.  Component officials stated that the inability to identify all existing  capabilities may result in intelligence information potentially not being  collected, properly translated, or analyzed in its proper context for  additional foreign languages and thus affect the timeliness and accuracy of  information.

The video was recorded by the  law enforcement officer\u2019s dashboard video camera. In the video, the four  suspects exit the car and begin conversing in Spanish among each other  while the officer appears to have difficulty understanding what the  individuals are saying. Seconds later, the four individuals attacked the  officer, took his gun, and shot the officer to death.", "As another example, an ICE special agent told us that in the course of  conducting a drug bust in 1991, he had been accidentally shot by a fellow  agent because of, among other things, foreign language  miscommunications. According to the agent and other sources familiar  with the incident, he was working as the principal undercover agent in a  drug sting operation in Newark, New Jersey. At the time of the incident,  prior to the formation of DHS, he was working as a U.S. Customs Service  agent. The undercover operation involved meeting and communicating in  Spanish with two Colombian drug dealers as part of a cocaine bust.  According to the agent, there were up to 18 other federal agents involved  in the operation, at least two of whom were fluent in Spanish. Further,  agents were videotaping and monitoring the conversation between the  federal agent and the drug dealers from a nearby command post. However,  the agent told us that none of the law enforcement officers in the  command post who were covertly monitoring his dialogue with the drug  dealers spoke or understood Spanish. The agent stated that as a result, law  enforcement officers were signaled to rush in prematurely to make the  arrests. In the chaos that ensued, the agent was accidentally shot by a  fellow agent and paralyzed from the chest down. According to the agent,  as well as other agents familiar with the incident, had there been Spanish- speaking officers in the command post to interpret the audio  transmissions from the agent, the accidental shooting may have been  avoided. By conducting an assessment of needs and capabilities, and using  the results of these assessments to identify shortfalls, DHS can be better  positioned to take action to mitigate these shortfalls, which will help to  ensure the safety of its officers and agents as they fulfill the department\u2019s  mission."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Developed a Variety of Foreign Language Programs, but the Extent to Which They Address Foreign Language Shortfalls Is Not Known", "paragraphs": ["DHS has established a variety of foreign language programs; however,  officials stated that they have not addressed the extent to which these  programs address existing shortfalls. According to DHS officials in  OCHCO, DHS\u2019s foreign language programs are managed at the component  level and are based on component operational capabilities and mission  requirements. The components have established programs and activities,  which consist of foreign language training, proficiency testing, foreign  language award programs, contract services, and interagency  agreements. Table 4 summarizes the extent to which foreign language  programs and activities have been established in Coast Guard, CBP, and  ICE select offices.", "According to DHS officials in OCHCO, decisions on whether to establish  programs and activities to develop foreign language capabilities are left to  the discretion of individual components and are based on component  operational capabilities and mission requirements. As shown in table 4,  foreign language programs and activities varied across DHS and within  select DHS components. For example, four of the seven component offices  we reviewed maintain Spanish language training programs, and some of  these offices require that officers complete Spanish language training  before they are assigned to their duty stations. The five types of foreign  language programs and activities used within and among the components  are language training, proficiency testing, foreign language award  programs, contract services, and interagency agreements.", "Spanish language training. Before officers can be assigned to their  duty stations, some components require that they complete a Spanish  language training program. Specifically, U.S. Border Patrol requires the  completion of an 8-week task-based Spanish language training  program. The Office of Field Operations has a 6-week basic Spanish  training program requirement, and the Office of Air and Marine  requires 6 weeks of task-based Spanish language training. The Office of  Detention and Removal Operations has a requirement for a 6-week  basic Spanish training program. These programs are designed to  provide officers with a basic Spanish language competency. U.S.  Border Patrol and Office of Air and Marine agents and officers are  required to attend Spanish language training only if they do not pass a  Spanish language proficiency exam.", "Foreign language proficiency tests. Several proficiency tests are  used by different components, and the type of test that is used depends  on the foreign language for which proficiency is being assessed. The  Coast Guard\u2019s proficiency test is produced by the Defense Language  Institute and consists of a set of tests that include an oral interview to  assess language proficiency in the skills of reading and listening. ICE\u2019s  proficiency test consists of an oral interview for all foreign languages  assessed, while CBP uses a combination of both oral and automated  telephone tests for assessing proficiency in similar foreign languages,  such as the Spanish language.", "Contract services. Contract services consist of contracts held by  individual components and offices for interpreter and translation  services. The use of language contract services depends on the unique  requirements of the operation in individual offices. For example, the  U.S. Border Patrol provides funding for translation services and the  Coast Guard contracts annually for Haitian-Creole interpreter services.  Select components utilize over-the-phone language contract services,  while other components also utilize in-person translation and  transcription contract services. Additionally, DHS\u2019s U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services operates and manages the Language Services  Section, comprising both intermittent and full-time language specialists  who may provide assistance to some offices in CBP and ICE in certain  cases.", "Interagency agreements. Interagency agreements consist of  individual component offices establishing professional relationships  with other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies as a result  of carrying out joint operations. Additionally, these agreements vary by  component, office, and location, and may often depend on the extent to  which other agencies in those areas work closely with DHS. The  interagency cooperation we observed during our site visits largely  occurs on an ad hoc basis. For example, component officials in Miami  told us that local, state, and federal government officials provide  translation assistance as needed without any written agreement  between agencies.", "Foreign language award programs. The foreign language award  program consists of certain DHS personnel voluntarily identified as  being proficient in an authorized foreign language and meeting  program requirements, including certain proficiency levels and  minimum usage requirements. As shown in table 5, the usage  requirement and award payment vary by component. Specifically, the  Coast Guard does not have a usage requirement, while CBP and ICE  offices require that certain DHS staff use the language 10 percent of the  time, or 208 hours each year. The usage requirement for special interest  languages is only twice per 6-month increment. Further, Coast Guard  interpreters receive up to $200 each month and linguists receive up to  $300 each month, while CBP and ICE employees can receive up to 5  percent of basic pay as an award payment.", "Components have established some language award programs as an  incentive for certain DHS employees to develop foreign language  capabilities to address components\u2019 language needs. According to ICE  officials, statutory language providing authorization for their foreign  language award program is limited to those employees who meet a  statutory definition of the term law enforcement officer. For example,  with respect to the law enforcement officer definition, intelligence  research specialists in ICE have not been determined to meet such  definition and be eligible to receive award payments for their use of  foreign language skills. In addition, component requirements may also  affect eligibility for foreign language awards. For example, according to  CBP, although U.S. Border Patrol agents are law enforcement officers,  Spanish language skills are a requirement for employment of that position,  therefore agents do no receive award payments for their use of Spanish or  other foreign language skills. Additionally, CBP told us that it is not  opposed to assessing its options regarding foreign language needs.", "While DHS components have a variety of foreign language programs and  activities, DHS has not assessed the extent to which these programs and  activities address potential shortfalls at the department or component  levels. OPM\u2019s strategic workforce planning guidance recommends that  agencies assess potential shortfalls in human capital resources, such as  foreign language capability, by comparing needs against available skills.  OCHO officials told us that DHS has not performed a department-level  assessment of the extent to which the programs address potential  shortfalls because DHS has delegated responsibility for foreign language  programs to the components. However, we found that the Coast Guard,  CBP, and ICE also have not assessed the extent to which their programs  address potential shortfalls.", "Although foreign language programs and activities at select components  contribute to the development of DHS\u2019s foreign language capabilities,  DHS\u2019s ability to use them to address potential foreign language shortfalls  varies. For example, the foreign language training programs generally do  not include languages other than Spanish, nor do they include various  Spanish dialects. According to several Coast Guard, CBP, and ICE  officials we spoke with, their foreign language programs and activities  were established to develop specific foreign language capabilities,  primarily in Spanish. Officers we interviewed noted that that these  programs and activities generally do not account for variations of the  Spanish language spoken in certain regions of the country, which can  potentially have fatal consequences, particularly during undercover  operations. Further, according to agents we interviewed in Puerto Rico,  both the agents and criminals understand that the Spanish phrase  \u201ctumbarlo\u201d in the Caribbean region means \u201ckill him,\u201d while agents from  the southern border understand this phrase to mean \u201carrest him.\u201d As  another example of the vital role of foreign language proficiency in certain  operations, we were told that foreign language capabilities in one  operation enabled an agent to infiltrate a prolific drug trafficking  organization. While working in a long-term drug smuggling investigation,  the agent came under suspicion by members of the trafficking  organization. However, the agent was able to utilize Spanish language  skills and dialect to avoid being discovered as a U.S. federal agent and  escape execution by his captors.", "Further, in certain cases, according to component officials, the programs  and activities are not well suited for some operational needs. CBP and ICE  officials noted that although their foreign language training programs and  activities are used for the Spanish language, they maintain a language  service contract for an over-the-phone, 24-hour translation service in over  150 languages. However, according to component officials we spoke with  in the Coast Guard, CBP, and ICE, this resource is limited depending on  the unique requirements of operations within and among components.  Specifically, the component officials said that this resource is limited  because of (1) the time it can take to obtain an interpreter over the phone,  (2) difficulty in relying on over-the-phone interpretation while conducting  operations at sea, and (3) the inability to use an interpreter who is over the  phone for an on-the-spot discussion and resolution of an issue or problem  encountered in the field. For example, officials stated that during an  operation in which they entered a house suspected of harboring  individuals trafficked into the United States, an officer intercepted a phone  call from one of the individuals who was involved in this illegal activity  who spoke Russian. In other operations, according to intelligence analysts  we spoke with, it is difficult or impossible to develop detainees\u2019 trust  during phone interviews to obtain intelligence. For example, according to  all of the agents we interviewed, potential informants are difficult or  impossible to recruit when the discussion is occurring through a third- party interpreter on the phone. Because the components have not  assessed the programs and activities, they have not addressed this  limitation.", "Furthermore, these programs and activities are managed by individual  components or offices within components. According to several Coast  Guard, CBP, and ICE officials, they manage their foreign language  programs and activities as they did prior to the formation of DHS. At the  department level and within the components, many of the officials we  spoke with were generally unaware of the foreign language programs or  activities maintained by other DHS components. In addition, many of the  Coast Guard, CBP, and ICE officials at all seven locations we visited stated  that they relied on colleagues from current or past interactions to interpret  or identify other foreign language resources. Given this decentralization,  conducting an assessment of the extent to which its program and activities  address shortfalls could strengthen DHS\u2019s ability to manage its foreign  language programs and activities and to adjust them, if necessary, to  address shortfalls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since its formation in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist  attacks, DHS and three of its largest components\u2014the Coast Guard, CBP,  and ICE\u2014have performed vital roles in carrying out a range of law  enforcement and intelligence activities to help protect the United States  against potential terrorist actions and other threats. To achieve its mission,  it is important that DHS and its components manage their human capital  resources in a way that ensures that fundamental capabilities, such as  foreign language capabilities, are available when needed. Foreign language  capabilities are especially important for DHS, as its employees frequently  encounter foreign languages while carrying out their daily responsibilities.  While DHS has taken limited actions to assess its foreign language needs  and capabilities, it has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of the  department\u2019s and its components\u2019 foreign language needs and capabilities  nor has it fully identified potential shortfalls. Further, although the Coast  Guard, CBP, and ICE have a variety of foreign language programs and  activities in place, they have not assessed the extent to which the  programs and activities they have established address foreign language  shortfalls. As a result, DHS lacks reasonable assurance that it\u2019s varied and  decentralized foreign language programs and activities are meeting its  needs.", "We have recommended that other federal agencies, including the  Departments of Defense and State and the FBI, take actions to help ensure  that their foreign language capabilities are available when needed. Similar  opportunities exist for DHS to help ensure that foreign language  capabilities are available to effectively communicate and overcome  language barriers encountered during critical operations, such as  interdicting the transport of contraband and other illegal activities.  Comprehensively assessing its foreign language needs and capabilities and  identifying any potential shortfalls and the extent to which its programs  and activities are addressing these shortfalls would better position DHS to  ensure that foreign language capabilities are available when needed.  Further, considering the important role foreign language plays in DHS\u2019s  missions, incorporating the results of foreign language assessments into  the department\u2019s future strategic and workforce planning documents  would help DHS ensure that it addresses its current and future foreign  language needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that DHS can identify its foreign language capabilities  needed and pursue strategies that will help its workforce effectively  communicate to achieve agency goals, we recommend that the Secretary  of Homeland Security (1) comprehensively assess DHS\u2019s foreign language  needs and capabilities and identify potential shortfalls, (2) assess the  extent to which existing foreign language programs and activities address  foreign language shortfalls, and (3) ensure that the results of these foreign  language assessments are incorporated into the department\u2019s future  strategic and workforce planning documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of our report to the Secretary of Homeland Security  for review and comment on June 9, 2010.

We selected the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  because they constitute a broad representation of program areas whose  missions include law enforcement and intelligence responsibilities. We  selected the Coast Guard\u2019s Foreign Language Program Office; CBP\u2019s Office  of U.S. Border Patrol, Office of Air and Marine, and Office of Field  Operations; and ICE\u2019s Office of Detention and Removal Operations, Office  of Investigations, and Office of Intelligence to ensure that we had a mix of  different program sizes and a broad representation of program areas  whose missions include law enforcement and intelligence responsibilities  and are most likely to involve foreign nationals, foreign language  documents, or both. We then selected a nonprobability sample of seven  site visit locations\u2014San Antonio and Laredo, Texas; Artesia, New Mexico;  New York and Buffalo, New York; Miami, Florida; and San Juan, Puerto  Rico\u2014to identify and observe foreign language use at select DHS  components. We selected these locations based on geographic regions,  border locations, and language use. Although the results are not  projectable, they provided us with valuable insights. During our site visits,  we spoke to over 430 DHS staff in law enforcement and intelligence units,  and observed the use of foreign language skills where foreign language  capabilities are deemed vital to meeting mission requirements, including  the following:    We interviewed Coast Guard officials at the Command, Sector, District,  and Stations and Intelligence and Enforcement representatives of the  Coast Guard in New York, Miami, and San Juan. During an operational  boat ride tour at Station Miami Beach, we observed an encounter  involving Spanish-speaking individuals.", "We spoke with officials in ICE\u2019s Detention, Fugitive, Intelligence and  Criminal Alien Operations units.
