These adjustments increased MSIS to 92, 93, and 94 percent of the amounts in CMS-64 in fiscal years 2007 through 2009, respectively.", "GAO could not account for the remaining differences in part because of inconsistencies in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) guidance between the two data sets. For example, CMS officials explained that expenditures for inpatient services as reported by a state in MSIS and as reported in CMS-64 are not necessarily for the same services.", "GAO also found that states do not submit timely MSIS information. CMS requires states to submit MSIS data within 45 days and CMS-64 data within 30 days of the end of the quarter. However, states' reporting of MSIS data can be up to 3 years late, whereas CMS-64 data are consistently reported on time. Also, MSIS expenditure data are considered less reliable when compared with CMS-64.", "GAO has reported that CMS will need more reliable data for assessing expenditures and measuring performance in the Medicaid program. MSIS and CMS-64 have the potential to offer a robust view of the Medicaid program, enhancing CMS oversight of aggregate spending trends, per beneficiary spending growth, and cross-state comparisons, all of which could be useful in improving the financial integrity of this high-risk program.

PPACA expands eligibility for Medicaid to nonelderly individuals whose  income does not exceed 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL),  or $30,700 for a family of four in 2012.

In fiscal year 2009, total MSIS expenditure data, after  adjustments, showed MSIS at 94 percent of CMS-64 expenditures, which  left billions of dollars unexplained.", "The remaining differences between the two data sets are potentially  explained by inconsistencies in CMS guidance and states\u2019 reporting  practices, neither of which can be quantified. In fiscal years 2007 through  2009, CMS provided states with inconsistent MSIS and CMS-64 guidance  regarding expenditure definitions, reporting dates, and reporting of  supplemental payments. Additionally, when compared with CMS-64, state  MSIS data were often delayed beyond the time frames established by  CMS, inconsistent in reporting payments for local government providers,  and were of poor quality.", "Taken together, these two data sets have the potential to offer a robust  view of the Medicaid program, enhancing CMS oversight of aggregate  spending trends, per beneficiary spending growth, and cross-state  comparisons, all of which could be useful in improving the financial  integrity of this high-risk program. This is critical given that Medicaid, a  program that GAO identified on our high-risk list, has among the highest  estimated improper payments of any federal program reporting such data.  However, the usefulness of these data sets as oversight tools is limited  because of delays in reporting and unnecessary inconsistencies between  the two data sets, both of which are inconsistent with federal internal  control standards. The 3-year lag in states\u2019 reporting of MSIS data  prevents its use for timely oversight of beneficiary-related utilization and  other spending trends. For example, identifying a difference in hospital  expenditures between MSIS and CMS-64 is of limited use when detected  3 years later. If states were meeting the current requirement of providing  MSIS data 45 days after each quarter, then such comparisons could  provide more useful and timely information.", "CMS has recently completed a pilot study aimed in part on improving  MSIS data.

To the  extent possible, we added expenditures reported in CMS-64, but not  reported in MSIS, to total expenditures in MSIS.", "To determine the extent to which MSIS and CMS-64 data sets on  Medicaid expenditures differ, nationally and by state, for fiscal years  2007 through 2009, we conducted a multistep analysis.expenditures from both data sets, we calculated the expenditures  reported in MSIS as a percentage of those reported in CMS-64.

The financial  management report also contains information solely related to  Medicaid.", "Step 2: Determine Medicaid Expenditures in MSIS for the Fiscal Year on  the Basis of the Number of Medicaid Enrollees  Because MSIS includes both Medicaid and CHIP expenditures, we  separated these expenditures to the extent possible. To do this, we first  determined whether a beneficiary was eligible for Medicaid or CHIP by  using the monthly eligibility code in MSIS. The Annual Person Summary  File ties an entire month\u2019s expenditures to an individual on the basis of his  or her monthly eligibility code. The next step was to remove, to the extent  possible, the CHIP expenditures in order to match MSIS expenditures  with CMS-64.

Consequently, we were able to distinguish between Medicaid  and M-CHIP spending. We thus removed from all MSIS totals any   M-CHIP expenditures to the extent possible. We determined the number  of months in the fiscal year a beneficiary received benefits under  Medicaid or M-CHIP. On the basis of this count, we prorated the  enrollees\u2019 total expenses for the fiscal year on the basis of the proportion  of the year a person was enrolled in either M-CHIP or Medicaid. If a  person was enrolled in the M-CHIP program for part of the year, then a  portion of the annual spending was apportioned toward M-CHIP. For  example, if a person was enrolled in M-CHIP for 3 months, then a quarter  of the expenditures would be considered M-CHIP, and the remaining  three-quarters of expenditures would be considered Medicaid.  Consequently, the Medicaid expenditures include prorated amounts for  Medicaid and M-CHIP enrollees.", "In contrast, CMS officials told us that until fiscal year 2010, states with a  stand-alone CHIP program (i.e., one that is operated separately from a  Medicaid program by the state; also known as S-CHIP) were not  supposed to report these expenditures into MSIS despite the presence of  the S-CHIP eligibility code. CMS officials indicated that any expenditures  associated with S-CHIP should be assumed to be Medicaid expenditures  despite the CHIP eligibility code. Therefore, we included any expenditures  associated with the S-CHIP code as Medicaid expenditures.", "Lastly, we included as Medicaid expenditures any other expenditures  associated with all other eligibility categories. These other eligibility  variables included \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201cineligible,\u201d as well as Medicaid.  Consequently, for states with standalone S-CHIP programs and those  that did not separate out M-CHIP expenditures, the total Medicaid  expenditures may be inflated in MSIS. Similarly, any expenditures  reported under the unknown and ineligible categories that were not  Medicaid expenditures may also inflate Medicaid expenditures.", "Step 3: Matching Inconsistent Definitions of Services between MSIS and  CMS-64  MSIS and CMS-64 data consist of expenditures broken down by service  types.definitions of Medicaid service types used in each data set.
