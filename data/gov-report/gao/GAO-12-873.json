Officials from advocacy groups cited additional challenges, such as difficulty gaining access to contracting officials and decreased contracting opportunities resulting from contract bundling\u0097the consolidation of two or more contracts previously performed under smaller contracts, into a single contract. Officials from agencies that accounted for 70 percent of federal contracting with small, minority-owned businesses\u0097(the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security, and the General Services Administration) told GAO that they conducted outreach to help small, minority-owned businesses with these challenges.

Federal agencies that GAO contacted said that the goals SBA negotiated with federal agencies for contracting with various socioeconomic categories, including small disadvantaged businesses, provided some information on efforts to assist minority-owned businesses. In fiscal year 2011, agencies GAO contacted met their prime contracting goal and three out of four agencies met their subcontracting goals.

According to the statement of Guiding Principles of  the Federal Acquisition System, when selecting contactors to provide  products or perform services, the government will use contractors that  have a track record of successful past performance or that have  demonstrated a current superior ability to perform. SBA officials told us  that historically and currently, small, minority-owned businesses that  lacked a performance history have had difficulty entering the federal  contracting market. MBDA officials also said that lack of a past  performance record with government contracts or private contracts of  similar size, made obtaining federal contracts more difficult for minority- owned businesses because of the weight given to performance history.", "However, some agency officials, including those from two DHS  contracting offices, noted that because prior commercial experience\u2014not  just government contracting experience\u2014was considered, the lack of  prior government experience would not necessarily make a minority- owned business noncompetitive. Officials from a GSA contracting office  said that most small businesses seeking to contract with its office had a  performance history with the private sector, not the federal government.  The officials said that they considered past performance with the private  sector when making contract award decisions, and thus would not  consider lack of past performance history with the federal government as  a challenge. Finally, officials from an HHS contracting office noted that  the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires that businesses  receive a neutral rating if they do not have a performance history and that  some small businesses may not be aware of this requirement.  However,  some advocacy group officials indicated that certain prerequisites and  past performance requirements were difficult for minority-owned  businesses to meet. For example, officials from one group said that these  businesses might partner with other more established businesses to help  meet the performance requirements.", "See 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.305(a)(2)(iv).

Further, MBDA officials noted that the federal contracting  process was very different from contracting with private sector  companies. They added that although federal agencies spend time and  money holding sessions on doing business with the federal government,  these sessions offered general information that could not be transferred  to bidding on specific projects. Similarly, agency officials also cited the  lack of understanding of agencies\u2019 contracting needs. For example, an  OSDBU official from HHS emphasized that businesses that did not  understand the mission of the agency with which they were seeking a  contract or did not know what the agency bought and acquired might not  know how to market their product or service appropriately to win the  contract.", "Advocacy group officials cited contract bundling as a significant  challenge, although a majority of agency officials disagreed. Advocacy  group officials whom we interviewed said that contract bundling could  reduce the number of contracting opportunities available for small and  minority-owned businesses. MBDA officials said that they believe that  many contracts are bundled unnecessarily and agreed that this practice  limited minority-owned businesses\u2019 ability to compete for these contracts.", "However, other federal agency officials we interviewed said that they did  not believe that contract bundling was a significant challenge for minority- owned businesses at their agencies. In addition, some agency officials  told us that they had specific policies regarding contract bundling. For  example, HHS and DOD contracting officials noted that their offices had  policies that prohibited contract bundling and added that small businesses  could protest a contract that they believed was unjustifiably bundled.  Further, officials from one HHS contracting office indicated that they  worked with small business specialists to determine if contracts should be  separated.", "Advocacy group officials cited a lack of access to contracting officials as a  significant challenge. Officials from six advocacy groups that we  interviewed stated that the agency officials present at outreach events,  such as matchmaking events, often did not have the authority to make  decisions about awarding a contract. However, with the exception of  MBDA, none of the federal agency officials we contacted said that access  to contracting officers was a challenge at their agencies. The officials  emphasized efforts that their agencies were making to assist businesses.  For example, officials participate in industry days, where businesses can  meet prime contractors as well as interact with agency procurement staff,  and also conduct one-on-one appointments with businesses that seek to  contract with their agencies. Some federal contracting officials did note  that limited resources might pose a challenge in accessing the contracting  officers.  For example, contracting officials from DHS and GSA indicated  that any perceived access issues would be due to limited resources in  contracting offices. GSA contracting officials said that when the office had  a large number of contracts to complete, they could not meet with each  business owner seeking contract opportunities.", "Advocacy group officials also cited a lack of monitoring of subcontracting  plans by federal agencies as a significant challenge for minority-owned  businesses, although SBA officials noted that this issue was a challenge  for all small businesses, not just those owned by minorities. Officials from  five advocacy groups described instances in which prime contractors did  not use the small, minority-owned business subcontractors that they  initially said they would use. Further, one advocacy group official said that  because federal contracting officials generally had relationships with  prime contractors and not subcontractors, small, minority-owned  subcontractors often had no recourse when a problem arose. An official  from another advocacy group stated that contracting officers have no  accountability to federal agencies to justify any subcontractor changes.  SBA officials noted that prime contractors\u2019 \u201cdropping\u201d of subcontractors  from their plans after the contracts were obligated was not an issue  exclusive to minority-owned businesses but was a challenge for small  subcontractors in general.", "In addition, we previously reported that CMRs cited a lack of authority to  influence subcontracting opportunities. was difficult to enforce prime contractors\u2019 performance under  subcontracting plans because determining that a contractor was not  acting in good faith was difficult.

An OSDBU official from DOD added  that the contracting officer would review and approve a replacement  subcontractor under certain circumstances.

One  advocacy group official said that linguistic barriers may be a challenge  because business owners with strong accents could have difficulty  communicating. Officials from a few Asian-American advocacy groups  noted that business owners with limited English proficiency (LEP)  may experience challenges. For example, one official said that business  owners in the construction industry may have difficulty obtaining a  required design certification if English was not the business owner\u2019s first  language. Another advocacy group official cited challenges such as  discrimination against subcontractors by prime contractors because of  accents or LEP. Officials from advocacy groups also cited examples of  cultural barriers. For example, one noted that some first generation  Americans might have an aversion to working with the federal  government and therefore would not be willing to seek government  contracts. Some officials from Hispanic advocacy groups said Hispanic  contracting officials were underrepresented in the federal government.", "A surety bond is form of insurance that guarantees contract completion.", "Officials from another group also said that some minority groups,  including those in nonmetropolitan areas, could lack the infrastructure  needed (e.g., Internet service and transportation) to conduct business in  these areas.", "Officials from all but one federal agency\u2014SBA\u2014that we contacted said  that they did not know of any linguistic or cultural issues that posed a  barrier for minority-owned businesses seeking to contract with the  government. SBA officials told us that cultural barriers may be a  challenge for minority-owned businesses seeking federal government  contracts and emphasized that minority-owned businesses would be  hesitant to reveal any linguistic barriers. The officials noted that some  cultural barriers existed for Asian-Americans, Alaskan Natives, Native- Americans, and Native Hawaiians, because their traditional ways of  conducting business involved intangibles that did not translate well into a  \u201cfaceless\u201d electronic contracting community. These officials also said that  some minority-owned businesses may have informal business  practices\u2014for example, they may obtain financing from a friend or family  member instead of through a bank\u2014and therefore a business owner  might not have the documentation required by some federal programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Outreach Efforts Help Address Some Challenges Facing Small and Minority-Owned Businesses", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously noted, federal agencies conduct outreach to help  minority-owned businesses seeking federal government contracts.

First, the  department stated that the report was a good start at capturing the federal  government\u2019s effort to support small, minority-owned businesses, but did  not include all federal programs that supported federal contracting with  minority-owned businesses. The department added that GAO had missed  an opportunity to provide a more comprehensive picture of the federal  government\u2019s efforts in this area, noting, for example, that the  Departments of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and  Transportation had programs (other than OSDBUs) geared toward  increasing federal contracts with minority-owned firms. In addition, the  department stated that an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion was  recently established at each of the financial regulatory agencies. While  providing support to minority-owned businesses, these agencies and  offices were outside of the scope of our review, which as we stated in our  report, focused on the four agencies\u2014DHS, DOD, GSA, and HHS\u2014that  accounted for about 70 percent of total federal obligations to small,  minority-owned businesses in fiscal year 2010. We also included SBA  and Commerce\u2019s MBDA in our review because of their roles in assisting  minority-owned businesses. We are reviewing the efforts of the Office of  Minority and Women Inclusion in an ongoing study that will be issued in  2013.", "Second, Commerce noted that although the dollar amount of federal  contracts obligated to small, minority-owned businesses was  encouraging, the report did not analyze the number of minority-owned  firms that actually secured federal contracts. The department said that it  was possible that a handful of minority-owned firms had secured sizable  federal contracts but that the majority of minority-owned firms continued  to fail in obtaining them. However, data are not available on the total  universe of small, minority-owned businesses that entered bids in  response to federal contract solicitations. Just as with our reporting of  funds obligated for contracts, data on the number of minority-owned  businesses that secured federal contracts would not provide information  on the number of such businesses that did not obtain them. Likewise,  while we do report MBDA\u2019s statistics on contracting assistance provided  to minority-owned businesses, again such data do not provide information  on how many businesses sought but did not obtain federal contracts. We  conducted interviews with officials from MBDA, SBA, contracting offices  at the federal agencies in our scope, and advocacy groups to obtain their  perspectives on the challenges minority-owned businesses may face in  seeking to contract with the federal government.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees; the Attorney General; the Secretaries of Defense, Homeland  Security, and Health and Human Services; the Acting Secretary of  Commerce; and the Administrators of the General Services  Administration and Small Business Administration. In addition, this report  will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions on the matters discussed in this  report, please contact me at (202) 512-8678 or by email at  shearw@gao.gov.

We analyzed information on  programs that provide federal contracting assistance and resources on  contracting opportunities, and are available to minority-owned  businesses. We describe programs and resources provided by the  Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) as they are tasked with  the growth and promotion of minority-owned businesses. We also  describe programs and resources available from the Small Business  Administration (SBA), as this agency is responsible for providing  assistance to small businesses\u2014which can be minority owned\u2014and  programs and resources available from other selected federal agencies  based on the criteria described below. Finally, we interviewed officials  from these selected agencies and advocacy groups that provide  assistance to businesses owned by Asian-, Black-, Hispanic-, and Native- Americans. We selected these minority groups because they received the  largest share of federal obligations to small, minority-owned businesses  based on business owners self-identifying as a member of these groups.", "To select agencies to include in our scope, we reviewed data from  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) on  contract awards to small businesses owned by the minority groups in our  scope by federal agency. Although we could not independently verify the  reliability of these data, we reviewed system documentation and  conducted electronic data testing for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness. On the basis of these efforts, we determined that the  FPDS-NG data on federal contract dollars to socioeconomic groups by  self-reported minority group were sufficiently reliable for purposes of our  review. We selected the top four agencies that accounted for about 70  percent of total federal obligations to small, minority-owned businesses in  fiscal year 2010\u2014the most recent data available at the time of our  selections. These agencies were the Departments of Defense (DOD),  Health and Human Services (HHS), and Homeland Security (DHS), and,  the General Services Administration (GSA).", "To select a purposive, non-representative sample of contracting offices  for purposes of conducting interviews, we first selected the top two  divisions within DOD, DHS, and HHS in terms of the percentage of their  agency\u2019s obligations to small, minority-owned businesses. Those  divisions included the Departments of the Army and Navy for DOD; the  Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the United States Coast  Guard for DHS, and the National Institute of Health and the Centers for  Medicaid and Medicare for HHS. We selected only one division for  GSA\u2014the Public Buildings Service\u2014as this division represented over 76  percent of GSA\u2019s funds obligated for contracts to small, minority-owned  businesses. Using this approach, we selected a total of seven divisions  within the four agencies in our scope. Within each division, we selected  one of the top contracting offices based on the office\u2019s percentage of their  division\u2019s obligations to businesses owned by the minority groups in our  scope. We selected two contracting offices from the Department of the  Army because the percentage of obligations to small, minority-owned  businesses by any of its top contracting offices was small. Our final  sample consisted of eight contracting offices.", "To describe the challenges that small, minority-owned businesses may  face in contracting with the federal government, we interviewed agency  officials\u2014including those from contracting offices and the Office of Small  Disadvantaged Business Utilization\u2014from the purposive, non- representative sample of eight contracting offices. We also interviewed  officials from MBDA and SBA. Further, we conducted interviews with  officials from 12 advocacy groups. We selected groups that provided  assistance to businesses owned by the minority groups in our scope  based on a web-based search on national organizations that represent  and provide assistance to minority-owned businesses in obtaining federal  contracts. To describe information on improving access to services for  persons with limited English proficiency, we reviewed Executive Order  13,166\u2014Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English  Proficiency (LEP)\u2014to understand its applicability to outreach activities  associated with federal contracting. We reviewed guidance from the  Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as existing LEP plans for each  agency in our scope. We could not review the LEP plans for DOD and for  SBA, as the plan for each agency had not yet been completed. We also  obtained and reviewed written responses from DOJ.", "To describe the information available on the extent of federal efforts to  assist small, minority-owned businesses in contracting with the federal  government, we reviewed federal government prime contracting and  subcontracting goals and SBA procurement scorecards for fiscal year  2011 for DOD, HHS, DHS and GSA. We also reviewed documentation for  programs that assist small businesses owned and controlled by socially  and economically disadvantaged individuals\u2014which can include  businesses that are minority-owned\u2014to determine the types of  contracting assistance available. We conducted interviews with officials  from the selected agencies and contracting offices to identify and obtain  available information on their outreach efforts to assist minority-owned  businesses. In addition, we conducted interviews with officials from 12  advocacy groups that provide contracting assistance to the minority  groups in our scope.", "For information on the percentage of funds obligated for contracts in fiscal  year 2011 to each socioeconomic category of small businesses by  minority group\u2014including small disadvantaged, women-owned, service- disabled veteran-owned, and Historically Underutilized Business Zone  (HUBZone)\u2014we analyzed data from FPDS-NG, which receives data from  the Central Contractor Registration System (CCR)\u2014the system in which  all businesses seeking federal government contracts must register. In  CCR, registrants (i.e., business owners) can self identify as minority- owned and can specify a minority group(s). Registrants can select from  the following six categories: Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian, Black- American, Hispanic-American, Native-American, and Other. We  conducted electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness. As a part of this assessment, we analyzed the FPDS-NG  data to determine cases in which contracting firms were identified as  belonging to a particular minority group, such as Subcontinent Asian, but  did not designate the firm as being minority-owned. This occurred in less  than 3 percent of the cases. We conducted the same assessment within  different socioeconomic categories, such as small disadvantaged  business, and found a potential undercount of the minority-owned  designation in less than 4 percent of the cases. In addition, businesses  that selected \u201cother minority\u201d and those that self-identified as more than  one minority group were categorized as other minority. We determined  the minority-owned designations data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report. However, because we cannot verify the minority  group that contractors self-report, we characterize these data as self- reported.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 through  September 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

In addition, the Department of Justice (DOJ) serves as a  central repository for agency plans to address LEP and provides  guidance to agencies for developing such plans.", "According to DOJ guidance issued on August 16, 2000 and available at  LEP.GOV, the four factors to be considered in determining what  constitutes \u201creasonable steps to ensure meaningful access\u201d include   (1) the number or proportion of such individuals in the eligible population,  (2) the frequency with which they come into contact with the program,   (3) the importance of the service provided by the program, and (4) the  resources available to the recipients. In May 2011, DOJ also issued a  Language Access Assessment and Planning Tool for Federally  Conducted and Federally Assisted Programs to provide guidance to  recipients of federal financial assistance and federal agencies. The first  step in the assessment tool is a self-assessment that determines what  type of contact an agency has with the LEP population and describes the  elements that are part of effective language access policy directives and  implementation plans. \u201cGenerally, current practice with regard to announcing federal government contracts and  grants would not be altered under the Executive Order.
