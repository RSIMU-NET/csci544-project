The major categories of in-transit inventory are as follows:", "Warehoused material\u2014material redistributed between storage activities, broken items shipped from Navy consolidation points to a commercial or other military service repair facility, and material returned from a commercial or other military service repair facility or an end user.", "Purchased material\u2014new material shipped from a commercial source to a storage activity.", "End-user material\u2014material ordered from a storage activity or commercial source by a unit that expects to use it.", "The Navy is required to use a variety of inventory tracking procedures to monitor shipment and receipt of in-transit items. Although the specific procedures for each major category have some differences, they all have three common control elements. First, the recipient of the material is responsible for notifying the NAVICP once the item has been received. This notification is an internal control designed to account for all in-transit assets. Second, if within 45 days of shipment NAVICP has not been notified that a shipment has arrived, it is required to follow up with the intended recipient. The rationale behind this requirement is that until receipt is confirmed, the exact status of the shipment is uncertain and therefore vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Third, the Navy is required to oversee in-transit inventory to assess the effectiveness of policies and procedures governing that inventory.
