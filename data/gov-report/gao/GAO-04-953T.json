Security Council resolution 661 of 1990 prohibited  all nations from buying and selling Iraqi commodities, except for food and  medicine. Security Council resolution 661 also prohibited all nations from  exporting weapons or military equipment to Iraq and established a  sanctions committee to monitor compliance and progress in implementing  the sanctions. The members of the sanctions committee were members of  the Security Council. Subsequent Security Council resolutions specifically  prohibited nations from exporting to Iraq items that could be used to build  chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. In 1991, the Security Council  offered to let Iraq sell oil under a U.N. program to meet its peoples\u2019 basic  needs. The Iraqi government rejected the offer, and over the next 5 years,  the United Nations reported food shortages and a general deterioration in  social services.", "In December 1996, the United Nations and Iraq agreed on the Oil for Food  program, which permitted Iraq to sell up to $1 billion worth of oil every 90  days to pay for food, medicine, and humanitarian goods. Subsequent U.N.  resolutions increased the amount of oil that could be sold and expanded  the humanitarian goods that could be imported. In 1999, the Security  Council removed all restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq could sell to  purchase civilian goods. The United Nations and the Security Council  monitored and screened contracts that the Iraqi government signed with  commodity suppliers and oil purchasers, and Iraq\u2019s oil revenue was placed  in a U.N.-controlled escrow account. In May 2003, U.N. resolution 1483  requested the U.N. Secretary General to transfer the Oil for Food program  to the CPA by November 2003. (Appendix II contains a detailed  chronology of Oil for Food program and sanctions events.) The United  Nations allocated 59 percent of the oil revenue for the 15 central and  southern governorates, which were controlled by the central government;  13 percent for the 3 northern Kurdish governorates; 25 percent for a war  reparations fund for victims of the Iraq invasion of Kuwait in 1990; and 3  percent for U.N. administrative costs, including the costs of weapons  inspectors.", "From 1997 to 2002, the Oil for Food program was responsible for more  than $67 billion of Iraq's oil revenue. Through a large portion of this  revenue, the United Nations provided food, medicine, and services to 24  million people and helped the Iraqi government supply goods to 24  economic sectors. Despite concerns that sanctions may have worsened the  humanitarian situation, the Oil for Food program appears to have helped  the Iraqi people. According to the United Nations, the average daily food  intake increased from around 1,275 calories per person per day in 1996 to  about 2,229 calories at the end of 2001. Malnutrition rates for children  under 5 fell by more than half. In February 2002, the United Nations  reported that the Oil for Food program had considerable success in  several sectors such as agriculture, food, health, and nutrition by arresting  the decline in living conditions and improving the nutritional status of the  average Iraqi citizen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Illicit Revenues by Former Regime Due to Iraqi Control over Contracts and Uncertain U.N.

Oil entered Syria by  pipeline, crossed the borders of Jordan and Turkey by truck, and was  smuggled through the Persian Gulf by ship.  Jordan maintained trade  protocols with Iraq that allowed it to purchase heavily discounted oil in  exchange for up to $300 million in Jordanian goods.  Syria received up to  200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day in violation of the sanctions.  Oil  smuggling also occurred through Turkey and Iran.", "In addition to revenues from oil smuggling, the Iraqi government levied  surcharges against oil purchasers and commissions against commodity  suppliers participating in the Oil for Food program. According to some  Security Council members, the surcharge was up to 50 cents per barrel of  oil and the commission was 5 to 15 percent of the commodity contract.", "In our 2002 report, we estimated that the Iraqi regime received a 5-percent  illicit commission on commodity contracts. However, a September 2003  Department of Defense review found that at least 48 percent of 759 Oil for  Food contracts that it reviewed were potentially overpriced by an average  of 21 percent. Food commodity contracts were the most consistently  overpriced, with potential overpricing identified in 87 percent of the  contracts by an average of 22 percent. The review also found that the use  of middlemen companies potentially increased contract prices by 20  percent or more. Defense officials found 5 contracts that included \u201cafter- sales service charges\u201d of between 10 and 20 percent.", "In addition, interviews by U.S. investigators with high-ranking Iraqi regime  officials, including the former oil and finance ministers, confirmed that the  former regime received a 10-percent commission from commodity  suppliers. According to the former oil minister, the regime instituted a  fixed 10-percent commission in early 2001 to address a prior \u201ccompliance\u201d  problem with junior officials.

At that time, the Secretary General  proposed that the United Nations, an independent agent, or the  government of Iraq be given the responsibility to negotiate contracts with  oil purchasers and commodity suppliers. The Secretary General concluded  that it would be highly unusual or impractical for the United Nations or an  independent agent to trade Iraq\u2019s oil or purchase commodities.

However, the  monitoring measures contained weaknesses. According to U.N. reports  and a statement from the monitoring firm, the major offshore terminal at  Mina al-Basra did not have a meter to measure the oil pumped nor could  onshore storage capacity be measured. Therefore, the U.N. monitors could  not confirm the volume of oil loaded onto vessels. Also, in 2001, the oil  tanker Essex took a large quantity of unauthorized oil from the platform  when the monitors were off duty.  In December 2001, the Security Council  required OIP to improve the monitoring at the offshore terminal.  It is  unclear what actions OIP took.

They stated that no  U.N. resolution tasked them with assessing the price reasonableness of the  contracts and no contracts were rejected solely on the basis of price.   However, OIP officials stated that, in a number of instances, they reported  to the sanctions committee that commodity prices appeared high, but the  committee did not cite pricing as a reason to place holds on the contracts.  For example, in October 2001, OIP experts reported to the sanctions  committee that the prices in a proposed contract between Iraq and the Al- Wasel and Babel Trading Company appeared high. However, the sanctions  committee reviewed the data and approved the contract.  In April 2004, the  Treasury Department identified this company as a front company for the  former regime.

The remaining oil was smuggled through  Turkey, the Persian Gulf, Jordan, and Syria (oil smuggling to Syria  began late 2000).  We estimated the amount of oil to each destination  based on information from and discussions with officials of EIA,  Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the Middle East Economic  Survey, and the private consulting firm Petroleum Finance.", "We used the price of oil sold to estimate the proceeds from smuggled  oil.  We discounted the price by 9 percent for the difference in quality.  We discounted this price by 67 percent for smuggling to Jordan and by  33 percent for smuggling through Turkey, the Persian Gulf, and Syria.  According to oil industry experts, this is representative of the prices  paid for smuggled oil.", "To estimate the amount Iraq earned from surcharges on oil, we  multiplied the barrels of oil sold under the Oil for Food program from  1997 through 2002 by 25 cents per barrel. According to Security  Council members, the surcharge varied, but Iraq tried to get as much  as 50 cents per barrel. Industry experts also stated the surcharge  varied.", "To estimate the commission from commodities, we multiplied Iraq\u2019s  letters of credit for commodity purchases by 5 percent for 1997  through 1998 and 10 percent for 1999 through 2002.  According to  Security Council members, the commission varied from 5 percent to 10  percent.  This percentage was also confirmed in interviews conducted  by U.S. officials with former Iraqi regime ministers of oil, finance, and  trade and with Sadaam Hussein\u2019s presidential advisors.", "GAO did not obtain source documents and records from the former regime  about its smuggling, surcharges, and commissions.  Our estimate of illicit  revenues is therefore not a precise accounting number. Areas of  uncertainty in our estimate include:", "GAO\u2019s estimate of the revenue from smuggled oil is less than the  estimates of U.S. intelligence agencies.  We used estimates of Iraqi oil  production and domestic consumption for our calculations.  U.S.  intelligence agencies used other methods to estimate smuggling.", "GAO\u2019s estimate of revenue from oil surcharges is based on a surcharge  of 25 cents per barrel from 1997 through 2002. However, the average  surcharge could be lower. U.N. Security Council members and oil  industry sources do not know when the surcharge began or ended or  the precise amount of the surcharge.  One oil industry expert stated  that the surcharge was imposed at the beginning of the program but  that the amount varied. Security Council members and the U.S.  Treasury Department reported that surcharges ranged from 10 cents to  50 cents per barrel.  As a test of reasonableness, GAO compared the  price paid for oil under the Oil for Food program with a proxy oil price  for the period 1997 through 2002.  We found that for the entire period,  the price of Iraqi oil was considerably below the proxy price. Oil  purchasers would have to pay below market price to have a margin to  pay the surcharge.", "GAO\u2019s estimate of the commission on commodities could be  understated.  We calculated commissions based on the commodity  contracts for the 15 governorates in central and southern Iraq (known  as the \u201c59-percent account\u201d because these governorates received this  percentage of Oil for Food revenues).  We excluded contracts for the  three northern governorates (known as the \u201c13-percent account\u201d).  However, the former Iraqi regime negotiated the food and medical  contracts for the northern governorates, and the Defense Contract  Audit Agency found that some of these contracts were potentially  overpriced.
