CMS uses three standard mechanisms for collecting website information\u2014website analytics, website user surveys, and website usability tests. These mechanisms have helped identify potential improvements to the website, such as adding information explaining how to use the website. However, GAO found that CMS does not have a systematic process for prioritizing and implementing these potential improvements. Rather, CMS officials described a fragmented approach to reviewing and implementing recommended website changes. Federal internal control standards require management to evaluate appropriate actions for improvement. Without having an established process to evaluate and prioritize implementation of improvements, CMS cannot ensure that it is fully meeting its goals for the website.", "GAO also found that several factors inhibit the ability of CMS's Five-Star Quality Rating System (Five-Star System) to help consumers understand nursing home quality and choose between high- and low- performing homes, which is CMS's primary goal for the system. For example, the ratings were not designed to compare nursing homes nationally, limiting the ability of the rating system to help consumers who live near state borders or have multistate options. In addition, the Five-Star System does not include consumer satisfaction survey information, leaving consumers to make nursing home decisions without this important information.

As the estimated 76 million baby boomers born between  1946 and 1964 become elderly, the number of nursing home residents  may increase. When deciding on a nursing home, consumers\u2014current  and potential nursing home residents and their family or friends\u2014can  make choices based on such factors as location, fees, services and  activities for residents, and what they know about the quality of care  provided in a facility.", "Given the various factors to consider when choosing a facility, the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014an agency within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that is responsible for  establishing and overseeing the quality standards that nursing homes  must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid  programs\u2014has taken steps to help consumers. Specifically, in 1998 CMS  began publicly reporting information related to the quality of nursing  homes on its Nursing Home Compare website. CMS\u2019s goals for the website include helping consumers compare nursing home quality and  assisting them in finding other information about nursing homes. In order  to further aid consumers using Nursing Home Compare, in 2008 CMS  implemented the Five-Star Quality Rating System (Five-Star System) on  the website. The Five-Star System assigns each nursing home an overall  rating and three component ratings based on the extent to which the  nursing home meets CMS\u2019s quality standards and other measures.  According to CMS, the primary goal of the Five-Star System is to provide  consumers with an easy way to understand nursing home quality and  distinguish between high- and low- performing nursing homes.", "In recent years, we and others have expressed concerns with Nursing  Home Compare and the Five-Star System, including concerns over  CMS\u2019s efforts to ensure the usefulness of these tools for consumers. In  our March 2012 report we reviewed, among other things, how the Five- Star System was developed and how CMS ensures its goals are met, and  noted that while the Five-Star System was a significant step toward  increasing the transparency of information important to consumers, to  sustain the system over time the agency would need to make a concerted  effort. CMS agreed with our recommendation to establish\u2014through  planning documents\u2014how its planned efforts would help the agency  achieve the goals of the Five-Star System. Additionally, some nursing  home stakeholder groups have raised concerns about the usefulness of  Nursing Home Compare for consumers as well as the accuracy of its  Five-Star System.", "Given the importance of providing useful information to consumers  choosing a nursing home, along with the concerns raised by nursing  home stakeholders and others, you asked us to examine the use of  Nursing Home Compare and the Five-Star System as tools for  consumers. In this report, we examine:  1.  the information CMS collects about the use of the Nursing Home  Compare website, including its usefulness to consumers, and  potential areas, if any, to improve the website, and  2.  to what extent the Five-Star System on Nursing Home Compare  enables consumers to understand nursing home quality and make  distinctions between high- and low- performing nursing homes.", "To examine the information CMS collects about the use of Nursing Home  Compare, including its usefulness to consumers, and CMS\u2019s efforts to  improve the website, we reviewed documents from CMS, such as reports  on Nursing Home Compare\u2019s website statistics and assessments of its  usability. In addition, we interviewed CMS officials, including those  responsible for the development and oversight of Nursing Home  Compare. We also conducted interviews with 30 nursing home  stakeholders. These included advocacy groups representing consumers  or providers, an organization of government agencies, and nursing home  quality experts at the national level as well as the state level for four  selected states\u2014California, Georgia, Kansas, and Rhode Island. We  selected these four states based on factors such as variation in  geographic region and size (number of nursing homes). We conducted  interviews with these nursing home stakeholders in order to identify the  strengths and weaknesses, as well as potential areas of improvement, of  Nursing Home Compare and the Five-Star System, among other things.  Using this information and CMS internal documentation, we identified  areas of improvement for Nursing Home Compare. We also examined the  information we collected against CMS\u2019s goals for the website and relevant  standards for internal control in the federal government.", "To examine the extent to which the Five-Star System enables consumers  to understand nursing home quality and distinguish between high- and  low- performing nursing homes, we analyzed CMS documents, including  its February 2015 Five-Star System Technical Users\u2019 Guide, the relevant  guide at the time of our analysis. We also interviewed CMS officials,  including those knowledgeable about the methodology for determining  Five-Star System ratings, and national and state nursing home  stakeholders, as described above. Furthermore, we analyzed CMS\u2019s  Five-Star System ratings data from the most recent full quarter of data  available at the time of our analysis, which ended December 2015. First,  for nursing homes with adjacent overall ratings (i.e., 4-star homes  compared to 5-star and 3-star homes) we examined the extent to which  these homes\u2019 underlying component scores overlapped at the state level.  For example, we examined the extent to which the component scores for  nursing homes that received a 4-star overall rating were higher or lower  than the component scores for nursing homes that received a 5- or 3-star  overall rating. Second, we determined the average age of the data used  to calculate each nursing home\u2019s overall rating and component ratings.  Third, we recalculated overall star ratings on a national basis using the  Five-Star System\u2019s methodology to determine how nursing homes\u2019 state- based ratings compare to their nationally based ratings. In addition, we  analyzed consumer complaint data collected and recorded in CMS\u2019s  Automated Survey Processing Environment Complaints/Incidents  Tracking System from July 2015 through December 2015 to examine the  extent to which each nursing home\u2019s overall rating correlated with the  number of consumer complaints registered against it. We examined the  last six months of 2015 to provide a fuller picture of each nursing home\u2019s  routine complaint levels. We analyzed these data at the national level and  for all 50 states and Washington, D.C., as appropriate. Finally, we  obtained 2015 nursing home resident satisfaction survey data from two of  our four selected states and compared these data to each nursing home\u2019s  overall Five-Star rating from that same year in order to determine the  extent to which the overall ratings for nursing homes in those two states  correlated with the level of consumer satisfaction. The findings from this  final analysis cannot be generalized to other states. For all data used in  these analyses, we interviewed knowledgeable officials and reviewed  related documentation, and based on these steps, determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable to explore the relationship between the  overall rating and the component ratings, describe the age of the data,  determine national rating distributions, and assess consumer satisfaction  information. We examined the information contained in the Five-Star  System against CMS\u2019s goals for the Five-Star System and HHS\u2019s Agency  for Healthcare Research and Quality\u2019s National Quality Measures  Clearinghouse.

Nursing homes with five  stars are considered to have much above average quality, while nursing  homes receiving one star are considered to have much below average  quality. Calculation of the overall star rating is based on separate ratings  that nursing homes receive for each of three components: health  inspections, staffing, and quality measures.", "Health inspection rating. CMS contracts with state survey agencies  to conduct unannounced, on-site nursing home health inspections\u2014 known as standard surveys\u2014to determine whether nursing homes  meet federal quality standards. Every nursing home receiving  Medicare or Medicaid payment must undergo a standard survey not  less than once every 15 months, and the statewide average interval  for these surveys must not exceed 12 months. State surveyors also  conduct complaint investigations in response to allegations of quality  problems. If nursing homes are found to be out of compliance with  any requirements, state surveyors issue deficiency citations that  reflect the scope (number of residents affected) and severity (level of  harm to residents) of the deficiency. Surveyors conduct revisits to the  nursing home to ensure that the deficiencies identified have been  corrected. A nursing home\u2019s health inspection rating is relative to  other nursing homes\u2019 health inspection ratings in their state. As such,  health inspection ratings are assigned to generally achieve the  following distribution within each state: the top 10 percent of nursing  homes receive five stars, the bottom 20 percent receive one star, and  the middle 70 percent of nursing homes receive two, three, or four  stars.", "Staffing rating. Nursing homes self-report staffing hours worked for a  2-week period at the time of the standard survey. CMS converts the  reported point-in-time staffing hours for nursing staff\u2014registered  nurses, licensed practical nurses, and certified nursing assistants\u2014 into measures that indicate the number of registered nurse and total  nursing hours per resident per day. CMS adjusts the staffing levels  for differences in the level of complexity of nursing services required  to care for residents across nursing homes\u2014referred to as resident  acuity. Each nursing home\u2019s staffing rating is assigned based on how  its total nursing and registered nurse staffing levels compare to the  distribution of staffing levels for freestanding homes in the nation and  staffing level thresholds identified by CMS.", "Quality measure rating. Nursing homes regularly collect assessment  information on all their residents, including information on the  residents\u2019 health, physical functioning, mental status, and general  well-being. Nursing homes self-report this information to CMS. CMS  uses some of the assessment information to measure the quality of  certain aspects of nursing home care, such as the prevalence of  pressure sores and changes in residents\u2019 mobility. At the time of our  analysis, CMS calculated this rating for each nursing home based on  11 of the 18 quality measures posted on Nursing Home Compare.  Information on the remaining 7 quality measures is posted on the  website but not used in the calculation of the rating.

The overall rating is assigned based on the following steps:  1.  Start with the number of stars for the health inspection rating.  2.  Add one star if the staffing rating is four or five stars and also greater  than the health inspection rating. Subtract one star if the staffing rating  is one star.

CMS held three  stakeholder meetings from 2010 through 2015. According to CMS  documents, stakeholders have included groups that represent  consumers, such as ombudsmen, consumer advocate groups, provider  advocate groups, and others that are involved in nursing home services.  Information exchanged during stakeholder meetings includes CMS  presentations on pending changes, such as the development of new  quality measures, and stakeholder feedback.", "The mechanisms that CMS utilizes to collect information about the use of  Nursing Home Compare provide the agency with valuable information.  However, these mechanisms do not provide CMS with information on the  usefulness of the website to a broader range of consumers. Specifically,  the usability tests are not designed to assess the website\u2019s usefulness to  consumers, and the website analytics and user surveys only provide  information about consumers who access the website. Therefore, the  mechanisms do not provide CMS with information on nursing home  consumers who have not used the website because they are unaware of  it, or choose not to use it, as well as the reasons why. In stakeholder  interviews we conducted, some nursing home stakeholders noted that  many consumers do not know about the website and that consumers  collect information from other sources.

According to many stakeholders,  Nursing Home Compare is a valuable tool for consumers but a few  specified that additional explanatory information is needed; without such  information, the usefulness of the website may be limited.", "Although CMS has identified the need for improvements to its Nursing  Home Compare website, the agency does not have a systematic process  that prioritizes recommended website changes and sets a timeline for  implementation. In response to a recommendation in our 2012 report, in  August 2013, CMS developed a strategic plan for evaluating the usability  of Nursing Home Compare. The plan described tasks, including an  expert review of the website, an analysis of competitor websites, and  usability testing, some of which resulted in the formal mechanisms that  CMS now has in place to collect information on the use of Nursing Home  Compare, as previously described. However, CMS does not have a  documented and systematic approach describing how to prioritize  recommended changes to the website and assessing the potential  improvements. Instead, officials described a fragmented approach to  reviewing and implementing recommended website changes that may  include verbal discussions of various factors, such as which changes  would provide the broadest impact. CMS officials stated that their current  approach to handling website changes had been working well, but since  the website has become more complex in recent years, they  acknowledged the need for a more formalized approach in addressing  identified website changes.", "CMS has stated the goal for its Nursing Home Compare website as  assisting consumers in finding and comparing information about nursing  home quality. In addition, under federal internal control standards,  management should address identified program deficiencies on a timely  basis and evaluate appropriate actions for improvement.

Specifically, we found that, in 37 out of 50 states, homes that received an  overall rating of 5-stars consistently had higher health inspection scores\u2014 the component measure that most significantly contributes to the overall  rating\u2014than homes that received an overall rating of 1-star. This means  that in the 37 states, consumers can safely assume that, in the case of  health inspections, the performance of any nursing home in their state  with an overall high 5-star rating is better than the performance of any  home with an overall low 1-star rating. Some stakeholders we spoke with  agreed that distinctions between nursing homes are clearest at the  extremes. For example, one stakeholder noted that the Five-Star System  is best at helping consumers identify the poorest performing homes to  avoid. Stakeholders also noted the value of having a national resource  that uses standardized and objective nursing home quality information.", "However, we also identified four factors that may inhibit the ability of  consumers to use the Five-Star System ratings as an easy way to  understand nursing home quality and identify high- and low- performing  homes, CMS\u2019s stated goal for the Five-Star System.  1.  Interpreting overall ratings. As previously described, the Five-Star  System\u2019s overall rating is calculated using a process that combines  three component ratings. However, the formula for combining the  components is not intuitive, which can make interpreting overall  ratings difficult for consumers by both complicating the comparison of  overall ratings and masking the importance of the component ratings.  Specifically, the comparison of overall ratings can be complicated  because a consumer cannot assume that the performance on a  particular component of the higher-rated home is better than that of  the lower-rated home. In our review, we generally did not find  distinctions in the scores for homes in the same state with adjacent  overall ratings\u2014e.g., 2- and 3-star homes\u2014or for homes with middle  overall ratings\u20142-, 3-, and 4-star homes. For example, in one state,  28 percent of homes with a 3-star overall rating had a better health  inspection score than the average health inspection score for homes  with an overall 4-star rating. Furthermore, the way CMS calculates  the overall rating can mask for consumers issues that may be present  in the component ratings. A consumer comparing nursing homes will  see each home\u2019s overall rating and component ratings, but they may  not understand the impact each component score has on the overall  rating. This could lead a consumer to rely more on the overall rating  when their individual needs may require attention to one specific  component more than the others. For example, two nursing homes  that both have a 4-star overall rating could have opposite quality  measure component ratings\u2014one with a low 1-star quality measure  rating and the other with a high 5-star quality measure rating. (See fig.  2).", "Many stakeholders stated that it is difficult to distinguish between  nursing homes with adjacent or middle ratings. In addition, some  stakeholders expressed concern about the overall rating, with one  explaining that often consumers make decisions based on the overall  rating without understanding it or looking at the underlying  components. According to CMS officials, the overall rating provides a  summary of complex information to guide consumers\u2014not an explicit  report card\u2014in as simple a way as possible. They also added that by  providing individual component ratings, consumers have the ability to  dig deeper into the source of the overall rating.  2.  Timeliness of ratings data. Each of the three rating components\u2014 which influence the overall star rating\u2014use a unique source of data  that are collected from nursing homes at different time intervals.  Specifically, the number of stars assigned to a nursing home is a  point-in-time picture of performance based on a prior snapshot of the  home\u2019s performance and may not reflect a nursing home\u2019s current  status. (See table 2). Some stakeholders we spoke with expressed  concern that a consumer may make a decision about a nursing home  based on data that does not reflect current conditions in the home.  According to CMS officials, a delay is always present due to  administrative processes such as validating data prior to being  posted. For example, the health inspection component data may be  delayed due to additional information from the outcomes of revisits to  the nursing home to check that deficiencies have been corrected.  CMS officials and stakeholders said the Five-Star System should not  be the only source of information a consumer uses; they both  encourage consumers to explore additional information including  visiting the home.  3.  Comparing nursing homes across states. The overall rating and  health inspection rating do not allow consumers to compare the  quality of homes across states, limiting the ability of the rating system  to help consumers who live near state borders or have multistate  options where they could place their family members. Because ratings  are relative to other nursing homes within a state, homes that receive  the highest and lowest ratings in their state may not be the highest or  lowest performing homes in another state or nationally. So, a  consumer cannot assume that a 5-star nursing home in one state  would be rated as a 5-star home in any other state. (See fig. 3).  Furthermore, we found that when we recalculated the star ratings  using a national distribution rather than a state distribution, homes\u2019  ratings often changed, sometimes dramatically. For example, about  23 percent of nursing homes with a 1-star overall rating in December  2015 had improved ratings when compared nationally and about 30  percent of homes with a 5-star overall rating had decreased ratings  when compared nationally. When looking at individual states, we  found that the nursing homes in some states would fare better or  worse under a national rating. Specifically, the percentage of homes  receiving an overall 1-star rating doubled in 4 states and the  percentage of homes receiving an overall 5-star rating doubled in 9  states. See appendix III for additional information about the results of  our analysis.", "According to CMS Five-Star System documentation, the rating system  is not designed to compare nursing homes nationally. Instead, ratings  are only comparable for homes in the same state. CMS made the  decision to base the health inspection component on the relative  performance of homes within the same state primarily due to variation  across the states in the execution of the standard surveys. Because  the health inspection component most significantly contributes to the  overall rating, this means that the overall rating also cannot be  compared nationally. However, the addition of national ratings would  be helpful for consumers and we have previously made  recommendations to CMS that would help decrease survey variation  across states. CMS has taken action on many of these  recommendations.  4.  Lack of consumer satisfaction information in ratings. Because the  Five-Star System does not include consumer satisfaction  information\u2014a key quality performance measure\u2014the rating system  is missing important information that could help consumers distinguish  between high- and low- performing nursing homes. We believe  consumer satisfaction surveys could be a more direct measure of  nursing home satisfaction than other available measures. For  example, our analysis of consumer satisfaction data shows that  nursing homes with higher overall star ratings did not necessarily  have higher resident satisfaction scores or fewer complaints. (See fig.  4). Specifically, our analysis found that the Five-Star System overall  ratings for each nursing home in two states that conduct resident  satisfaction surveys were only slightly correlated with the percentage  of residents that would recommend the home to other consumers\u2014an  indicator of consumer satisfaction included on the state surveys.  Similarly, when analyzing complaint data for all states\u2014a proxy for  consumer satisfaction\u2014we also found only a slight correlation  between the total number of consumer complaints registered against  a home in each state and the home\u2019s overall Five-Star System  rating. Many stakeholders told us that they would like to see resident  satisfaction included in the Five-Star System. For example, one state  stakeholder group explained that they think it is important for a  consumer making a nursing home decision to understand how the  administration resolves an issue with a resident when one arises. That  type of information is not currently captured in the Five-Star System,  but could be captured through a resident satisfaction survey, which  could strengthen the ratings.", "According to CMS officials, they recognize that consumer satisfaction  is important information, but collecting the data in a consistent,  objective way for all of the nursing homes in the country is a  challenge. They acknowledged that some states have been able to  overcome these implementation challenges and administer statewide  nursing home consumer satisfaction surveys. Until consumer  satisfaction information is included in the rating system, consumers  will continue to make nursing home decisions without the benefit of  this key performance measure and may not be choosing the home  that would best meet their needs. While we recognize that gathering  this information is challenging, CMS has done so in its hospital rating  system. Specifically, CMS developed a hospital consumer satisfaction  survey with assistance from HHS\u2019s Agency for Healthcare Research  and Quality\u2014an agency that, among other things, focuses on quality  measurement and includes consumer satisfaction as one of its  National Quality Measures Clearinghouse\u2019s clinical quality measures.", "In addition to the items discussed above, presentation of the Five-Star  System does not prominently display key explanatory information that  could help consumers better understand how to use the ratings.  Specifically, we found that CMS does not prominently provide  descriptions of how to understand the ratings and what consumers should  consider when using the ratings or information on how the overall rating is  calculated. In addition, CMS clearly discloses the date of the data used to  assign stars for the health inspection component, but not for the staffing  or quality measure components, and does not prominently state the  previously discussed limitation that homes can only be compared within a  state. For example, in order to find descriptions of how the overall rating  is calculated, consumers must follow links that take them off of their  nursing home search and results webpages and, as noted previously, an  average webpage visit is less than 6 minutes. Many stakeholders we  spoke with explained that consumers often have very little time to make a  nursing home decision, and a few noted that it is also a stressful process,  therefore making prominent and readily available information crucial. In  addition, many stakeholders expressed concerns that consumers may not  understand the ratings and how they are calculated. Further, many  stakeholders expressed concern about the timeliness of the data, with  some noting that consumers were generally unaware of the timing of the  data. CMS officials described the tension between keeping the Five-Star  System as simple as possible for consumers so that they can quickly  understand the ratings and also providing enough information on how and  when the ratings are calculated. Collectively, the four factors that hinder  consumers\u2019 ability to use the Five-Star System ratings, along with the lack  of explanatory information provided by CMS, may limit the Five-Star  System\u2019s ability to meet CMS\u2019s goal of providing consumers with an easy  way to understand nursing home quality and make distinctions between  high- and low- performing homes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Nursing Home Compare and the Five-Star System seek to help  consumers choose among nursing homes. Nursing home selection can  be a stressful and time-sensitive process, so these are important tools  that CMS makes available to the public. However, our review found  opportunities for improvement in both the website and the ratings. CMS  has given much attention to the website since its inception almost 20  years ago. For example, the agency has put in place mechanisms for  reviewing the website\u2019s use and has identified numerous improvements  that could be made. However, without a systematic process for reviewing  options and determining priorities for improvement\u2014currently absent from  their efforts\u2014CMS is unable to ensure that the website is meeting its  intended goal.", "A key component of the website is the Five-Star System, containing  important quality information on every nursing home so consumers can  differentiate between them and choose those that can best meet their  needs. Because the Five-Star System contains multiple types of  information, compiled from different sources, and has complexities  inherent in ratings systems, it can be challenging for consumers to fully  understand how to take advantage of the varied information it contains.  Additional capability and information not currently included in the rating  system could also benefit consumers trying to differentiate between high-  and low- performing nursing homes\u2014such as the ability to compare  homes nationally and the addition of consumer satisfaction survey  information. In addition, prominently displaying explanatory information on  how to use the ratings, which does not require users to navigate off the  nursing home search and results pages, could help address challenges  consumers face when trying to understand the ratings. Absent such  enhancements, CMS cannot ensure that the Five-Star System is fully  meeting its stated goal of helping consumers easily understand nursing  home quality and distinguish between high- and low- performing homes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen CMS\u2019s efforts to improve the usefulness of the Nursing  Home Compare website for consumers, we recommend that the  Administrator of CMS establish a systematic process for reviewing  potential website improvements that includes and describes steps on how  CMS will prioritize the implementation of potential website improvements.", "To help improve the Five-Star System\u2019s ability to enable consumers to  understand nursing home quality and make distinctions between high-  and low- performing homes, we recommend that the Administrator of  CMS take the following three actions: add information to the Five-Star System that allows consumers to  compare nursing homes nationally; evaluate the feasibility of adding consumer satisfaction information to  the Five-Star System; and develop and test with consumers introductory explanatory information  on the Five-Star System to be prominently displayed on the home  page. Such information should explain, for example, how the overall  rating is calculated, the importance of the component ratings, where  to find information on the timeliness of the data, and whether the  ratings can be used to compare nursing homes nationally."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for its review and comment.  HHS provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix V. In  its comments, HHS described the history of the Nursing Home Compare  website and the Five-Star System, improvements the agency has made  to both, and concurred with three of our four recommendations. In  particular, HHS concurred with our recommendations to establish a  process for reviewing potential website improvements that describes how  it will prioritize their implementation, evaluate the feasibility of adding  consumer satisfaction information to the Five-Star System, and develop  and test explanatory information on the Five-Star System to be displayed  on the home page. HHS did not concur with our recommendation to add  information to the Five-Star System that would allow consumers to  compare nursing homes nationally. HHS indicated that because of state  variation in the execution of standard surveys, it is difficult to compare  homes nationally on the health inspection component. They also noted  that the Five-Star System is just one of many factors consumers should  use when selecting a nursing home. As we describe in this report, efforts  have been and should continue to be made to reduce state variation in  standard surveys. For example, CMS regional offices are tracking state  differences in deficiency citations. We maintain that the ability for  consumers to compare nursing homes nationally is critical to making  nursing home decisions, especially for those consumers who live near  state borders or have multistate options, and that our recommendation  remains valid.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from its  date.

For this examination, we analyzed data from three sources. We  analyzed Five-Star System data from the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS). These data provide detailed rating information  on over 15,000 nursing homes included in the Five-Star System from the  most recent full quarter available at the time of our analysis, which ended  December 2015. Additionally, we analyzed CMS consumer complaint  data for a six-month period ending in December 2015. We collected and  analyzed these data for all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Furthermore,  we collected and analyzed 2015 nursing home resident satisfaction  survey data from two of our four selected states that collect survey data.", "We conducted the following analyses:  1.  To determine the extent to which the Five-Star System provides  consumers with information distinguishing between high- and low-  performing nursing homes, we analyzed December 2015 data from  CMS\u2019s publicly available Five-Star Scores and Ratings data.  Specifically, for each state, we determined the range of scores that  underlie each component star rating: for health inspection we used  the weighted all cycles score, for staffing we looked at the total  adjusted staffing score, and for quality measures we calculated the  total quality measure score\u2014for each nursing home\u2019s overall rating.  We then determined whether, within each state and for each  component rating, the scores of the worst performing 5-star nursing  homes overlapped with the scores of the best performing 1-star  nursing homes. We also conducted this analysis for each  combination of the star ratings.  2.  To determine the timeliness (or age) of the data used for each  component Five-Star ratings for consumers viewing the ratings in  December 2015, we analyzed data from CMS\u2019s Five-Star Scores and  Ratings data for that month downloaded from CMS\u2019s website.  Specifically, we calculated the average age of the data for each  component rating at that point in time. For the health inspection  component, we analyzed the standard survey date, but did not  analyze the complaint investigation date because a meaningful  average age cannot be calculated.  3.  To determine the extent to which nursing homes\u2019 ratings changed  when compared nationally rather than compared only within each  state, we analyzed December 2015 data from CMS\u2019s Five-Star Score  and Ratings data downloaded from CMS\u2019s website. Specifically, we  recalculated each nursing home\u2019s health inspection and quality  measure scores that are normally assigned based on state  distributions so that they were based on a national distribution (new  distribution allotments were based on CMS\u2019s state distribution  guidelines). We then recalculated each home\u2019s overall rating using  our new health inspection component rating, our new quality measure  rating, and CMS\u2019s staffing component rating. In addition, we  analyzed the change in overall nursing home ratings when applying  the methodology nationally.  4.  To determine the relationship between nursing home satisfaction data  and CMS\u2019s Five-Star ratings, we did the following:  a.  We used complaints registered against nursing homes by  residents, families, ombudsmen, or others as a proxy  measurement of satisfaction. Specifically, we analyzed complaint  data recorded in CMS\u2019s Automated Survey Processing  Environment Complaints/Incidents Tracking System from July 1  through December 31, 2015. We examined the last six months of  2015 to provide a fuller picture of each nursing home\u2019s routine  complaint levels. For each state and nationally, we determined the  correlation between each nursing home\u2019s total number of  registered consumer complaints and its overall Five-Star rating.  b.  We used the results of 2015 nursing home resident satisfaction  surveys from two of our selected states that collect such  information. Specifically, we focused on the responses to whether  the resident would recommend that nursing home to others as a  measure of satisfaction. In one state, this measure was the actual  percentage of residents that recommended the home and in the  other state it was the ranking of the home based on residents\u2019  responses. For both states, we determined the correlation  between each nursing home\u2019s resident response on the state  survey and its overall Five-Star rating. The findings from this  analysis cannot be generalized to other states.", "For all data used in these analyses, we interviewed knowledgeable  officials and reviewed related documentation and based on these steps  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to explore the  relationship between the overall rating and the component ratings,  determine national rating distributions, assess consumer satisfaction  information, and describe the age of the data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Nursing Home Stakeholder Views on Consumer Use of Nursing Home Compare", "paragraphs": ["We held interviews with 30 nursing home stakeholders\u2014eight national  stakeholders and 22 state stakeholders from four states (Rhode Island,  Georgia, Kansas, and California) we selected based on factors such as  variation in geographic region and size (number of nursing homes).  These stakeholders represent a range of provider groups, consumer  groups, government agencies, and technical experts. We selected  organizations in each state and nationally that are relevant to nursing  home consumers and providers. Technical experts were identified by their  prominence in the nursing home quality research field. In addition, some  stakeholders we interviewed identified other groups that would be  appropriate to interview. Our interviews included a set of questions  regarding consumer use of Nursing Home Compare. Responses to these  questions cannot be generalized beyond the stakeholders we  interviewed.", "We found that stakeholders generally could not quantify the number of  consumers who use Nursing Home Compare, but most speculated that  consumers use the site \u201ca little\u201d to \u201csomewhat\u201d and a few stakeholders  said that consumers use the website \u201ca lot\u201d. Some stakeholders thought  the number of people using Nursing Home Compare was growing, and  one stakeholder thought this was because people are generally trying to  make more educated decisions about nursing home care. Another  stakeholder thought this increase could also be a result of people using  the Internet to look things up more frequently, nursing homes included.", "Some stakeholders noted that use of Nursing Home Compare probably  differs depending on whether the patient is searching for care in an urban  or a rural setting. Specifically, they stated that they think Nursing Home  Compare is used more frequently in urban areas, where more nursing  home options are available, compared to rural areas where there may be  only one home in a town. See Table 3 below for summary of stakeholder  responses.", "Some stakeholders stated that they believe the extent to which  consumers use Nursing Home Compare may depend on the amount of  time that the consumer has to research and pick a nursing home. For  example, according to a few stakeholders, if someone\u2019s family member is  getting discharged from the hospital and needs to be placed in a nursing  home immediately, the consumer is less likely to use Nursing Home  Compare. In contrast, one stakeholder noted that if consumers are  planning for the future and researching nursing homes before care is  needed, then they are more likely to use Nursing Home Compare.", "We found that stakeholders were split in their responses about when  consumers would typically use Nursing Home Compare \u2013 whether as an  initial step in beginning their nursing home search or as a way to confirm  recommendations obtained from others. Most stakeholders stated that the  consumer using the website is most likely a family member\u2014usually an  adult child or grandchild\u2014and rarely the individual in need of a nursing  home placement.", "When asked how valuable the information provided on Nursing Home  Compare is to consumers who are researching and choosing a nursing  home, most stakeholders stated that it was \u201csomewhat valuable\u201d, and  some said that they thought it was \u201cvery valuable\u201d. One stakeholder said  that the information was \u201cof little value\u201d. See Table 4 below for a summary  of stakeholder responses.", "Some stakeholders stated that the information on Nursing Home  Compare is a good place to start and may help consumers narrow down  their search, but ultimately it is not likely to be the only source of  information. Many stakeholders agreed that in addition to conducting  online research, consumers should also always try to visit nursing homes  in person before a making a decision. A few stakeholders stated that  observing a nursing home and its current residents firsthand on any given  day provides the most valuable information when making a decision. In  addition, stakeholders noted that consumers also obtain information  about nursing homes through other sources\u2014primarily through word of  mouth from friends, family, and neighbors, and from information provided  by primary care physicians, hospital discharge planners, and local  ombudsmen. Many stakeholders noted that in most cases though, the  location of a nursing home is often the main determinant of where a  family member is placed.", "Stakeholders mentioned that consumers also use third party, private  websites, and in some states, such as California and Kansas, consumers  may rely on websites with state-specific nursing home information. Some  stakeholders thought that consumers used these other sources of  information more often than Nursing Home Compare. A couple of  stakeholders thought consumers preferred these third-party, private  websites because some of them provide a more personalized experience  and offer the opportunity to speak with someone on the phone, where  CMS\u2019s Nursing Home Compare does not provide either of those options.  A couple other stakeholders thought that consumers may be more likely  to use and trust Nursing Home Compare compared to these other private  websites simply because it is a government website. A couple of  stakeholders expressed concern about consumers using third-party,  private websites because nursing homes may pay to be included, and so  the website may not provide objective information on nursing home  options for consumers. Additionally, these private websites often appear  on search engine results before Nursing Home Compare, so consumers  may use them before seeing and using CMS\u2019s Nursing Home Compare  website.", "Finally, stakeholders provided mixed responses regarding whether they  suggested consumers use Nursing Home Compare when helping them  search for nursing homes. For example, several stakeholders told us that  they routinely referred consumers to the website, while another said that  she would only direct consumers to Nursing Home Compare if they were  not familiar with the area, or if did not have any time to spend on the  nursing home search process. The stakeholder would ultimately  recommend the consumer coming in and talking to her, and then would  not use Nursing Home Compare at all."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Potential Changes to Ratings If National Distribution Used Rather than Existing State Distribution, December 2015", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Correlation between Consumer Complaints, July through December 2015, and Overall Ratings, December 2015", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact name above, Linda Kohn, Director, Karin  Wallestad, Assistant Director, Kathryn Richter, Analyst-In-Charge, Amy  Andresen, Julianne Flowers, Shannon Smith, and Brienne Tierney made  key contributions to this report.
