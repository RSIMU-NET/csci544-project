One element of SBI is SBInet--the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) program responsible for developing a comprehensive border protection system through a mix of security infrastructure (e.g., fencing), and surveillance and communication technologies (e.g., radars, sensors, cameras, and satellite phones). The House Committee on Homeland Security asked GAO to monitor DHS progress in implementing the SBInet program. This testimony provides GAO's observations on (1) SBInet technology implementation; (2) SBInet infrastructure implementation; (3) the extent to which CBP has determined the impact of SBInet technology and infrastructure on its workforce needs and operating procedures; and (4) how the CBP SBI Program Management Office (PMO) has defined its human capital goals and the progress it has made to achieve these goals. GAO's observations are based on analysis of DHS documentation, such as program schedules, contracts, status, and reports. GAO also conducted interviews with DHS officials and contractors, and visits to sites in the southwest border where SBInet deployment is underway. GAO performed the work from April 2007 through October 2007. DHS generally agreed with GAO's findings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS has made some progress to implement Project 28--the first segment of SBInet technology across the southwest border, but it has fallen behind its planned schedule. The SBInet contractor delivered the components (i.e., radars, sensors and cameras) to the Project 28 site in Tucson, Arizona on schedule. However, Project 28 is incomplete more than 4 months after it was to become operational--at which point Border Patrol agents were to begin using SBInet technology to support their activities. According to DHS, the delays are primarily due to software integration problems. In September 2007, DHS officials said that the Project 28 contractor was making progress in correcting the problems, but DHS was unable to specify a date when the system would be operational. Due to the slippage in completing Project 28, DHS is revising the SBInet implementation schedule for follow-on technology projects, but still plans to deploy technology along 387 miles of the southwest border by December 31, 2008. DHS is also taking steps to strengthen its contract management for Project 28. SBInet infrastructure deployment along the southwest border is on schedule, but meeting CBP's goal to have 370 miles of pedestrian fence and 200 miles of vehicle barriers in place by December 31, 2008, may be challenging and more costly than planned. CBP met its intermediate goal to deploy 70 miles of new fencing in fiscal year 2007 and the average cost per mile was $2.9 million. The SBInet PMO estimates that deployment costs for remaining fencing will be similar to those thus far. In the past, DHS has minimized infrastructure construction labor costs by using Border Patrol agents and Department of Defense military personnel. However, CBP officials report that they plan to use commercial labor for future fencing projects. The additional cost of commercial labor and potential unforeseen increases in contract costs suggest future deployment could be more costly than planned. DHS officials also reported other challenging factors they will continue to face for infrastructure deployment, including community resistance, environmental considerations, and difficulties in acquiring rights to land along the border. The impact of SBInet on CBP's workforce needs and operating procedures remains unclear because the SBInet technology is not fully identified or deployed. CBP officials expect the number of Border Patrol agents required to meet mission needs to change from current projections, but until the system is fully deployed, the direction and magnitude of the change is unknown. For the Tucson sector, where Project 28 is being deployed, Border Patrol officials are developing a plan on how to integrate SBInet into their operating procedures. The SBI PMO tripled in size during fiscal year 2007, but fell short of its staffing goal of 270 employees. Agency officials expressed concerns that staffing shortfalls could affect the agency's capacity to provide adequate contractor oversight. In addition, the SBInet PMO has not yet completed long-term human capital planning."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss observations on selected aspects  of the Secure Border Initiative\u2019s SBInet program implementation.", "Securing the nation\u2019s borders from illegal entry of aliens and contraband,  including terrorists and weapons of mass destruction, continues to be a  major concern.

SBInet technology is also intended to include the  development and deployment of a common operating picture (COP) that  provides uniform data through a command center environment to Border  Patrol agents in the field and all DHS agencies and to be interoperable  with stakeholders external to DHS, such as local law enforcement.  The  initial focus of SBInet is on the southwest border areas between ports of  entry that CBP has designated as having the highest need for enhanced  border security because of serious vulnerabilities.

As the prime contractor,  Boeing is responsible for acquiring, deploying, and sustaining selected  SBInet technology and tactical infrastructure projects.  In this way, Boeing  has extensive involvement in the SBInet program requirements  development, design, production, integration, testing, and maintenance  and support of SBInet projects. Moreover, Boeing is responsible for  selecting and managing a team of subcontractors that provide individual  components for Boeing to integrate into the SBInet system.

Project 28 is the first opportunity for Boeing to demonstrate  that its technology system can meet SBInet performance requirements in a  real-life environment. Boeing\u2019s inability thus far to resolve system  integration issues has left Project 28 incomplete more than 4 months after  its planned June 13 milestone to become operational\u2014at which point,  Border Patrol agents were to begin using SBInet technology to support  their activities, and CBP was to begin its operational test and evaluation  phase.  Boeing delivered and deployed the individual technology  components of Project 28 on schedule. Nevertheless, CBP and Boeing  officials reported that Boeing has been unable to effectively integrate the  information collected from several of the newly deployed technology  components, such as sensor towers, cameras, radars, and unattended  ground sensors. Among several technical problems reported were that it  was taking too long for radar information to display in command centers  and newly deployed radars were being activated by rain, making the  system unusable. In August 2007, CBP officially notified Boeing that it  would not accept Project 28 until these and other problems were  corrected.  In September 2007, CBP officials told us that Boeing was  making progress in correcting the system integration problems; however,  CBP was unable to provide us with a specific date when Boeing would  complete the corrections necessary to make Project 28 operational. See  figures 2 and 3 below for photographs of SBInet technology along the  southwest border.", "The SBInet PMO reported that is in the early stages of planning for  additional SBInet technology projects along the southwest border;  however, Boeing\u2019s delay in completing Project 28 has led the PMO to  change the timeline for deploying some of these projects. In August 2007,  SBInet PMO officials told us they were revising the SBInet implementation  plan to delay interim project milestones for the first phase of SBInet  technology projects, scheduled for calendar years 2007 and 2008. For  example, SBInet PMO officials said they were delaying the start dates for  two projects that were to be modeled on the design used for Project 28  until after Project 28 is operational and can provide lessons learned for  planning and deploying additional SBInet technology along the southwest  border. According to the SBInet master schedule dated May 31, 2007, these  projects were to become operational in December 2007 and May 2008.  Despite these delays, SBInet PMO officials said they still expected to  complete all of the first phase of technology projects by the end of  calendar year 2008. As of October 15, 2007, the SBInet PMO had not  provided us with a revised deployment schedule for this first phase.", "CBP reports that it is taking steps to strengthen its contract management  for Project 28. For example, citing numerous milestone slippages by  Boeing during Project 28 implementation, in August 2007, CBP sought and  reached an agreement with Boeing to give it greater influence in milestone  setting and planning corrective actions on the Project 28 task order. While  CBP had selected a firm-fixed-price contract to limit cost overruns on  Project 28, CBP officials told us that the firm-fixed-price contract CBP  used for Project 28 had limited the government\u2019s role in directing Boeing  in its decision making process. For example, CBP and contractor officials  told us they expressed concern about the timeline for completing Project  28, but CBP chose not to modify the contract because doing so would have  made CBP responsible for costs beyond the $20 million fixed-price  contract. In mid-August 2007, CBP organized a meeting with Boeing  representatives to discuss ways to improve the collaborative process, the  submission of milestones, and Boeing\u2019s plan to correct Project 28  problems. Following this meeting, CBP and Boeing initiated a Change  Control Board. In mid-September representatives from Boeing\u2019s SBInet  team and its subcontractors continued to participate on this board and  vote on key issues for solving Project 28 problems. Although CBP  participates on this committee as a non-voting member, a senior SBInet  official said the government\u2019s experience on the Change Control Board  had been positive thus far. For example, the official told us that the  Change Control Board had helped improve coordination and integration  with Boeing and for suggesting changes to the subcontractor companies  working on Project 28."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBInet Tactical Infrastructure Deployment on Track but May Be Challenging and More Costly than Planned", "paragraphs": ["Deploying SBInet\u2019s tactical infrastructure along the southwest border is on  schedule, but meeting the SBInet program\u2019s goal to have 370 miles of  pedestrian fence and 200 miles of vehicle barriers in place by December  31, 2008, may be challenging and more costly than planned. CBP set an  intermediate goal to deploy 70 miles of new pedestrian fencing by the  close of fiscal year 2007 and, having deployed 73 miles by this date,  achieved its goal. Table 1 summarizes CBP\u2018s progress and plans for  tactical infrastructure deployment.", "Costs for the 73 miles of fencing constructed in fiscal year 2007 averaged  $2.9 million per mile and ranged from $700,000 in San Luis, Arizona, to $4.8  million per mile in Sasabe, Arizona. CBP also deployed 11 miles of vehicle  barriers and, although CBP has not yet been able to provide us with the  cost of these vehicle barriers, it projects that the average per mile cost for  the first 75 miles of barriers it deploys will be $1.5 million. Figure 4  presents examples of fencing deployed.", "CBP estimates costs for the deployment of fencing in the future will be  similar to those thus far. However, according to CBP officials, costs vary  due to the type of terrain, materials used, land acquisition, who performs  the construction, and the need to meet an expedited schedule.  Although  CBP estimates that the average cost of remaining fencing will be $2.8  million per mile, actual future costs may be higher due to factors such as  the greater cost of commercial labor, higher than expected property  acquisition costs, and unforeseen costs associated with working in remote  areas.  To minimize one of the many factors that add to cost, in the past  DHS has used Border Patrol agents and DOD military personnel.   However, CBP officials reported that they plan to use commercial labor  for future infrastructure projects to meet their deadlines. Of the 73 miles  of fencing completed to date, 31 were completed by DOD military  personnel and 42 were constructed through commercial contracts.  While  the non-commercial projects cost an average of $1.2 million per mile, the  commercial projects averaged over three times more\u2014$4 million.", "According to CBP officials, CBP plans to utilize exclusively commercial  contracts to complete the remaining 219 miles of fencing. If contract costs  for deployment of remaining miles are consistent with those to deploy  tactical infrastructure to date and average $4 million per mile, the total  contract cost will be $890 million, considerably more than CBP\u2019s initial  estimate of $650 million.", "Although deployment of tactical infrastructure is on schedule, CBP  officials reported that meeting deadlines has been challenging because  factors they will continue to face include conducting outreach necessary  to address border community resistance, devoting time to identify and  complete steps necessary to comply with environmental regulations, and  addressing difficulties in acquiring rights to border lands. As of July 2007  CBP anticipated community resistance to deployment for 130 of its 370  miles of fencing.  According to community leaders, communities resist  fencing deployment for reasons including the adverse effect they  anticipate it will have on cross-border commerce and community unity. In  addition to consuming time, complying with environmental regulations,  and acquiring rights to border land can also drive up costs.  Although CBP  officials state that they are proactively addressing these challenges, these  factors will continue to pose a risk to meeting deployment targets.", "In an effort to identify low cost and easily deployable fencing solutions,  CBP funded a project called Fence Lab. CBP plans to try to contain costs  by utilizing the results of Fence Lab in the future.  Fence Lab tested nine  fence/barrier prototypes and evaluated them based on performance  criteria such as their ability to disable a vehicle traveling at 40 miles per  hour (see fig. 5), allowing animals to migrate through them, and their cost- effectiveness.  Based on the results from the lab, SBInet has developed  three types of vehicle barriers and one pedestrian fence that meet CBP  operational requirements (see fig. 6).  The pedestrian fence can be  installed onto two of these vehicle barriers to create a hybrid pedestrian  fence and vehicle barrier.  CBP plans to include these solutions in a  \u201ctoolkit\u201d of approved fences and barriers, and plans to deploy solutions  from this toolkit for all remaining vehicle barriers and for 202 of 225 miles  of remaining fencing.  Further, CBP officials anticipate that deploying  these solutions will reduce costs because cost-effectiveness was a  criterion for their inclusion in the toolkit.  SBInet officials also told us that  widely deploying a select set of vehicle barriers and fences will lower  costs through enabling it to make bulk purchases of construction and  maintenance materials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBInet Impact on Border Patrol\u2019s Workforce Needs and Operating Procedures Remains Unclear", "paragraphs": ["While SBInet Program officials expect SBInet to greatly reduce the time  spent by CBP enforcement personnel in performing detection activities, a  full evaluation of SBInet\u2019s impact on the Border Patrol\u2019s workforce needs  has not been completed.
