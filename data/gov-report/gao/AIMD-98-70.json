As agreed with your offices, our objectives were to determine whether (1) the architecture is complete and (2) Customs has processes and procedures to enforce compliance with the architecture. To do so, we compared Customs\u2019 architecture and associated processes to applicable Department of Treasury and related federal architecture requirements. We performed our work at Customs\u2019 headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the Newington Data Center in Newington, Virginia, from July 1997 through January 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Details of our scope and methodology are contained in appendix I.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Acting Commissioner of Customs or his designee.

It does this by (1) enforcing the laws governing the flow of goods and persons across the borders of the United States and (2) assessing and collecting duties, taxes, and fees on imported merchandise. During fiscal year 1997, Customs collected $22.1 billion in revenue at more than 300 ports of entry, and it processed nearly 450 million passengers who entered the United States during the year.", "To accomplish its mission, Customs is organized into six business areas\u2014trade compliance, outbound, passenger, finance, human resources, and investigations. Each business area is described below.", "The trade compliance business area includes enforcement of laws and regulations associated with the importation of goods into the United States. To enforce compliance with the trade laws and regulations, Customs (1) works with the trade community to promote understanding of applicable laws and regulations, (2) selectively examines cargo to ensure that only eligible goods enter the country, (3) reviews documentation associated with cargo entries to ensure that it is properly valued and classified, (4) collects billions of dollars annually in duties, taxes, and fees associated with imported cargo, (5) assesses fines and penalties for noncompliance with trade laws and regulation, and (6) manages the collection of these moneys to ensure that all trade-related debts due to Customs are paid and properly accounted for.", "The outbound business area includes Customs operations related to the enforcement of laws and regulations associated with the movement of merchandise and conveyances from the United States. To enforce compliance with these laws and regulations, Customs (1) selectively inspects cargo at U.S. ports to guard against the exportation of illegal goods, such as protected technologies, stolen vehicles, and illegal currency, (2) collects, disseminates, and uses intelligence to identify high-risk cargo and passengers, (3) seizes and accounts for illegal cargo, (4) assesses and collects fines and penalties associated with the exportation of illegal cargo, and (5) physically examines baggage and cargo at airport facilities for explosive and nuclear materials. In addition, the outbound business includes collecting and disseminating trade data within the federal government. Accurate trade data are crucial to establishing accurate trade statistics on which to base trade policy decisions and negotiate trade agreements with other countries. By the year 2000, Customs estimates that exports will be valued at $1.2 trillion, as compared to $696 million in 1994.", "The passenger business area includes processing all passengers and crew of arriving and departing (1) air and sea conveyances and (2) noncommercial land vehicles and pedestrians. In fiscal year 1997, Customs processed nearly 450 million travelers, and by the year 2000, expects almost 500 million passengers to arrive in the United States annually. Many of Customs\u2019 passenger activities focus on illegal immigration and drug smuggling and are coordinated with other federal agencies, such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Activities include targeting high-risk passengers, which requires timely and accurate information, and physically inspecting selected passengers, baggage, and vehicles to determine compliance with laws and regulations.", "The finance business area includes asset and revenue management activities. Asset management consists of activities to formulate Customs\u2019 budget; properly allocate and distribute funds; and acquire, manage, and account for personnel, goods, and services. Revenue management encompasses all Customs activities to identify and establish amounts owed Customs, collect these amounts, and accurately report the status of revenue from all sources. Sources of revenue include duties, fees, taxes, other user fees, and forfeited currency and property. The revenue management activities interrelate closely with the revenue collection activities in the trade compliance, outbound, and passenger business areas.", "The human resources business area is responsible for filling positions, providing employee benefits and services, training employees, facilitating workforce effectiveness, and processing personnel actions for Customs\u2019 18,000 employees and managers.", "The investigations business area includes activities to detect and eliminate narcotics and money laundering operations. Customs works with other agencies and foreign governments to reduce drug-related activity by interdicting (seizing and destroying) narcotics, investigating organizations involved in drug smuggling, and deterring smuggling efforts through various other methods. Customs also develops and provides information to the trade and carrier communities to assist them in their efforts to prevent smuggling organizations from using cargo containers and commercial conveyances to introduce narcotics into the United States.", "To carry out its responsibilities, Customs relies on information systems and processes to assist its staff in (1) documenting, inspecting, and accounting for the movement and disposition of imported goods and (2) collecting and accounting for the related revenues. Customs\u2019 Office of Information and Technology (OIT) fiscal year 1998 budget is about $147 million for information management and technology activities. Customs expects its reliance on information systems to increase as a result of its burgeoning workload. For 1995 through 2001, Customs estimates that the annual volume of import trade between the United States and other countries will increase from $761 billion to $1.1 trillion. This will result in Customs processing an estimated increase of 7.5 million commercial entries\u2014 from 13.1 million to 20.6 million annually\u2014during the same period. Recent trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have also increased the number and complexity of trade provisions that Customs must enforce.", "Customs recognizes that its ability to process the growing volume of imports while improving compliance with trade laws depends heavily on successfully modernizing its trade compliance process and its supporting automated systems. To speed the processing of imports and improve compliance with trade laws, the Congress enacted legislation that eliminated certain legislatively mandated paper requirements and required Customs to establish the National Customs Automation Program (NCAP).", "The legislation also specified certain functions that NCAP must provide, including giving members of the trade community the capability to electronically file import entries at remote locations and enabling Customs to electronically process \u201cdrawback\u201d claims.

OMB has also issued guidance on the development and implementation of agency information technology architectures.", "Treasury has also issued to its bureaus, including Customs, guidance on developing an information systems architecture. This guidance, known as Treasury Information Systems Architecture Framework (TISAF), is also included in OMB\u2019s guidance. According to Treasury, TISAF is intended to help reduce the cost, complexity, and risk associated with information technology development and operations.

In 1994, Customs began to develop ACE to replace its existing automated import system, the Automated Commercial System. ACE is intended to provide an integrated, automated information system for collecting, disseminating, and analyzing import-related data and ensuring the proper collection and allocation of revenues, totaling about $19 billion annually. According to Customs, ACE is planned to automate critical functions that the Congress specified when it established NCAP.", "Customs reported that it spent $47.8 million on ACE as of the end of fiscal year 1997. In November 1997, Customs estimated it would cost $1.05 billion to develop, operate, and maintain ACE over the 15 years from fiscal years 1994 through 2008. Customs plans to deploy ACE to all 342 ports that handle commercial cargo imports.", "Customs plans to develop and deploy ACE in multiple phases. According to Customs, the first phase, known as NCAP, is to be an ACE prototype. Customs currently plans to deploy NCAP in four releases. The first is scheduled to be deployed for field evaluation at three locations beginning in May 1998, and the fourth is scheduled for October 1999. Customs, however, has not adhered to previous NCAP deployment schedules.", "Specifically, implementation of the NCAP prototype slipped from January 1997 to August 1997 and then again to a series of four releases beginning in October 1997, with the fourth release starting in June 1998.", "Customs also has several other efforts underway to modify or enhance existing information systems that support its six business areas. For example, in fiscal year 1998, Customs plans to spend about $3.7 million to enhance its Automated Export System (AES), which supports the outbound business area and is designed to improve Customs\u2019 collection and reporting of export statistics and to enforce export regulations. In addition, Customs plans to spend another $4.6 million to modify its administrative systems supporting its finance and human resource business areas.

Further, while the architecture and related documentation describe business functions and users and locations for one business area (trade compliance), they do not identify the information needs and flows for all the functions. Nonetheless, Customs has defined many characteristics of its information systems\u2019 hardware, software, communications, data management, and security components. Because these characteristics are not based on a complete understanding of its enterprisewide functional and information needs, Customs does not have adequate assurance that its information systems will optimally support its ability to (1) fully collect and accurately account for billions of dollars in annual federal revenue and (2) allow for the expeditious movement of legal goods and passengers across our nation\u2019s borders while preventing and detecting the movement of illegal goods and passengers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Framework for Effectively Developing a Complete Systems Architecture", "paragraphs": ["Reflecting the general consensus in the industry that large, complex systems development and acquisition efforts should be guided by explicit architectures, we issued a report in 1992 defining a comprehensive framework for designing and developing systems architectures.

It provides a high-level description of the organization\u2019s mission and target concept of operations; the business functions being performed and the relationships among functions; the information needed to perform the functions; the users and locations of the functions and information; and the information systems needed to support the agency\u2019s business needs. An essential element of the logical architecture is the definition of the component interdependencies (e.g., information flows and interfaces).", "The technical component ensures that systems are interoperable, function together efficiently, and are cost-effective over their life cycles (including maintenance costs). The technical component details specific information technology and communications standards and approaches that will be used to build systems, including those that address critical hardware, software, communications, data management, security, and performance characteristics.", "TISAF, Treasury\u2019s departmentwide architecture framework, is generally consistent with our framework. According to TISAF, a complete architecture has the following four components, each representing a different perspective or view of the agency:", "Functional: A representation of what the organization does (i.e., its mission and business processes) and how the organization can use information systems to support its business operations.", "Work: A description of where and by whom information systems are to be used throughout the agency.", "Information: A description of what information is needed to support business operations.", "Infrastructure: A description of the hardware and \u201cservices\u201d (e.g., software and telecommunications) needed to implement information systems across the agency.", "TISAF\u2019s functional, work, and information components together form the logical view of the architecture, while its infrastructure represents the technical view of the architecture.", "To develop and evolve systems that effectively support business functions, a top-down process must be followed. The logical architecture (e.g., business functions and information flows) is defined first and then used to specify supporting systems (e.g., interfaces, standards, and protocols).", "Treasury endorses this top-down approach. Treasury officials responsible for developing and implementing TISAF stated that development of the architecture begins with defining and describing the agency\u2019s major business functions. Once this is accomplished, the agency can identify the relationships among the functions, the information needed to perform the functions, the users and locations of the functions, and the existing and needed applications and related information technology required to execute and support the business functions. According to Treasury guidance, the architecture\u2019s infrastructure component (i.e., its systems specifications and standards) should be derived from the other three components. In addition, the guidance states that each element of the architecture must be integrated and traceable, and the relationships between them must be explicit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete Enterprise Architecture Increases the Risk of Building Systems That Do Not Effectively Support Business Needs", "paragraphs": ["Customs does not have a complete systems architecture to effectively and efficiently guide and constrain the millions of dollars it invests each year in developing, acquiring, and maintaining the information systems that support its six business areas.

For the sixth business area (trade compliance), Customs has defined all the business functions and users and work locations and some, but not all, of the information and data needs and flows.", "With respect to the business functions, Customs\u2019 architecture provides descriptions of only 29 of 79 collective functions in its six business areas. The architecture does not describe the other 50 functions in sufficient detail to understand what they are, how they relate, who will perform them, where they will be performed, what information they will produce or consume, and how the information should be handled (i.e., captured, stored, processed, managed, distributed, and protected). Table 1 summarizes by business area the number of functions defined in the architecture.", "Examples of undefined functions in the outbound, passenger, investigations, and human resources business areas are as follows:", "Outbound: The architecture names \u201cexamine cargo\u201d and \u201cseize and process cargo\u201d as 2 of the 13 functions in this business area. However, the architecture does not describe how to examine cargo, what cargo to examine, when to examine cargo, what information/data is needed to examine cargo, how the results of the cargo examination are used and by whom, or how cargo examination data should be protected. Similarly, the architecture does not describe when cargo will be seized and by whom, what criteria are used to seize cargo, how cargo will be seized and accounted for, or what information is required to account for the seized cargo (e.g., date of seizure, company name, and commodity).", "Passenger: The architecture names \u201cidentify compliance target\u201d and \u201cprocess non-compliant passengers/conveyances\u201d as 2 of the 13 functions in this business area. However, the architecture does not describe how targets are identified, who identifies targets, how target information is disseminated, what information is collected to determine compliance, or how target information needs to be protected. Likewise, the architecture does not define compliant passenger/conveyance, how passengers are processed and by whom, or where passengers/conveyances are processed.", "Investigations: The architecture names \u201cperform interdiction\u201d as 1 of the 10 functions in this business area. However, the architecture does not describe how an interdiction is conducted, who conducts interdictions, what criteria are used to identify potential passengers or cargo to interdict, what happens to the seized persons or cargo, or how interdiction information needs to be protected.", "Human Resources: The architecture names \u201cmanage internal service programs\u201d as 1 of the 22 functions in this business area. However, the architecture does not describe what services are provided and by whom, who is eligible to receive the services, or where the potential recipients are located.", "Within the trade compliance business area, even though Customs\u2019 architecture does not define 10 of 15 trade compliance functions, Customs has described these 10 business functions, the relationships among them, and the work to be performed within each function (including who will perform the work and where it will be performed) in documents other than the architecture. Further, Customs has specified the data needed to support some, but not all, of the trade compliance functions. For example, Customs identified key information sources (such as cargo manifests and summary declarations) associated with NCAP, the ACE prototype that covers a subset of trade compliance activities, and specific data elements associated with each information source.", "Customs, however, has not defined the information/data needs, including security, and information/data flows among its six business areas. With respect to information security in particular, Customs\u2019 architecture does not (1) specify functional requirements for enterprisewide security, (2) include a security concept of operations that describes how Customs will operate (e.g., what controls will be used) to satisfy these requirements, or (3) include a security subarchitecture that specifies how these controls will be implemented, certified, and accredited and how the controls\u2019 operational effectiveness will be validated. Given that computer security continues to be a long-standing problem at Customs, this issue is particularly troubling. In our audits of Customs\u2019 fiscal year 1992 and 1993 principal financial statements, we stated that Customs\u2019 controls to prevent and detect unauthorized access and intentional or inadvertent unauthorized modifications to critical and sensitive data and computer programs were ineffective, thereby jeopardizing the security and reliability of the operations central to Customs\u2019 mission. While Customs has since taken meaningful steps toward correcting these access problems, they still remain. According to the Treasury Inspector General\u2019s report on Customs\u2019 fiscal years 1997 and 1996 financial statements, computer security weaknesses continue to exist that could allow for unauthorized modification and deletion of application and systems software and data in Customs\u2019 systems supporting the trade, financial management, and law enforcement activities.", "Until Customs addresses these weaknesses, it will not know the full extent of inter- and intra-business area functional and informational needs and dependencies and thus cannot develop, acquire, and maintain supporting information systems that optimally support the agency\u2019s operations and activities. Moreover, until these interdependencies among and within business areas have been fully analyzed and defined and an approach for securing the associated information has been established, the opportunities for incompatibilities and duplications among systems and the information they process and share increase, as do the opportunities for unauthorized access and modification of data. Such opportunities jeopardize, in turn, the completeness, consistency, and integrity of the data Customs uses and publishes. Given the importance of reliable data to Customs\u2019 (1) billion dollar revenue collection mission, (2) trade statistics used in developing trade policy and negotiating trade agreements, and (3) efforts to prevent and detect the illegal movement of goods and services across our nation\u2019s borders, such risks must be effectively addressed through an enterprise systems architecture.", "With respect to the infrastructure or technical component of Customs\u2019 architecture, Customs has specified much of the information that Treasury guidance states should be included in this component (e.g., standards for system and application software, communication interfaces, and hardware). However, as noted previously, this component is not based on a complete analysis of Customs\u2019 functional and information needs. For example, the architecture does not address information security requirements, yet its infrastructure specifies network encryption and remote access server products. Because it specified these products without knowing the business needs they support, Customs does not have adequate assurance that these products are needed or that they satisfy its true business needs, minimally or optimally. That is, the list of products cited may be either unnecessary or insufficient to support its real business needs.", "Experience has shown that attempting to define and build major systems without first completing a systems architecture unnecessarily increases the cost and complexity of these systems. For example, we reported that FAA\u2019s lack of a complete architecture resulted in incompatibilities among its air traffic control systems that (1) required higher- than-need-be system development, integration, and maintenance costs and (2) reduced overall system performance. Without having architecturally defined requirements and standards governing information and data structures and communications, FAA was forced to spend over $38 million to acquire a system dedicated to overcoming incompatibilities between systems. According to a Customs\u2019 contractor, Customs is also experiencing such inefficiencies and unnecessary costs because it lacks an architecture.

For example, after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) spent over $3 billion attempting to modernize its tax systems without a defined logical architecture, it could not demonstrate benefits commensurate with costs and was forced to significantly restructure the effort. Unless it completes its architecture before attempting to develop operational systems like ACE, Customs runs the risk of repeating failures like those that IRS experienced.", "Customs\u2019 CIO officials have since acknowledged the need for a complete systems architecture and its value in information technology investment management. Accordingly, Customs is developing a statement of work for a TISAF-compliant architecture. With the help of a contractor, Customs plans to use whatever data each business area may have already developed relative to functional, work, and information needs as a starting point in completing an enterprise architecture.

Under this process, Customs\u2019 investment review board (IRB) uses four criteria in scoring competing investment options and allocating funding among them. The four criteria are risk (e.g., technical, schedule, and cost); strategic alignment (e.g., cross-functional benefits, linkage to Customs\u2019 business plan, and compliance with legislative mandates); mission effectiveness (e.g., contributions to service delivery); and cost/benefit ratio (e.g., tangible and intangible benefits, and costs).", "Customs is in the process of implementing its investment management process for the fiscal year 1999 budget cycle.", "According to Customs\u2019 investment management process, investment compliance with the architecture is considered, but not required, under the technical risk criterion.

According to Customs officials, while architectural compliance is not an explicit criterion in the process, it will be considered and documented as part of the IRB funding decisions.", "Without an effective, well-defined process for enforcing the architecture, Customs runs the risk that unjustified deviations from the architecture will occur, resulting in systems that do not meet business needs, are incompatible, perform poorly, and cost more to develop, integrate, and maintain than they should. For example, we reported that FAA\u2019s lack of an enforced systems architecture for its air traffic control operations resulted in the use of expensive interfaces to translate different data communication protocols, thus complicating and slowing communications, and the proliferation of multiple application programming languages, which increased software maintenance costs and precluded sharing software components among systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Customs\u2019 incomplete enterprise information systems architecture and limitations in its plans for enforcing compliance with an architecture once one is completed impair the agency\u2019s ability to effectively and efficiently develop or acquire operational systems, such as ACE, and to maintain existing systems.

Additionally, Customs committed to not making major system investments prior to developing a TISAF-compliant architecture.", "Customs raised several additional matters related to systems architecture, none of which affect our conclusions and recommendations and thus are not discussed here.

We also interviewed officials from Treasury\u2019s Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Systems and Chief Information Officer (the organization responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining TISAF) to seek clarification and explanation of TISAF requirements. Further, we asked Customs to give us its enterprise information systems architecture and a mapping of all architectural documents to TISAF\u2019s four architectural components\u2014functional, work, information, and infrastructure. In response, Customs provided the documents listed in table I.1.", "Customs subsequently provided two additional architecture documents that it did not map to any TISAF component. The two additional documents were the ACE Technical Architecture and the Enterprise IT Architecture Strategy-Executive Overview.", "We then analyzed the architecture documents Customs provided to identify any variances with the TISAF requirements for each architectural component. We also interviewed Customs and supporting contractor officials to (1) seek clarification and explanation of the content of the architecture documents, (2) identify instances where the architectural documents did not satisfy TISAF requirements, and (3) solicit from Customs any additional evidence related to meeting TISAF requirements.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed Customs\u2019 policies and procedures governing information technology investment management to determine architecture enforcement processes and interviewed Customs officials to determine organizational roles and responsibilities related to architecture development and enforcement. We also discussed with Customs officials any plans for changing the agency\u2019s processes and organizational responsibilities for developing and enforcing the architecture."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.S. Customs Service", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s letter dated March 31, 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. Our report neither states nor implies that Customs is unable to ensure the proper collection and allocation of revenues totaling about $19 billion annually. Rather, the report states that one of ACE\u2019s key functions is to ensure the proper collection and allocation of revenues totaling about $19 billion annually. 2. Customs states that it began developing its enterprise systems architecture prior to Treasury\u2019s publication of TISAF and is working with Treasury to develop a TISAF-compliant architecture. While these statements are true, they do not address our point that Customs\u2019 architecture is insufficiently complete to be useful in guiding and constraining major systems investments. In order to optimize systems investments, the architecture must specify the six elements cited in our report. Furthermore, each element of the architecture must be built upon the preceding ones. Customs\u2019 architecture does not include these elements for all business areas and, as we point out in our report, the systems and standards selected were not based on a complete analysis of Customs\u2019 functional and information needs.", "We do not agree with Customs\u2019 statement that an architecture is never completed. An architecture must be complete (i.e., include the six elements described in our report) to be useful in building or buying systems. This does not mean that a completed architecture cannot be modified to reflect changes in organizational missions and business functions or advancements in information technology products. This process of thoughtful and disciplined change\u2014maintenance\u2014is performed routinely on all information system components (e.g., architectures, documentation, software, and hardware). 3. While we agree that architectural models used in industry and government vary, all models consistently require the top-down, structured approach described in our report. Customs has not followed this approach and, therefore, does not have adequate assurance that its infrastructure (i.e., technical architecture) will meet its business requirements.", "Customs states that it has been cautioned against defining an architecture in too much detail lest the business process changes before system development can proceed, but it does not clearly define what it means by too much detail. Customs\u2019 architecture neither defines all critical business functions nor identifies all information needs and flows within and among the business areas for five of its six business areas. As a result, rather than being overly detailed, it lacks the basic, required elements. 4. While the Treasury Inspector General (IG) has given Customs an unqualified opinion in fiscal year 1997, the IG also reported that Customs lacks adequate assurance that all revenue due is collected and compliance with other trade laws is achieved. Despite the progress that has been made, this lack of assurance has been a persistent issue since we reported on our audit on Customs\u2019 financial statements for fiscal year 1992.5. Customs states that we have inaccurately characterized the completeness of its architecture for the finance business area because certain finance business functions have been defined in various other analyses, reports, and strategies. This assertion reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose and value of a systems architecture. Our report concludes that Customs\u2019 architecture for its finance business area (as well as all but one other business area) is substantially incomplete because it does not (1) describe all the agency\u2019s business functions, (2) outline the information needed to perform the functions, or (3) completely identify the users and locations of the functions. Even if other documents contain fragments of the missing information for one business area, which we did not attempt to verify, this does not mitigate the need for a single, comprehensive, maintainable, and enforceable statement of architectural requirements and standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accounting and Information Management Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Rona Stillman, Chief Scientist for Computers and Telecommunications Linda Koontz, Associate Director Randolph Hite, Senior Assistant Director Deborah A.
