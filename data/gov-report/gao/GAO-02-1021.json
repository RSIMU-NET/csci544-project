These efforts have also become important in the United States' relations with other countries and with international organizations, such as the United Nations (U.N.). The Department of State is charged with coordinating these international efforts and protecting Americans abroad. State has helped direct the U.S. efforts to combat terrorism abroad by building the global coalition against terrorism, including providing diplomatic support for military operations in Afghanistan and other countries. State has also supported international law enforcement efforts to identify, arrest, and bring terrorists to justice, as well as performing other activities intended to reduce the number of terrorist attacks. The State Department conducts multifaceted activities in its effort to prevent terrorist attacks on Americans abroad. For Americans traveling and living abroad, State issues public travel warnings and operates warning systems to convey terrorism-related information. For American businesses and universities operating overseas, State uses the Overseas Security Advisory Councils--voluntary partnerships between the State Department and the private sector--to exchange threat information. To disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations abroad, State has numerous programs and activities that rely on military, multilateral, economic, law enforcement, intelligence, and other capabilities. State uses extradition treaties to bring terrorists to trial in the United States and cooperates with foreign intelligence, security, and law enforcement entities to track and capture terrorists in foreign countries. If the United States has no extradition agreements with a country, then State, with the Department of Justice, can work to obtain the arrest of suspected terrorist overseas through renditions. The State Department leads the U.S. response to terrorist incidents abroad. This includes diplomatic measures to protect Americans, minimize damage, terminate terrorist attacks, and bring terrorists to justice. To coordinate the U.S. effort to combat terrorism internationally, State uses a variety of mechanisms to work with the Departments of Defense, Justice, and the Treasury; the intelligence agencies; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and others. These mechanisms include interagency working groups at the headquarters level in Washington, D.C., emergency action committees at U.S. missions overseas, and liaison exchanges with other government agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, efforts to combat  terrorism have become an increasingly important part of U.S. government  activities.

The U.S. Department of State is charged with  coordinating these international efforts and protecting Americans abroad;  its objective is to reduce the number of terrorist attacks, especially those  on U.S. citizens and interests. While countering terrorism has always been  a part of State\u2019s role, it took on heightened significance in the aftermath of  the 1998 al Qaeda terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and  Kenya (see fig. 1). Since the September 11 attacks on the World Trade  Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., State has  helped direct the U.S. efforts to combat terrorism abroad by building the  global coalition against terrorism, including providing diplomatic support  for military operations in Afghanistan and other countries.

Footnotes to this report identify  programs and activities managed by the U.S. Agency for International  Development that complement the State Department\u2019s efforts to combat  terrorism abroad. This report is part of a larger effort that you jointly  requested to review governmentwide programs to combat terrorism  overseas. Regarding some of these programs, it is important to recognize  that the State Department works in conjunction with a number of other  federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Justice, and the  Treasury, as well as the Central Intelligence Agency. As agreed with your  staff, we plan to report later this year on governmentwide efforts to combat  terrorism overseas.", "State\u2019s organizational chart appears in appendix I to this report.

To identify programs and  activities provided by other departments and coordinated through State,  we reviewed documents and interviewed officials from the Departments of  Defense, Justice, and the Treasury; the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies; and the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID). In addition, we conducted fieldwork  at the U.S. Embassy in Athens, Greece, to observe programs and activities  to combat terrorism overseas. At selected regional and functional military  commands, we met with State Department Political Advisors at the U.S.  Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida; the U.S. Southern  Command in Miami, Florida; and the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart-  Vaihingen, Germany. In addition, we conducted fieldwork at the  International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest, Hungary, to review  programs to combat terrorism that the State Department manages or funds  or both.

State received an  additional $203 million through the Emergency Response Fund as part of  the $40 billion appropriated by the Congress in response to the September  11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States.", "The Office of Management and Budget reported that determining precise  funding levels associated with activities to combat terrorism is difficult  because departments may not isolate those activities from other program  activities.

For example, to protect  U.S. officials, property, and information abroad, the Bureau of Diplomatic  Security provides local guards for embassies and armored vehicles for  embassy personnel (see fig. 2). In addition, it provides undercover teams to  detect terrorist surveillance activities. Following the 1998 embassy  bombings in Africa, State upgraded security for all missions, which  included strengthening building exteriors, lobby entrances, and the walls  and fences at embassy perimeters (see fig. 3). The upgrades also included  closed-circuit television monitors, explosive detection devices, walk- through metal detectors, and reinforced walls and security doors to  provide protection inside the embassy. In addition, State plans to replace  some existing embassies with buildings that meet current security  standards, such as having a 100-foot setback from streets surrounding  embassies. State also has programs to protect national security information  discussed at meetings or stored on computers. These programs include  U.S. Marine security guards controlling access to embassies, efforts to  prevent foreign intelligence agencies from detecting emanations from  computer equipment, and computer security programs.", "State has several programs to help warn Americans living and traveling  abroad against potential threats, including those posed by terrorists. For  example, to warn Americans about travel-related dangers, in fiscal year  2001 the Bureau of Consular Affairs issued 64 travel warnings, 134 public  announcements, and 189 consular information sheets. In addition, missions  employ a \u201cwarden system\u201d to warn Americans registered with an embassy  of threats against their security. The system varies by mission but uses  telephone, E-mail, fax, and other technologies as appropriate. Finally, the  Bureau of Diplomatic Security manages the Overseas Security Advisory  Councils program. The councils are a voluntary, joint effort between State  and the private sector to exchange threat- and security-related information.  Councils currently operate in 47 countries.", "In addition, State manages and funds programs to train foreign government  and law enforcement officials to combat terrorism abroad. These programs  include the following:  the Antiterrorism Assistance Program, implemented by the Bureau of  Diplomatic Security, to enhance the antiterrorism skills of law  enforcement and security personnel in foreign countries;  the International Law Enforcement Academies, managed by the Bureau  for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, to provide law  enforcement training in four locations around the world. The  Departments of State, the Treasury, and Justice\u2014including the Bureau  of Diplomatic Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other U.S.  law enforcement agencies\u2014provide the on-site training;  the Department of Justice's Overseas Prosecutorial Development and  Assistance Training and the International Criminal Investigation  Training Assistance Program.
