VA physicians wrote over 34 million prescriptions for veterans for pharmaceuticals, including OTC products, to be used on an outpatient basis and usually provided at low or no cost to the veterans.

Copayments collected covered a relatively small portion of these costs for several reasons. First, the $2 copayment collected for a 30-day supply represented only a portion of the ingredient, dispensing, and collection costs of most OTC medications and dietary supplements. Second, copayments were not required for medical supplies.

This action, which is currently in progress, has not yet achieved an adequate level of consistency or cost-containment systemwide because the networks\u2019 current formularies approximate the more generous coverage of OTC products at some VA facilities. Moreover, some networks are permitting facilities to provide less generous coverage of OTC products than these networks\u2019 formularies allow. This is likely to perpetuate the uneven availability of OTC products.", "Given the disagreement among networks and facilities over the provision of OTC products, additional guidance may be needed to ensure that veterans have a consistent level of access to OTC products systemwide. In light of concerns about potential resource shortages at some facilities, tailoring the availability of OTC products for nonservice-connected conditions to be more in line with that at less generous facilities would seem desirable. This would essentially limit OTC products to those most directly related to VA hospitalizations.", "VA facilities could also reduce their costs if they restructured OTC product dispensing and copayment collection processes.

This could be achieved by expanding copayment requirements to include medical supplies, reducing the income threshold for veterans with nonservice-connected conditions, or increasing the amount of copayment required.

Our recommendations, for the most part, were based on actions certain VA pharmacies have already taken."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limiting OTC Products", "paragraphs": ["VA did not concur with our recommendation to limit OTC products for nonservice-connected conditions to those most directly related to VA hospitalizations or those considered most essential to prevent hospitalization. VA stated that its policy to provide patients with medications, medical supplies, and dietary supplements is based on the clinical determination that these items are medically necessary. VA pointed out that continuity of care is a cornerstone of primary care practice with emphasis on preventive care and asserted that implementation of this recommendation would probably lead to fragmented care. VA stated that fragmentation of care can lead to an overall increase in health care costs. Restriction of OTC products could also lead to a shift in prescribing patterns. To ensure that the patient will actually get the needed medication, physicians may order more expensive prescription items if OTC versions are not provided by VA pharmacies, a practice that would lead to increased overall expenditures.", "Our recommendation was designed to bring VA\u2019s provision of OTC products into closer alignment with the practices of the vast majority of health care plans in this country. Generally, private health care plans provide primary care but exclude OTC products as a benefit for their participants\u2014that is, they expect enrollees to obtain OTC products from other sources at their own expense. Furthermore, what we are recommending is that VA do on a systemwide basis what several of its own facilities have done. VA\u2019s local facilities generally factor in drug substitution and potential health effects when making their decisions about which drugs to provide. Some of them have already made the tough choices about which OTC drugs were essential to provide, and they did not report encountering, to any great extent, the types of potential problems that VA expressed concern about in its comments. Limiting VA pharmacies\u2019 provision of certain OTC items presumes that veterans will obtain the items from other local outlets if they share their physicians\u2019 assessment of the products\u2019 medical necessity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dispensing More Economical Quantities", "paragraphs": ["VA agreed that OTC products should be provided in more economical quantities to reduce VA\u2019s dispensing costs but only in those instances deemed clinically appropriate. VA stated that the current medication renewal process often serves as a good opportunity for the patient to have personal contact with the health care provider and to be reevaluated for medication compliance. VA also stated that quantity limitation must be based on quality of care considerations and the individual veteran\u2019s ability to comply with his or her medication regimen. Also, consideration must be given to the stability of the drug in question.", "Our recommendation was intended to reduce the dispensing costs associated with OTC products and touches on prescription refills rather than prescription renewals. For chronic conditions, VA prescriptions are usually written for 6- or 12-month periods with refills. Renewing the prescriptions once or twice a year does provide opportunities for veterans to see VA health care practitioners, but refilling those prescriptions every 90 days in the interim does not. VA pharmacy officials told us that routine refills are generally handled by mail with no interaction between physicians and veterans.", "Analgesics, such as aspirin and acetaminophen, which VA dispensed almost 3 million times in fiscal year 1995, provide an example of how refill quantities influence costs. VA could save about $3 in dispensing costs each time it provided one 180-day supply instead of two 90-day supplies. When sold in local outlets, aspirin is commonly packaged in quantities of 100 to 500 tablets, making it possible for veterans and others to readily buy more than 180-day supplies without raising concerns about medical safety or product stability. OTC products are safe when the manufacturers\u2019 labeling directions are followed and, as in the case of aspirin, are stable enough to be stored in users\u2019 homes for 6 months or longer without adverse consequences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limiting Mail Service", "paragraphs": ["VA did not concur with our recommendation to reduce VA\u2019s dispensing costs for OTC products by limiting mail service to certain situations. VA stated that implementing this recommendation would undermine the important health care goals of patient satisfaction and customer service. Also, VA stated that mail service helps to reduce daily crowding and congestion in ambulatory care and parking areas of VA treatment facilities.", "When resources are limited, choices about whether to fund certain OTC products have to be made by local VA pharmacies. Some VA pharmacies reported to us that they continued to provide certain OTC products, such as cases of liquid dietary supplements or diapers, but did not mail them. Veterans needing such OTC products have to pick them up at the pharmacy (exceptions are made when warranted). Again, we are only recommending that VA do, on a systemwide basis, what several of its facilities have done independently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collecting Copayments When Products Are Dispensed", "paragraphs": ["VA did not concur with our recommendation to require veterans to make copayments at the time OTC products are dispensed. VA stated that to the fullest extent possible, veterans are encouraged to make copayments at the time OTC products are dispensed. An estimated 35 percent of prescription copayments are collected at the time of dispensing. Because approximately 50 percent of all outpatient prescriptions are mailed, VA stated, it is obvious that copayment collection rates at the time of dispensing are already high. Collection decisions must be made on an individual basis, according to VA, which stated that a veteran will not be denied a medically necessary product if for some reason copayment cannot be made at the time the product is dispensed.", "During our examination of the copayment process at the VA facility we visited, however, we found that veterans were not presented a copayment bill or required to make payments at the time OTC products were dispensed at the pharmacy. Instead, the facility primarily mailed copayment bills to veterans, incurring additional administrative costs. Because VA\u2019s records showed only total copayment collections, copayments received by mail or collected by the cashier could not be differentiated.", "Our work showed that about 25 percent of OTC copayments billed were uncollected. VA incurs additional administrative costs to pursue these uncollected copayments. Collecting the copayments for OTC products at the time of dispensing would eliminate the administrative costs to bill and rebill delinquent payers. Veterans could help conserve VA\u2019s limited resources by making copayments when they pick up the OTC products at the pharmacy or by including their copayments when ordering refills by mail. Given current copayment rates of $2 for a 30-day quantity, our recommendation would not seem to be overly burdensome on veterans.
