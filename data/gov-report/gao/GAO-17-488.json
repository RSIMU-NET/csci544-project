To do so, GAO analyzed FMCSA's strategic plan and modernization plans; compared governance documentation to best practices; selected four investments based on operations and maintenance spending for fiscal year 2016, among other factors, and compared assessments for the investments against OMB criteria; and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) initiated a modernization effort in 2011 and developed an information technology (IT) strategic plan that describes the technical strategy, vision, mission, direction, and goals and objectives to support the agency's mission; however, the plan lacks timelines to guide FMCSA's goals and strategies. In addition, the agency has not completed a modernization plan for its existing IT systems that includes scope, an implementation strategy, schedule, results-oriented goals, and measures, although it has recently awarded a contract to develop such a plan. The Acting Chief Information Officer (CIO) said that updating FMCSA's IT strategic plan had not been a priority for the agency. However, without a complete IT strategic plan, FMCSA will be less likely to move toward its ultimate goal of modernizing its aging legacy systems.", "FMCSA has begun to address leading practices of IT governance, but its investment governance framework does not adequately establish an investment board, select and reselect investments, and provide investment oversight. Specifically, regarding the practice of establishing an IT investment review board, FMCSA has not yet clearly defined roles and responsibilities for key working groups and individuals, including the Office of the CIO. Regarding selecting and reselecting IT investments, FMCSA requires participation and collaboration during the select phases for all IT investments; however, it lacks procedures for selecting new investments and reselecting investments that are already operational for continued funding. According to the Acting CIO, the agency is currently drafting these procedures and intends to finalize them by the end of May 2017. Regarding the practice of IT investment oversight, the agency has policies and procedures to ensure that corrective actions and related efforts are executed and tracked, but they have not yet been fully implemented by the three boards. These weaknesses are due to the agency not adhering to its IT orders that establish its governance structure. As a result, FMCSA lacks adequate visibility into and oversight of IT investment decisions and activities, which could ultimately hinder its modernization efforts.", "FMCSA had not fully ensured that the four systems GAO selected to review are effectively meeting the needs of the agency because none of the program offices completed operational analyses as required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). However, as part of its capital planning and investment control process, FMCSA assessed the four key factors of an operational analysis\u2014costs, schedules, investment performance, and customer and business needs. One of the selected programs had partially implemented all four of these factors; two programs had partially implemented one factor, and one program had not addressed any of these factors. This was due to FMCSA not having guidance for conducting operational analyses for investments in operations and maintenance. Until FMCSA fully reviews its operational investments, the agency will lack assurance that these systems meet mission needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations to FMCSA to improve its IT strategic planning, oversight, and operational analyses.

The domestic commercial motor carrier industry covers a range  of businesses, including private and for-hire freight transportation,  passenger carriers, and specialized transporters of hazardous  materials. These carriers also range from small carriers with only one  vehicle that is owned and operated by a single individual, to large  corporations that own thousands of vehicles.", "In carrying out its mission, FMCSA is responsible for four key safety  service areas.", "Registration Services: Motor carriers are required to register with  FMCSA; have insurance; and attest that they are fit, willing, and  able to follow safety standards. Vehicles must be properly registered  and insured with the state of domicile and are subject to random and  scheduled inspections by both state and FMCSA agents. Drivers must  have a valid commercial driver\u2019s license issued by their state of  residence and pass a physical examination as evidenced by a current  valid medical card every 2 years. In calendar year 2015, there were  57,358 active interstate new entrant carriers that registered with  FMCSA.", "Inspection Services: Conducting roadside inspections is central to  FMCSA\u2019s mission. States and, to a lesser extent, FMCSA staff,  perform roadside inspections of vehicles to check for driver and  maintenance violations and then provide the data from those  inspections to the agency for analysis and determinations about a  carrier\u2019s safety performance. FMCSA also obtains data from the  reports filed by state and local law enforcement officers when  investigating commercial motor vehicle accidents or regulatory  violations. The agency provides grants to states that may be used to  offset the costs of conducting roadside inspections and improve the  quality of the crash data the states report to it. In addition, the field  offices in each state, known as divisions, have investigators who  conduct compliance reviews of carriers identified by state inspection  and other data as unsafe or at risk of being unsafe. FMCSA and its  state partners conduct about 3.4 million inspections a year.", "Compliance Services: FMCSA monitors and ensures compliance  with regulations governing both safety and commerce. The  compliance review process is performed by safety auditors and  investigators who collect safety compliance data by visiting a motor  carrier\u2019s location to review safety and personnel records. In the  instances of new carriers entering the commercial market, FMCSA  audits these carriers within 12 months of service. In 2015, FMCSA  conducted 14,656 investigations and 30,000 new entrant safety  audits, and sent about 21,000 warning letters. FMCSA uses data  collected from motor carriers, federal and state agencies, and other  sources to monitor motor carrier compliance with the Federal Motor  Carrier Safety Regulations and Hazardous Materials Regulations.  These data are also used to evaluate the safety performance of motor  carriers, drivers, and vehicle fleets. The agency uses the data to  characterize and evaluate the safety experience of motor carrier  operations to help federal safety investigators focus their enforcement  resources by identifying the highest-risk carriers, drivers, and  vehicles.", "Enforcement Services: FMCSA is responsible for bringing legal  action against companies that are not in compliance with motor carrier  safety policies.

In addition,  the program office did not assess current costs against life-cycle  costs, perform a structured schedule assessment, or compare current  performance against cost baseline and estimates developed when the  investment was being planned.", "MCMIS: The MCMIS program office had not implemented any of the  required operational analysis factors. Specifically, program officials  did not assess current costs against life-cycle costs, perform  structured assessments of schedule and performance goals, or  identify whether the investment supports business and customer  needs and is delivering the services it was designed to, including  identifying whether the system overlaps with other systems. This is  particularly concerning given that all seven users we interviewed  stated that the system does not interact well with other systems and  users have to access other systems to gather information that they  cannot obtain in MCMIS.", "Sentri 2.0: Sentri\u2019s program office partially implemented one of the  required operational analysis factors and did not implement the three  other factors for the component that has been operational since May  2010, also known as Sentri 2.0. Specifically, the program had partially  implemented assessments of customer and business needs by  reviewing Sentri 2.0 user needs as it develops the business and user  requirements for development of Sentri 2.1. However, while all five  users we interviewed stated that their feedback regarding Sentri was  provided to FMCSA, they were not sure whether the feedback was  being implemented. Moreover, the program office had not identified  whether the investment supports customer processes, as designed,  and is delivering the goods and services it was intended to deliver. In  addition, the program did not assess current costs against life-cycle  costs or perform structured schedule and performance goal  assessments.", "URS: The URS program office partially implemented four of the  required operational analysis factors for functionality of the system  that was delivered in December 2015. Specifically, the program office  developed a business case that outlines costs, schedules, investment  performance goals, and customer and business needs. Additionally,  the program office communicated with stakeholders through  meetings, conferences, webinars, and call centers. For example, it  has hosted over 30 webinars to better understand how the system is  working for the users. Nevertheless, the program office had not yet  conducted an analysis to assess current costs against life-cycle costs,  performed a structured assessment of the schedule or performance  goals, or ensured the functionality delivered is operating as intended  and is meeting user needs. The need for conducting an analysis is  particularly pressing for this program since all four system users we  interviewed stated that URS is difficult to use and does not work as  intended: they stated that they are unable to complete filings, carrier  registration, and request changes to DOT numbers.", "With regard to the deficiencies we identified, the Acting CIO stated that  the agency does not yet have FMCSA-specific guidance to assist  programs to conduct operational analyses on an annual basis. The Acting  CIO stated that FMCSA has drafted guidance, including templates, to  assist programs in conducting these analyses and officials in the Office of  Information Technology stated that the agency planned to have the  guidance finalized by end of June 2017. While finalizing this guidance is a  positive step to assist programs in conducting operational analyses,  FMCSA does not adequately ensure its systems are effective at meeting  user needs. Until FMCSA fully reviews its O&M investments as part of its  annual operational analyses, the agency will lack assurance that these  systems meet mission needs, and the associated spending could be  wasteful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While FMCSA has recognized the need to develop an effective  modernization plan and has awarded a contract to do so, it has not  completed an IT strategic plan needed for modernizing its existing legacy  systems.

Further, FMCSA does not  have the processes in place for ensuring that systems currently in use are  meeting agency needs or for overseeing its IT portfolio. The four systems  we reviewed did not have completed operational analyses that show if a  system is, among other things, effective at meeting users\u2019 needs.

Our objectives were to  (1) assess the extent to which the agency has plans to modernize its  existing systems, (2) assess the extent to which FMCSA has  implemented an IT governance structure, and (3) determine the extent to  which FMCSA has ensured selected IT systems are effective.", "To address the first objective, we obtained and evaluated FMCSA IT  systems modernization documentation that discuss future changes to  ensure user needs are met, including its IT strategic plan for fiscal years  2014 to 2016 and systems modernization plans. We analyzed whether  these plans complied with best practices that we have previously  identified. These practices call for developing a strategic plan that  includes defining the agency\u2019s vision and providing a road map to help  align information resources with business strategies and investment  decisions. We also interviewed agency officials including those from the  Office of Information Technology; Enforcement and Compliance,  Information Security, and Privacy divisions to discuss the agency\u2019s plans  to modernize existing systems, including any actions the agency is taking  to identify redundancies among the systems and explore the feasibility of  consolidating data collection and processing systems.", "To corroborate this information, we reviewed the FMCSA\u2019s budgetary  data (i.e., its fiscal year 2016 IT portfolio summary) submitted to the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that identifies all of the  agency\u2019s IT investments to identify whether it included any potentially  redundant systems. Specifically, we reviewed the name and narrative  description of each investment\u2019s purpose to identify any similarities  among related investments and discussed any potential redundancies  with the Acting Chief Information Officer (CIO).", "For the second objective, we compared agency documentation, including  executive board meeting minutes and briefings from fiscal years 2015 and  2016, FMCSA IT governance orders, and charters, against critical  processes associated with Stage 2 of GAO\u2019s IT investment management  framework. In particular, Stage 2 of the framework includes the following  key processes for effective governance:  instituting the investment board;  selecting and reselecting investments that meet business needs; and providing investment oversight.", "We also interviewed agency officials to better understand FMCSA\u2019s  governance structure, which included identifying whether the agency is  taking appropriate steps with respect to IT governance.", "To address the third objective, we selected four existing IT systems to  review. In selecting these investments, we analyzed FMCSA\u2019s fiscal year  2016 IT portfolio summary submitted to OMB which included the agency\u2019s  existing IT, data collection, processing systems, data correction  procedures, and data management systems and programs. To assess  the reliability of the OMB budget data, we reviewed related  documentation, such as OMB guidance on budget preparation and capital  planning. In addition, we corroborated with FMCSA that the data was  accurate and reflected the data it had reported to OMB. We determined  that the budget data was reliable for our purposes of selecting these  systems. Specifically, we used the following criteria to select four systems  to review:", "At least one investment must have been identified as a major IT  investment, as defined by OMB. FMCSA had only identified one  major IT investment in fiscal year 2016.", "The remaining non-major systems must have had planned operations  and maintenance (O&M) spending in fiscal year 2017.", "The system is mission critical.", "The program must not have been included in a recent GAO or  inspector general review that examined the program\u2019s effectiveness.", "Using the above criteria, we selected the following four systems:  1.  Aspen: A non-major desktop application that collects commercial  driver/vehicle inspection details, performs some immediate data  analysis, creates and prints a vehicle inspection report, and transfers  inspection data into the FMCSA information systems.  2.  Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS): A non- major information system that captures FMCSA inspection, crash,  compliance review, safety audit, and registration data. It is FMCSA\u2019s  authoritative source for the safety performance records for all  commercial motor carriers and hazardous materials shippers.  3.  Safety Enforcement Tracking and Investigation System (Sentri): A  non-major application used to facilitate safety audits and interventions  by FMCSA and state users. It is intended to combine roadside  inspection, investigative, and enforcement functions into a single  interface.  4.  Unified Registration System (URS): A major system that is intended to  replace the existing registration systems with a single comprehensive,  online system and provide FMCSA-regulated entities a more efficient  means of submission and management of data pertaining to  registration applications.", "We then assessed the agency\u2019s efforts to determine the effectiveness of  these systems in meeting the needs of the agency by reviewing  documentation from the four selected systems and compared it to key  factors identified in OMB\u2019s guidance on conducting annual operational  analysis, which are a key method for examining the performance of  investments with O&M funding. More specifically, we assessed whether  FMCSA had conducted an operational analysis on each of the systems.  For those systems that did not have an analysis performed, we reviewed FMCSA\u2019s IT documentation on the performance of these systems (i.e.,  business cases and performance management reviews) to determine  whether key factors of an operational analysis were conducted. For  example, we assessed whether the agency assessed cost, schedule, and  investment performance, including its interaction with other systems; and  customer and business needs, including adaptability of the system in  order to make necessary future changes to ensure user needs are met  and areas for innovation in the areas of customer satisfaction.", "We also conducted interviews with 22 selected system users to obtain  insight into whether the identified systems are meeting their needs and  any challenges users face in using these systems, including whether the  systems are adaptable to future needs and methods to improve user  interface. We selected these users based on recommendations from  FMCSA program officials and industry stakeholder representatives.  Based on these recommendations, we then selected users based on the  type of users, including FMCSA users, state agencies, law enforcement  officials, and private sector individuals involved in the motor carrier  industry. While these user interviews are illustrative, they cannot be used  to make generalizable statements about users\u2019 experience as a whole.", "Based on our work to determine selected programs\u2019 effectiveness, we  made recommendations regarding deficiencies identified in the report. We  did not make recommendations regarding methods to improve user  interfaces since two of the selected systems (Aspen and MCMIS) are  planned to be modernized and the remaining two systems (Sentri and  URS) have components still under development, as discussed in our  report.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2016 to July 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
