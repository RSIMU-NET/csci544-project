This report examines the extent to which: (1) FEMA's National Preparedness System and associated preparedness grants have assisted jurisdictions in preparing for disasters; (2) FEMA has strengthened the National Preparedness System and what steps remain; and (3) FEMA is using after-action reports to identify lessons learned and strengthen future preparedness. GAO evaluated agency guidance, analyzed 2013 to 2017 capability data\u2014the most current available; conducted site visits to five states; and interviewed FEMA, state, and local emergency management officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) National Preparedness System and associated grants have helped build some emergency management capabilities, but gaps remain. Capabilities fall in five mission areas: (1) prevention\u2014preventing imminent acts of terrorism, (2) protection\u2014protecting citizens and assets, (3) mitigation\u2014mitigating the loss of life and property, (4) response\u2014responding quickly to save lives, and (5) recovery\u2014timely restoration of infrastructure and housing, among other things. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, jurisdictions directed almost 90 percent of FEMA preparedness grants ($7.3 of $8.3 billion) to capabilities in the crosscutting (i.e., benefit all five mission areas), response, and prevention areas (figure below). Jurisdictions reported a higher level of preparedness in these areas compared to capabilities in the other mission areas\u2014recovery, mitigation, and protection. Jurisdictions have consistently rated select capabilities in these three mission areas\u2014such as disaster housing and cybersecurity\u2014in the lowest category since 2013. FEMA does not limit jurisdictions' use of preparedness grants for select capabilities, but it has encouraged jurisdictions to address the known gaps.", "FEMA is taking steps to strengthen the national preparedness system, but has yet to determine what steps are needed to address the nation's capability gaps across all levels of government. Specifically, FEMA is implementing a new methodology to collect more quantitative data on capabilities at the state, territory, and local levels\u2014as GAO recommended in 2011\u2014and also plans to begin assessing the federal government's capabilities. Including the federal government in such an assessment would enable FEMA and jurisdictions to assess national preparedness capabilities collectively. While these are positive steps that could meet the intent of the 2011 recommendation, FEMA has yet to determine what steps are needed to address the capability gaps once they are identified, including jurisdictions' capability gaps that have been known since 2012. By determining these steps and informing key stakeholders, such as Congress, about what resources will be needed across all levels of government, FEMA will be better positioned to address the nation's capability gaps.", "FEMA after-action reports have identified areas for improvement and lessons learned following disasters, but has completed after-action reviews for only 29 percent of disasters from 2017 through 2019. FEMA lacks a formal mechanism to track corrective actions and does not have guidance on sharing after-action reports with key external stakeholders, as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations that FEMA (1) determine what steps are needed to address emergency management capability gaps, and communicate it to key stakeholders (2) prioritize completion of after-action reviews, 3) track corrective actions, and (4) develop guidance on sharing findings externally.

According to the Federal  Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) 2017 Hurricane Season  After-Action Report, the 2017 hurricanes collectively affected 47 million  people, and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria all rank among the top  five costliest hurricanes ever recorded. The 2018 hurricane season  followed with Hurricanes Florence and Michael causing nearly $50 billon  of damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration. In addition, in 2018, the Camp Fire in northern California  destroyed more than 18,500 buildings and was the costliest and deadliest  wildfire in California\u2019s history.", "The rising number of natural disasters and increasing state, local, and  tribal reliance on federal disaster assistance is a key source of federal  fiscal exposure. Since 2005, federal funding for disaster assistance has  totaled at least $460 billion, which consists of obligations for disaster  assistance from 2005 through 2014 totaling at least $278 billion and  select appropriations for disaster assistance from 2015 through 2019  totaling $183 billion. Most of this funding was appropriated for  catastrophic hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and other losses in 2017 and  2018. Disaster costs are projected to increase as extreme weather  events become more frequent and intense due to climate change\u2014as  observed and projected by the U.S. Global Change Research Program  and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.", "FEMA\u2014a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014is  the lead federal agency responsible for disaster preparedness, response,  and recovery. We previously reported that FEMA faced challenges in  preparing for, responding to, and recovering from Hurricane Maria, which  largely affected Puerto Rico in 2017. After major disasters, FEMA\u2019s  standard practice is to prepare an after-action report that identifies  strengths, areas for improvement, and potential best practices identified  during response and recovery efforts. FEMA\u2019s 2017 Hurricane Season  After-Action Report recognized the challenges of Hurricane Maria, among  other disasters, and found that the agency must better prepare for  sequential, complex disasters and address logistical challenges that may  complicate efforts to deploy resources to remote areas. We have also  reported on the challenges in assessing state and local jurisdiction  preparedness for emergencies and disasters. In March 2011, we  reported that FEMA needed to improve its oversight of preparedness  grants by establishing a framework with measurable performance  objectives for assessing urban area, state, territory, and tribal capabilities  to identify gaps and prioritize investments. Specifically, we  recommended that FEMA complete a national preparedness assessment  of capability gaps at each level based on tiered, capability-specific  performance objectives to enable prioritization of grant funding. As of  March 2020, this recommendation has not been implemented.", "FEMA uses the National Preparedness System to help assess the  nation\u2019s emergency management capabilities and, in part, to help  prioritize federal preparedness grants it provides to state and local  communities to fill gaps in their emergency management capabilities.  Specifically, the National Preparedness System is designed to help  communities measure and assess their 32 distinct emergency  management capabilities (\u201ccore capabilities\u201d) and, in part, to prioritize  preparedness grants. According to DHS, from fiscal years 2002 through  2019, DHS awarded over $52 billion in preparedness grants to enhance  and strengthen the capabilities of state, local, tribal, and territorial grant  recipients to prevent, protect, mitigate against, respond to, and recover  from terrorist attacks and other disasters.", "You asked us to review a broad range of issues related to disaster  preparedness. This report examines:  1.  the extent to which the National Preparedness System and associated  preparedness grants assisted jurisdictions in preparing for disasters;  2.  the extent to which FEMA has strengthened the National  Preparedness System and what steps remain to prepare for future  disasters; and,  3.  the extent to which FEMA uses after-action reports following major  disasters to identify lessons learned and strengthen future  preparedness activities.", "To determine the extent to which the National Preparedness System and  associated preparedness grants assisted jurisdictions in preparing for  disasters, we reviewed FEMA\u2019s 2012 guidance, which jurisdictions used  to prepare assessments of their emergency management capabilities  from 2012 through 2017\u2014the most current data available at the time of  our review. After reviewing the guidance, we reviewed 10 jurisdictions\u2019  assessments of their emergency management capabilities for 2013  through 2018 to examine the extent to which their capability ratings were  being enhanced or sustained over that period. We selected these  jurisdictions because they had prepared assessments prior to 2018 and  were also impacted by the 2017 and 2018 hurricanes and wildfires. We  also reviewed DHS notices announcing the availability of preparedness  grants and FEMA case studies examining jurisdictions\u2019 use of grant  funds, to determine the extent to which FEMA requires or encourages  grant recipients to use the funds to improve the capabilities. Further, we  analyzed data submitted by jurisdictions from their emergency  management capability assessments on the 32 core capabilities, broken  down annually by state, territory, and, to the extent possible, by Urban  Area Security Initiative regions, which encompass major metropolitan  areas throughout the United States. To validate FEMA\u2019s assessment of  the submitted jurisdictions\u2019 data, we conducted the same analysis that  FEMA conducted on the emergency management capability assessments  submitted by the 50 states, District of Columbia, and 5 territories from  2013 through 2017. The results of both analyses proved to be  consistent with one another. We also compared our data analysis to  FEMA\u2019s data analysis to help ensure the reliability of the data. In addition,  we interviewed FEMA officials to determine how, and to what extent, the  data can be used to report on national preparedness. We determined that  these data were reliable for the purpose of our reporting objectives.", "We also reviewed FEMA\u2019s current guidance, which was updated in 2018  and included instructions to the jurisdictions on how to measure and  assess their capabilities in a manner that would allow them to define their  capability gaps quantitatively moving forward. In addition, we reviewed  FEMA\u2019s strategic planning documents and the Comprehensive  Preparedness Guide 101, which provides additional guidance jurisdictions  use to develop preparedness plans and report on their capabilities. We  also conducted interviews and site visits with state emergency  management officials in California, Florida, New York, North Carolina,  and Texas to discuss their process for identifying and preparing for  specific threats, hazards, and risks. Four of the five states we visited  experienced major disasters during 2017 and 2018. In addition to the four  states that incurred damages during 2017 and 2018, we visited New  York, which was not impacted by the 2017 and 2018 hurricanes or  wildfires. However, New York has multiple threats, risks, and hazards-and  receives preparedness grants annually. We interviewed officials from the  state and city of New York to, in part, discuss their use of preparedness  grant funds. Additionally, within the five states we visited, we interviewed  emergency management officials in four cities and 11 counties to obtain  their views on the response and recovery to the 2017 and 2018  hurricanes and wildfires, as well as their perspectives on various  preparedness activities they participate in as part of the National  Preparedness System. We selected the counties and cities based on  the high level of damages they incurred during the 2017 and 2018  disasters and by whether they receive preparedness grant funding. The information obtained during these site visits are specific to the state and  local officials we interviewed and are not generalizable to all state and  local emergency management officials or recipients of preparedness  grants, but their perspectives provide insights into how the National  Preparedness System and associated preparedness grants are helping  jurisdictions prepare for disasters.", "To determine the extent to which FEMA has strengthened the National  Preparedness System and what, if any, steps remain to prepare for future  disasters, we conducted interviews with officials in FEMA\u2019s National  Preparedness Directorate and the National Preparedness Assessment  Division to gain their perspectives on FEMA\u2019s implementation and use of  the National Preparedness System. We reviewed relevant information  from our prior testimony to Congress on national capabilities and  analyzed FEMA documents\u2014such as the 2019 National Threat and  Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (National THIRA) Overview  and Methodology. In addition, we interviewed state and local officials  from the five states we visited to discuss the implementation of the 2018  methodology that recipients of preparedness grants use to conduct state,  local, and territorial threat assessments.", "To determine the extent to which FEMA is using after-action reports  following major disasters to strengthen future preparedness activities, we  interviewed officials from FEMA\u2019s headquarters and its regional staff  (Regions II, IV, VI, and IX) who are responsible for conducting, collecting,  and analyzing FEMA\u2019s after-action reports; and collected and analyzed  available after-action reports. We selected these FEMA regions because  of their proximity to the five states we visited and their experiences  assisting in the response and recovery efforts during the 2017 and 2018  disasters. The FEMA regional officials we interviewed are responsible for  coordinating disaster assistance and preparedness activities in California,  Florida, New York, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Texas, and U.S. Virgin  Islands. While the regional officials\u2019 views add important context to our  findings, their statements cannot be generalized and are not  representative of all FEMA Regional officials. In addition, we reviewed  prior GAO reports, in which we reviewed coordination among FEMA\u2019s  regional offices and headquarters, in part, to assess their process for  conducting and using after-action reports. We also reviewed FEMA  program guidance related to FEMA\u2019s after-action reporting protocols.  We then compared FEMA\u2019s efforts to identify and address lessons  learned with the provisions in the Post-Katrina Emergency Management  Reform Act of 2006 (Post-Katrina Act) as well as the standards for  conducting lessons learned efforts outlined in The Standards for Program  Management. We also assessed FEMA\u2019s efforts against DHS\u2019s National  Response Framework, which specifies that evaluation and continual  process improvement are cornerstones of effective preparedness.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2018 to April 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In 2018, FEMA required jurisdictions to begin using the new  methodology to assess the core capabilities within the response and  recovery mission areas. Beginning in 2019, FEMA required jurisdictions  to begin using the new methodology to assess the core capabilities  across all mission areas.

For example, Craven County, NC, officials told us that in response  to the flooding from Hurricane Florence, their emergency operations  center was instrumental in communicating with first responders. In doing  so, they were able to keep county wells running while working with utility  companies to prioritize areas that needed electrical power, such as  hospitals and grocery stores.

In 2017, 43 percent of the assessment ratings by states and  territories rated three of the four mitigation-related capabilities in the  highest category. Improvements in the mitigation mission area could be,  in part, attributable to FEMA providing jurisdictions with grant funds other  than preparedness grants, such as post-disaster grants, which include  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds.", "Further, state and local decisions on how to prioritize preparedness grant  awards resulted in about 1 percent\u2014$78 million\u2014being directed to  capabilities within the recovery mission area between 2013 and 2018. As  shown in figure 4, jurisdictions directed approximately 79 percent of the  $78 million (about $62 million) in the recovery mission area to the  infrastructure systems capability, which is intended to, in part, allow  jurisdictions to re-establish critical infrastructure in disaster-impacted  areas to support life sustainment activities, ongoing emergency response  operations, and to help facilitate recovery efforts. Additionally, about 3  percent of the $78 million\u2014about $2.4 million\u2014was directed to disaster  housing capabilities, such as implementing housing solutions that  effectively support the temporary housing needs of an impacted  jurisdiction.", "State officials from New York and North Carolina, as well as officials from  five localities, said they often prioritize and use preparedness grants to  maintain existing capabilities within the crosscutting, prevention, and  response capabilities, rather than enhancing capabilities where gaps are  known to exist, such as those in the recovery and protection areas. In  addition, state officials from Texas, as well as officials from two localities  told us that they need to use portions of their limited grant funds\u2014 especially from Emergency Management Performance Grant funds\u2014to  hire and retain local emergency management personnel, which leaves  fewer funds for them to devote to enhancing lower-rated emergency  management capabilities. For example, some county governments may  not have the resources necessary to fund a single emergency manager,  which requires them to use Emergency Management Performance Grant  funds to hire and retain necessary staff.", "Another reason why jurisdictions do not use more of the grants toward  lower-rated mission areas is because some view certain capabilities in  the recovery and mitigation mission areas to be the responsibility of the  federal government. Both FEMA and state officials told us that sometimes  jurisdictions do not use these grants to strengthen capabilities such as  housing because they consider the federal government responsible for  filling the gaps. For example, preparedness data from 2013 to 2017  showed the percent of jurisdictions identifying the federal government as  responsible for providing housing solutions to disaster survivors increased  from 46 to 53 percent. According to state officials from North Carolina, it  would not be a prudent use of grant funds for the state to purchase and  store temporary housing units that may not be needed inside the borders  of the state for several years.

Specifically, FEMA  officials told us cybersecurity remains a high priority for all jurisdictions for  2020 and has identified areas from lessons learned where cybersecurity  could be strengthened. Jurisdictions are considering investments in  cybersecurity such as adding more information technology equipment and  hiring personnel with cybersecurity expertise. However, according to state  officials from New York and Texas, jurisdictions often lack the resources  necessary to hire and retain personnel skilled enough to prepare for,  respond to, and recover from cyberattacks.", "Preparedness grants, in general, are designed to allow jurisdictions  discretion to spend the funds as they see fit on projects that meet  eligibility requirements. While FEMA encourages jurisdictions to invest  grant funds to address their capability gaps, it does not require or direct  jurisdictions to spend grant funding in a certain area. In light of these  challenges, FEMA has taken a number of other steps to try to address  these capability gaps.", "FEMA proposed creating a new National Priorities Security Grant in  the President\u2019s 2019 and 2020 budget proposals, which could be  used to address new and emerging threats and gaps, such as those  in cybersecurity. FEMA proposed that the program\u2019s priorities be  assessed frequently and shift as needed to address emerging threats  and capability gaps. In fiscal years 2019 and 2020, the President\u2019s  budget proposed $522 and $430 million respectively. The proposed  grant program was not approved by Congress.", "In 2019, FEMA established the Regional Catastrophic Preparedness  Grant Program to help jurisdictions address known capability gaps in  disaster housing as well as logistics and supply chain management. In  fiscal year 2019, FEMA awarded $10 million in these grants to eight  local governments.", "In 2019, FEMA began implementing the Building Resilient  Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program to provide  jurisdictions with funding to make their infrastructure more resilient in  future disasters. According to FEMA, grant recipients could use  future funding to strengthen capability gaps in the recovery and  mitigation mission areas. FEMA plans to issue a Notice of Funding  Opportunity in the summer of 2020, followed by an application period.

Specifically, FEMA officials told us that the  current suite of preparedness grants lacks the flexibility needed to  address some of the long-standing capability gaps, in part, because the  grants are required to be spent on capabilities that have a nexus to  terrorism. In addition, as described earlier, one state official, and two local  officials, suggested that the level of funding for the Emergency  Management Performance Grant will likely not allow states and localities  to hire and retain local emergency management personnel while also  making the investments needed to address the capability gaps identified  through the National Preparedness System.

For example, FEMA published new guidance in May 2018 to update the  methodology for how jurisdictions are to evaluate their preparedness  levels when completing THIRAs and SPRs. The intent was to allow  communities to collect more specific, quantitative data to compare their  capability targets to current capabilities, thereby more accurately defining  their capability gaps. Beginning in 2018, jurisdictions used the new  methodology to assess their capabilities in the crosscutting, response,  and recovery mission areas. Beginning in 2019, jurisdictions were  required to use the new methodology to assess the capabilities across all  five mission areas: prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and  recovery.", "According to FEMA, this new methodology improves on the prior one  because the new methodology will allow jurisdictions to more accurately  determine what amount of resources are needed to address specific  threats and hazards. Specifically, as a result of using more quantitative  data, such as the specific number of disaster victims able to be sheltered  following a disaster, jurisdictions may be able to better define their  capability gaps when compiling their SPRs. For example, if jurisdictions  are able to understand that their current capability is less than their  needed capability target, they will be able to define their capability gaps in  quantitative terms. According to FEMA officials, the new methodology, if  implemented successfully, will allow jurisdictions to know what additional  resources and capabilities\u2014beyond their own current capabilities\u2014may  be needed during future disasters.

The 2019 National THIRA consists of nine catastrophic incident  scenarios and 22 capability targets across the crosscutting, response,  and recovery mission areas.

Less than 2 weeks after the first  confirmed case is identified at a local  hospital, the illness causes hundreds of  fatalities and thousands of people seeking  medical attention. As the virus spreads,  approximately 30 percent of the population  across the United States and other countries  becomes severely ill. Conventional flu  vaccines are ineffective against the current  strain, and the CDC estimates that a new  vaccine could be months away from mass  production. Because of the pandemic, social  distancing is in widespread effect. Utilities,  police, fire, government, and other essential  services are disrupted due to social  distancing and employee absenteeism.  Businesses close, resulting in a large-scale  loss of services across the region (e.g.  banking, food stores, gas stations). There is a  shortage of medical supplies, equipment,  beds, and healthcare workers as hospitals  are quickly overwhelmed, with up to millions  of individuals seeking outpatient medical care  and millions more requiring hospitalization.  Civil disorder contributes to the high rate of  absenteeism and the overcrowding of  hospitals and medical centers. how quickly power service can be restored to customers; how quickly life-sustaining commodities can be delivered to people; how quickly emergency sheltering, food, and water can be provided to how quickly affected healthcare facilities can restore function.", "In the aftermath of the sequential 2017 disasters, FEMA\u2019s 2017 Hurricane  Season FEMA After-Action Report recognized the need to more  effectively scale response efforts for concurrent, complex incidents.

FEMA found that combining the impacts of a National THIRA scenario  with the set of plausible concurrent operations more accurately reflects  the challenges the nation would need to address should one of the threat  scenarios identified in the National THIRA occur. However, given that  FEMA has yet to finalize inclusion of the National THIRA into the 2020  National Preparedness Report, it is too early to determine the extent to  which it helps FEMA more accurately define the nation\u2019s emergency  management capability gaps and results in the nation being better  prepared for future catastrophic disasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Yet to Determine What Steps Need to be Taken to Address Capability Gaps at the Federal and Jurisdictional Levels", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, the National Preparedness System has identified  gaps in jurisdictions\u2019 emergency management capabilities since 2012.

The collection  of that information, through the National Stakeholder Preparedness  Report, was scheduled to begin in 2020 but was delayed due to response  operations for the COVID-19 pandemic. According to DHS, this  information will be incorporated into the 2021 National Preparedness  Report, helping to form a more complete picture of national capabilities.  FEMA stated that the costs to address the nation\u2019s resource gaps cannot  be estimated without first accounting for existing federal capabilities.  According to DHS, the anticipated date for the 2020 National  Preparedness Report, pending response operations to the COVID-19  pandemic, is October 30, 2020, and the 2021 National Preparedness  Report is planned to be released in October 2021. DHS stated that once  the 2021 National Preparedness Report is released, FEMA will develop  and socialize a plan to work with the federal interagency to identify  resources needed to address the national gaps identified in the 2021  National Preparedness Report.", "If implemented effectively, these actions combined with the steps taken to  inform key stakeholders could meet the intent of our recommendation.  Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to finalize  the 2021 National Preparedness Report prior to being able to account for  the federal government\u2019s existing capabilities, we are adjusting the  wording of this recommendation to follow the issuance of the 2021  National Preparedness Report. DHS estimates the expected completion  date to be March 2022.", "DHS concurred with our second recommendation to develop guidance to  help determine which after-action reviews should be prioritized and  implement timeframes for following up on incomplete after-action reports.", "According to DHS, FEMA will address the prioritization of disaster after- action reports as the Continuous Improvement Program\u2019s first priority for  2020. Additionally, FEMA plans to identify and develop timeframes for  following up on after-action reports as part of a broader program  evaluation effort in 2020. These actions, if implemented effectively, could  meet the intent of our recommendation. While FEMA originally anticipated  completing this guidance during 2020, the COVID-19 response extended  this timeline. DHS estimates the expected completion date to be March  31, 2021.", "DHS concurred with our third recommendation to develop a formal  mechanism to consistently track best practices, lessons learned, and  corrective actions. DHS stated that FEMA, in December 2019,  implemented an issue elevation and resolution system for tracking best  practices, lessons learned, and corrective actions that are elevated to  FEMA headquarters level for resolution, as appropriate. However,  according to FEMA in April 2020, the agency has taken steps to track  best practices and lessons learned through a serious of Microsoft Excel  files, but this is not considered to be a long term or ideal operating  solution due to its lack of accessibility, ease of use, and ability to be  queried. Further, in April 2020, FEMA stated that it is working to identify  resources to build an actual application that will be used for this purpose.  These actions, if implemented effectively, could meet the intent of our  recommendation.", "DHS concurred with our fourth recommendation that FEMA develop  guidance on sharing after-action reports and their relevant findings with  external stakeholders, when appropriate. According to DHS, FEMA is  drafting program guidance for the Continuous Improvement Program to  address the sharing of after action reports and their relevant findings with  external stakeholders. These actions, if implemented effectively, could  meet the intent of the recommendation. Due to the ongoing COIVD-19  pandemic, FEMA estimates its completion date to be March 31, 2021.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland  Security, the FEMA Administrator, and the appropriate congressional  committees.
