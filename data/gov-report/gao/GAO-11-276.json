DOD recognized the importance of interoperability and directed adherence to internationally accepted biometric standards. DOD applied adopted standards in some but not all of its collection devices. Specifically, a collection device used primarily by the Army does not meet DOD adopted standards. As a result, DOD is unable to automatically transmit biometric information collected to federal agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). For example, this device is responsible for 13 percent of the records maintained by DOD--the largest number of submissions collected by a handheld device, according to DOD. Further, this constitutes approximately 630,000 DOD biometric records that cannot be searched automatically against FBI's approximately 94 million. DOD has not taken certain actions that would likely improve its adherence to standards, all of which are based on criteria from the Standard for Program Management, the National Science and Technology Council, and the Office of Management and Budget guidance, respectively. First, DOD does not have an effective process, procedure, or timeline for implementing updated standards. Second, DOD does not routinely test at sufficient levels of detail for conformance to these standards. Third, DOD has not fully defined roles and responsibilities specifying accountability needed to ensure its collection devices meet new and updated standards. DOD is sharing its biometric information and has an agreement to share biometric information with the Department of Justice, which allows for direct connectivity and the automated sharing of biometric information between their biometric systems. DOD's ability to optimize sharing is limited by not having a finalized sharing agreement with DHS, and its capacity to process biometric information. Currently, DOD and DHS do not have a finalized agreement in place to allow direct connectivity between their biometric systems. DOD is working with DHS to develop a memorandum of understanding to share biometric information now scheduled for completion in May 2011; however, without the agreement, it is unclear whether direct connectivity will be established between DOD and DHS, which affects response times to search queries. Further, agencies' biometric systems have varying system capacities based on their mission needs, which affects their ability to similarly process each other's queries for biometric information. As a result, DOD and other agency officials have expressed concern that DOD's biometric system may be unable to meet the search demands from their other biometric systems over the long-term. DOD officials do not believe that they need to match other agencies' biometric system capacities because they do not anticipate receiving the same number of queries given differences in mission. However, the advancements other agencies make in their biometric systems may continue to overwhelm DOD's efforts as it works to identify its long-term biometric system capability needs and associated costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve DOD's ability to collect and share information, GAO recommends that DOD implement processes for updating and testing biometric collection devices to adopted standards; fully define and clarify the roles and responsibilities for all biometric stakeholders; finalize an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and identify its long-term biometric system capability needs.

The  FBI is currently in the process of transitioning from IAFIS to the Next  Generation Identification system, which will include an expansion to  biometrics storage and search capabilities for fingerprints; scars, marks,  and tattoos; faces; irises; and palms. The Next Generation Identification  system is a multiyear effort with six increments that is expected to be  completed by 2014.  (2) DHS\u2019s Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT).  Established in 1994 and managed by the United States Visitor and  Immigrant Status Indicator Technology program, which falls under the  purview of the National Protection and Programs Directorate within DHS,  IDENT is used by DHS and State for many purposes including border  security, information on persons undergoing naturalization and visa  processes, and in the agencies\u2019 counterterrorism efforts. IDENT stores,  searches, matches, and shares fingerprints.

The memorandum  further stated that all new or updated DOD collection devices must meet  the DOD EBTS standard and be interoperable with DOD\u2019s biometric  system ABIS. Consistent with the Army\u2019s position on interoperability, the  DOD Directive on Biometrics, issued in February 2008, stated that  collection and transmission of biometric information shall be controlled  through the use of DOD adopted standards to enhance consistency and  interoperability of biometric information. A 2009 Joint Interoperability  report, which reviewed selected biometric systems that interfaced with  DOD\u2019s ABIS and analyzed data collected by these systems for  conformance issues that have an impact on interoperability, stated that  several DOD biometric collection devices meet DOD adopted standards.

For example, a  collection device used by the Army to meet an urgent need in 2005 and  currently still in use in Iraq and Afghanistan, did not meet the standard  current at the time of the 2009 Joint Interoperability report, and according  to DOD officials, continues to not adhere to DOD EBTS version 1.2 or the  more current version 2.0. As of late 2009, this collection device, known as  the Handheld Interagency Identity Detection Equipment or HIIDE,  continued to be purchased by DOD. According to DOD officials, DOD  continues to use the HIIDE because it meets DOD\u2019s mission needs and  since it was developed as an urgent mission need for Central Command to  collect and authenticate the identity of individuals, it does not have to  adhere to DOD\u2019s information technology standards. Those standards are  included in the DOD Information Technology Standards Registry, the  central repository for DOD-approved information technology standards,  and are mandated for programs of record for biometric technologies,  which are considered permanent capabilities.

Both DOD and DHS access FBI\u2019s IAFIS  in order to share information. Therefore, if FBI does not have access to  DOD information, for example, HIIDE biometric records, then neither  does DHS when they search against IAFIS. However, according to DHS  and DOD officials, DOD manually provides biometric records of  individuals on its watch list, which can include HIIDE-collected biometric  information.

However, without timely guidance that documents and communicates a  process, procedure, or timeline for updating biometric capabilities from  one version of a standard to another, the military services may continue to  lack accurate information that is necessary to implement new or updated  standards during the acquisition process. Specifically, military services  may not have information on when an emerging DOD standard will  become mandated within the 3-year time frame, but must ensure that  collection devices being developed conform to the DOD mandated  standard, not the emerging standard. The Army established the Biometrics  Standards Working Group based on the 2008 biometric directive that,  among other activities, it should provide guidance for consistent standards  implementation, however, the 2009 DOD joint interoperability assessment  found that DOD lacked a process beyond the Working Group to address  the impact of changes to the DOD adopted standards. Further, absent such  a process, procedure, or timeline to manage the update to new standards,  the military services may also face increased costs in developing biometric  collection devices when time frames for the update of standards are not  documented or managed.

As part of the  memorandum, DOD and the FBI agree to share their biometric  information with each other in a timely manner when their respective  missions require access to such data.", "In addition to DOD and the FBI\u2019s agreement to share biometric  information, DHS, State, and DOJ have agreements in place that allow for  direct connectivity and the automated sharing of biometric information  among their biometric systems\u2014capabilities that support the collection,  storage, use, and sharing of biometric data. Specifically, DHS and State  established a memorandum of understanding in 2005 to facilitate  interagency cooperation and sharing of, among other things, biometric  information on visa applicants and biometric information stored on DHS\u2019s  biometric system, to enhance border security and facilitate legitimate  travel. State uses DHS\u2019s biometric system for storing and sharing copies  of their biometric information. Additionally, DHS, DOJ, and State  established a memorandum of understanding in July 2008 to improve  information sharing among the three agencies for the purposes of such  missions as national security, law enforcement, immigration, and border  management. The July 2008 memorandum included an agreement to  share, among other things, biometric information through interoperability  between the agencies\u2019 biometric systems. According to FBI officials, the  FBI initiated the interoperability agreement in 2005 to exchange biometric  information between DOJ\u2019s and DHS\u2019s biometric systems and gained  access to DHS\u2019s full biometric system in 2008. However, according to DHS  officials, initial sharing of DHS high priority biometric information with  DOJ\u2019s biometric system began in 2006, such as information on individuals  expedited for removal and those denied visas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Does Not Have an Agreement with DHS or with State, Which Limits Its Ability to Efficiently Share Biometric Information", "paragraphs": ["DOD and DHS currently do not have an agreement in place that allows for  direct connectivity between their biometric systems; however, DOD is  currently in the process of working with DHS to develop a memorandum  of agreement to share biometric information. DOD also does not have an  agreement in place to directly share information with State; however,  according to DOD officials, State sharing requirements will be covered in  the agreement between DOD and DHS. According to the draft  memorandum, the intent of the document is to formalize the ongoing  relationship between DOD and DHS and to clarify their commitment to  permitting the maximum amount of biometric information sharing  permitted by law. Among other delays, in July 2010, DOD officials  informed us that the draft memorandum was undergoing a subsequent  review at DHS because some individuals at DHS had been inadvertently  left off the initial review. As of January 2011, DOD and DHS have not  signed an agreement that allows for direct connectivity between their  biometric systems.", "We reported in 2008 that DHS officials acknowledged that establishing a  sharing agreement with DOD would increase sharing of biometric  information between the agencies and close any gaps. According to DHS  officials, having such an agreement in place would allow DOD and DHS to  access each other\u2019s biometric systems when needed for reasons such as  detainee screening and airport passenger screening. Direct access would  reduce response times to search queries because currently DOD and DHS  biometric systems do not have direct connectivity and therefore do not  have automated search capabilities so the response times vary. We  recognize that developing an agreement to share information takes time;  for example, it took over 5 years to develop the memorandum of  understanding between DOD and the FBI. DOD and DHS officials stated  they had hoped to have the memorandum completed by the end of 2010;  however, as of January 2011 the agreement had not yet been completed.  Several dates of completion and reasons for delay of the memorandum  between DOD and DHS were provided to us by DOD officials throughout  our review. In December 2010, DOD anticipated completing a signed  agreement with DHS no later than May 31, 2011.", "According to DOD and DHS officials, some sharing of information is  occurring between DOD, DHS, and State, even though DOD and DHS do  not have a finalized sharing agreement. We reported in 2008 that DOD and  DHS had not established direct connectivity between their two biometric  systems and relied on the FBI\u2019s biometric system as an indirect link  between DOD and DHS. At the time, while limited occasional sharing of  DOD and DHS biometrics occurred, it did not happen on a regular basis.  According to DOD, DHS, and FBI officials, the indirect sharing  arrangement through the FBI\u2019s biometric system is still in place, as shown  in figure 3. The FBI maintains an Interim Data Sharing Model, which  consists of two parts\u2014the FBI provides a set of data to DHS for DHS  stakeholders to access and DHS provides a set of data to the FBI for FBI  stakeholders to access, to include DOD, which includes biometric  information on individuals with expedited removals and individuals who  were denied visas. Furthermore, the FBI retains on its IAFIS some  biometric information from DOD on non-U.S. persons, such as those who  have criminal records, which allows DHS and State to access limited  information from DOD through the FBI biometric system. However, both  DOD and FBI officials noted that the FBI may be terminating its Interim  Data Sharing Model as the FBI transitions to its new biometric system. In  March 2011, FBI officials reported that DOD searches of the portion of the  Interim Data Sharing Model containing information on expedited removals  and individuals who were denied visas were discontinued on January 20,  2011. However, FBI\u2019s IAFIS will continue to facilitate searches of DHS  information for DOD until a direct connection has been established  between DHS and DOD\u2019s biometric systems, according to FBI officials.", "Since we reported in 2008, DOD and DHS have established a manual  process for sharing information on at least a daily basis\u2014once every         24 hours\u2014through the use of a secured Web site. DOD manually inputs to  this web site copies of critical DOD biometric information that DHS can  manually access to place onto its own biometric system. The State  Department can access this information once it is stored on DHS\u2019s  biometric system. However, DHS and State may not be able to take  immediate action should they have a query prior to DOD\u2019s once-a-day  update. In addition, as noted in our 2008 report, if DHS and State do not  have access to DOD biometric information on individuals trying to enter  the United States, then they may not be able to determine whether those  individuals should be denied entry, and potential harm could come to U.S.  interests from individuals inadvertently allowed into the United States.", "Officials from DOD, DHS, and the FBI have discussed the goal for direct  connectivity among their biometric systems to better enable automated  sharing of biometric information (see fig. 4).

As  noted previously, the FBI\u2019s IAFIS is a national fingerprint and criminal  history system, while DHS\u2019s IDENT is used for many purposes, including  border security and visa and naturalization processing. DOD\u2019s Next  Generation ABIS is used to identify and verify non-U.S. persons and helps  determine if the individual poses a threat or potential threat to national  security. DOD\u2019s Next Generation ABIS is currently capable of handling  8,000 transactions per day. In contrast, according to FBI officials, the FBI\u2019s  IAFIS system currently performs over 100,000 to 200,000 search queries a  day, while DHS manages over 160,000 search queries a day, according to  DHS officials. DOD has plans to increase the capacity to 22,000  transactions per day in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and upgrades  to later bring capacity up to 45,000 transactions per day, according to DOD  officials.", "DOD officials do not believe that they need to match other agencies\u2019  biometric system capacities because they do not anticipate receiving the  same number of queries given differences in mission. However, DOD and  other agency officials have expressed concern that DOD\u2019s biometric  system is limited in its ability to maximize sharing of biometric  information. The FBI has reported that DOD is currently meeting their  needs by supporting a capacity of 3,000\u20134,000 transactions per day, for  which the FBI could query DOD\u2019s Next Generation ABIS to search against.  However, FBI officials told us that they are concerned with DOD\u2019s  capacity as the Next Generation ABIS is not capable of handling all of the  queries that the FBI receives. FBI officials noted that DOD does not want  the FBI to send every search query it receives through DOD\u2019s biometric  system. At this time, the FBI and DOD are working to target and define a  set of search queries for the FBI to send through Next Generation ABIS,  according to FBI officials. However, a maximum transaction capacity has  not yet been set for FBI submissions to DOD. Additionally, DHS officials  believe DOD will need more capacity to handle search queries in order for  direct interoperability between DOD and DHS to occur. DHS reported in  November 2010 that when it establishes direct interconnectivity with DOD,  DHS plans to send 13,000 search queries in 2011 and 14,000 search queries  in 2012 to DOD\u2019s Next Generation ABIS for searching per day. DHS noted  in January 2011 that transaction volumes for search queries from DHS to  DOD\u2019s biometric system are currently in flux and have not been finalized.  However, DOD officials have acknowledged that their current system\u2019s  transaction capacity is limited for sharing because the number of queries  from other federal agencies currently exceeds their biometric system  capacity of 8,000 transactions per day.", "The advancements other agencies continue to make in their biometric  systems may overwhelm DOD\u2019s efforts as it works to identify its long-term  biometric system capability needs and associated costs. At the same time  that DOD carries out these expansion efforts, other agencies continue to  make advancements in their biometric systems and will continue to do so  in the future for various reasons, including the addition of new technology  and biometric modalities as emerging technologies and modalities are  identified and matured. For example, as previously mentioned, DHS is  considering iris and facial biometrics for future incorporation into its  biometric system. In addition, the FBI is moving to an enhanced biometric  system that will incorporate scars, marks, tattoos, face, iris, and palm  biometrics. Such agency biometric system advancements could exceed  DOD\u2019s biometric system\u2019s capability to respond. In light of this, DOD may  not be able to facilitate sharing of biometric information across federal  agencies in a timely and efficient manner, in accordance with DOD  policies. Specifically, DOD\u2019s biometric directive requires that biometric  systems be interoperable with other identity management capabilities and  systems both internal and external to DOD, to maximize effectiveness, as  well as information-sharing efforts. Furthermore, DOD\u2019s biometrics  strategic plan outlines as a primary objective that DOD operate and  maintain biometric systems that enable sharing with other biometric  systems as part of DOD\u2019s goal to meet the warfighters\u2019 needs in a timely  manner."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["National security challenges from multiple sources continue to increase,  therefore making it critical that federal agencies find effective ways to  collaborate and share information\u2014particularly biometric information\u2014 on those who would threaten the United States. DOD has taken steps to  adopt biometric standards that could improve the quality of biometric  information collected and has increased its efforts to share biometric  information with key federal agencies. However, DOD could take certain  actions to help improve its ability to collect and share biometric  information with other federal agencies. For example, DOD has adopted  standards for the collection of biometrics to enhance interoperability with  other key federal agencies\u2019 biometric systems, but at least one DOD device  responsible for the collection of over 600,000 biometric records, does not  meet DOD adopted standards, such as a handheld biometric collection  device used by the Army. DOD can take steps to improve conformance to  DOD adopted standards with a process for implementing updated  standards for biometric collection devices that are in the acquisition  process, more sufficient testing of devices for conformance to adopted  standards to better facilitate interoperability with federal agencies, and  more fully defining the roles and responsibilities of DOD entities to ensure  its collection devices meet DOD adopted standards. Without these steps,  DOD limits its ability to identify potential criminals or terrorists who have  biometric records in other federal agency\u2019s biometric systems, and may  result in the military services incurring delays and additional costs if they  find they have acquired a device that is no longer acceptable to DOD. In  addition, DOD has agreements in place with key federal agencies such as  DOJ to help facilitate direct connectivity between their biometric systems,  but it has not finalized an agreement with DHS and by extension the State  Department. This has an impact on timely interoperability. Finally, the  varying system capacities at these key federal agencies exceeds that of  DOD to the extent that agencies have expressed concern that DOD\u2019s  biometric system may be unable to meet the search demands from their  own biometric systems within useful response time frames. Without  efforts to address these issues, the quality and process of collecting and  sharing biometrics may continue to limit DOD\u2019s ability to identify potential  criminals or terrorists who have biometric records in other federal  agency\u2019s biometric systems in a timely manner, and ultimately these  challenges to interoperability may place U.S. national security at greater  risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve DOD\u2019s ability to collect and help ensure that federal agencies  are sharing biometric information on individuals who pose a threat to  national security to the fullest extent possible, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, as the Principal Staff Assistant  responsible for the oversight of DOD biometrics, to take the following five  actions in collaboration with other key federal agencies and internal DOD  stakeholders, including BIMA, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, and  U.S. Air Force:  Implement a process for updating collection devices to adopted standards  to help ensure that all DOD systems related to biometrics, including  collection devices, conform to adopted standards.
