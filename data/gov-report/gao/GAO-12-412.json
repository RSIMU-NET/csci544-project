GAO\u0092s objectives were to determine (1) the extent to which DOD has policies that identify and respond to environmental exposures, (2) what programs exist to provide health care or compensation to individuals for environmental exposures, and (3) which features of other federal programs may provide options in designing future compensation programs. GAO briefed the Armed Services Committees in December 2011, to satisfy the mandate. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant documentation, visited installations, and interviewed relevant officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD relies on four types of policies to identify and respond to many but not all aspects of environmental exposures: (1) environmental restoration policies address hazardous releases at military Installations; (2) occupational and environmental health policies address workplace exposures; (3) deployment health policies address the collection of occupational and environmental health data for deployed individuals; and (4) public health emergency management policies. Nonetheless, there are some limitations in the policies\u0092 coverage. For example, DOD\u0092s environmental restoration policies do not specify when to conduct public health assessments at its sites beyond the initial assessment of certain priority sites required by the Superfund law. In addition, DOD has not fully documented its responses to recommendations that result from the assessments. DOD officials responsible for oversight reported that they did not know what actions, if any, installations had taken on about 80 percent of the recommendations. Without a comprehensive tracking system, DOD has no assurance that it is addressing recommendations appropriately and could be missing opportunities to identify and resolve concerns about some health threats. Further, DOD has no policy guiding services and their installations on appropriate actions to address health risks from past exposures, which DOD attributes to the Superfund law not specifically requiring responsible parties to address such risks.", "Although several programs potentially provide either health care or compensation to various types of individuals suffering from environmental exposures, the ability of some individuals to actually obtain benefits\u0097particularly compensation\u0097is often complicated by documentary, scientific, and legal factors. First, it is often difficult to document an environmental exposure because they are often not always identified at the time they occurred. Second, it is often difficult to establish causation between an environmental exposure and a health condition, because scientific research has not always established a clear link. Third, although under certain circumstances some individuals have legal standing under the Federal Tort Claims Act to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government for damages due to an environmental exposure, damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act are not available to other types of individuals, and for certain types of claims due to legal precedent or statutes.", "In several cases, Congress has established alternative programs to provide compensation to specific populations exposed to specific environmental hazards, such as for individuals involved in the production of nuclear weapons and those who worked in coal mines. Agency officials in charge of managing these alternative programs told us that certain features of these programs have proven to be beneficial to both claimants and administrators and should be considered for inclusion if any future programs are established to compensate individuals for environmental exposures on military installations. For example, Department of Labor and Department of Justice officials told GAO a compensation program that resolves claims in a nonadversarial manner and provides outreach to potential claimants is more beneficial to both claimants and administrators. In contrast, a more adversarial with limited claimant assistance usually leads to delays and increased cost for both claimants and the agency adjudicating claims."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to DOD to identify and respond to limitations in its policies for responding to environmental exposures.

At Naval Air Facility Atsugi, an off-base incinerator released  toxic fumes that drifted over the installation. The Department of Veterans  Affairs estimates that, from 1985 through 2001, over 25,000 individuals  on the installation could have been exposed to air contaminants.  Similarly, since the start of military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the  U.S. military and its contractors have burned solid waste, including  plastics, electronics, and appliances, in open burn pits on or near military  bases. These burn pits have produced smoke and harmful emissions that  military and other health professionals believe may cause acute and  chronic health effects. Moreover, at Camp Lejeune in the early 1980s,  volatile organic compounds were discovered in some water systems  serving installation housing areas. Exposure to certain volatile organic  compounds increases the risk of adverse health effects, including cancer.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 650,000 individuals were  stationed at Camp Lejeune at some point during the contamination  period, which lasted about 30 years, and officials at the Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry estimate that up to one million  individuals could have been exposed. According to the Navy, some  former residents and individuals who worked on Camp Lejeune have  recently filed administrative claims against the U.S. government totaling  billions of dollars in potential damages for health conditions alleged to  have resulted from exposure to the contaminated water. However, the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) response in identifying, studying,  addressing, and communicating these three environmental hazards has  raised congressional concerns in general about how DOD responds to  possible individual exposures to environmental hazards on its  installations.

To satisfy the mandate, we provided a briefing to the House and  Senate Armed Services Committees in December 2011. This report  provides additional information on the topics addressed in response to  that mandate.", "To determine the processes DOD has in place for identifying and  responding to possible exposures to environmental hazards we reviewed  and analyzed relevant laws as well as guidance from DOD, the  Environmental Protection Agency, and the Agency for Toxic Substance  and Disease Registry. In conducting this analysis we conducted content  searches of DOD guidance documents to determine the extent to which  they addressed environmental exposures on military installations and  conducted a literature search to determine if there were any best  practices in responding to environmental exposures. We also examined  the database used to track the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease  Registry public health assessment recommendations and DOD\u2019s  implementation of those recommendations.

To determine the  programs that currently exist within the federal government to provide  health benefits and compensation to individuals, we obtained, reviewed,  and analyzed relevant laws and regulations, agency guidance, and other  documentation to identify the eligibility requirements and determination  procedures and extent of compensation and medical benefits provided  through various processes currently available to different types of  individuals possibly exposed to environmental hazards while working or  living on military installations. We also interviewed officials from DOD,  Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Labor, Department of  Justice, and officials from each of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Judge  Advocate Offices. To determine the features of alternative federal  programs that provide medical benefits and monetary compensation we  reviewed and analyzed relevant laws and regulations, agency guidance,  external studies, previous GAO reports, and other documentation to  identify other comparable federal programs that provide medical benefits  and monetary compensation to large groups of individuals that have been  exposed to a specific environmental hazard.

This usually  requires not only documentation of a release of a contaminant but also  that the individual was potentially exposed to the contaminant (i.e., in the  area of the release at the time and place it occurred) at a level plausibly  related to an adverse health outcome. However, it is often difficult to  document the specific time, place, or level of an environmental exposure  because such exposures are not always identified, defined, and  measured at the time of the occurrence since adverse effects of the  exposure may not be immediately apparent. This is true for environmental  exposures both on and off military installations. When environmental  exposures are not identified at the time of the release, the opportunity to  collect data on both the level of exposure and individuals present at the  time of the release may be lost. For example, in 2010 we reported that  U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq did not sample or monitor burn pit  emissions as provided by a key U.S. Central Command regulation, and,  as a result, the health impacts of burn pit exposure on individuals are not  well understood. Although DOD and the Department of Veterans Affairs  have commissioned studies to enhance their understanding of burn pit  emissions, the current lack of data on emissions specific to burn pits and  related exposures limit efforts to characterize potential health impacts on  servicemembers and contractors.", "Agent Orange is a mixture of herbicides initially developed to control broad-leafed  weeds in agricultural settings. In large quantities, it causes large-scale defoliation. It  primarily was used during the Vietnam War to defoliate large areas in order to deprive the  opposition forces of cover and food crops. Between 1962 and 1971, more than 21 million  gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed across Southeast Asia. Though the military was  unaware of it at the time of its initial use, it was later discovered that Agent Orange also  contained a dioxin, which is a by-product of the manufacturing process. This dioxin is  classified as a human carcinogen. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs,  cancers currently associated with exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides are  chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin\u2019s  lymphoma, prostate cancer, various respiratory cancers (lung, bronchus, larynx, trachea),  and some soft tissue sarcomas. of institutional knowledge resulting from staff turnover over the years.  This lack of records may continue to be an issue, particularly for  exposures occurring in the past that may at some point in the future result  in adverse health conditions. For example, some veterans returning from  Afghanistan and Iraq blame emissions from open air burn pits for several  health conditions, including respiratory illnesses. However, the Institute of  Medicine recently issued a report that was inconclusive regarding the  connection between burn pit emissions and adverse health conditions.  One of the major reasons cited by the Institute of Medicine for the  inconclusive results was insufficient data on troops\u2019 exposures to open air  burn pits. According to the study, some of the incomplete information that  hampered the Institute\u2019s analysis included information on how many  people worked in or near the pits, for how long, and how frequently.", "In many cases, obtaining compensation for an environmental exposure  further depends on an individual\u2019s ability to establish causation between  an exposure and the adverse health condition, but this is often difficult  because scientific research has not always established a clear link  between the contaminant and an adverse health effect. This is true for  environmental exposures both on and off military installations. Further  complicating the matter is the fact that for many environmental exposures  there is a latency period\u2014the time period from initial exposure to a  contaminant and the date an adverse health condition is diagnosed.  When there is a long latency period between an environmental exposure  and an adverse health condition, choosing between multiple causes of  exposure may be difficult. Where multiple alternative causes are present,  science is often unable to demonstrate that a particular individual\u2019s  environmental exposure was the cause of the condition. For example, it is  difficult to definitively rule out other environmental or lifestyle risk factors  that could have caused the condition during the years between the  exposure and the appearance of the condition. Indeed, another major  reason cited by the Institute of Medicine for the inconclusive results of  their burn pit study was high background levels of ambient pollution from  other sources, such as diesel fumes and dust that might also be  responsible for the respiratory conditions. According to the Institute of  Medicine, because of the existence of these pollutants, it could not  establish a conclusive link between burn pit emissions and the adverse  health conditions being experienced by some individuals.", "The water contamination at Camp Lejeune further underscores the  difficulties associated with these documentary and scientific factors.  Specifically, little data exist regarding Camp Lejeune\u2019s past water quality  tests and the extent to which contaminants were found in the water. As a  result, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry is  conducting a water modeling assessment to fill in the gaps in the data.  The Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry hopes the water  modeling will help identify the time and place certain areas at Camp  Lejeune received contaminated drinking water and ultimately help to  determine who was exposed, at what levels, and for how long. For  example, the data collection efforts for the Agency for Toxic Substances  and Diseases Registry\u2019s studies revealed that the area serviced by  Holcomb Boulevard water system on Camp Lejeune received water that  may have contained volatile organic compounds for a longer period than  was previously thought. Furthermore, once it has been established that a  veteran was exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, the  Department of Veterans Affairs needs to determine whether the alleged  health condition can generally be caused by the exposures received  during service and whether the health condition in a specific claim was  caused by the exposure in deciding whether to provide compensation.  These difficulties may affect veterans\u2019 ability to obtain benefits and  compensation. Data provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs show  that in calendar year 2011, the department completed decisions on 849  claims from veterans alleging an adverse health condition resulting from  the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. Of these 849 claims, 212  (25 percent) claims were granted and 637 (75 percent) were denied.  According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, those claims that were  denied failed to demonstrate one or more of the following: (1) service at  Camp Lejeune during the period of water contamination, (2) a current  disease or disability, or (3) a medical nexus or link between a current  disability and service at Camp Lejeune. According to the Department of  Veterans Affairs, a total of 1,151 claims are still being adjudicated.", "Active duty servicemembers, military retirees, veterans, and other federal  workers are able to seek compensation through Departments of Defense,  Veterans Affairs, and Labor programs, but other individuals may need to  seek a remedy under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Certain individuals  have legal standing under the Federal Tort Claims Act to file a lawsuit  against the U.S. government for damages due to an environmental  exposure under some circumstances. But damages under the Federal  Tort Claims Act are not available to other types of individuals, and for  certain types of claims, due to legal precedent or statutes. For example,  most active duty servicemembers, military retirees, and veterans may not  bring suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act due to the doctrine outlined  in the Supreme Court case Feres v. United States, and its successor  cases, for personal injuries that arise incident to their military service, and  such claims or lawsuits they attempt to file under the Federal Tort Claims  Act are subject to dismissal. However, active duty servicemembers,  military retirees, and veterans may be eligible for compensation through  Department of Defense or Veterans Affairs programs. Similarly, the  Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy for  federal workers and their dependents if the worker is injured or killed in  the performance of duties. Thus, the disability compensation, medical,  and other benefits provided for under the Federal Employees\u2019  Compensation Act are the exclusive means by which federal workers can  seek compensation from the U.S. government.

In accordance with limitations on adjudication of  claims, set out in the National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years  2011 and 2012, the Navy stated it is currently not adjudicating these  claims, and is awaiting the outcome of several ongoing and planned  studies by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry. In  addition to filing administrative claims with the Navy, some claimants  have also exercised their rights under the Federal Tort Claims Act and  filed lawsuits against the U.S. government in federal district courts.

However, when the exposures of military personnel in Vietnam  to Agent Orange could not be clearly documented, Congress enacted  legislation establishing the presumption that veterans who served in  Vietnam during a specified time frame, and subsequently developed  certain health conditions, provided in the statute or prescribed in  regulations, had been exposed. This presumption relieves the veteran  of proving one or more of the eligibility requirements for direct service  connection and shifts the burden of proof from the veteran to the  government in order to rebut the presumption.", "In addition, DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs officials told us they  are taking steps to overcome some of the difficulties in confirming  scientific links between certain contaminants and adverse health  conditions and in maintaining documentation regarding environmental  exposures.

According to Department of Veterans Affairs  officials, conducting these types of scientific studies will provide  documentation and scientific information on adverse health conditions,  that if found to be significantly different between deployed and  nondeployed servicemembers, may provide officials with information to  further examine the link between potential environmental exposures and  adverse health conditions.

In contrast, the Department of  Labor administers the Black Lung Program, and shares responsibility  for administering the Energy Employees Occupational Illness  Compensation Program with the Departments of Health and Human  Services, Energy and Justice. Responsibility for administering the  Black Lung Program has changed since its inception. Specifically,  claims for the Black Lung Program were initially processed and paid  by the Social Security Administration but, as designed by the original  legislation, the Department of Labor began processing claims in 1973  and took over all Black Lung Program claims processing in 1997. In  2002, Congress officially transferred all legal responsibility and  funding for the program to the Department of Labor.", "Funding: Funding for the three programs varies. Although initially  funded solely through annual appropriations, the Black Lung Program  is now funded largely by the coal mining industry.

In this process, the coal mine operators typically  serve as the opposing party to the claimant, and if a claimant is awarded  benefits, the mine operator determined to be the responsible employer of  the miner must generally pay the benefits, either directly or through  insurance. If no mine operator can be held liable for payments, the Black  Lung Disability Trust Fund pays the cost of black lung claims from funds  collected through an excise tax on coal.", "Department of Labor officials told us that they prefer the nonadversarial  features of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program and the  Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program because  these features can improve the timeliness of processing claims.  Conversely, the adversarial features in the Black Lung Program have  contributed to delays in reaching a final disposition of claims by allowing  opposing parties to provide evidence to refute initial claims and to appeal  claim decisions. For example, a party displeased with the initial decision  of the Division of Coal Mine Workers\u2019 Compensation in the Department of  Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs can request a  hearing with a Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge within 30  days after the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Program decision is filed.  Dissatisfied parties can appeal Administrative Law Judge decisions to the  Department of Labor Benefits Review Board and Benefits Review Board  decisions can be appealed to the appropriate United States Circuit Court  of Appeals. Finally, Circuit Court of Appeals decisions may be appealed  to the Supreme Court of the United States. In 2009, GAO found that this  structure led to a high rate of appeals that prolong the resolution of  claims. Both miners and coal mine operators frequently seek appeals,  and for those claimants awarded compensation during the initial  adjudication in fiscal year 2008, the coal mine operators found liable   Since  appealed the decision approximately 80 percent of the time.decisions are routinely appealed, GAO previously found that each level of  appeal review can take up to a year to adjudicate; ultimately, a claim may  remain in the adjudication process for years with the administering federal  agency incurring the cost for the years of processing the claim. For  example, for claims between 2001 and 2008, 28 percent of the claims of  miners awarded compensation from coal mine operators spent 3 to 8  years within the adjudication process. During this period, the claimant\u2019s  ultimate entitlement to compensation will remain in doubt.", "All three programs provide outreach and assistance services to potential  claimants. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation  Program sponsors outreach activities, including town hall meetings and  traveling resource centers, to disseminate information about benefits and  provide assistance to claimants in applying for benefits. For the Black  Lung Program, 15 black lung grantees, which provide specialized  diagnosis and treatment services, outreach, and educational programs to  help patients and their families deal with the disease have been  established through grants from the Department of Health and Human  Services.

For the Radiation Exposure Compensation  Program, these features allow program administrators to meet with  citizens, respond to questions about the program, conduct town hall  meetings, and assist in filling out claim forms. For the Energy Employees  Occupational Illness Compensation Program, town hall meetings have  provided information to more remote locations where individuals may not  have known they might have been exposed to radiation and, according to  the Department of Labor\u2019s 2009 annual report, this outreach resulted in  86 new claims in fiscal year 2009. In addition, resource centers located  near major Department of Energy facilities helped claimants complete  necessary claim forms and gather documentation such as employment  verification to support their claims. In fiscal year 2009, this outreach  helped claimants file 9,935 claims. Further, the Energy Employees  Occupational Illness Compensation Program continues to assist  claimants by enhancing its database on the types of chemical and toxic  contaminants that existed at the major Department of Energy facilities,  easing claimants\u2019 evidentiary burdens and speeding the claims process.", "According to officials from the agencies that administer the alternative  programs for compensation we reviewed and our prior work, the eligibility  requirements of a given program may have an impact on the difficulty of  claimants trying to establish eligibility, the time needed to process claims,  and the cost of administering the program. The evidence needed by  claimants varies based on the criteria for each program, which are set out  in statutes and regulations. For example, under many compensation  programs, claimants must typically show a link between an environmental  exposure and subsequent adverse health conditions to be eligible.  However, the three programs we examined have certain presumptions  that alleviate the need for claimants to fully establish a causal link  between an environmental exposure and subsequent adverse health  condition. These presumptions address, among other things, locations at  which environmental exposures are presumed to have occurred, time  frames during which claimants present in certain locations are presumed  to have been exposed, and health conditions that are presumed to have  been caused by an exposure. According to officials from the agencies  that administer the alternative programs for compensation, although  presumptions may reduce the burden on the claimant they may  potentially increase costs. In addition, very specific presumptions can  reduce eligibility for individuals who do not meet established criteria but  who, in fact, developed adverse health conditions due to exposure, while  very broad presumptions may overstate the connection between an  exposure and adverse health conditions, allowing claimants who were not  harmed by the exposure to obtain benefits and potentially increasing the  cost of the program unnecessarily. The three alternative programs for  compensation that we reviewed further illustrate how eligibility  requirements may have an impact on the difficulty of claimants trying to  establish eligibility, the time needed to process claims, and the cost of  administering the program.", "The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  provides compensation for several different types of claimants. Part B  provides compensation for, among others, employees of the  Department of Energy, its contractors or subcontractors, and atomic  weapons employers with radiation-induced cancer who developed the  cancer after working at a covered facility and whose cancer is  determined to be at least as likely as not related to the employment.  The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  relies on extensive medical and scientific processes that reconstruct  the radiation dose exposure by estimating the type and level of  radiation exposure to each affected organ to collect accurate evidence  for those claimants with a potential radiation-exposure related cancer,  which, based on previous GAO work, may increase the time and  administrative cost to adjudicate a claim. In 2010, GAO found that it  took 3 or more years to process claims that required a radiation dose  reconstruction, while those that did not require this reconstruction took  about a year to adjudicate. In addition, the direct administrative  costs for cases that require a dose reconstruction for potential  radiation-exposure related cancer, based on our 2010 report, are  estimated at about $20,000 per case, while the administrative costs of  other cases under the program ranged from $6,000-$8,000 per  case. However, in some cases in which it is not feasible to estimate  with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose received by employees at  Department of Energy facilities who were likely exposed to radiation\u2014 and there is a reasonable likelihood that such radiation dose may  have endangered employees\u2019 health\u2014the Energy Employees  Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act provides for the  addition of a class of those employees to the special exposure cohort.  Unlike claimants who are not members of the special exposure  cohort, members of the cohort who are diagnosed with any of the  cancers specified by Congress are not required to establish that the  cancer was \u201cat least as likely as not\u201d related to their employment. For  members of the cohort, this presumption reduces the evidence  necessary to meet eligibility requirements by removing the need to  establish causation between the exposure and the illness. According  to Department of Labor officials, for members of any of the more than  70 additional classes of employees added to the special exposure  cohort, the claim approval rate is 60 percent, compared to 34 percent  for claimants who are not in the special exposure cohort. Agency  officials told us that the special exposure cohort alleviates the need for  administrators to determine whether evidence supports the existence  of a link between the employment and the illness for each individual,  thus reducing administrative costs and the time needed for  adjudicating claims. However, these presumptions may overstate the  connection between an exposure and adverse health conditions and  potentially increase the cost of benefits provided in the program by  allowing claimants who were not harmed by the exposure to obtain  benefits.", "In order to receive benefits under the Black Lung Program, claimants  must generally show that the miner has or had pneumoconiosis, the  pneumoconiosis resulted in total disability or death, and that the  pneumoconiosis arose, at least in part, out of coal mine employment.  The requirement to establish causation between the coal mine  employment and the adverse health condition may increase the  difficulty for claimants trying to establish eligibility. For example, prior  GAO work has shown that few claimants have been able to meet the  program\u2019s evidentiary requirements set by law. In 2008, 87 percent  of claims within the Black Lung Program were denied, with over 60  percent of the claims denied during the initial adjudication because  claimants could not prove that they had pneumoconiosis or that  pneumoconiosis had caused disability or death. The Black Lung  Program has some presumptions, set out in statute, that ease this  requirement for claimants who worked at a coal mine. However,  some of these presumptions are rebuttable, and according to agency  officials, can still be refuted by the mine operator.", "Claimants seeking compensation under the Radiation Exposure  Compensation Program must show that they were exposed to  radiation from atmospheric nuclear testing or as a result of their  employment in the uranium mining industry, and that they developed  a related adverse health condition, specified in law or regulation.  These claimants are not required to establish causation between the  exposure and the adverse health condition. According to a  Department of Justice report, the Radiation Exposure Compensation  Program was designed to utilize existing records so that claims could  be resolved in a reliable, objective, and nonadversarial manner, with  little administrative cost to the program or person filing the claim. For  example, residents who lived downwind of atmospheric nuclear  weapons tests may use a record for ownership of a home to show that  they were present in a location during a specific time frame to meet  the qualifications of the program. While this approach may be  beneficial for administrators and claimants, the officials from the  agencies that administer the compensation programs told us that not  requiring the establishment of causation using scientific evidence  potentially diminishes the accuracy of decisions for claims, and may  increase the number of claimants who were not harmed by the  exposure but are approved for benefits. A study by the National  Academy of Sciences emphasizes this by concluding that eligibility for  the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program should be based on a  more scientific approach that emphasizes a \u201cprobability of causation\u201d  model that uses a mathematical formula to determine whether  radiation exposure is likely the cause of an individual\u2019s cancer.", "The frequencies and types of payment provided vary among alternative  programs for compensation, and may impact the administrative costs of  compensation programs. For example, the Energy Employees  Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act and the Radiation  Exposure Compensation Act provide lump sum payments in varying  amounts, while the Black Lung Program provides monthly payments. The  Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program and the  Black Lung Program also provide compensation for some medical  expenses, and the Black Lung Program provides, in some cases,  payment of claimants\u2019 attorney fees. According to Departments of Labor  and Justice officials who administer these programs, the frequency and  type of payments a program provides impacts administrative costs of the  program. For example, although a lump sum benefit payment has low  administrative costs since it is a one-time payment, some officials noted  that there may be moral implications with lump sum payments especially  in cases where the claimant may misallocate their lump sum award and  need to pursue benefits from other federal programs such as Social  Security Disability Insurance. Conversely, although monthly payments  may cost more in the longer term compared to lump sum payments,  especially if an adverse health condition must be periodically monitored  through the program in order to establish continued eligibility, a monthly  or periodic payment, on the other hand, would provide a steady stream of  income to the claimant but may also cost more to administer since the  funding agency must process payments on a monthly basis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the most recent Defense Installations Strategic Plan, DOD states its  goals of providing effective, safe, and environmentally sound living and  working places in support of DOD missions.

The Departments of Defense\u2019s, Veterans Affairs\u2019, and  Health and Human Services\u2019 written comment letters are reprinted in  appendices IV, V, and VI, respectively. The Department of Veterans  Affairs supported the recommendations, stating that \u201cthe Department of  Defense\u2019s adoption of the report recommendations would likely lead to  prompt provision of additional information on exposures, and ultimately  help veterans and others potentially exposed.\u201d The Department of Health  and Human Services expressed its support for the first recommendation  indicating that it would be available to collaborate with DOD to update the  current memorandum of understanding. In its comments, DOD partially  concurred with our first recommendation and did not concur with our  second and third recommendations. We continue to believe our  recommendations remain valid, as discussed in the report.", "DOD partially concurred with our first recommendation\u2013\u2013to establish  procedures to comprehensively track and document the status and nature  of DOD responses to public health recommendations and reflect these  procedures in an updated memorandum of understanding. Specifically:", "DOD stated that it will review its procedures for tracking DOD\u2019s  responses to Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  recommendations and, if needed, make the appropriate changes  to its tracking system. As noted in our report, the tracking system  data provided to GAO indicated that DOD did not have information  on the status of DOD\u2019s response to 80 percent of the  recommendations. Therefore, we believe DOD needs to make  improvements to its tracking system. Without these improvements,  DOD is missing opportunities to ensure that vital public health  issues are adequately addressed.", "In regards to the memorandum of understanding, DOD stated that  changes are not necessary. We disagree. The current  memorandum of understanding does not expressly call for  tracking recommendations, which we believe is an important  coordination activity. As we note in our report, the memorandum  of understanding does refer to DOD guidelines for tracking  recommendations, but these have not been updated in 17 years.  Moreover, these guidelines are not being followed, as our report  shows and DOD officials acknowledged. These guidelines called  for regular updates and an annual report on the status of  recommendations and public health actions at each site. On the  other hand, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease  Registry officials told us that updating the memorandum of  understanding with DOD, to address tracking recommendations  would be useful. Given that DOD is not following the tracking  procedures in its existing guidelines and overlooking the status of  80 percent of the recommendations, we believe that the  memorandum of understanding should be revised to expressly  address tracking responsibilities to help ensure that identified  public health risks are addressed.", "DOD did not concur with our second recommendation\u2013\u2013to establish a  policy that identifies when installations should consider requesting public  health assessments in addition to the initial assessments at National  Priorities List sites. DOD stated that its agrees that there should be  policies in place to guide decisions on soliciting public health  assessments, but believes the appropriate policies and responsibilities  are already in place. We disagree with DOD for several reasons:", "First, DOD states that additional public health assessments  conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease  Registry would duplicate the risk assessments conducted by DOD  and others, which it believes are more comprehensive. We believe  DOD\u2019s comments overlook the important distinctions between the  two assessments. Risk assessments are intended to enable the  selection of cleanup remedies to reduce or eliminate current and  future exposures, but these risk assessments generally do not  include epidemiology or assessments of health risk to populations  from current, future, and past exposures, as the public health  assessments do\u2013\u2013a fact which DOD officials acknowledged.  Thus, these assessments have distinct purposes and scopes.", "Second, DOD states that supplementary policy for additional  public health assessments for DOD cleanup sites is not needed,  but did not elaborate on the reasons why. In the course of  conducting a DOD cleanup program, installations may become  aware of past exposures\u2013\u2013such as at Tyndall Air Force Base or  Camp Lejeune\u2013\u2013years after an initial health assessment was  developed. In fact, site characterization and restoration activities  may take many years, and new health risks may be discovered  during this process. However, without this guidance, it is unclear  when it is appropriate to request a new health assessment.", "Third, DOD states that its current policies require the assessment  of health risks to servicemembers and their dependents living on  its installations; however, until DOD\u2019s February 2012 revised  directive, it was unclear when and if health surveillance data were  collected for servicemembers\u2019 dependents. As we said in the  report, it is too soon to determine whether the implementation of  this directive will include all individuals living or working on DOD  installations\u2013\u2013particularly servicemembers\u2019 dependents living on  overseas installations. As such, policies beyond the general  directive are needed to ensure appropriate data are collected that  might support a public health assessment when necessary.", "Finally, DOD states that assessments at Naval Air Station Atsugi,  Japan, and Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, were initiated based  on health concerns raised by military families living on these  installations. However, in our view, these examples highlight  DOD\u2019s reactive\u2013\u2013rather than proactive\u2013\u2013approach to responding  to health concerns.  In the case of air pollution at Atsugi, no DOD  policy existed to guide the Navy on their approach to conducting  environmental surveillance, medical testing, or notification of the  potentially exposed dependents. As a result, it took several years  for DOD to complete a risk assessment and notify  servicemembers and their dependents about the long-term health  effects. It took at least 13 years after the initial complaints for DOD  and the U.S. government to get the Japanese government to  close the incinerator that contributed to the air pollution. Policies to  guide decisions on soliciting public health assessments could  accelerate DOD\u2019s response to future public health concerns.", "DOD did not concur with our third recommendation\u2013\u2013to provide guidance  on actions to identify and address possible health risks faced by  individuals from past exposures at military installations. DOD stated that it  follows federal law, and its current guidance and policy are adequate for  reasonably anticipated actions. We disagree for two reasons:", "The experiences at Atsugi Naval Air Station and Camp Lejeune  demonstrate that DOD\u2019s current guidance and policy are not  adequate to encompass situations that have potentially severe  health implications, which DOD has already encountered in the  past. At Atsugi, an off-base incinerator in Japan released toxic  fumes that drifted onto the naval base and may have exposed  over 25,000 individuals on the installation to toxic air contaminants  from 1985 through 2001, according to the Department of Veterans  Affairs, despite individual complaints starting around 1988. At  Camp Lejeune, potential exposure to volatile organic compounds  in drinking water has resulted in administrative claims by  servicemembers against the U.S. government totaling billions of  dollars in potential damages for health conditions alleged to have  resulted from exposure to contaminated water. In these examples,  no current DOD policy or guidance was available to provide focus  and direction in how officials should address past exposures. We  continue to believe that these experiences could inform new  policies by DOD to provide guidance to the services and their  installations on how to manage situations that encounter similar  challenges in the future, while maintaining appropriate flexibility.", "DOD stated that its cleanup policy is adequate because the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act does not require responsible parties to identify  individuals who may have been exposed to contamination in the  past. We agree that the act does not generally require responsible  parties to identify exposed individuals, but that was not the basis  for our recommendation; moreover, DOD is not limited to meeting  the minimum requirements of federal law. GAO was mandated by  Congress to review the extent to which DOD has a standard  framework for responding to environmental hazards and possible  exposures, among other things, and to make recommendations  for any administrative action \u201cthat the Comptroller General deems   In determining  appropriate in the context of the assessment.\u201dwhether there is a standard framework, we found these gaps in  policy. In light of these gaps and our mandate, we believe it is  appropriate and have recommended that DOD develop guidance  to assist the services and their installations in these situations.

In conducting this analysis, we  catalogued DOD guidance and conducted content analysis to determine  the extent to which the guidance addressed environmental exposures on  military installations. Additionally, we conducted a literature search in  professional journals to identify DOD policies in responding to  environmental exposures. We also examined the database used to track  the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry\u2019s public health  assessment recommendations and DOD\u2019s implementation of those  recommendations.

We then  developed matrices comparing the eligibility requirements and  determination procedures of the various programs to identify what types  of individuals were eligible for the various programs and if there were any  gaps in coverage. We met agency officials from the Departments of  Defense, Veterans Affairs, Labor, and Justice, to obtain further insight  into the administration and eligibility requirements of the various  programs; find out the reasons for any gaps in coverage and what  challenges exist in obtaining benefits or compensation; and determine the  potential adverse effects any such gaps and challenges may have on  individuals exposed to environmental hazards. In addition, we interviewed  officials from each of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Judge Advocate  Offices to obtain information regarding environmental exposure tort  claims and the process for filing claims. To assess the reliability of claims  data obtained from the Department of the Navy and the Department of  Veterans Affairs, we interviewed agency officials regarding the processes  and procedures used to verify accurate data are maintained within the  databases.

Using these criteria, we  identified three programs: The Black Lung Program administered by the  Department of Labor, the Energy Employee Occupational Illness  Compensation Program administered by the Department of Labor, and  the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program administered by the  Department of Justice as the most comparable of environmental  exposure compensation programs. We identified one other environmental  exposure-related compensation program, the Marshall Islands Nuclear  Claims Tribunal, but did not include it our analysis because it does not  provide compensation to U.S. citizens. Although we collected and  reviewed information regarding other compensation programs such as the  Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, the National Vaccine  Injury Compensation Program, and the September 11th Victim  Compensation Fund, we did not include these programs in our analysis  as they do not provide compensation for injuries caused by environmental  hazards. Both the Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and  the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provide  compensation for injuries caused by vaccines and the September 11th  Victim Compensation Fund only provides compensation based on death  or injury caused by terrorist attacks. To identify and assess the features of  these alternative compensation programs, including the benefit and  challenges to the design of features, we reviewed prior GAO reports, met  with GAO experts who have reported on these programs, interviewed  agency officials with the Departments of Labor and Justice, and obtained  and reviewed documentation and claims data on the programs from  agency officials.
