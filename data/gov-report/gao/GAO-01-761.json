It is difficult to assess USDA's progress when it uses unrealistic goals to achieve strategic outcomes and when it uses untimely data that has not been consistently verified. In two areas--strategic human capital management and information security--progress in measuring USDA's performance has been frustrated by the lack of goals and measures for identified issues.

USDA presented one performance report with agency-by-agency coverage and 1 departmental and 24 agency and office performance plans. We reviewed the same outcomes we addressed in our June 2000 review of the agency\u2019s fiscal year 1999 performance report and fiscal year 2001 performance plans to provide a baseline by which to measure the agency\u2019s performance from year-to-year. These selected key outcomes are ensuring an adequate and reasonably priced food supply;  opening, expanding, and maintaining global market opportunities for reducing hunger and ensuring food for the hungry; ensuring a safe and wholesome food supply; and reducing food stamp fraud and error.", "As agreed, using the selected key outcomes for USDA as a framework, we (1) assessed the progress USDA has made in accomplishing these outcomes and the strategies the agency has in place to achieve them; and (2) compared USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan with the agency\u2019s previous year performance report and plan for these outcomes. Additionally, we agreed to analyze how USDA addressed its major management challenges, including the governmentwide high-risk areas of strategic human capital management and information security, that we and USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General identified.

For example, USDA reported that it met its goals for stabilizing peanut and tobacco prices and maintaining the economic viability of peanut and tobacco producers. However, it is difficult to assess USDA\u2019s progress because the department did not provide an overall evaluation of this outcome in its report. According to the performance report, USDA met about 72 percent of the performance goals related to this outcome, less than last year when USDA reported it met over 80 percent of its goals.", "USDA did not select the outcome of providing an adequate and reasonably priced food supply as a key departmental strategic goal in its fiscal year 2002 performance plan, which was issued in June 2001. Some of USDA\u2019s efforts to achieve this outcome are discussed under the top ranked departmental strategic goal of expanding economic and trade opportunities for U.S. agricultural producers and a USDA official stated that this outcome continues to be important for the department. USDA\u2019s discussion of this strategic goal stated that farming and ranching is being transformed by changes in biological and information technology, environmental and conservation concerns, greater threats from pests and diseases spreading across continents, natural disasters and the industrialization of agriculture, and globalization of markets. Under this goal, USDA chose as its first objective to provide an effective safety net and to promote a strong, sustainable U.S. farm economy. USDA explained that if it is to achieve its goal of promoting a strong farm economy that is less dependent of government support, then it must also place a heavy emphasis on helping farmers proactively manage the risks inherent in agriculture and improve farmers income. USDA\u2019s second objective under this strategic goal is to expand export markets\u2014USDA illustrated the opportunity for exports by estimating that 96 percent of American agriculture\u2019s potential customers reside outside the United States. Some of the performance goals presented for this strategic goal are to improve farmers\u2019 incomes, reduce pest and disease outbreaks, and expand international sales opportunities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opening, Expanding, and Maintaining Global Market Opportunities for Agricultural Producers", "paragraphs": ["USDA reported progress in fiscal year 2000 that was similar to its performance last year in that it met some of its goals and indicators for this outcome. USDA stated that it exceeded its targets for two key goals. The gross trade value of markets created, expanded, or retained annually due to market access activities reached $4.35 billion, significantly higher than its $2 billion target. USDA attributed $2 billion of this gain to negotiations on China\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization in fiscal year 2000. Similarly, annual sales, which were reported by U.S. exporters from on-site sales at international trade shows, reached $367 million in fiscal year 2000, compared to USDA\u2019s target of $250 million. Despite these successes, USDA fell short in meeting other goals. The department reported $837 million in U.S. agricultural exports resulted from the implementation of trade agreements under the World Trade Organization, below its target of $2 billion. It also reported that the total value of U.S. agricultural exports supported by its export credit guarantee programs reached $3.1 billion, falling short of its $3.8 billion target.", "USDA uses a questionable methodology for measuring the success of its efforts to expand and maintain global markets for U.S. agricultural products. USDA\u2019s goals and indicators emphasize growth in the U.S. share of the global agricultural market\u2014measured by changes in the dollar value of exports resulting from the implementation of trade agreements, market access enhancements, sales from annual trade shows, and agricultural exports. Yet, the dollar value of exports is subject to powerful external variables that transcend USDA\u2019s authority and ability to affect change in international trade. These variables include exchange rates, government policies, global and national economic conditions, climactic changes, and numerous other factors over which USDA has no control or strategies to address. For example, the decrease in the value and volume of U.S. agricultural exports over the last several years is generally recognized by economists, government officials, and private sector representatives to be the result of deteriorating economic conditions, particularly in the Asian market, over which USDA has no control. USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service has consistently held that U.S. agricultural export performance results more from market forces, which include multiple variables beyond the control of USDA, than from the actions of the U.S. government to expand international market opportunities. Along with other research institutions, it has confirmed that the decline in the value of U.S. agricultural exports from $60 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $50.9 billion in fiscal year 2000 was not attributable to U.S. government trade policies, programs, and activities.  It further observed that USDA programs typically have a limited effect on the dollar value of U.S. exports and market share. We have previously raised questions about the extent of the relationship between USDA\u2019s export policies and programs and increased exports.", "USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 plan is based on the assumption that government policies, programs, and activities have a significant influence on the U.S. share of the global agricultural market. USDA has set a goal to increase exports by $14 billion by fiscal year 2010, or about 22 percent of the global market. This level would return the United States to the same global market share it held in the early 1990s. USDA\u2019s plan is consistent with the assumption that the government\u2019s impact is enhanced when the government works with the private sector to create a facilitative environment to expand sales of agricultural products abroad. USDA\u2019s strategies are to include a long-range integrated marketing plan, which would provide a generalized framework that goes beyond the traditional narrow and short-term programmatic and reactive export oriented approaches. Among its goals are those for (1) developing a long-range marketing plan that enlists USDA\u2019s network of domestic and foreign field offices in an effort to assist U.S. producers in capturing new market opportunities, (2) partnering with private U.S. market development groups to leverage resources aimed at expanding market opportunities abroad for U.S. food and agricultural products, (3) expanding U.S. access to foreign markets through active participation in the World Trade Organization and international trade forums, and (4) continuing to monitor international trade agreements and negotiating new agreements to open overseas markets to U.S. food and agricultural products. However, what is not yet spelled out are the key elements of the integrated marketing plan that will move beyond a generalized concept to the reality of specific actions that will lead to success. Among the elements that could be further addressed would be the organizational structure, the human capital and technological resources, and the operational concepts and methods that will actually enable USDA to meet its global marketing objectives.", "USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricultural Service said that its plans are necessarily generalized at this point in time and should be considered as their first steps in developing an integrated marketing plan.  The Service also said that it would be instituting quarterly reporting to track progress.  In addition, the Service disagreed with our views about its departmental level strategic performance goal to affect U.S. market share, and said that it believed it had selected the ultimate measure of change for international agricultural markets.  However, as previously discussed, we disagree with the selection of this goal because USDA\u2019s activities have little influence on the overall level of international market shares.  Since the GPRA was designed to lead to better insights into the performance of government, USDA will need to adopt a realistic departmental performance goal to meet this purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Food for the Hungry", "paragraphs": ["According to its performance report, USDA reported continued progress toward this outcome and met about 80 percent of its goals.  USDA\u2019s performance exceeded that of fiscal year 1999. For example, the department reported meeting its goals for distributing food nutrition education information to low-income Americans, for increasing the number of schools that meet USDA\u2019s dietary guidelines, and for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of commodity acquisition and distribution to support domestic and international food assistance programs. Some of the goals do not have specific performance targets, so it is not always clear what USDA is actually accomplishing. For example, USDA determined that it is meeting its goal of improving the nutritional status of Americans by such actions as distributing revised dietary guidelines and by promoting media coverage, and observing seminar attendance and web-page usage related to improved nutrition and diet. These measures of performance do not tell us whether USDA\u2019s actions are improving Americans\u2019 nutritional status.", "USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 departmental performance plan contains many general strategies for achieving its goals and measures. For example, one general strategy called for reallocating funds from areas with excess funds to areas with high demand for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. However, some of the general strategies make it difficult to assess USDA\u2019s progress. For example, USDA\u2019s goal to improve food security for children and low-income individuals calls for expanding program access to the needy\u2014and the plan\u2019s strategies for doing this involves \u201ceffectively delivering assistance\u201d and \u201ccontinuing efforts\u201d to ensure that the Food Stamp Program is accessible. Such strategies provide little insight into the specific actions USDA intends to take to achieve its goals. In addition, at the time of our review, USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service, the agency primarily responsible for this outcome, had yet to draft a performance plan for fiscal year 2002. The detailed goals and strategies that the agency level plan would contain are needed to support USDA\u2019s departmental plan. The Acting Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service reported that the agency is assembling a policy team and will issue a draft performance plan after the team is selected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Safe and Wholesome Food Supply", "paragraphs": ["According to its performance report, USDA met or exceeded nearly all of its fiscal year 2000 performance goals for ensuring a safe and wholesome food supply. USDA stated that it met its goals for key areas, such as the percentage of federally inspected meat and poultry slaughter and/or processing plants that had implemented the basic hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) requirements. GAO issued a report on this subject in 1997. USDA also reported that it exceeded its goal for the number of reviews it conducted of foreign meat and poultry food safety programs to ensure their compliance with U.S. safety standards. GAO also issued a report on this subject in 1998. When performance goals were not met, USDA generally provided specific explanations, including describing external factors when applicable, for not achieving the performance goals. For example, USDA reported that it fell short of meeting its goal for deploying 607 computers to state inspection programs because 4 states did not have the funding available to meet their 50-percent share of the computers\u2019 costs. In another example, USDA did not meet its goal to perform 68,000 laboratory tests, falling short of its target by 8,000 tests. USDA did not provide any additional strategies for achieving this goal in the following fiscal year, but it stated that it believed many of the difficulties in meeting the goal have been alleviated by the implementation of the new HACCP system.", "USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan describes several strategies to ensure a safe and wholesome food supply. Such strategies include (1) strengthening laboratory and risk assessment capabilities, (2) implementing a HACCP system for eggs, and (3) strengthening its foreign food safety program efforts. These strategies generally provided a clear description of USDA\u2019s approach for reaching its performance goals. For example, USDA described a strategy that seeks to improve its foreign food safety program review efforts by intensifying reviews of animal feeds, animal identification, and process control systems in countries exporting meat and poultry products to the United States. However, the strategies did not show how USDA plans to address and overcome the fundamental problem it faces in this area\u2014the current food safety system is fragmented with as many as 12 different federal agencies administering over 35 laws regarding food safety. USDA\u2019s plan states that the creation of a single federal food safety agency, as previously recommended by us, extends beyond the legal scope of any one federal agency. We have maintained that until this fragmented system is replaced with a risk-based single food agency, the U.S. food safety system will continue to under perform. USDA pointed out that it does not have the authority to merge with other federal agencies and form a single food safety agency. (See app. I.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Food Stamp Fraud and Error", "paragraphs": ["According to its performance report, USDA met or exceeded many of its fiscal year 2000 goals and made progress toward reducing food stamp fraud and error.  The department, for example, reported exceeding its goal for payment accuracy rate in the delivery of Food Stamp Program benefits and stated that it would support continued improvements by seeking opportunities to simplify program rules\u2014a recommendation made by us in a recent report on reducing payment errors. It also reported collecting about $219 million in overpayments to recipients in fiscal year 2000, which exceeded its original target of collecting about $194 million. In some instances, USDA fell short of meeting its goals for this outcome. For example, USDA did not meet its goal for increasing the percentage of debt owed by retailers who were delinquent on their food stamp payments that was referred to Treasury, and it narrowly missed its goal for the number of retailers sanctioned for not meeting regulatory requirements. In those instances when goals were not met, USDA generally provided specific explanations for not achieving them. For example, the department reported that it did not meet its goal for referring to the Treasury Department cases of food stamp retailers with delinquent debts for collection because it did not submit cases in a timely manner and because of shortcomings in the processing of such referrals.", "USDA did not base its fiscal year 2000 performance report assessments on actual performance data in some cases. For example, for two performance goals\u2014maintain payment accuracy in the delivery of Food Stamp Program benefits and the number of states qualifying for enhanced funding based on high payment accuracy\u2014the department reported progress from fiscal year 1999, and it stated that it would meet its fiscal year 2000 performance goals based on \u201cearly indications\u201d and planned activities. USDA also recognized that actual data would be available 3 months after the performance report was issued, which represents an improvement in data reporting.  Nevertheless, the absence of timely performance data makes it difficult for USDA and others to annually assess performance and determine if changes in strategies are needed.", "USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 departmental performance plan contained several strategies for reducing food stamp fraud and error. USDA stated that it intended to continue to improve the accuracy and consistency of its quality control system and support state efforts to improve food stamp benefit accuracy through technical assistance and by using the best practices for information-sharing. However, the departmental plan did not have specific strategies to demonstrate how USDA would achieve its strategic goals and objectives. In some instances, a discussion of goals, objectives, and strategies directly related to this key outcome were not included. For example, the plan did not include a discussion of how it would deal with retail stores that violate program requirements. A recent Food and Nutrition Service study estimated that stores each year illegally provided cash for benefits (trafficking of benefits) totaling about $660 million. USDA\u2019s departmental plan also did not specifically discuss the Food and Nutrition Service\u2019s targets or measures for reducing trafficking in food stamps, and it does not contain details on the strategies to be used to reduce fraud and error in the Food Stamp Program. The details of these strategies may be included in the Food and Nutrition Service\u2019s agency level performance plan for fiscal year 2002, which has not yet been prepared. Additionally, we have identified efforts to reduce fraud and error in the food stamp program as a major management challenge.

Specifically, the report continued to be an agency-by-agency discussion of its progress without an overview presenting a picture of the department\u2019s overall performance. As discussed previously, the fiscal year 2000 performance report has limitations such as its reliance on narrative measures that track agency actions but that do not provide information about the impacts of the agency\u2019s performance. There are also areas where the data is limited and of questionable reliability\u2014USDA has reported that the vast scale and complexity of its programs present major management challenges in terms of the availability of accurate, credible, and timely performance data. For example: (1) the Foreign Agricultural Service reported that it has limited resources for tracking issues related to the World Trade Organization and barriers in foreign markets leading to errors and limitations in data verification; (2) USDA\u2019s estimates of the populations that are participating in food stamp and other nutrition assistance programs are generally not available in time for preparing its annual performance reports; (3) USDA has relied on data about school food services that is collected informally and without standardized procedures because of opposition to the collection of this data; and (4) USDA reported that its data on agricultural producers\u2019 awareness of risk management alternatives had not been collected consistently from state to state.", "In addition, the fiscal year 2000 performance report varied from providing a detailed discussion of USDA\u2019s data verification and validation efforts, to little or no information about its data accuracy. In many cases, USDA did not provide information on the steps that were taken to verify and validate the data. For example, concerning the performance goal to eradicate a common animal disease, the report simply stated that staff members are responsible for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the data. Also, UDSA did not report on the reliability of the information reported by the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, which relies on the accomplishments and results reported by the universities receiving its research funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Performance Plans for Fiscal Years 2001 and 2002", "paragraphs": ["USDA developed a new departmental plan for fiscal year 2002 that is significantly different than its 2001 plan.

This streamlined presentation consolidated the more than 1,700 agency specific performance goals and measures it presented in 2001 into 5 departmental strategic goals, 56 annual performance goals, and 79 measures for fiscal year 2002. The departmental strategic goals USDA selected were as follows: (1) expand economic and trade opportunities for U.S. agricultural producers; (2) promote health by providing access to safe, affordable, and nutritious food; (3) maintain and enhance the nation\u2019s natural resources and environment; (4) enhance the capacity of all rural residents, communities, and businesses to prosper; and (5) operate an efficient, effective, and discrimination-free organization.

USDA did not consistently provide the detailed strategies that were needed for achieving its departmental goals. Of the 56 annual performance goals in the departmental plan, 33 goals do not contain overall performance targets against which to measure overall progress. For each of these 33 goals, USDA provided various performance indicators, some of which contain performance targets that are representative measures of progress. Also, there were goals that were substantially affected by external factors beyond the scope of USDA\u2019s activities. Examples include the goals to (1) grow the U.S share of the global agriculture market, even though USDA\u2019s programs have a limited effect on the total dollar value of U.S. exports, and (2) enhance the capacity of all rural residents, communities, and businesses to prosper, when the scope of USDA\u2019s rural assistance programs is not designed to provide for a comprehensive federal effort in this area. Moreover, in the Secretary\u2019s message transmitting the fiscal year 2002 plan, the Secretary stated that she had not thoroughly reviewed the new strategic plan, did not have a full leadership team in place, and recognized that more needed to be done. The Secretary also stated that once USDA\u2019s full leadership team is in place, it will be working to conduct a top-to-bottom review of the department\u2019s programs, and will develop new strategic and annual performance goals to carry out this administration\u2019s priorities.", "Additionally, in response to our prior GPRA reviews, USDA included two new sections in its 2002 performance plan\u2014one that includes a discussion of data verification and validation by each performance goal and one that recognizes major management challenges identified by GAO. The discussion of USDA\u2019s data and its sources is a valuable addition to USDA\u2019s plan because it provides a more consistent picture of the data USDA uses, the steps USDA takes to verify its data, and the limitations that need to be taken into account."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USDA\u2019s Efforts to Address its Major Management Challenges Identified by GAO", "paragraphs": ["GAO has identified two governmentwide high-risk management challenges: strategic human capital management and information security. Regarding human capital management, USDA\u2019s plan contains a key outcome\u2014to ensure USDA has a skilled, satisfied workforce and strong prospects for retention of its best employees. The plan recognized emerging skill gaps, high retirement eligibility rates, and the need for staff to shift to a greater use of technology as departmental strategic issues. However, USDA has identified only one human capital performance measure\u2014an employee satisfaction survey\u2014which would not measure the closing of skill gaps, the retention of critical employees, or changes related to the use of new technology. Furthermore, the extent of the discussion of human capital strategies in USDA\u2019s individual agency plans varies. For example, the plans of the Farm Service Agency and the Food Safety and Inspection Service did not discuss human capital issues, and the Food and Nutrition Service has not completed a plan. With respect to information security, we found that the Chief Information Officer\u2019s performance report did not explain its progress in implementing its August 1999 action plan for improving departmentwide information security, or time frames and milestones for doing so. In addition, USDA\u2019s performance plan did not have departmental goals and measures related to this important area.

We continue to believe that the OIG should play a role in facilitating the major management challenge section of the departmental performance plan, and have modified our recommendation to directly call for the OIG to participate in the development of this section of USDA\u2019s plan.", "The Foreign Agricultural Service disagreed with our recommendation to better match the department\u2019s goals and outcomes with its capabilities for expanding global market opportunities.  It stated that the measure it is using\u2014global market share\u2014is the ultimate performance measure for describing overall changes in international markets and that the Congress is interested in U.S. international market share.  However, in discussing this concern, the Service itself acknowledged that market forces are the principal cause of changes in exports rather than its activities.  Therefore, we continue to believe that it would be appropriate to use more realistic goals for performance that are more closely related to the outcomes that USDA activities can achieve.  The Service\u2019s agency level performance plan contains some performance indicators that are more limited and better reflect the government\u2019s role in changing export values and market share.", "The Foreign Agricultural Service also expressed concern that if it were to make detailed information on its strategies available to the public, it could be used by foreign competitors to offset U.S. efforts.  Because of the limited federal role in affecting international market share, we believe that more specific information on U.S. role and activities would not compromise U.S. efforts.", "USDA officials stated that that they had made progress in improving information security and strategic human capital management. Specifically, USDA officials said that progress had been made in implementing their August 1999 action plan to strengthen information security.  However, USDA officials recognized that this information, along with information security goals and measures, was generally not included in the department\u2019s performance plan or report and that the process of measuring USDA\u2019s performance would be improved by including it. Also, concerning strategic human capital management, USDA\u2019s performance report and plan did not summarize key actions that USDA officials said have been taken on workforce planning, recruitment, and the retention of employees.  USDA will have the opportunity to summarize its progress in these areas in its future performance reports and plans.", "Department officials also provided technical clarifications, which we made as appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As agreed, our evaluation was generally based on a review of the fiscal year 2000 performance report and the fiscal year 2002 performance plan and the requirements of GPRA, the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000, guidance to agencies from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for developing performance plans and reports (OMB Circular A-11, Part 2), previous reports and evaluations by us and others, our knowledge of USDA\u2019s operations and programs, GAO identification of best practices concerning performance planning and reporting, and our observations on USDA\u2019s other GPRA-related efforts. We also discussed our review with agency officials in the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and with the USDA Office of Inspector General. The agency outcomes that were used as the basis for our review were identified by the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee as important mission areas for the agency and generally reflect the outcomes for key USDA programs or activities. The major management challenges confronting USDA, including the governmentwide high-risk areas of strategic human capital management and information security, were identified by us in our January 2001 performance and accountability series and high-risk update or were identified by USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General in December 2000. We did not independently verify the information contained in the performance report and plan, although we did draw from our other work in assessing the validity, reliability, and timeliness of USDA\u2019s performance data. We conducted our review from April 2001 through August 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after the date of this letter. At that time, we will send copies to appropriate congressional committees; the Secretary of Agriculture; and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

USDA has one performance report and a departmentwide plan with supporting plans from the department\u2019s individual agencies. The first column lists the challenges identified by our office and USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General. The second column discusses what progress, as discussed in its fiscal year 2000 performance report, USDA made in resolving its challenges. The third column discusses the extent to which USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plan includes performance goals and measures to address the challenges that we and the USDA\u2019s OIG identified. While USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance report addressed progress in resolving some of the 17 management challenges, the department did not have goals for the following: strategic human capital management, information security, Forest Service land exchange program, grant agreement administration, grant competitiveness, research funding accountability, and Rural Business Cooperative Service and therefore did not discuss progress in resolving these challenges. USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2002 performance plans provided some goals and measures or strategies for all but five of its management challenges. USDA did not have goals for the management challenges involving the Forest Service land exchange program, grant agreement administration, grant competitiveness, research funding accountability, and Rural Business Cooperative Services. For the remaining 12 major management challenges, its performance plan had (1) goals and measures that were directly related to 8 of the challenges, (2) goals and measures that were indirectly applicable to 3 of the challenges, or (3) had no goals and measures related to 1 of the challenges, but discussed strategies to address it.  In commenting on a draft of this report, USDA stated that it made additional progress in resolving its management challenges that had not been reflected in its fiscal year 2000 performance report and fiscal year 2002 performance plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Erin Barlow, Andrea Brown, Jacqueline Cook, Thomas Cook, Charles Cotton, Angela Davis, Andrew Finkel, Judy Hoovler, Erin Lansburgh, Carla Lewis, Sue Naiberk, Stephen Schwartz, Richard Shargots, Mark Shaw, Ray Smith, Alana Stanfield, Phillip Thomas, and Ronnie Wood."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
