Both Houses of Congress have taken steps to increase disclosure requirements. The President has also called for earmark reform. In January 2007, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed agencies to collect and submit data to it on fiscal year 2005 earmarks in appropriations bills and certain authorization bills. GAO collected and analyzed information on four agencies' processes (i.e., the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Civil Works programs).

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to levy taxes, to finance government operations through appropriations, and to prescribe the conditions governing the use of those appropriations. This power is referred to generally as the congressional \"power of the purse\" and derives from various provisions of the Constitution. Government agencies may not draw money out of the Treasury to fund operations unless Congress has appropriated the money. At its most basic level, this means that it is up to Congress to decide whether to provide funds for a particular program or activity and to fix the level of that funding. It is also well established that Congress can, within constitutional limits, determine the terms and conditions under which an appropriation may be used. In this manner, Congress may use its appropriation power to accomplish policy objectives and to establish priorities among federal programs. Our review of four federal agencies' processes for responding to written directives from Congress regarding the use of funds found that each of the selected agencies responds to congressional directives in a manner consistent with the nature of its programs and operations and in response to the desires of its own authorizing and appropriations committees in Congress. Agencies differ in terms of the specific processes followed to respond to congressional directives, and they have also adopted their own approaches for responding to the 2007 request for data on earmarks from OMB.

In fact,  CRS data show increases in the number and amount for individual  appropriation bills during that period.", "Any discussion of trends, however, is complicated by the fact that  different definitions of the term earmarks exist and that the amounts  reported vary depending on the definition used. Although CRS has totaled  the number and amount of earmarked spending for each of the regular  annual spending bills enacted since fiscal year 1994, CRS has cautioned  that the data presented for the 13 appropriations cannot be combined into  a governmentwide total because of the different definitions and  methodologies that were used for each bill.

In this  sense, the difference between a lump-sum appropriation and a line-item  appropriation is a relative concept hinging on the specificity of the  appropriation. Also, unlike an earmark, a line item is typically separate  from the larger appropriation. As noted above, in earlier times when the  federal government was much smaller and federal programs were (or at  least seemed) less complicated, line-item appropriations were more  common.

In a 1975  decision, we pointed out that agencies ignore such expressions of intent at  the peril of strained relations with committees and that agencies have a  practical obligation to abide by such expressions. This obligation,  however, must be understood to fall short of a legal requirement giving  rise to a legal infraction where there is a failure to carry out that  obligation. In that decision, we pointed out that Congress has recognized  that it is desirable to maintain executive flexibility to shift funds within a  particular lump-sum appropriation account so that agencies can make  necessary adjustments for unforeseen developments, changing  requirements, and legislation enacted subsequent to appropriations. This  is not to say that Congress does not expect that funds will be spent in  accordance with budget estimates or in accordance with restrictions or  directions detailed in committee reports. However, in order to preserve  spending flexibility, it may choose not to impose these particular  restrictions as a matter of law, but rather to leave it to the agencies to  \u201ckeep faith\u201d with Congress. \u201cCongress may always circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting  restrictions in the operative statutes (though not . . . just in the legislative history).

We also spoke with  officials from some of the site offices that help the program offices  implement and track congressional directives.", "At DOT, we spoke with officials from the Office of the Secretary, FHWA,  and FTA. Because implementation is handled at the division and state  levels, we also interviewed officials from FHWA division offices and state  departments of transportation in Alaska, Florida, and Maine. We selected  the division offices and states to interview based on the number of  congressional directives in SAFETEA-LU as well as the level of oversight  and involvement of those division offices and states in the administration  of congressional directives.", "At the Corps, we spoke with the Chief of the Programs Integration  Division, who is responsible for the Civil Works budget, and other officials  responsible for identifying earmarks for OMB and congressional directives  for the Corps\u2019 routine management process.", "To identify the selected agencies\u2019 processes for tracking, implementing,  and reporting on congressional directives, we reviewed agency documents  related to available data or databases used for tracking and reporting on  congressional directives. We also reviewed agency guidance or written  protocols to demonstrate actions taken to implement congressional  directives. In addition, we also interviewed the relevant agency officials  from the units of the selected agencies we previously discussed.", "To obtain their views on the trends and impact of congressional directives  on agency programs, we spoke with knowledgeable agency officials from  the selected agencies using similar questions. Because we assessed  agencies\u2019 data on congressional directives to be insufficiently reliable for  the purposes of comparing across agencies and showing trends over time,  we could not analyze trend data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency-Specific Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
