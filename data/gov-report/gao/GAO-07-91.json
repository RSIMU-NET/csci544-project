To study this trend, GAO reviewed the nature and causes of the restatements made by certain CFO Act agencies in fiscal year 2004 to their fiscal year 2003 financial statements. Eleven CFO Act agencies had restatements for fiscal year 2003. Nine of those 11 received unqualified opinions on their originally issued fiscal year 2003 financial statements.

GAO found that all nine agencies could have greatly enhanced the adequacy, effectiveness, and timeliness of their restatement disclosures to users. Similar transparency issues existed with the associated audit reports regarding disclosure of all the essential information that would clearly explain the restatements. GAO highlighted the following issues as among the more prevalent issues to be addressed: 1) columns of the agencies' restated financial statements were not labeled as \"Restated\"; 2) agencies' restatement footnote disclosures lacked clarity or sufficient detail regarding the nature of the restatements and the effect on balances reported in previously issued financial statements; 3) restatement information was not sufficiently disclosed in the agencies' Management Discussion and Analysis; 4) audit reports did not disclose that the respective agencies had restated certain of their fiscal year 2003 financial statements; 5) audit reports did not provide a statement that the previously issued audit report was withdrawn and replaced by the opinion on the restated financial statements; and 6) material misstatements and potential material misstatements were not timely communicated by agencies to either their auditors or to the users of the financial statements. The primary contributing factor for the restatement disclosure issues that GAO identified was insufficient guidance available at the time to both the agencies' management and their respective auditors for disclosure of the restatements and the timeliness of such disclosures. GAO believes that information regarding restatements should be disclosed in a transparent and timely manner consistent with the qualitative characteristics of information in financial reports described in Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts (SFFAC) No. 1. In GAO's view, more detailed accounting and auditing guidance on how to satisfy the financial reporting characteristics as outlined in SFFAC No. 1 as it relates to the disclosure of restatements would have been helpful. OMB revised Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements, which provides additional guidance to federal agencies' management regarding disclosure of restatements to previously issued financial statements. Revisions made to OMB Circular No. A-136 address many of GAO's concerns regarding the agencies' disclosure of restatements. In addition, the proposed 2006 revision of generally accepted government auditing standards now includes a section on reporting on restatement of previously issued financial statements. In addition, on August 23, 2006, OMB issued Bulletin No. 06-03, which also provides some information regarding reporting on restatements. However, GAO believes that OMB needs to timely provide additional, though complementary, restatement guidance to both the agencies' management and their respective auditors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We continue to have concerns about restatements to federal agencies\u2019  previously issued financial statements. During fiscal year 2005, at least 7 of  the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies restated certain of their  fiscal year 2004 financial statements to correct misstatements. To study  this trend, we reviewed the nature and causes of the restatements made by  certain CFO Act agencies in fiscal year 2004 to their fiscal year 2003  financial statements. Our audit of the consolidated financial statements of  the U.S. government (CFS) for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 showed that 11  CFO Act agencies had restated one or more of their fiscal year 2003  financial statements to correct misstatements. Nine of the 11 agencies had  received an unqualified audit opinion on their originally issued financial  statements. Because of the significant increase in the number of  restatements identified during our fiscal year 2004 audit, we initiated a  review of the nature and causes of these 9 federal agencies\u2019 restatements.", "Accounting principles attribute errors in recognition, measurement,  presentation, or disclosure in previously issued financial statements to   (1) mathematical mistakes, (2) mistakes in the application of generally  accepted accounting principles (GAAP), or (3) oversight or misuse of facts  when the financial statements were prepared. Restatements occur when  an entity, either voluntarily or prompted by its auditors or regulators,  revises previously issued financial statements. Accounting standards state  that financial statements should only be restated for the correction of  errors that would have caused any statements to be materially misstated.  Therefore, restatements should not occur if misstatements in previously  issued financial statements are not material. Such standards further state  that the restated financial statements should disclose the nature of the  misstatement and effect of its correction on relevant balances. The Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued guidance to federal  agencies\u2019 management regarding disclosure of restatements to previously  issued financial statements. Generally accepted government auditing  standards (GAGAS) discuss the auditors\u2019 responsibilities when they  become aware of information affecting previously issued financial  statements, including corrections of material misstatements. GAGAS  stress the importance of timely communication of restatements to users  relying or likely to rely on the previously issued financial statements. The  proposed 2006 revision of GAGAS includes an additional section on  reporting on restatement of previously issued financial statements. In  addition, on August 23, 2006, OMB issued Bulletin No. 06-03, which also  provides some information regarding reporting on restatements.", "We believe that federal agencies\u2019 financial statements and the related audit  reports should provide users with at least a basic understanding of why a  restatement was necessary and the effect of the restatement on the  agencies\u2019 previously issued financial statements and related audit reports.  In keeping with full transparency, when restatements occur, restated  financial statements should clearly communicate that the financial  statements previously issued by management and the opinion thereon  should no longer be relied on and instead the restated financial statements  and the related auditor\u2019s opinion should be used. In addition, timely  communication of restatements is critical to prevent users of federal  agencies\u2019 financial statements and the related audit reports from  inadvertently relying on inaccurate information.", "Restatements are not unique to the federal government. Over the past  several years, we have seen a number of corporate scandals as well as  restatements by public companies. In response, the Congress enacted the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 to strengthen corporate governance and  improve transparency and accountability to help ensure the accuracy and  integrity of the financial reporting system in the private sector to protect  investors. In addition, in May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards  Board\u2019s (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No.  154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, was issued. FAS   No. 154 requires nongovernmental entities to disclose that their previously  issued financial statements have been restated, a description of the nature  of the error, the effect of the correction on each financial statement line  item, and the cumulative effect of change in the statement of financial  position. Further, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now  requires companies to disclose restatements in the Form 8-K. Specifically,  under the Form 8-K requirements, if a company is advised by its auditor  that disclosure should be made to prevent future reliance on a previously  issued audit report or completed interim review related to previously  issued financial statements, the company should disclose (1) the date on  which it was so advised or notified, (2) the financial statements that  should no longer be relied upon, (3) a brief description of the information  provided by the auditor, and (4) a statement of whether the audit  committee or the board of directors discussed with the auditor the matters  disclosed in the filing.", "America\u2019s taxpayers deserve no less in terms of transparency,  accountability, disclosure, and notification from federal agencies. Between  September 2005 and January 2006, we issued reports covering five of the  nine CFO Act agencies that had received unqualified audit opinions on, but  subsequently restated, their originally issued fiscal year 2003 financial  statements. We reported that these restatements generally resulted from  (1) lack of effective internal controls over the processing and reporting of  certain transactions and (2) failure of the auditors to design and/or  perform adequate audit procedures to detect such misstatements. During  our fieldwork, December 2004 through October 2005, our review of these  nine agencies also focused on the following two key areas: (1) the extent  of transparency exhibited in disclosing the nature and cause of the  misstatement and its impact on the financial statements and the reissued  or updated audit report and (2) the timing of communicating the material  misstatement to users of the financial statements.

While restatements to previously issued financial  statements can happen and may not be surprising given weaknesses in the  financial reporting environment at many federal agencies, inherently,  restatements raise questions about the reliability of other information in  previously issued financial statements. In addition, frequent restatements  to correct misstatements can undermine public trust and confidence in  both the entity and all responsible parties. Adequate transparency and  timely notification of restatements are essential to help preclude users of  agencies\u2019 financial statements and the related audit reports from  inadvertently relying on inaccurate information and allow them to make  more informed and relevant decisions.", "According to SFFAC No. 1, the primary intended users of federal agencies\u2019  financial reports are citizens, the Congress, federal executives, and federal  program managers. Each of these groups may use federal agencies\u2019  financial statements to satisfy their specific needs. Citizens are interested  in many aspects of the federal government, especially those federal  programs that affect their well-being. The Congress uses the agencies\u2019  financial statements to monitor and evaluate the efficiency and  effectiveness of federal programs. Federal executives, such as central  agency officials at OMB and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury),  use the federal agencies\u2019 financial statements to oversee government  spending.

Treasury assists the President in managing the finances of the  federal government and prepares the CFS, which is based on audited  financial statements prepared by federal agencies. GAO uses the agencies\u2019  financial statements and the work of their respective auditors during its  annual audit of the CFS.

Because the OIGs typically contracted with various  independent public accountants (IPA) to audit the agencies\u2019 financial  statements, we expanded our contacts to include such IPAs. Our work was  not designed to and we did not test the accuracy or appropriateness of the  restatements. In addition, our review did not include restatements  reported in fiscal year 2005 financial statements since such financial  statements were issued during November 2005, one month after the  completion of our fieldwork. With respect to the two key areas, we  reviewed the nine agencies\u2019 fiscal years 2004 and 2003 comparative  financial statements and the related audit reports to determine, among  other things, whether the appropriate columns of the agencies\u2019 restated financial statements were  labeled \u201cRestated\u201d; fiscal year 2003 ending balance agreed with the fiscal year 2004  beginning balance on the agencies\u2019 Statement of Changes in Net  Position, if restated; agencies\u2019 restatement footnotes were properly labeled; agencies asserted in their MD&A that they had received a consecutive  number of clean audit opinions, and if so, whether they disclosed that  certain of their previously issued financial statements were  subsequently restated to correct for a material misstatement; audit reports referred the reader to the agencies\u2019 restatement footnote; agencies timely notified their auditors and users of their financial  statements of the material misstatement and plans for correcting the  misstatement in the financial statements; and auditors were aware of a material misstatement to previously issued  financial statements prior to the beginning of the fourth quarter of the  following fiscal year and whether the amount and effect were known,  and if so, did the auditors advise the agencies\u2019 management to reissue  the financial statements.", "For this capping report, which is based on our review of the nine federal  agencies that reported restatements in fiscal year 2004 financial  statements, we considered certain accounting and auditing standards that  were applicable to fiscal year 2004 federal financial reporting as well as  accounting standards that were issued subsequent to fiscal year 2004.

The bulletin did not provide  guidance for what the auditor should communicate to management for  when and how an actual or potential restatement should be disclosed to  the users of the agency\u2019s financial statements. With respect to the auditor\u2019s  responsibilities for timely communication, AU section 561 states that  consideration should be given to, among other things, the \u201ctime elapsed\u201d  since the erroneous financial statements were issued. According to AU  section 561, when the auditor has concluded that action should be taken to  prevent future reliance on the audit report, the auditor should advise the  auditee to make appropriate disclosure of the newly discovered facts and  their impact on the financial statements to persons who are known to be  currently relying or who are likely to rely on the financial statements and  the related auditor\u2019s report. AU section 561 also states that if an auditor  determines that issuance of financial statements accompanied by the audit  report for a subsequent period is \u201cimminent,\u201d appropriate disclosures can  be made in such statements rather than by separately issuing the restated  financial statements. However, guidance available during fiscal year 2004,  AU section 561 and OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, did not define \u201ctime elapsed\u201d  or \u201cimminent.\u201d In addition, existing standards and guidance do not provide  sufficient explicit or detailed guidance to management and auditors  regarding ensuring the timely disclosure of material misstatements  affecting previously issued financial statements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Issues Regarding Timeliness of Management\u2019s Communication of Misstatements to Auditors and Users", "paragraphs": ["In our view, none of the agencies timely communicated that a potential  material misstatement had been identified to either their auditor or to the  users of the financial statements. Agency management is responsible for  reporting key information in a timely manner, including timely notification  of known material or potential material misstatements in previously issued  financial statements.", "During fiscal year 2004, OMB Bulletin No. 01-02 called for communication  between the agencies\u2019 management and their auditors, but it did not  provide details for disclosing restatements to users of agency financial  statements. In addition, as noted above, neither OMB Bulletin No. 01-09  nor SFFAS No. 21 provided specific guidance on the timely investigation  and reporting of a material misstatement or potential material  misstatement in a previously issued financial statement following its  discovery. Our review of the nine CFO Act agencies that restated certain  of their fiscal year 2003 financial statements found that three of these  agencies identified potential material misstatements prior to the beginning  of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, and in our view, did not timely  communicate that a potential misstatement had been identified either to  their auditors or to the users of their financial statements. The remaining  six agencies identified potential material misstatements after the third  quarter of fiscal year 2004 but before that year\u2019s comparative financial  statements were issued. These six agencies, in our view, also did not  timely communicate the potential material misstatements to the users of  their financial statements since they did not notify the users of the  potential material misstatement prior to the issuance of the restated fiscal  year 2003 financial statements during fiscal year 2004.", "We believe that the current version of OMB Circular No. A-136, if properly  implemented, should address many of our concerns regarding agencies\u2019  timely communication of restatements. For example, according to this  version of OMB Circular No. A-136, \u201cmanagement shall assume  responsibility for any false or misleading information in the financial  statements, or omissions that render information made in the financial  statements misleading. As such, as soon as possible after errors are  detected, management shall notify their auditors and inform their primary  users of their financial statements of the error and plans for correcting it  in the financial statements \u2026 it is imperative that management work with  their auditor as soon as the error is detected to assist the auditor in any  actions that need to be taken.\u201d", "These are important advances. We do, though, have some remaining  concerns regarding the adequacy of guidance to agencies relating to the  timely communication of material misstatements in previously issued  financial statements. Specifically, we believe it is important for  subsequently discovered material misstatements and potential material  misstatements be disclosed to OMB in the agencies\u2019 quarterly financial  statements for the reporting period in which the misstatements were  discovered. In our view, agencies need to report on the misstatement  within a reasonable time period following the discovery of the  misstatement. In particular, if the specific amount of a material  misstatement and the related effect of such on the previously issued  financial statements are known and the issuance of the subsequent period  audited financial statements is not imminent, then we believe it is  important that the agencies promptly (1) reissue the most recently issued  fiscal year financial statements before issuing the current year\u2019s financial  statements and (2) communicate the reissuance (a) in writing to the  Congress, OMB, Treasury, and GAO; and (b) to the public on the Internet  pages where the agencies\u2019 audited financial statements that were affected  by the material misstatements were published. If a material misstatement  is identified when issuance of the subsequent period audited financial  statements is imminent, we believe it is important that the agencies   (1) issue restated financial statements as part of the current year\u2019s  comparative financial statements and (2) communicate the restatement   (a) in writing to the Congress, OMB, Treasury, and GAO; and (b) to the  public on the same Internet page where the agencies\u2019 audited financial  statements that were affected by the material misstatements were  published.", "Further, in our view, if at any time an agency identifies a material  misstatement or potential material misstatement and the effects of it on  the financial statements are not known or cannot be determined without a  prolonged investigation, the agencies should timely notify persons that are  known to be relying or who are likely to rely on the previously issued  financial statements and the related audit report that the (1) previously  issued financial statements will or may be restated and therefore, (2) the  related audit report is no longer reliable. It is important that the agencies  include the Congress, OMB, Treasury, and GAO in any such notification  and notify the public by posting such notification on the same Internet  pages where the agencies\u2019 previously issued financial statements that were  affected by the material or potential material misstatement were  published.", "An example of how to appropriately convey this type of information is  State\u2019s communication and disclosure of a potential material misstatement  in its fiscal year 2004 financial statements. Specifically, State identified a  potential material misstatement during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  2005 and, in our view, went beyond the then existing guidance and  appropriately disclosed the problem. Guidance available to agency  management at that time, SFFAS No. 21 and OMB Bulletin No. 01-09, did  not provide explicit guidance for timely communication of a restatement  to users of financial statements. State also complied with the revised OMB  Circular No. A-136, issued August 23, 2005, even though it was not  effective until the end of fiscal year 2005. Specifically, during September  2005, State\u2019s CFO timely notified external parties, including GAO, to which  State\u2019s fiscal year 2004 comparative financial statements were directly  distributed, not to rely on its fiscal year 2004 comparative financial  statements and the related audit report. The notification also stated that  State was committed to resolving this issue as quickly as possible. State  also notified the public of this issue in the form of a cautionary note on the  same Internet pages where the agency\u2019s audited financial statements that  were affected by the material misstatement were published. State\u2019s  cautionary note included a statement that such actions were necessary  because State recently became aware of a potential material misstatement  affecting the previously issued financial statements and the related audit  report. State noted that due to the need for a complete and thorough  analysis, the complexity of the matters involved, and the accelerated  financial reporting requirements, State was unable to satisfy the  independent auditors by November 15 as to the amount of the potential  material misstatement. As a result, the independent auditors issued a  qualified opinion on the fiscal year 2005 and 2004 financial statements.  State\u2019s CFO also sent a subsequent letter to GAO on December 23, 2005, to  inform us that the independent auditors had satisfied themselves about the  amounts presented and the auditor updated its opinion on the fiscal year  2005 and 2004 financial statements from a qualified to an unqualified  opinion. State was fully transparent in its reports of the restatement in all  respects and showed how disclosing the restatement should be done. As  such, in our view, State\u2019s actions serve as a model for full and timely  notification of a potential material misstatement found in a previously  issued financial statement when identified after the third quarter of the  current fiscal year and before the current year\u2019s comparative financial  statements are issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues Regarding Timeliness of Certain Auditors\u2019 Restatement Disclosures", "paragraphs": ["Auditors play a critical role in helping to ensure that users of financial  statements are timely notified of material misstatements affecting  previously issued financial statements and restatement of such financial  statements.", "AU section 561, guidance available during fiscal year 2004, requires that  auditors consider the \u201ctime elapsed\u201d since the financial statements were  issued when a material misstatement is discovered. According to AU  section 561, if an auditor determines that issuance of financial statements  accompanied by the audit report for a subsequent period is \u201cimminent,\u201d  appropriate disclosures can be made in such statements rather than in  reissued statements. However, neither \u201ctime elapsed\u201d nor \u201cimminent\u201d is  defined in AU section 561. We found that at least one of the auditors of the  three agencies that had discovered misstatements prior to the fourth  quarter of the current fiscal year did not advise its respective agency to  make such a disclosure because (1) in May 2004 the auditor did not think  that there were any users who would still be relying on the fiscal year 2003  financial statements and the related audit report and (2) the auditor  considered issuance of the fiscal years 2004 and 2003 comparative  financial statements to be imminent. We have concerns that, without  notification, anyone who may have been relying on the fiscal year 2003  financial statements would not have known for more than 5 months that  the agency\u2019s originally issued financial statements, which received an  unqualified opinion, were materially misstated and should not be relied on.", "In our view, existing auditing standards and guidance, including OMB  Bulletin No. 06-03, while conveying the need for appropriate notifications,  do not provide sufficient explicit or detailed guidance to auditors  regarding ensuring the timely disclosure of material misstatements  affecting previously issued financial statements. Our position is that when  a material misstatement or potential material misstatement affecting  previously issued financial statements and the related audit report is  identified, the auditor has a responsibility to advise the agency\u2019s  management to timely notify users such as the Congress, OMB, Treasury,  and GAO in writing as well as the public and clearly disclose the situation  to them. If the agency\u2019s management does not timely provide adequate  disclosure to the relevant users, the auditor has the responsibility to do so.", "We believe that it is also important that the auditor advise the agency\u2019s  management of its responsibility to determine the specific amount of the  material misstatement or potential material misstatement and the related  effects of such on the previously issued financial statements as soon as  reasonably possible.

If the agency\u2019s management does not  reissue the financial statements or communicate the reissuance as  required, our position is that the auditor has the responsibility to notify the  Congress, OMB, Treasury, and GAO in writing as well as any other users  known to be relying on the previously issued financial statements. If the  specific amount of the material misstatement and the related effects of  such on a previously issued financial statement are known and issuance of  the subsequent period audited financial statements is imminent, it is  important that the auditor advise the agency\u2019s management to issue  restated financial statements as part of the current year comparative  financial statements and disclose restatements in the audit report. If the  specific amount of the misstatement and the related effect of such on a  previously issued financial statement remain unknown when the current  year financial statements are issued, it is necessary that the auditor  disclose such information when issuing the audit report and modify or  disclaim the opinion on the previously issued financial statements as  appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The issues we identified regarding the transparency and timeliness of  restatement disclosures primarily resulted from insufficient guidance  available during fiscal year 2004 to both the agencies\u2019 management and  their respective auditors for disclosure of the restatements and the  timeliness of such disclosures.
