GAO was asked to examine issues related to schools' recruitment of veterans. This report examines (1) how selected schools recruit veterans, (2) veterans' school search and recruiting experiences, and (3) VA's actions to help veterans make informed decisions and to identify inappropriate recruiting practices.", "For the first question, GAO interviewed officials from 9 schools and reviewed websites of 30 additional schools; both groups were selected for variation in sector (public, nonprofit, and for-profit) and other criteria. For the second question, GAO surveyed a nationally representative group of student veterans, producing results generalizable to the student veteran population. For the third question, GAO reviewed relevant federal requirements and agency documents and interviewed agency officials. GAO also spoke with veteran and higher education organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Selected schools used various practices, from mass advertising to individual outreach, to recruit and inform prospective student veterans. Eight of nine schools GAO interviewed reported advertising in print or online media dedicated to military audiences. Most of the nine schools contacted veterans directly by phone or email, sometimes with military-focused recruiters, to provide information on benefits or services or to highlight the school as \u201cmilitary-friendly.\u201d Further, 29 of the 30 school websites GAO reviewed included a section specifically for veterans, some of which were featured prominently on the home page.", "Many surveyed veterans reported that school communication was important in selecting a school; however, nearly 23 percent (about 15,200 veterans when generalized nationally) reported excessive contacts from schools and an estimated 10 percent (about 6,900 veterans nationwide) said they felt pressure to enroll. In addition, while most surveyed veterans reported receiving generally accurate information from their school, about 23 percent (about 16,500 veterans nationwide) reported receiving some information they viewed as inaccurate, such as estimated student loan debt. Many veterans also wanted more information from their schools, such as on veteran support services (see figure below). Inaccurate or incomplete information can lead veterans to choose schools that do not meet their needs and exhaust their benefits before achieving their goals. Veteran and higher education groups said that greater access to independent and objective advice would help veterans with their education choices.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has taken steps to inform and protect student veterans, but some efforts have been insufficient. VA is developing tools to help veterans understand their education benefits and compare information on schools. VA has also taken some action to improve veterans' awareness of its free education counseling services, as required by law, but its efforts to expand awareness among prospective students and ease the application process have been limited. At the same time, almost half of surveyed veterans were not aware of VA's counseling when considering schools. To help identify misleading or aggressive recruiting, VA has launched a new complaint system, created a risk-based approach to oversee schools, and taken other steps. While VA has made some progress implementing federally required initiatives, its project planning has lacked realistic timelines and goals\u2014in contrast to sound planning practices. As a result, Congress and others lack information on VA's progress implementing planned initiatives to protect and inform student veterans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA improve outreach and accessibility of its educational counseling services and more consistently develop and communicate realistic timelines as it implements initiatives based on federal requirements.

Since the Post- 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill)  went into effect, the number of veterans receiving VA education benefits  has almost doubled\u2014to over 1 million in fiscal year 2013\u2014and the use of  these benefits will continue to grow as the number of post-9/11 veterans  is expected to increase to more than 5 million by 2020. Because of these  education benefits, schools may be particularly interested in enrolling  veterans. For-profit schools may have added incentive to enroll veterans  because of requirements related to other federal student aid programs  administered by the Department of Education (Education). Recent  congressional hearings and press accounts have included anecdotal  reports of veterans experiencing aggressive recruiting practices or being  misled by school recruiters. Additionally, some state attorneys general  have begun investigations or filed lawsuits against schools for deceptive  marketing and other consumer fraud concerns regarding veterans or  other students, while the Federal Trade Commission recently issued a  notice advising veterans about how to avoid schools that may pressure  them to enroll in a program that does not meet their educational needs.", "Reports of misleading and aggressive school recruiting practices, as well  as concerns about whether veterans have access to clear and accurate  information about schools, have resulted in recent federal actions.  Specifically, the President issued Executive Order 13607, which calls on  VA and other agencies to strengthen enforcement mechanisms to ensure  that schools are not engaged in deceptive or aggressive recruiting  practices toward veteran and military students. In addition, legislation  enacted in January 2013 (Public Law 112-249) required VA to develop a  comprehensive policy to improve outreach and transparency to veterans  and provide information to help veterans make informed education  choices.", "Given the large and growing federal investment in veterans\u2019 education  benefits, GAO was asked to examine issues related to schools\u2019  recruitment of veterans. This report provides information on the following  questions:  1.  How do selected schools recruit veterans?  2.  What are the school search and recruiting experiences of student  veterans?  3.  What actions has VA taken to help veterans make informed education  decisions and to identify inappropriate school recruiting?", "To address the first question, we conducted phone interviews with  officials from nine schools (three schools in each sector\u2014public, for-profit,  and nonprofit) to gather information on the extent and ways they reach  out to veterans and military servicemembers. We also reviewed the  websites of an additional 30 schools (10 per sector) to review basic  information on how schools\u2019 websites are used to engage interested  students and to provide information aimed at prospective veteran or  military students. We selected the schools for our interviews and website  analysis for variation in sector, VA funding levels, and level of degrees  offered (e.g., bachelor\u2019s vs. associate\u2019s), among other criteria. All of our  selected schools received at least $2 million in total Post-9/11 GI Bill  payments from fiscal years 2010 through 2011, the most recent data  available when we selected our schools. The information gathered from  our school interviews and website review is not generalizable to all  schools, but is useful in illustrating the range of recruiting practices used  by selected schools.", "To address the second question, we administered a survey to a nationally  representative sample of 900 recently enrolled student veterans (300 per  sector) to ask about their recruiting experiences and information they  received from their current school. A total of 254 students responded to  the survey\u2014an unweighted response rate of 28 percent. We conducted a  nonresponse bias analysis with available administrative data from the  sample population to determine whether any characteristics were  correlated with the propensity to respond. We determined that our survey  respondents were more likely to be older than the general population of  veterans using VA education benefits. We therefore adjusted the sample  weights so that our survey responses reflect the age distribution in the  population. All survey results presented in the body of this report are  generalizable to the population of student veterans receiving Post-9/11 GI  Bill benefits for the first time in 2012. Due to an insufficient response rate,  we were not able to report results by sector. A detailed description of our  sampling methodology can be found in appendix I. The survey instrument  and a tabulation of the results can be found in appendix II.", "To address the third question, we reviewed pertinent federal laws and  requirements, including Executive Order 13607 and provisions in Public  Law 112-249. We interviewed VA officials and reviewed agency  documents to examine VA\u2019s progress in implementing relevant portions of  the executive order and the public law. We also interviewed officials and  obtained documents from Education to better understand any relevant  interagency work with VA. In addition, we asked students we surveyed  and school officials we interviewed about the content and usefulness of  relevant information and assistance provided by VA. Lastly, we  interviewed officials from several veterans service organizations and  higher education organizations to obtain their perspectives on key issues.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2013 through May  2014, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Additionally  veterans may use benefits for a variety of schools and degree programs,  including 4-year colleges and universities that typically offer bachelor\u2019s  degrees or higher, community colleges that typically offer associates  degrees, and vocational and technical schools that offer certificates, but  typically not degrees. Lastly, students may participate in a program on a  physical school campus, through online programs, or both. To receive  education benefits through the Post-9/11 GI Bill, students submit  applications to VA, schools certify students\u2019 enrollment in classes, and VA  processes claims and payments.

For example, officials at a nonprofit school said that in  recent years it has placed a higher priority on adult students and online  learning, in part, to increase enrollment and meet the needs of the  veteran and military student population. Similarly, officials at a public  community college near several military bases said that it wanted to  increase its student population, with a specific focus on student veterans  because they were a large and growing part of their local community.

Officials at  seven schools said that they made recruiting visits on military bases to  which they were invited, generally those that were located near their  campuses. For example, officials from one nonprofit school said that they  did recruiting visits at the 18 military bases where they had a campus, as  well as other bases to which they were invited. Officials from one for-profit  school said that it visited about 30 military bases in a year, generally  through education fairs held on bases.

Seven of  the nine schools we interviewed explicitly asked if a prospective student  was a veteran or affiliated with the military. While two of these schools  asked this on the application, five schools asked this earlier in the  recruiting process. For instance, officials at two for-profit schools said that  one of the first questions asked of prospective students is whether they  are affiliated with the military\u2014in order to transfer these students to  specialized recruiters who are familiar with VA and military education  benefits. Officials at two nonprofit schools said they do not explicitly ask if  a prospective student is a veteran, but can ascertain their status in other  ways, such as when veterans discuss their background on the phone or  because the contact was made at a veteran or military event. Officials at  these schools also said that they know whether a prospective student is  military affiliated based on the website through which the student came to  them (e.g., a banner advertisement on a military site) or if they were on  the veteran or military section of the school\u2019s website.", "In addition, officials at four of the schools we interviewed said that they  work with military-affiliated \u201clead generator\u201d websites that identify students  who have submitted their contact information and agreed to be contacted  by schools that may match their interests. Officials at one nonprofit  school noted that it used a lead generator for one campus near a military  base and was considering using it with other campuses. Officials from a  public school\u2019s online program said the school used several lead  generator companies to identity potentially interested students, including  prospective veteran or military students. Two nonprofit schools that used  lead generators also purchased military-affiliated names through other  means. One school purchased a list of addresses for military residents in  an urban area with a heavy military presence to send direct mailings, and  another school purchased a list of e-mails of subscribers to a military  magazine.", "Although not veteran specific, some of the 30 school websites we  reviewed used techniques focused on encouraging students to provide  their contact information or engage directly with the school at the start of  their website search. For example, 10 of the 30 schools\u2019 websites we  reviewed (8 for-profit schools and 2 nonprofit schools) had a separate  advertising link that appeared at the top of search engine results. This link  opens up a separate \u201chome page\u201d for the school that includes a  prominent request for a person\u2019s contact information and much less  information about the school than the school\u2019s official home page. Also,  some school websites encouraged students to engage with them right  away. Specifically, 9 of the 30 schools (6 for-profit schools and 3 nonprofit  school) used prominent pop-up chat windows or links to \u201clive chats\u201d on  their traditional home page to respond to questions from prospective  students about the school.", "Once a veteran is identified, officials from most of the nine schools we  interviewed said that they contacted veterans directly, such as by phone  or email, and their school made special efforts to customize the individual  communication. Officials from six schools said that they contacted  prospective veteran or military students by phone. For instance, officials  at one for-profit school said that they had around 400 admissions  advisors who made individual contacts with prospective students, and  about 60 were dedicated to communicating with military-affiliated  students. Similarly, the recruiting official at a public school\u2019s online  program said that 6 of their 15 enrollment advisors were specifically  designated to respond to inquiries from prospective veteran or military  students, and that they did not have designated enrollment staff for any  other student population group. Also, six schools sent veteran-focused e- mail messages and four schools sent veteran-focused direct mailings,  communicating information such as the military-friendly nature of the  school or information on veteran or military benefits. For example, officials  of one public school said that while they send a general \u201cthank you\u201d e- mail to all students who apply, they send a second e-mail to veterans that  encourages them to contact their office of veteran and military support  services or seek out the school\u2019s former-military peer advisors to respond  to inquiries. Officials at most of the nine schools said that they did not  make any contacts with students who had not first indicated interest or  requested information. For instance, officials at all of the schools said that  they did not make \u201ccold calls,\u201d or calls to someone who had not previously  expressed interest in the school or provided their contact information.

Given the complexities of higher education  information, some veterans may not fully understand the school  information they obtain and a lack of familiarity or experience with higher  education issues can make it difficult to assess the accuracy of  information. For example, while most veterans reported that they obtained  information on a school\u2019s accreditation, representatives from several  schools and veterans service and higher education organizations we  interviewed said that veterans sometimes lacked a clear understanding  about the importance of accreditation and how different types of  accreditation could affect their ability to transfer credits to other schools.", "If a veteran cannot transfer credits earned previously at a different school,  he or she may have to take additional courses, incur additional tuition  charges, and possibly use all of his or her VA education benefits before  completing the educational program or degree.", "Reports of inaccuracy can be useful in highlighting areas that warrant  additional attention, as selecting a school based on inaccurate  information or an incomplete understanding of available information can  adversely affect a veteran\u2019s education or career plans. For example,  representatives from one veterans service organization said several  veterans told them that they were led to believe by school staff or  marketing materials that successfully completing their chosen program  would allow them to work in a certain occupation (e.g., information  technology) or obtain a certain type of job (e.g., police officer); however,  these veterans later discovered that potential employers generally did not  hire graduates of their program or required additional job experience.

All survey  results presented in the body of this report are generalizable to the  population of 73,000 student veterans who were receiving Post-9/11 GI  Bill benefits for the first time in 2012. Due to an insufficient response rate,  we were not able to report results by sector. We administered the survey  using mail and electronic distribution from July 2013 to November 2013. A  copy of the full questionnaire and aggregate responses for all close- ended questions are included in appendix II. The practical difficulties of  conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in interpreting a particular  question or sources of information available to respondents can introduce  unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in developing  the questionnaire, collecting the data, and analyzing them to minimize  such nonsampling error (see below)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sample Design and Survey Development and Administration", "paragraphs": ["Using data from VA, we identified the population of all veterans who were  enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time between July and  December 2012 and were using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to fund their  education\u2014approximately 90,000 student veterans. To stratify our  random sample into three equal groups based on school sector (public,  public, and for-profit), we merged data from the Department of Education  on school sectors with our list of student veterans, using school identifier  information in both data sets. While some veterans\u2019 school information  could not be matched to the existing information on school sector, we  matched schools representing most of the veterans in our population,  which resulted in a universe of approximately 73,000 veterans from which  we drew our stratified random sample of 900 student veterans, 300  attending schools in each sector.", "To inform the design of our survey instrument, we met with individual  veterans and veterans service organizations. We conducted seven  pretests with veterans who attended schools across the sectors to ensure  that survey questions collected the expected information, obtain any  suggestions for clarification, and determine whether veterans were able to  appropriately recall their experiences when they were selecting schools.  We also discussed survey questions and administration modes with  students from two veterans service organizations.", "To encourage survey participation, we conducted pre-administration and  follow-up phone calls, sent survey instruments to both e-mail and mailing  addresses, and took other measures. Before administering the survey, we  contacted individuals in our sample for whom we had telephone or e-mail  contact information to inform them about the survey, update their  preferred contact information, and answer any questions or concerns they  had. In addition, we included information from Student Veterans of  America to help promote our survey. We administered the survey using  both e-mail and mailing addresses. We sent a hard copy of our survey to  individuals in our sample with a mailing address but without an e-mail  address, and sent an e-mail message with a hyperlink to an online  version of the survey to those for whom we had e-mail addresses. We  also included a postcard with the hard copy survey that provided  instructions on how to complete the survey online, for those who  preferred to respond online. A few weeks after our initial request, we did a  second round of hard copy mailings to all recipients who had not  completed the survey online or by mail, so that all these recipients  received at least one mailed survey. We also sent follow-up emails and  conducted follow-up phone calls to encourage participation.

We conducted a nonresponse bias analysis  to see if characteristics available from the sample frame for survey  respondents correlated with the propensity to respond. We used logistic  regression models with a binary response variable to test for this. Our  non-response bias analysis indicated that our survey respondents did not  reflect the age distribution of the sample frame population. Specifically,  our respondents tended to be older than the population from which we  selected our sample. To adjust for this, we post-stratified the sample  weights by age so that the weighted age distribution of our sample  respondents reflected the age distributions in the sample frame. All  estimates presented in this report are weighted to reflect the sample  design, a non-response adjustment, and post-stratification for age.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 7  percentage points).
