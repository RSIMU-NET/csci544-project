This testimony, which is based on both current and past GAO work, synthesizes the results of these reviews as they pertain to meeting performance goals, adjusting to added responsibilities, acquiring new assets (especially the Deepwater program--to replace or upgrade cutters and aircraft, and the Rescue 21 program--to modernize rescue communications), and meeting other future challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to the Coast Guard, the agency's fiscal year 2005 performance, as self-measured by its ability to meet program goals, was the highest since the terrorist attacks in September 2001. Even with the need to sustain new homeland security duties, respond to particularly destructive hurricanes, and cope with aging assets, the Coast Guard reported meeting or exceeding performance targets for 7 of 11 mission programs, and it anticipates meeting the target for 1 more program once final results for the year are available. In particular, based on our discussions with Coast Guard and other officials, as well as our review of pertinent documents, the Coast Guard's response to Hurricane Katrina highlighted three elements key to its mission performance: a priority on training and contingency planning, a flexible organizational structure, and the agency's operational principles. Three organizational changes appear to be helping the Coast Guard adjust to added responsibilities. First, according to agency officials, a realigned field structure will allow local commanders to manage resources more efficiently. Second, according to the Coast Guard, a new response team for maritime security is expected to provide greater counterterrorism capability. Finally, new and expanded partnerships inside and outside the federal government have the potential to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency. While some progress in acquisition management has been made, continued attention is warranted. Within the Deepwater program, additional action is needed before certain past recommendations can be considered as fully implemented. Also, the program recently had difficulties in acquiring Fast Response Cutters to replace aging patrol boats. For the Rescue 21 program, deficiencies in management and oversight appear similar to those that plagued the Deepwater program, leading to delays and cost overruns, and demonstrating that the Coast Guard has not translated past lessons learned into improved acquisition practices. Two additional future challenges also bear close attention: deteriorating buoy tenders and icebreakers that may need additional resources to sustain or replace them, and maintaining mission balance while taking on a new homeland security mission outside the agency's traditional focus on the maritime environment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the President\u2019s fiscal year 2007  budget request for the Coast Guard\u2014funding that the Coast Guard  believes is critical to improving its performance and reducing  vulnerabilities within the U.S. maritime domain. As you know, the Coast  Guard has faced many extraordinary challenges and new responsibilities  in recent years, including heightened responsibility for protecting  America\u2019s ports, waterways, and waterside facilities from terrorist attacks,  while maintaining responsibility for many other programs important to the  nation\u2019s interests, such as helping stem the flow of illegal drugs and illegal  immigration, protecting important fishing grounds, and responding to  marine pollution.

The  current budget request reflects a proposed increase of about $328 million,  compared to increases for each of the past 2 budget years that exceeded  $500 million for each year. (See fig. 1.) About $5.5 billion, or more than   65 percent of the total funding request of $8.4 billion, is for operating  expenditures. The acquisition, construction, and improvements (AC&I)  account amounts to another $1.2 billion, or about 14 percent, and the  remainder is primarily for retiree pay and healthcare fund contributions.

According to Coast Guard officials, much of the additional  $328 million in this fiscal year\u2019s budget request, which is about 4 percent  over and above the fiscal year 2006 budget of $8.1 billion, covers such  things as salary and benefit increases and maintenance. In addition, more  than $57 million of this increase is to establish a permanent National  Capital Region Air Defense program to enforce the National Capital  Region no-fly zone, a program previously conducted by U.S. Customs and  Border Protection (CBP). By comparison, the increases for the AC&I  account for this time period have been even greater than the overall  funding increase, growing by 66 percent since fiscal year 2002. However,  the fiscal year 2007 AC&I budget request of almost $1.2 billion represents  little change in funding from the Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal year 2006 enacted  AC&I budget."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Coast Guard Reported Progress Made in Meeting Program Performance Targets", "paragraphs": ["Even with sustained homeland security responsibilities, aging assets, and a  particularly destructive hurricane season stretching resources across the  agency, in fiscal year 2005 the Coast Guard reported that 7 of its   11 programs met or exceeded program performance targets. In addition,  the agency reported that it anticipates meeting the target for 1 additional  program when final results become available in July 2006, potentially  bringing the total met targets to 8 out of 11 programs. According to Coast  Guard documents, the agency missed targets for three programs\u2014 undocumented migrant interdiction, defense readiness, and living marine  resources\u2014in fiscal year 2005, as it had in some previous years. Coast  Guard officials attributed these missed targets to, among other factors, the  increased flow of migrants and staffing shortages for certain security units  within the defense readiness program. (See app. III for more detailed  information on each program.) If the Coast Guard meets 8 performance  targets as it predicts, the results would represent the greatest number of  performance targets met in the last 4 years. (See fig. 2.) The preliminary  results of our ongoing work reviewing the Coast Guard\u2019s six non- homeland security performance measures suggests that, for the most part,  the data used for the measures are reliable and the measures themselves  are sound. That is, they are objective, measurable, and quantifiable as well  as cover key program activities. However, given the DHS policy of  reporting only one main performance measure per program and the limits  on how comprehensive a single measure is likely to be, there may be  opportunities to provide additional context and information to  decisionmakers about Coast Guard performance results. We will provide  final results on this work in a report to be published later this summer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Progress Came Despite Additional Demands Posed by Hurricane Katrina", "paragraphs": ["This overall progress came in a year when the Coast Guard faced  significant additional demands brought on by Hurricane Katrina. As it had  to do when it implemented MTSA and when it conducted heightened port  security patrols immediately after the September 2001 terrorist attacks,  the Coast Guard found itself operating at an increased operational tempo  for part of fiscal year 2005. Although the Hurricane Katrina response  period was relatively brief for some missions, such as search and rescue,  Coast Guard officials told us that the sheer magnitude of the response  made it unique, and responding to it tested the agency\u2019s preparedness and  ability to mobilize large numbers of personnel and assets within a short  time. In this effort, the Coast Guard had several responsibilities during and  immediately following the hurricane: to conduct search and rescue; to  direct the closing and re-opening of ports in cooperation with  stakeholders,(such as shipping companies, harbor police, DHS, CBP, and  local fire and police departments), to ensure safety and facilitate  commerce, thereby lessening the economic impact of the storm on the  nation; and to monitor pollution clean up of the many oil spills that  occurred in the wake of the flooding. For the purposes of this testimony,   I would like to focus on the Coast Guard\u2019s search and rescue response.   We are conducting a more complete review of the Coast Guard\u2019s role and  response to Hurricane Katrina across several mission areas under the  authority of the Comptroller General, and expect to provide additional  information later this summer. So far, however, this work is showing that  three factors appear to have been key to the Coast Guard\u2019s response to  Hurricane Katrina:    The Coast Guard was prepared to respond to search and rescue needs.", "Although the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina required substantial  response and relief efforts, the Coast Guard was well prepared to act  since it places a priority on training and contingency planning. First  and foremost, the missions the Coast Guard performed during  Hurricane Katrina were the same missions that the Coast Guard trains  for and typically performs on a day-to-day basis. The Coast Guard\u2019s  mission areas include, among others, search and rescue, law  enforcement, regulatory functions, and, most recently, homeland  security responsibilities, allowing the Coast Guard to respond and act  in a myriad of situations. However, with regard to Hurricane Katrina,  the magnitude of the Coast Guard\u2019s mission activity appears  noteworthy. For example, for all of 2004, according to the Coast  Guard\u2019s Fiscal Year 2005 Report, the Coast Guard responded to more  than 32,000 calls for rescue assistance and saved nearly   5,500 lives. By comparison, in 17 days of Hurricane Katrina response,  Coast Guard officials reported conducting over 33,500 rescues,  including rescuing 24,135 people by boat and helicopter and evacuating  9,409 people from hospitals. Coast Guard officials we spoke to  underscored the importance of the planning, preparation, and training  that they regularly conduct that allowed them to complete the many  challenging missions presented by Katrina.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s organizational structure and practices facilitated  the agency\u2019s response. In terms of the Coast Guard\u2019s organizational  structure, the Coast Guard has personnel and assets throughout the  United States, which allows for more flexible response to threats. In  terms of Coast Guard practices, according to the hurricane and severe  weather plans we reviewed for Coast Guard Districts 7 (Florida region)  and 8 (Gulf region), and discussions we had in Washington, D.C.,  Virginia, Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana with Coast Guard officials  responsible for implementing those plans, the Coast Guard tracks the  likely path of an approaching storm, anticipates the necessary assets to  address the storm\u2019s impact, and repositions personnel and aircraft out  of harm\u2019s way, with a focus on reconstituting assets to respond to local  needs once it is safe to do so. Given the magnitude of Hurricane  Katrina, the Coast Guard took a more centralized approach to prioritize  personnel and assets to respond, but the operational command  decisions remained at the local level. That is, the Coast Guard\u2019s  Atlantic Area Command played a key role in identifying additional  Coast Guard resources, and worked with District Commands to quickly  move those resources to the affected Gulf region, while local  operational commanders directed personnel and assets to priority  missions based on their on-scene knowledge.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s operational principles facilitated the agency\u2019s  actions. Throughout our field work, Coast Guard officials referred to  the principles of Coast Guard operations that guide the agency\u2019s  actions.  Coast Guard officials identified these principles, which ranged  from the importance of having clear objectives and flexibility to  managing risks and exercising restraint, as instrumental in their  preparation for Hurricane Katrina. The Coast Guard prides itself on  these operational principles that collectively form the foundation of  Coast Guard culture and actions during operations. These principles  set an expectation for individual leadership in crisis, and personnel are  trained to take responsibility and action as needed based on relevant  authorities and guidance. For example, during the initial response to  Hurricane Katrina, a junior-level pilot, who first arrived on-scene in  New Orleans with the planned mission of conducting an environmental  inspection flight, recognized that search and rescue helicopters in the  area could not communicate with officials on the ground, including  those located at hospitals and at safe landing areas. This pilot took the  initiative while on-scene\u2014an operational principle\u2014to redirect her  planned mission, changing it from an environmental flight to creating  the first airborne communication platform in the area. Doing so helped  ensure that critical information was relayed to and from helicopter  pilots conducting search and rescue so that they could more safely and  efficiently continue their vital mission. When we consulted her  commanding officer about these actions, he supported her decision and  actions and noted that Coast Guard personnel generally have the  flexibility to divert from their intended mission to accomplish a more  important mission, without obtaining advance supervisory approval. He  indicated that this was not only common practice, but it was supported  by a written directive at his unit.", "While acknowledging the importance of these operational principles, it  is equally important to note that the response to Hurricane Katrina also  hinged on discipline and adherence to critical plans. For example,  multiple aircraft were operating in a confined space with little  separation, thus adhering to critical search and rescue plans, as well as  using experience and judgment, resulted in numerous rescues despite  these difficult circumstances. While the Hurricane Katrina search and  rescue effort was unprecedented, sustaining this effort might have been  much more difficult if it had gone on for a much longer period.  Combining a longer-term catastrophic response with the continuing  needs of the agency\u2019s day-to-day missions would be more challenging  for a small service such as the Coast Guard. Relative to other military  services, the Coast Guard is small, and when resources are shifted to  any one specific mission area, other mission areas may suffer. For  example, Coast Guard units in Florida sent many air and surface assets  to the Gulf region to respond to Hurricane Katrina. While the assets  were deployed to the Gulf region, the Coast Guard noticed a spike in  the level of illegal migration activity off of the Florida coast. However,  once Coast Guard assets returned to the Florida region, the Coast  Guard initiated a more intensive air and sea patrol schedule to  markedly announce their return to the area, and focus on interdicting  illegal migrants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Continues with Organizational Changes and Expanded Partnerships to Meet Growing Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard organizational changes and expanded partnerships have  helped to alleviate some resource pressures posed by added  responsibilities or further deterioration of assets, as well as help  accomplish its mission responsibilities.

As  we reported to you last year, the Coast Guard began making this change to  improve mission performance through better coordination of Coast Guard  command authority with operational resources such as boats and  aircraft. Under the previous field structure, for example, a marine safety  officer who had the authority to inspect a vessel at sea or needed an aerial  view of an oil spill as part of an investigation would often have to  coordinate a request for a boat or an aircraft through a district office,  which would obtain the resource from a group or air station. Under the  realignment, these operational resources are to be available under the  same commanding officer\u2014allowing for more efficient operations. This  revised structure involves dividing operations into 35 geographic \u201csectors.\u201d  Coast Guard officials stated that all 35 sectors have been established as of  May 2006.

The Coast Guard\u2019s $4.7 million  request for fiscal year 2007 would provide the team with chemical,  biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive detection equipment;  improve the Coast Guard\u2019s Special Missions Training Center facility; and  provide additional personnel and operating capacity for a third 60-member  unit, building the team toward 24/7 response capabilities.

For example, the Coast Guard is currently  developing a pilot program to increase operational efficiencies between  the Coast Guard and CBP aimed at pushing potential threats away from  U.S. ports. This offshore operation, currently in a pilot stage, includes the  integration of each agency\u2019s vessel targeting efforts, unifies their boarding  operations, and includes professional exchange opportunities. Although  this effort is only being tested within the Pacific Area Command of the  Coast Guard, according to a senior Coast Guard official, the Pacific  Command intends to send its results to Coast Guard headquarters so the  agency can determine how to best implement the program across the  Coast Guard at a later date.", "In addition to partnering with other federal agencies, the Coast Guard has  also initiated partnerships with both government and industry. Under  regulations implementing MTSA, a Coast Guard Captain of the Port must  develop an Area Maritime Security Plan in consultation with an Area  Maritime Security Committee. These committees are typically composed  of members from federal, local, and state governments; law enforcement  agencies; maritime industry and labor organizations; and other port  stakeholders that may be affected by security policies. The security plan  they develop is intended to provide a communication and coordination  framework for the port stakeholders and law enforcement officials to  follow in addressing security vulnerabilities and responding to any  incidents. Stakeholders in two ports we visited identified their Area  Maritime Security Committees as an invaluable forum for port partners.  For example, they said meetings of these committees serve as an  opportunity for members of the port community to network with one  another, build relationships, address various maritime-related issues, and  coordinate security planning efforts.", "The Coast Guard has expanded its partnership with NOAA to enforce  domestic fisheries regulations. NOAA operates a technology-based system,  called the vessel monitoring system, to track and monitor fishing vessels.  This system offers real-time data on a ship\u2019s course and position, where  the ship has requested to fish, the type of fishing requested, and the  number of days the ship has been out of port. The Coast Guard uses this  information to assist with its enforcement of domestic fisheries  regulations by identifying vessels that may not be in compliance with  domestic fisheries regulations. For example, the monitoring information  will show if fishing vessels are operating within a restricted area.  According to Coast Guard officials, the information shared from this  partnership has allowed Coast Guard assets to be used more efficiently in  checking on potentially noncompliant vessels and enforcing fishing laws."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Progress Made with Ongoing Acquisition Efforts, but Continued Attention Is Warranted", "paragraphs": ["Our recent reviews indicate that while the Coast Guard has made progress  in managing the Deepwater program, further actions are needed and the  lessons learned from this effort have not been applied to other ongoing  acquisitions.

In addition, the acquisition of Fast Response Cutters has  recently experienced setbacks. Meanwhile, the Rescue 21 program  continues to be of concern as the program has been plagued by delays,  technical problems, and cost escalation\u2014issues that parallel the problems  encountered in the early years of the Deepwater program. Another  program, the Nationwide Automatic Identification System, is still in early  development stages and specific technical system requirements remain  undefined. As a result, according to Coast Guard officials, this has affected  the Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to respond to our recommendation that the  agency cultivate potential partnerships in order to leverage resources  toward implementing the system.

The Coast Guard has  devoted considerable attention to concerns that we and others raised, in  particular to implementing recommendations for improvement. Our past  concerns about the Deepwater program have been in three main areas\u2014 ensuring better program management and oversight, ensuring greater  accountability on the part of the system integrator, and creating sufficient  competition to help act as a control on costs\u2014and to address these  concerns, we made a total of 11 recommendations. Table 1 provides an  overview of the 11 recommendations, including their current status. In  short, five recommendations have been fully implemented, five have been  partially implemented, and one has not been implemented. Three of the  five partially implemented recommendations appear close to being fully  implemented, in that the actions taken appear to be sufficient but results  are not yet known or final procedural steps (such as issuing a policy  currently in draft form) are not complete. The remaining two partially  implemented recommendations, both of which deal with effective program  management and contractor oversight, remain somewhat more  problematic, and these are discussed further below. In both cases,  however, the steps needed to fully implement these recommendations are  relatively straightforward.", "In 2004, we reported that the integrated product teams (IPTs), the Coast  Guard\u2019s primary tool for managing the Deepwater program and overseeing  contractor activities, were struggling to carry out their missions because  of four major issues: (1) lack of timely charters to provide authority  needed for decision making, (2) inadequate communication among team  members, (3) high staff turnover, and (4) insufficient training. Despite  progress in addressing these four issues, we do not consider this  recommendation to be fully implemented. There are indications that the  IPTs are still not succeeding in developing sufficient collaboration among  subcontractors. Coast Guard officials recently reported that collaboration  among the subcontractors continues to be problematic and that the system  integrator wields little influence to compel decisions among them. For  example, when dealing with proposed design changes for assets under  construction, the system integrator has submitted the changes as two  separate proposals from both first-tier subcontractors rather than  coordinating the separate proposals into one coherent plan. According to  Coast Guard performance monitors, because the two proposals often carry  a number of overlapping work items, this approach complicates the Coast  Guard\u2019s review of the needed design change. Several improvements  designed to address these problems are under way, but it is too early to  determine if these will effectively eliminate the problems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Providing Field Personnel with Guidance and Training on Transitioning to New Deepwater Assets", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, we reported the Coast Guard had not effectively communicated  decisions on how new Deepwater and existing assets are to be integrated  during the transition and whether Coast Guard or contractor personnel   (or a combination of the two) will be responsible for maintenance of the  Deepwater assets. For example, Coast Guard field personnel, including  senior-level operators and naval engineering support command officials,  said they had not received information about how they would be able to  continue meeting their missions using existing assets while also being  trained on the new assets. Since that time the Coast Guard has placed  more emphasis on outreach to field personnel, including surveys, face-to- face meetings, and membership in IPTs. Despite these efforts, there are  indications that the actions are not yet sufficient to consider the  recommendation to be fully implemented. In particular, our review of  relevant documents and discussions with key personnel make clear that  field operators and maintenance personnel are still concerned that their  views are not adequately acknowledged and addressed, and have little  information about maintenance and logistics plans for the new Deepwater  assets. For example, though the first National Security Cutter is to be  delivered in August 2007, field and maintenance officials have yet to  receive information on plans for crew training, necessary shore facility  modifications, or how maintenance and logistics responsibilities will be  divided between the Coast Guard and the system integrator.

Under the original  2002 Deepwater Implementation Plan, all 49 of the Coast Guard\u2019s 110-foot  patrol boats were to be converted into 123-foot patrol boats, with  increased capabilities, as a bridging strategy until a replacement vessel,  the 140-foot FRC, came on line beginning in 2018. The Coast Guard  converted 8 of the 110-foot patrol boats to 123-foot boats, but discontinued  further conversions because the patrol boats were experiencing technical  difficulties, such as hull buckling, and were not able to meet post- September 11, 2001 mission requirements. This prompted the Coast Guard  to revise this part of the Deepwater program. The 2005 Revised Deepwater  Implementation Plan reflected the Coast Guard\u2019s cancellation of further  patrol boat conversions and acceleration of the design and delivery of the  FRC, which was being designed to use composite materials in the hull,  decks and bulkheads. Under the 2005 revised plan, the first FRC was  scheduled to come on line in 2007\u201411 years earlier than originally  planned.", "In late February 2006, the Coast Guard suspended design work on the FRC  because of risks with the emerging design. In particular, an independent  design review by third-party consultants preliminarily demonstrated,  among other things, that the FRC would be far heavier and less efficient  than a typical patrol boat of similar length. As a result, the Coast Guard is  now pursuing three strategies for moving forward with the FRC  acquisition. The first strategy involves Integrated Coast Guard Systems,  the prime contractor, purchasing design plans for and building an \u201coff-the- shelf\u201d patrol boat that could be adapted for Coast Guard use as a way to  increase patrol hours until the FRC design could be finalized. The Coast  Guard issued a request for information in April 2006 to assess the off-the  shelf options. The second strategy is to revise the requirements of the FRC  in order to allow for modifications to the current FRC design. Concurrent  with the first two strategies, the Coast Guard\u2019s third strategy is to have a  third party reassess the analyses used in the decision to use composite  materials for the FRC to determine if the use of composite materials will,  in fact, reduce total ownership costs. The result of the Coast Guard  pursuing these strategies is that the Coast Guard would end up with two  classes of FRCs. The first class of FRCs would be based on an adapted  design from a patrol boat already on the market, to expedite delivery, and  a follow-on class that would be based on revisions made to address the  problems identified in the original FRC design plans.  Pursuant to these  three strategies, Coast Guard officials now estimate that the first FRC will  likely not be delivered until late fiscal year 2009, at the earliest. GAO plans  to release a report in late June 2006 providing updated information on the  status of FRC design efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rescue 21 Continues to Be of Concern as It Enters Implementation Phase", "paragraphs": ["The Rescue 21 acquisition program\u2014the Coast Guard\u2019s effort to replace its  antiquated command, control and communication infrastructure used  primarily to monitor mariner distress calls, and coordinate search and  rescue operations\u2014continues to be of concern as the program has been  plagued by numerous delays, technical problems, and cost overruns.  GAO\u2019s recently released report shows that the program is about 5 years  behind its originally proposed schedule for full implementation in 2006,   as a result primarily of delays in development and testing of the system.  In addition, these delays have raised the Coast Guard\u2019s estimated costs for  bringing Rescue 21 up to full operating capability from $250 million to  $710.5 million. Moreover, our analysis of contractor performance trends,  including a significant number of contract items not completed as   planned and requiring renegotiation, indicates that total acquisition cost  overruns will continue, and implementation costs could reach as high as  $872 million.", "These delays, technical problems, and cost overruns are the result of  deficiencies in Coast Guard acquisition management and contractor  oversight\u2014deficiencies similar to those that we identified earlier in the  Deepwater program. Such a pattern is of concern because it suggests that  the Coast Guard has not translated the lessons learned from Deepwater to  its overall acquisition management. In particular, deficiencies in the  Rescue 21 program include common problems of acquisition management  and oversight including ineffective project monitoring and risk  management, poorly defined user requirements, unrealistic schedule and  cost estimates developed by the contractor, and limited executive-level  oversight. And although the Coast Guard has developed the high-level  requirements for Rescue 21, it has relied solely on the contractor to  manage these requirements.", "As discussed, we found similar problems in the Deepwater program with  comparable adverse impacts on cost, schedule and results.  For example,  at the start of the program we identified a number of risks that would need  to be addressed for the program to be successful\u2014including ensuring that  procedures and personnel are in place for managing and overseeing the  contractor, and taking steps to minimize potential problems in developing  new technology.  Since that time, we have made numerous specific  recommendations to the Coast Guard based on the deficiencies uncovered  by our audits.", "The delays in implementing Rescue 21 mean that field units will continue  to face limitations in their ability to hear boaters in distress and the agency  will be subject to cost and performance challenges to maintain the legacy  equipment. For example, as a result of Rescue 21\u2019s delay, some field units  will likely continue to experience coverage gaps, limiting their ability to  monitor mariners in distress and some will continue to be at risk of  performing larger and potentially more costly searches due to the legacy  system\u2019s more limited capabilities. In addition, because the legacy  equipment is over 30 years old, it is at high risk for failure, a factor which  could result in costly repairs. Moreover, although the Coast Guard  previously issued a moratorium on upgrades to the legacy system, delays  in the Coast Guard\u2019s implementation of Rescue 21 may require units to  upgrade or install new equipment for the legacy system. This would result  in further costs, and in fact, this has already occurred at some units.", "The importance of resolving acquisition management problems is  underscored by the operational benefits that are expected to be realized  from system implementation, and some of these benefits have already  been achieved in a few locations where the Rescue 21 system has been  used.  For example, following Hurricane Katrina, the Coast Guard took  advantage of Rescue 21\u2019s capabilities to address communications  challenges through an early deployment of a portable antenna to Louisiana  in September 2005 to provide communications capabilities that had been  lost due to the storm.  In another case, the direction-finding capability of  the Rescue 21 system helped the Coast Guard to rescue some stranded  boaters who had inaccurately identified their location to the Coast Guard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard in Early Phase of Developing the Nationwide Automatic Identification System", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard is at an early phase in developing the Nationwide  Automatic Identification System (NAIS)\u2014an important step in the overall  effort to increase port safety and security by collecting, integrating, and  analyzing information on vessels operating within or bound for U.S.  waters\u2014and is pursuing partnership opportunities that could potentially  accomplish NAIS installation goals more quickly and reduce installation  costs to the federal government. According to the Coast Guard, NAIS will  allow the Coast Guard to both receive and transmit information to vessels  entering and leaving U.S. waters, supporting both MTSA and the National  Plan to Achieve Maritime Domain Awareness. In July 2004, we  recommended that the Coast Guard seek and take advantage of  opportunities to partner with organizations willing to develop systems at  their own expense as part of the acquisition process. In response,  according to Coast Guard officials, the agency has begun to develop  partnerships. However, officials noted that because the project and  technology are still in the early stages of development, these partnerships  remain limited. For example, Coast Guard officials said that because the  Coast Guard still does not know all of the specific technical system  requirements, they do not yet know of all the potential partners that could  enable the Coast Guard to leverage resources.

According to Coast  Guard officials, even though it did not have a centralized tracking system  for the condition of its ATON small boat assets during this time period, the  Coast Guard\u2019s overall assessments of these smaller assets indicated that  most of the asset types were in fair to poor condition. According to Coast  Guard officials and documents, the reasons for their condition include the  fact that many of the asset types are beyond their expected service lives  and the general workload of the assets has increased to carry out other  missions, such as maritime security after September 11, 2001, or providing  disaster response after events such as the recent hurricanes on the Gulf  Coast."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing Amount of Maintenance on ATON and Domestic Icebreaking Assets Is Being Performed", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard personnel reported to us that crew members have had to  spend increasingly more time and resources to troubleshoot and resolve  maintenance issues on the older ATON and domestic icebreaking assets.  The Coast Guard personnel we met with indicated that because the  systems and parts are outdated compared with the technology and  equipment available today, it can be challenging and time consuming to  diagnose a maintenance issue and find parts or determine what corrective  action to take. For example, the propulsion control system on the 140-foot  icebreaking tugs uses circuit cards that were state-of-the-art when the tugs  were commissioned in the late 1970s to 1980s but are no longer  manufactured today and have been superseded by computer control  systems. According to the Coast Guard personnel we met with, the lack of  a readily available supply of these parts has forced maintenance personnel  to order custom made parts or refurbish the faulty ones, increasing the  time and money it takes to address maintenance problems. The personnel  also told us that because such equipment is outdated, finding  knowledgeable individuals to identify problems with the equipment is  difficult, which further complicates the maintenance of the assets. Crews  of other assets we visited also confirmed the difficulty of diagnosing  problems and obtaining replacement parts for other critical subsystems  such as the main diesel engines.", "Aware of such issues, the Coast Guard completed a mission needs analysis  for ATON and domestic icebreaking assets, and developed an approach to  renovate or recapitalize these assets. This analysis, which was completed  in 2002, looked at the condition of the existing assets and their ability to  support mission needs. The analysis concluded that all of the assets  suffered in varying degrees with respect to safety, supportability,  environmental compliance, and habitability, and would need replacement  or rehabilitation to address these issues. In response to this analysis, the  Coast Guard developed a plan to systematically replace or renovate the  assets. Program officials at the Coast Guard indicated that current  estimates place the total cost to carry out this plan at about $550 million.  According to a Coast Guard official, although resource proposals to carry  out this project had been made during the budget planning processes for  fiscal years 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, those proposals were either  deferred or terminated by DHS or the Office of Management and Budget  from inclusion in the final budget requests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Polar Class Icebreaking Assets Are in Need of Significant Maintenance", "paragraphs": ["Preliminary observations from our review of the Coast Guard\u2019s polar  icebreaking assets revealed similar challenges for the Coast Guard to  perform the maintenance needed to sustain the capabilities of these  assets. As with the other older ATON and domestic icebreaking assets, the  two Polar Class icebreakers that are used for breaking the channel into the  Antarctic research station are reaching the end of their design service lives  of 30 years. According to Coast Guard officials, the icebreakers\u2019 age  combined with recent harsh ice conditions and increased operational  tempo have left the Polar Class icebreakers unable to continue the mission  in the long term without a substantial investment in maintenance and  equipment renewal. These officials also told us that while the hull  structures are sound, critical systems such as the main gas turbine  controls and the controllable pitch propeller systems have become  unreliable. Corroborating this account of the icebreakers\u2019 condition, an  interim report issued in December 2005 by the National Research Council  of the National Academies also found that the icebreakers have become  inefficient to operate because substantial and increasing maintenance is  required to keep them operating and that significant long-term  maintenance had been deferred over the past several years.", "Given the age and obsolescence of the Polar Class icebreakers, funding for  maintenance and repair has been and will likely continue to be a  challenge. Coast Guard officials indicated that the cost of maintenance  activity for the icebreakers required that additional funding be transferred  from other Coast Guard asset maintenance accounts in previous years in  order to carry out this maintenance. For fiscal years 2005 and 2006, the  Coast Guard also obtained additional funds for maintenance from the  National Science Foundation (NSF). The Coast Guard has considered  undertaking a project to extend the service lives of the existing assets by  refurbishing or replacing those systems that have reached the end of their  service lives. The Coast Guard estimates that this extension project could  provide an additional 25 years of service for the existing assets. The cost  to carry out this project for both Polar Class icebreakers is estimated  between $552 and $859 million. Coast Guard capital planning  documentation indicates that failure to fund this project could leave the  nation without heavy icebreaking capability and could jeopardize the  investment made in the nation\u2019s Antarctic Program.

Certainly, if one  measure of organizational excellence is performance in crisis, Hurricane  Katrina shows that the Coast Guard is well along on that scale. Excellence  must also be demonstrated in more mundane ways, however, such as how  an organization manages its acquisitions. In this case, the Coast Guard  needs to consistently, and from the beginning, employ widely known best  practices for its acquisition management processes particularly with  respect to developing requirements, project and risk management, and  ensuring proper executive level oversight. Although the Coast Guard is to  be complimented for its willingness to make improvements after our  audits have identified problems, such as with the Deepwater program, its  acquisition management would be better if the agency employed the  lessons once learned and translated them into generally-improved  practices. Better overall practices would help to ensure that future  projects will not repeat past problems and will be completed on time and  at cost.", "The Coast Guard has clearly been at the vortex of many of the most  sweeping changes in the federal government\u2019s priorities over the past  several years. \u201cHomeland security\u201d carries a much different tone, as well  as budgetary significance, in the national consciousness after September  11, 2001.
