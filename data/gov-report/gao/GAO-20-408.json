Additionally, about 96 percent of all behavioral health services accessed by Medicare beneficiaries in 2018, the latest data available, were for a primary diagnosis in one of five behavioral health disorder categories. (See figure.) Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorders, accounted for 42 percent of services. SUD services accounted for about 7 percent of all services accessed by beneficiaries. Further, two-thirds of behavioral health services were provided by psychiatrists, licensed clinical social workers, and psychologists in 2018.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) agency that administers Medicare, uses various approaches to disseminate information to Medicare beneficiaries about coverage for behavioral health services. As part of these efforts, CMS mails out Medicare & You \u2014the most widely disseminated source of information on Medicare benefits\u2014to all Medicare beneficiaries every year. GAO reviewed the fall 2019 and January 2020 editions of Medicare & You. While the January 2020 edition describes a new coverage benefit for beneficiaries with opioid use disorders, neither edition includes an explicit and broader description of the covered services available for substance use disorders.

We focused only on claims for Medicare beneficiaries in  fee-for-service Medicare because similar reliable information was not  available for beneficiaries enrolled in MA. From the 2018 Part B data, we  isolated the behavioral health services provided in 2018 and analyzed these behavioral health services as a share of total Part B services and  expenditures. We also analyzed the behavioral health services by  diagnosis, type of service, provider type, and beneficiary demographic.  We conducted our analysis at the service level: a single service or  multiple services may be delivered during a single visit to a provider. For  example, a beneficiary may receive a general consultation and  psychotherapy during one visit, and the provider would bill both services  to Medicare for that visit. We selected the behavioral health services  included in our analysis based on the service codes (which describe the  type of service provided) and diagnosis codes (which describe the  primary condition related to the service) associated with each claim. Our  analysis focused on services delivered by health care providers that can  diagnose, treat, or otherwise care for an individual, and excluded  behavioral health-related services provided by other types of providers,  such as services performed by lab facilities. For all service codes other  than psychiatry, services were only included if the beneficiary\u2019s primary  diagnosis was a behavioral health condition. We defined behavioral  health conditions as those in the Mental and Behavioral Disorders range  of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related  Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10).", "To assess the reliability of the behavioral health services claims data, we  obtained information from knowledgeable CMS officials regarding the  accuracy of the information, and we performed checks to identify missing  or incorrect data.
