The program has been managed in 2-year increments, known as blocks. Block 2006, the second BMDS block, was completed in December 2007. By law, GAO annually assesses MDA's progress. This testimony is based on GAO's March 2008 report that addressed MDA's progress in (1) meeting Block 2006 goals for fielding assets, completing work within estimated cost, conducting tests, and demonstrating the performance of the overall system in the field, and (2) making managerial improvements to transparency, accountability, and oversight. GAO reviewed the assets fielded; contractor cost, schedule, and performance; and tests completed during 2007. GAO also reviewed pertinent sections of the U.S. Code, acquisition policy, and the charter of a new missile defense board."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the past year, MDA has fielded additional and new assets, enhanced the capability of some existing assets, and achieved most test objectives. MDA did not meet the goals it originally set for the block. Ultimately, MDA fielded fewer assets, increased costs by about $1 billion and conducted fewer tests. Even with the cost increase, MDA deferred work to keep costs from increasing further, as some contractors overran their fiscal year 2007 budgets. Deferring work obscures the cost of the block because such work is no longer counted as part of Block 2006. The cost of the block may have been further obscured by a way of planning work used by several contractors that could underestimate the actual work completed. If more work has to be done, MDA could incur additional costs that are not yet recognized. MDA also sets goals for determining the overall performance of the BMDS. Similar to other DOD programs, MDA uses models and simulations to predict BMDS performance. GAO was unable to assess whether MDA met its overall performance goal because there have not been enough flight tests to provide a high confidence that the models and simulations accurately predict BMDS performance. Moreover, the tests that have been done do not provide enough information for DOD's independent test organization to fully assess the BMDS' suitability and effectiveness. GAO has previously reported that MDA has been given unprecedented funding and decision-making flexibility. While this flexibility has expedited BMDS fielding, it has also made MDA less accountable and transparent in its decisions than other major programs, making oversight more challenging. MDA, with some direction from Congress, has taken significant steps to address these concerns. MDA implemented a new way of defining blocks--its construct for developing and fielding BMDS increments--that should make costs more transparent. For example, under the newly-defined blocks, MDA will no longer defer work from one block to another. Accountability should also be improved as MDA will, for the first time, estimate unit costs for selected assets and report variances from those estimates. DOD also chartered a new executive board with more BMDS oversight responsibility than its predecessor. Finally, MDA will begin buying certain assets with procurement funds like other programs. This will benefit transparency and accountability, because to use procurement funding generally means that assets must be fully paid for in the year they are bought. Previously, Congress authorized MDA to pay for assets incrementally using research and development funds. Some oversight concerns remain, however. For example, MDA has not yet estimated the total cost of a block, and therefore, cannot have a block's costs independently verified--actions required of other programs to inform decisions about affordability and investment choices. However, MDA does plan to estimate block costs and have them verified at some future date. Also, the executive board faces a challenge in overseeing MDA's large technology development efforts and does not have approval authority for some key decisions made by MDA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s  (MDA\u2019s) strategy for acquiring a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)  and its progress in fielding Block 2006\u2014its second increment of capability.", "MDA has been charged with developing and fielding the BMDS, a system  expected to be capable of defending the United States, deployed troops,  friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of  flight.

In addition, the Aegis BMD element was able to  meet its revised block goals for one of its two components. The program upgraded all  planned ships, but fielded three fewer Aegis BMD Standard Missile-3s (SM-3) than planned  because the missiles were delayed into 2008 to accommodate an unanticipated requirement  to deliver three missiles to Japan.", "2008 cost. Because MDA did not track the cost of the deferred work, the  agency could not make an adjustment that would have matched the cost  with the correct block.  Consequently, we were unable to determine the  full cost of Block 2006.", "Another reason why it is difficult to determine the actual cost of Block  2006 is a planning methodology too often employed by some MDA prime  contractors that can obscure the full cost of work. Contractors typically  divide the total work of a contract into small efforts in order to define  them more clearly and to ensure proper oversight. Work may be planned  into categories including: (1) level of effort\u2014work that contains tasks of a  general or supportive nature and does not produce a definite end product  and (2) discrete\u2014work that has a definable end product or event.  When  work is discrete, delivery of the end product provides a sound basis for  determining actual contractor performance. When discrete work is instead  planned as level of effort, the contractor\u2019s performance becomes less  transparent because work is considered complete when the time planned  for it has expired, whether or not the intended product has been  completed.  Earned value management does not recognize such variances  in completing scheduled work and to the extent more work has to be done  to complete the product, additional costs could be incurred that are not  yet recognized.of their work as level of effort.  MDA officials agree that its contractors  have improperly planned discrete work as level of effort, and are taking  steps to remedy the situation.", "Many of MDA\u2019s prime contractors plan a large percentage  We also observed that while several contractors had difficulty with  controlling costs, during fiscal year 2007, MDA awarded approximately 95  percent or $606 million of available award fee to its prime contractors.  In  particular, contractors developing the ABL and Aegis BMD Weapon  System were rated as performing very well in the cost and/or program  management elements and received commensurate fees, even though  earned value management data showed that their cost and schedule  performance was declining.

The agency recognizes  that there is not always a good link between its intentions for award fees  and the amount of fee being earned by its contractors. In an effort to  rectify this problem, the agency has begun to revise its award fee policy to  align agency practices more closely with DOD\u2019s current policy that better  links performance with award fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Testing and Performance of Fielded Capability", "paragraphs": ["Most test objectives were achieved during 2007, although several BMDS  programs experienced setbacks in their test schedules.

GMD  successfully completed an intercept with an operationally representative  interceptor and a radar characterization test.  A second intercept test  employing the SBX radar has been delayed because a target malfunction  delayed the execution of the first intercept test.

As we reported in March 2007, MDA operates with  considerable autonomy to change goals and plans, which makes it difficult  to reconcile outcomes with original expectations and to determine the  actual cost of each block and of individual operational assets. In the past  year, MDA has begun implementing two initiatives\u2014a new block construct  and a new executive board\u2014to improve transparency, accountability, and  oversight.

The agency\u2019s new construct is based on  fielding capabilities that address particular threats as opposed to the  previous biennial time periods. MDA\u2019s new block construct makes many  positive changes. These include establishing unit cost for selected block  assets, incorporating into a block only those elements or components that  will be fielded during the block, and abandoning the practice of deferring  work from block to block.", "These changes should improve the transparency of the BMDS program  and make MDA more accountable for the investment being made in  missile defense. For example, the actual cost of each block can be tracked  because MDA will no longer defer work planned for one block, along with  its cost, to a future block. In addition, MDA plans to develop unit costs for  selected BMDS assets\u2013\u2013such as THAAD interceptors\u2014so that the cost of  those assets can be monitored. In addition, the agency plans to request an  independent verification of these unit costs and report significant cost  growth to Congress. However, MDA has not yet determined all of the  assets that will report a unit cost or how much a unit cost must increase  before it is reported to Congress. systems before system development and demonstration can begin. Until  the full cost of each block is known, it will be difficult for decision makers  to compare the value of investing in each block to the value of investing in  other DOD programs or to determine whether a block is affordable over  the long term.", "Another issue yet to be addressed is whether the concurrent development  and fielding of BMDS assets will continue. Fully developing an asset and  demonstrating its capability prior to production increases the likelihood  that the product will perform as designed and can be produced at the cost  estimated. To field an initial capability quickly, MDA accepted the risk of  concurrent development and fielding during Block 2004. It continued to do  so during Block 2006 as it fielded assets before they were fully tested. For  example, by the end of Block 2004, the agency realized that the  performance of some ground-based interceptors could be degraded  because the interceptors included inappropriate or potentially unreliable  parts. As noted earlier, MDA has begun the process of retrofitting these interceptors, but work will not be completed until 2012. Meanwhile, there  is a risk that some interceptors might not perform as designed. MDA has  not addressed whether it will accept similar performance risks under its  new block construct or whether it will fully develop and demonstrate all  elements/components prior to fielding.", "MDA has not addressed whether it will transfer assets produced during a  block to a military service for production and operation at the block\u2019s  completion. Officials representing multiple DOD organizations recognize  that transfer criteria are neither complete nor clear given the BMDS\u2019s  complexity. Without clear transfer criteria, MDA has transferred the  management of only one element\u2014the Patriot Advanced Capability-3\u2014to  the military for production and operation. For other elements, MDA and  the military services have been negotiating the transition of  responsibilities for the sustainment of fielded elements\u2014a task that has  proven to be time consuming. Although MDA documents show that under  its new block construct the agency should be ready to deliver BMDS  components that are fully mission-capable, MDA officials could not tell us  whether at the end of a block MDA\u2019s Director will recommend when  management of components, including production responsibilities, will be  transferred to the military."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Executive Board Offers Improved, but Not Full, Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Oversight improvement initiatives are also underway for MDA. In March  2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense established a Missile Defense  Executive Board (MDEB) to recommend and oversee implementation of  strategic policies and plans, program priorities, and investment options for  protecting the United States and its allies from missile attacks. The MDEB  is also to replace existing groups and structures, such as the Missile  Defense Support Group.", "The MDEB appears to be vested with more authority than its predecessor,  the Missile Defense Support Group. When the Support Group was  chartered in 2002, it was to provide constructive advice to MDA\u2019s Director.  However, the Director was not required to follow the advice of the group.  According to a DOD official, although the Support Group met many times  initially, it did not meet after June 2005. This led to the formation of the  MDEB.  Its mission is to review and make recommendations on MDA\u2019s  comprehensive acquisition strategy to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. It  is also to provide the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics) with a recommended strategic program plan and a feasible  funding strategy based on business case analysis that considers the best  approach to fielding integrated missile defense capabilities in support of  joint MDA and warfighter objectives. The MDEB will be assisted by four  standing committees. These committees, which are chaired by senior-level  officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff,  could play an important oversight role as they are expected to make  recommendations to the MDEB, which in turn, will recommend courses of  action to the Under Secretary of Defense and the Director, MDA as  appropriate. entered System Development and Demonstration, it has not triggered  certain statutes requiring the development of information that the Defense  Acquisition Board uses to inform its decisions. For example, most major  defense acquisition programs are required by statute to obtain an  independent verification of life-cycle cost estimates prior to beginning  system development and demonstration, and/or production and  deployment. Independent life-cycle cost estimates provide confidence that  a program is executable within estimated cost. Although MDA plans to  develop unit cost for selected block assets and to request that DOD\u2019s Cost  Analysis Improvement Group verify the unit costs, the agency does not  initially plan to develop a block cost estimate and therefore, cannot seek  an independent verification of that cost. Although MDA will not be  required to obtain an independent verification of block costs when they  are estimated, MDA officials told us that they have initiated discussions  with the Cost Analysis Improvement Group on independent verifications  of block cost estimates.", "Statute also requires an independent verification of a system\u2019s suitability  for and effectiveness on the battlefield through operational testing before  a program can proceed beyond low-rate initial production. After testing is  completed, the Director for Operational Test and Evaluation assesses  whether the test was adequate to support an evaluation of the system\u2019s  suitability and effectiveness for the battlefield, whether the test showed  the system to be acceptable, and whether any limitations in suitability and  effectiveness were noted. However, a comparable assessment of the  BMDS assets being fielded will not be available to the MDEB.  As noted  earlier, the limited amount of testing completed, which has been primarily  developmental in nature, and the lack of verified, validated, and accredited  models and simulations prevent the Director of Operational Test and  Evaluation from fully assessing the effectiveness,  suitability, and  survivability of the BMDS in annual assessments.", "MDA will also make some decisions without needing approval from the  MDEB or any higher level DOD official. Although the charter of the MDEB  includes making recommendations to MDA and the Under Secretary of  Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) on investment options,  program priorities, and MDA\u2019s strategy for developing and fielding an  operational missile defense capability, the MDEB will not necessarily have  the opportunity to review and recommend changes to BMDS blocks. MDA  documents show that the agency plans to continue to define each block of  development without requiring input from the MDEB. According to a  briefing on the business rules and processes for MDA\u2019s new block  structure, the decision to initiate a new block of BMDS capability will be  made by MDA\u2019s Director. Also cost, schedule, and performance  parameters will be established by MDA when technologies that the block  depends upon are mature, a credible cost estimate can be developed,  funding is available, and the threat is both imminent and severe. The  Director will inform the MDEB as well as Congress when a new block is  initiated, but he will not seek the approval of either.", "Finally, there will be parts of the BMDS program that the MDEB will have  difficulty overseeing because of the nature of the work being performed.  MDA plans to place any program that is developing technology in a  category known as Capability Development. These programs, such as ABL,  KEI, and MKV, will not have a firm cost, schedule, or performance  baseline. This is generally true for technology development programs in  DOD because they are in a period of discovery, which makes schedule and  cost difficult to estimate. Yet, the scale of the technology development in  BMDS is unusually large, ranging from $2 billion to about $5 billion dollars  a year\u2014eventually comprising nearly half of MDA\u2019s budget by fiscal year  2012. The MDEB will have access to the budgets planned for these  programs over the next 5 or 6 years, each program\u2019s focus, and whether  the technology is meeting short-term key events or knowledge points. But  without some kind of baseline for matching progress with cost, the MDEB  will not know how much more time or money will be needed to complete  technology maturation. MDA\u2019s experience with the ABL program provides  a good example of the difficulty in estimating the cost and schedule of  technology development. In 1996, the ABL program believed that all ABL  technology could be demonstrated by 2001 at a cost of about $1 billion.  However, MDA now projects that this technology will not be demonstrated  until 2009 and its cost has grown to over $5 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDA Directed to Use Procurement Funding", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to further improve the transparency of MDA\u2019s acquisition  processes, Congress has directed that MDA\u2019s budget materials delineate  between funds needed for research, development, test and evaluation;  procurement; operations and maintenance; and military construction.Congress gave MDA the flexibility to field certain assets using research,  development, test and evaluation funding which allowed MDA to fund the  purchase of assets over multiple years. Congress recently restricted MDA\u2019s  authority and required MDA to purchase certain assets with procurement  funds. Using procurement funds will mean that MDA will be required to  ensure that assets are fully funded in the year of their purchase, rather  than incrementally funded over several years. Additionally, our analysis of  MDA data shows that incremental funding is usually more expensive than  full-funding, in part, because inflation decreases the buying power of the  dollar each year. For example, after reviewing MDA\u2019s incremental funding  plan for THAAD fire units and Aegis BMD missiles, we analyzed the effect  of fully funding these assets and found that the agency could save about  $125 million by fully funding their purchase and purchasing them in an  economical manner. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2008, Congress directed that MDA request procurement funding and  advanced procurement funding for long lead items in its fiscal year 2009  budget including funding for THAAD fire units and Aegis BMD SM-3  missiles. MDA did not request such funding because it slipped the  schedule for procuring THAAD fire units 3 and 4 by one year and because  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 was not  signed in time to allow MDA to adjust its budget request for SM-3 missiles.  However, in MDA\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget submittal, the agency intends  to incorporate a detailed plan of action and milestones to transition from  incremental funding to full funding beginning in fiscal year 2010 and for all  fiscal years thereafter."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Actions Recommended in Our Recent Report", "paragraphs": ["The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub.

DOD  stated that MDA already uses key knowledge points, technology levels,  and engineering readiness levels to assess the progress of technology  programs and that it will continue to investigate other ways of making  such assessments. DOD also noted that MDA\u2019s mission is to work with the  warfighter, rather than Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, to  determine that the BMDS is ready for fielding.  However, DOD stated that  MDA will continue to work with operational testers to strengthen the  testing of BMDS suitability and effectiveness.  We believe that DOD and  Congress would benefit from understanding the remaining cost and time  needed to complete a technology program, important information that  MDA\u2019s methods do not yet provide.  Since BMDS testing will continue to  serve both developmental and operational purposes, its scope should be  sufficient to enable the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation to  evaluate the system\u2019s operational effectiveness, suitability, and  survivability.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
