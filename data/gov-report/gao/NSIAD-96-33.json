During fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the total cost for maintaining these engines was about $1.1 billion of the $13 billion depot maintenance program. Depot repair of engines and engine components requires more funding than any other commodity that is not an end-item weapon system, such as an aircraft or ship. Engine overhaul costs represent about 8.5 percent of the total depot maintenance budget.", "Military engines are maintained and overhauled in an extensive network of military service depots, private sector engine manufacturers, and private sector repair activities, such as airlines and independent repair service companies. Of the 51 types of military engines used today, 28 are generally repaired in military depots and 23 almost exclusively by contractors. The engines maintained by the private sector generally have commercial as well as military applications. Generally, commercial counterpart engines repaired by the private sector support fewer aircraft and require less inventory than engines that are maintained in military depots. In recent years, private sector firms have sought more of the military engine workload. At the same time, excess capacity has also been increasing in military depots, as both numbers of military aircraft and engines as well as engine overhaul requirements have declined.", "As a part of this review, we analyzed DOD\u2019s approach to allocating engine depot repair between the public and private sectors. Engine maintenance has been the subject of recent congressional interest. Additionally, engines are DOD\u2019s largest and most costly commodity group. Further, one category of engines\u2014those with commercial counterparts\u2014are either identical or very similar to engines used in the private sector. These characteristics enhance their potential cost-effectiveness as candidates for privatization.

Appendix I provides a brief overview of the engine depot repair process, using a flow diagram and pictures.", "Depot-level maintenance is the third of the three maintenance levels used by the military services. Depot maintenance activities have historically had more extensive technical capability than the lower levels\u2014in terms of the facilities, equipment, and trained personnel. However, various programs initiated in recent years by the military have resulted in blending some maintenance activities among the various levels. For example, the Air Force implemented a two-level maintenance concept that significantly reduced the second level of maintenance at the operational unit for some systems, including engines. Under this concept, faulty engine components are shipped from the unit to Air Force depots, including the two engine repair depots. The work done in the two-level shops is considered depot-level repair and is performed by a combination of military, civilian, and contractor personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Engines With Commercial Counterparts", "paragraphs": ["DOD has depot-level capability to repair 28 different types of large turbine engines.

DOD also organically repairs many smaller gas turbine engines that provide auxiliary power to aircraft and ground support equipment. DOD contracts for most of the repair of 23 other engines, which power such aircraft as the KC-10, T-38, and C-9.", "Most of the 28 engines maintained in DOD\u2019s public depots are military-unique and not used in the commercial market place. Military-unique engines include the F100 engine, which powers the F-15 and F-16 aircraft, and the F404 engine, which powers the F/A-18 and F-117A aircraft. However, 10 of the 28 engines maintained in DOD depots are comparable to engines used in the private sector. In addition, the Air Force is considering developing repair capability for the F117 engine, which powers the C-17 aircraft and is currently supported by the manufacturer. It is similar to the commercial engine that powers the Boeing 757 aircraft.", "Table 1.1 shows the 11 military engines with commercial counterparts for which DOD has or is considering developing depot maintenance capability.", "In most cases where it repairs a military engine with a commercial counterpart, DOD owns a significant portion of the engines in existence. For example, DOD has 25 percent of the F108/CFM56 engines, 54 percent of the T56, 62 percent of the TF33/JT3D, 78 percent of the TF34/CF34, and 95 percent of the T53."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Declining Engine Depot Maintenance Requirements", "paragraphs": ["DOD depot maintenance workload requirements, including engines, have decreased from about 202 million direct labor hours in fiscal year 1987 to about 100 million direct labor hours projected for fiscal year 1996. Since geopolitical tensions eased in the late 1980s, changes in military strategy, reductions-in-force structure, and improved engine reliability have all contributed to decreased demand for engine repair requirements. The change in war-planning scenarios from a massive, protracted war in response to a Soviet invasion to shorter duration contingency scenarios also reduced the anticipated surge requirement for depot maintenance.", "Similarly, reductions in aircraft inventory have also reduced maintenance requirements. Between fiscal years 1985 and 1994, the services reduced their aircraft inventories from about 24,500 to 17,400. For example, the Air Force reduced its F-4 aircraft inventory from 1,597 to 61. Depot overhauls of the J79 engine, which supports the F-4 aircraft, also declined from over 500,000 direct labor hours in fiscal year 1986 to an estimated 0 for fiscal year 1997. Further reductions in aircraft inventories and associated engine repair requirements are expected as the services continue to phase out older weapon systems.", "In addition, improvements in technology have increased the reliability of turbine engines, reduced the number of depot-level overhauls, and reduced depot-level maintenance requirements. For example, three different engines have powered the KC-135 tanker aircraft. The first KC-135s were fitted with the J57 engine, which was later replaced with the TF33 engine. The Air Force is now replacing most of these engines with the F108. The F108 engine, with an unscheduled removal rate per  1,000 flying hours of 0.10, has 91 percent fewer unscheduled engine removals than the J57, which has an unscheduled engine removal rate of 1.16, and 79 percent fewer than the TF33, which has an unscheduled removal rate of 0.48.", "Similar engine reliability improvements have been achieved through modifications of other engines.

Additionally, DOD consolidated repair activities for most engine types at only one depot. As shown in table 1.2, 11 engine types were maintained at two or more depots in 1990. With only one exception, DOD now has only one organic depot-level repair site for each military engine. However, some engines are repaired both by a military depot and one or more private sector contractors.", "These workload consolidations began in 1990 as part of the DOD management review process and subsequent Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) decisions to close aviation depots. Specifically, Defense Management Report Decision 908 initially called for $3.9 billion in depot cost reductions over a 5-year period, but the target savings were later increased to $6.4 billion over a 7-year period. Efforts to achieve savings included consolidation, interservicing, and competitions between government depots and the private sector. Some of these efforts were superseded by the 1993 BRAC decision to close Alameda Naval Aviation Depot. For example, a single site for handling the T56 engine core workload was to be decided by a public-public competition between Alameda Naval Aviation Depot and San Antonio Air Logistics Center. Following the BRAC decision to close Alameda, the Navy transferred its T56/501K workload to the San Antonio Air Logistics Center.", "Despite these initiatives, DOD\u2019s engine depot repair facilities continue to have significant excess capacity. During the 1995 BRAC process, DOD\u2019s Joint Cross Service Group for Depot Maintenance noted that engines were among the five commodities with the greatest amount of excess capacity.

We visited each of the shops and reviewed the floor plans with industrial engineers and shop supervisors to validate the work position counts. Then we determined capacity using the computation method defined in DOD\u2019s Depot Maintenance Capacity and Utilization Measurement Handbook (DOD 4151.15-H), which expresses capacity in direct labor hours. This method calculates a product by multiplying work position counts by an availability factor (95 percent) and by annual productive hours (1,615), assuming a 1-shift, 40-hour workweek. We did not include Naval Aviation Depot, North Island, capacity data in our analysis because at the time of our visit, the engine repair shops were being relocated and work position counts could not be accurately determined.", "To determine excess capacity, we compared fiscal year 1997 projected workload requirements against our capacity calculations.

These repair activities included 2 engine manufacturers, 5 airlines, and 17 independent repair activities.", "The private repair activities reported their reserve capacity to repair military engines in terms of the number of whole engines they could overhaul annually. To compare the reserve capacity reported by the private sector to projected military engine workload, we converted the number of engines reported by the private sector to direct labor hours using the depot labor standard or the average number of direct labor hours used to overhaul each engine at the depot.

Core exists to minimize operational risks and to guarantee required readiness for these weapon systems. Core depot maintenance capabilities will comprise only the minimum facilities, equipment, and skilled personnel necessary to ensure a ready and controlled source of required technical competence. Depot maintenance for the designated weapon systems will be the primary workloads assigned to DOD depots to support core depot maintenance capabilities.", "Under the core concept, military requirements are driven by contingency scenarios developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The services must identify what weapon systems and equipment are necessary to meet these requirements as well as the level of depot maintenance that is required to support these systems. Where the services are certain that they must maintain control of depot support to minimize risk to combat commanders, capabilities are established and retained in organic maintenance depots.", "In November 1993, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense issued a policy memorandum that directed the services to quantify and report their depot maintenance core requirements by January 1994. The Secretary provided the services a methodology to follow in computing their core requirements. In defining core, DOD policy emphasized that core depot maintenance capability comprises only the minimum level of capability needed to support mission-essential weapon systems.", "Since core is the capability to support rather than the maintenance of specific weapon systems, this requirement does not apply to workload for specific systems. Thus, depot maintenance for some core engines could be privatized since the capability to repair the engines is similar to the same capability used to repair other core engines in the public depot.", "In addition, the policy memorandum stated that it is not core policy that all mission-essential hardware be maintained in a DOD depot. Private industry may maintain mission-essential weapon systems, if a service is satisfied that reliable sources of repair exist in the private sector to negate risk to the weapon system. For example, even though the KC-10 aircraft is a high priority mission-essential system required early in major regional conflicts, DOD contracted out the maintenance for the life of the aircraft. The KC-10 has a high degree of similarity with its commercial counterpart, the DC-10, which DOD believes mitigates the risk of contracting out the aircraft\u2019s maintenance.", "We asked depot officials to specify how much of their workload for military engines with commercial counterparts they considered to be core.

Revisions to this directive in 1982 continued this requirement. It also stated that, to the extent possible, a competitive industrial base for depot maintenance should be established. More specifically, it provided that contractor support should be considered when it would (1) improve the industrial base, (2) improve peacetime readiness and combat sustainability, (3) be cost-effective, or (4) promote contract incentives for reliability and maintainability.

Although the competition program is credited with significant savings, private contractors generally do not believe the program is fair. They cite as support the fact that Air Force depots won a high percentage of its competed workloads. Noting the Air Force\u2019s success, private sector companies\u2014particularly original equipment manufacturers\u2014believed the Air Force depots were not including all of their costs.

In the cases we reviewed, we found that repair sources for military-unique engines were limited to one commercial repair source\u2014the original equipment manufacturer\u2014whereas two or more private sector repair sources were generally available for commercial counterpart engines. Competition for a particular product or service significantly reduces the government\u2019s costs for products or services.", "Limited data available regarding contract maintenance costs for military-unique engines indicate that private sector repair is more costly than organic repair. For example, both the Air Force and a public accounting firm recently compared the cost-effectiveness of public versus private depot maintenance for the F404 engine, which powers the F-117 aircraft, and the F118 engine, which powers the B-2 aircraft. In both cases, the public depots were found to be a more cost-effective source of repair than the original engine manufacturers. In the case of the F404, the analysis resulted in the Defense Depot Maintenance Council transferring the engine workload to the Navy depot at Jacksonville, Florida, where the work will be done under an interservice agreement with the Air Force. The accounting firm\u2019s analysis of the F118 confirmed the Air Force\u2019s original source selection of the Oklahoma City depot. These examples indicate that privatization of repair for military-unique engines would likely be more costly than organic repair. The key reason is that this workload is awarded on a sole-source basis to the original equipment manufacturer.

In previous years, war-planning scenarios emphasized a large-scale, full mobilization, but current scenarios emphasize smaller, regional conflicts. This change, combined with reductions-in-force structure, has created significant excess capacity. As a part of DOD\u2019s 1995 base closure and realignment process, the Joint Cross Service Group on Depot Maintenance analyzed the capacity of 24 facilities to maintain and repair 16 commodities. It found that DOD\u2019s depots have over 3 million direct labor hours in excess engine repair capacity.

As indicated, we found the greatest percent of excess engine capacity at the Corpus Christi Army Depot and Cherry Point Naval Aviation Depot and the smallest percent at the Jacksonville Naval Aviation Depot. The excess capacity in the two Air Force engine depots averages about 42 percent.", "Actions that increase excess capacity and decrease the utilization of existing depots diminish their cost-effectiveness. For example, an organic depot with several thousand employees may incur fixed overhead costs, including the depot\u2019s share of base support costs, exceeding $100 million annually. When a military depot has excess capacity, moving workload out of this facility and into the private sector will result in increasing the share of overhead expense that all the remaining workload must support\u2014increasing the unit cost for all the units produced by that facility.
