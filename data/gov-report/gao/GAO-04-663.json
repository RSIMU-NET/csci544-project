GAO identified (1) the factors contributing to rural road fatalities, (2) federal and state efforts to improve safety on the nation's rural roads, and (3) the challenges that may hinder making improvements in rural road safety. GAO obtained information from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and other organizations with knowledge of these issues. In addition, GAO analyzed fatal crash data on rural roads from Department of Transportation databases and visited five states that account for about 20 percent of the nation's rural road mileage. GAO also contacted academic experts and examined legislative proposals for improving rural road safety. We provided copies of a draft of this report to the Department of Transportation for its review and comment. In discussing this report, agency officials noted that safety should be part of every project designed and built with federal-aid highway funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Four primary factors contribute to rural road fatalities--human behavior, roadway environment, vehicles, and the care victims receive after a crash. Human behavior involves the actions taken by or the condition of the driver and passengers. Human behaviors are important because almost 70 percent of the unrestrained (unbelted) fatalities between 2000 and 2002 occurred in rural crashes. Additionally, the majority of alcohol- and speeding-related fatalities occurred on rural roads. Roadway characteristics that contribute to rural crashes include narrow lanes, sharp curves, trees, and animals. Vehicle factors include problems that arise due to the design of vehicles and are important for both urban and rural roads. Care of crash victims also contributes to rural fatalities because of the additional time needed to provide medical attention and the quality of rural trauma care. In fiscal year 2003, FHWA provided about $27.4 billion in federal-aid highway funds to states. While many projects using these funds have safety features, the amount used for safety is not tracked. However, about $648 million of these funds went to the Hazard Elimination and Rail-Highway Crossings Programs and were specifically provided for safety purposes--about $330 million of which went to improve rural road safety. NHTSA provided about $671 million to states for activities that influence both rural and urban drivers' behavior in such areas as safety belt use, drunk driving, or speeding. States are ultimately responsible for selecting the projects to support with federal funding. The five states we visited used a portion of the funding received for rural road safety. Many challenges hinder efforts to improve rural road safety--for example, not all states have adopted safety belt and drunk driving laws that might curb behavior contributing to rural road fatalities. In addition, states are limited in using federal-aid highway funds for certain rural roads, and most rural roads are the responsibility of local governments that may lack the resources to undertake costly projects to improve road safety. Further, some states lack adequate crash data to support planning and evaluation of safety projects. Lastly, the nature of rural areas makes it difficult to provide adequate emergency medical care."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Traffic crashes are a major cause of death and injury in the United States.

Further, the rate of fatalities  per vehicle mile traveled on rural roads was more than twice the urban  fatality rate. The magnitude of rural road mileage and the widespread  dispersal of crashes makes preventing and responding to rural road crashes  difficult. The federal government provides funds for states to use in  addressing highway safety problems.

To meet  this requirement, we identified (1) the factors contributing to rural road  fatalities, (2) federal and state efforts to improve safety on the nation\u2019s  rural roads, and (3) the challenges that may hinder making improvements  in rural road safety. To identify the factors contributing to rural road  fatalities, we used an earlier GAO report, Highway Safety:  Research  Continues on a Variety of Factors That Contribute to Motor Vehicle  Crashes (GAO 03-436, March 2003) and supplemented it by obtaining  information from FHWA, NHTSA, and other organizations familiar with this  issue. In addition, we analyzed fatal crash data on rural roads from  Department of Transportation (DOT) databases. We assessed the reliability  of these databases and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report. To identify federal and state efforts to  improve rural road safety, we interviewed and obtained documentation  from officials in FHWA and NHTSA and visited five states that, in total,  accounted for about 20 percent of the nation\u2019s rural road mileage. To  identify challenges that may hinder making improvements in rural road  safety, in addition to interviewing the above officials, we contacted experts  from academia and from advocacy groups and reviewed various legislative  proposals that may help address the issues. For each of the selected studies  that are used in this report, we determined whether the study\u2019s findings  were generally reliable. To do so, we evaluated the methodological  soundness of the studies using common social science and statistical  practices.

Collector roads are designed for lower speeds and shorter trips and  generally link areas to arterial roads and interstates. They are typically two- lane roads that extend into residential neighborhoods. Local roads are any  roads below the collector system and may be paved or unpaved roadways  that provide access to farms, residences, and other rural property. As  shown in figure 2, local roads make up the majority of the nation\u2019s rural  roads.", "Rural roads have more fatalities and a greater rate of fatalities than urban  roads, when considering vehicle miles traveled. In 2002, of the 42,815  fatalities on the nation\u2019s roadways, 25,849 (60 percent) were on rural roads.

During the same period, the fatality rate on  urban roads declined about 54 percent.", "FHWA and NHTSA are two agencies within the U.S. Department of  Transportation responsible for road safety. FHWA\u2019s mission is to provide  financial and technical support to state, local, and tribal governments for  constructing, improving, and preserving the highway system. As part of this  mission, FHWA seeks to reduce highway fatalities and injuries through  research and by implementing technology innovations. In addition, its  Office of Safety develops and implements strategies and programs to  reduce the number and severity of highway crashes involving both  motorized and nonmotorized travelers on the nation\u2019s highways, streets,  bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and at intermodal connections. NHTSA\u2019s  mission is to reduce deaths, injuries, and economic losses resulting from  motor vehicle crashes. The agency sets and enforces safety performance  standards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment and provides  grants to state and local governments. NHTSA, among other things, also  investigates safety defects in motor vehicles, helps states and local  communities reduce the threat of drunk drivers, promotes the use of safety  belts and child safety seats, and provides consumer information on motor  vehicle safety topics. Under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), NHTSA provided the states with about $2.7 billion for  efforts to improve driver behaviors and safety data from fiscal year 1998  through fiscal year 2003.", "Other organizations such as the American Association of State Highway  and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Governors Highway Safety  Association also play important roles in highway safety. As an organization  representing state transportation departments, AASHTO provides  engineers with guidance on how to design safe and efficient roads through  a publication referred to as the Green Book.  In addition, AASHTO recently  published a special guide on alternative designs for very low-volume  roads.  Furthermore, in 1997 AASHTO also focused attention on improving  roadway safety by developing a Strategic Highway Safety Plan that  identified 22 key or emerging highway safety emphasis areas. Topics  included (1) aggressive and speeding drivers, (2) keeping vehicles on the  roadway and minimizing the consequences of leaving the roadway, and (3)  supporting better state coordination and planning for behavioral and  construction programs. For each of these areas, publications are being  developed under the National Cooperative Highway Research Program that  address the issues and potential countermeasures. Another organization  that plays a major role in highway safety is the Governors Highway Safety  Association, which represents the highway safety programs of states and  territories on the human behavioral aspects of highway safety. Areas of  focus include occupant protection, impaired driving, and speed  enforcement, as well as motorcycle, school bus, pedestrian and bicycle  safety, and traffic records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four Factors Contribute to Rural Road Fatalities", "paragraphs": ["One or more of four factors contribute to rural road fatalities\u2014human  behavior, roadway environment, vehicles, and the degree of care for  victims after a crash. Human behavioral factors involve actions taken by or  the condition of the driver and passenger of the automobile, including the  use or nonuse of safety belts, the effects of alcohol or drugs, speeding and  other traffic violations, and being distracted or drowsy when driving.  Roadway environment factors that contribute to rural road fatalities  include the design of the roadway (e.g., medians, lane width, shoulders,  curves, access points, lighting, or intersections); roadside hazards (e.g.,  utility poles, trees, and animals adjacent to the road); and roadway  conditions (e.g., rain, ice, snow, or fog). Vehicle factors include vehicle- related failures and vehicle design issues that contribute to a crash and are  important in both rural and urban crashes.

For  example, of the approximately 53,000 unrestrained (unbelted) vehicle  occupant fatalities that occurred from 2000 through 2002, about 36,000  or 68 percent occurred in rural areas. NHTSA research on safety belt use  in rural areas shows that rural areas are essentially similar to urban  areas in safety belt use rates. In 2002, NHTSA data showed about 73  percent belt use in rural areas and 72 percent in urban areas.", "Alcohol-impaired driving contributed to 27,775 rural road fatalities from  2000 through 2002\u2014about 63 percent of the 44,403 alcohol-related  fatalities nationwide. While, according to NHTSA data, there is little  difference between blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of rural and  urban drivers involved in fatal crashes, state officials told us that risks  from drinking and driving in rural areas are increased because of longer  driving distances and the lack of public transportation options available  to intoxicated drivers.", "From 2000 through 2002, about 62 percent of the nation\u2019s speeding  related fatalities were on rural roads, amounting to about 24,000 of the  39,000 fatalities where speed was a contributing factor, according to  NHTSA data. According to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety  officials, speed influences crashes by increasing the distance traveled  from when a driver detects an emergency until the driver reacts;  increasing the distance needed to stop; increasing the severity of an  accident (i.e., when speed increases from 40 to 60 miles per hour, the  energy released in a crash more than doubles); and reducing the ability  of the vehicles, restraint systems, and roadside hardware, such as  guardrails and barriers, to protect occupants.", "Drivers who are distracted or drowsy also contribute to rural crashes.", "For example, a 2002 NHTSA national survey found that drivers involved  in a distracted-related crash attribute their distraction to such items as  looking for something outside the car (23 percent of drivers in a  distracted-related crash), dealing with children or other passengers (19  percent), looking for something inside the car (14 percent), or another  driver (11 percent). A Virginia Commonwealth University pilot study of  distracted drivers found that for rural drivers in the study, crashes often  involved driver fatigue, insects striking the windshield or entering the  vehicle, and animals and unrestrained pet distractions. The study  found that in urban areas distracted driving crashes often involved  drivers looking at other crashes, traffic, or vehicles, or using cell  phones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Roadway Environment Factors Contribute to Rural Road Fatalities", "paragraphs": ["Roadway factors also contribute to rural road fatalities. Rural roads can be  narrow; have limited sight distance due to hills and curves; have small or  nonexistent shoulders; have no medians; and may have hazards or objects  near the roadway such as trees, utility poles, or animals. As a result of these  features, fatal crashes on two-lane rural roads are significant. For example,  FHWA reports that over 70 percent of single-vehicle run-off-the-road  fatalities occur on rural roadways and that about 90 percent of these were  on two-lane rural roads. Similarly, crashes involving vehicles crossing the  centerline and either sideswiping or striking the front end of oncoming  vehicles are a major problem in rural areas, accounting for about 20  percent of all fatal crashes on rural two-lane roads. In addition, crashes  with animals\u2014specifically larger animals such as deer and elk-\u2014are also  prevalent in rural areas. For example, according to the Deer-Vehicle Crash  Information Clearinghouse, there were more than 130,000 deer-vehicle  crashes reported in five states in 2000. In addition, a Highway Safety  Information System report examined five states\u2019 experiences with motor  vehicle collisions involving animals and found that from 1985 through 1990,  74 percent to 94 percent of reported crashes involving animals occurred on  rural roads. The report also found that collisions involving animals ranged  from about 12 percent to 35 percent of all reported crashes on two-lane  rural roads. Rural roadway conditions can also contribute to rural crashes  and resulting fatalities. Surface conditions that can impair a driver\u2019s ability  to control the vehicle include snow, ice, standing water, and oil, in addition  to such road surface features as potholes, ruts, and pavement edge drop- offs. Lack of lighting also contributes to rural road fatalities. For example, a  study performed for the Minnesota Department of Transportation found  that the installation of street lighting at isolated rural intersections reduced  both nighttime crash frequency (25 percent to 40 percent) and crash  severity (8 percent to 26 percent)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vehicle Design Contributes to Rural Road Fatalities", "paragraphs": ["The design of the vehicle can contribute to rural road fatalities. The wide  variances in vehicle sizes and weights, as well as vehicle configurations,  sometimes result in greater damage and injury to smaller vehicles and their  occupants if a collision occurs. For example, when heavy sport utility  vehicles (SUV) or pickup trucks collide with smaller cars, the occupants in  the lighter and lower vehicles are more likely to die as a result of the crash,  particularly if struck in the side. Vehicle design has been shown to affect  vehicle handling in particular types of maneuvers. In rural settings this is  important because the roads may be narrow and have sharp curves. The  design of the vehicle in these types of crashes can make a difference in  whether a run-off-the-road vehicle rolls over, one of the most serious types  of crashes. Almost three-fourths of fatal rollover crashes occur in rural  areas, according to a 2002 NHTSA study. In 2002, rollover crashes killed  10,666 occupants in passenger cars, pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans. A study  by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that examined single-vehicle  rollover crashes concluded that the combined rollover crash rate for  pickup trucks and SUVs was more than twice the rate for passenger cars.  In addition, a NHTSA study found that in 2002, nearly two-thirds of the  3,995 SUV occupant fatalities occurred in rollover crashes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Effective and Available Emergency Medical Services Contribute to Rural Road Fatalities", "paragraphs": ["Lack of effective and available emergency medical services (EMS) also  contribute to rural road fatalities.

This compares with 8  percent of the fatal crashes on urban highways where victims did not reach  a hospital within an hour. In addition, the Emergency Medical Services  Division Chief at NHTSA told us that providing adequate medical care in  rural areas is more challenging due, in part, to the lack of trauma services.  A 2001 GAO report found that rural areas are more likely to rely on  volunteers rather than paid staff, and these volunteers may have fewer  opportunities to maintain skills or upgrade their skills with training.   According to an opinion survey of state EMS directors in 2000, rural areas  received significantly less coverage by emergency medical technicians,  paramedics, enhanced 911 services, and emergency dispatchers. Finally, a  1995 Montana study concluded that the absence of an organized trauma  care system contributed to preventable deaths from mechanical trauma,  including motor vehicle crashes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Efforts to Improve Highway Safety Include Rural Roads", "paragraphs": ["Each year FHWA and NHTSA provide billions of dollars to states to  improve roadways and eliminate roadway hazards, as well as to improve  driver behavior.

In fiscal  year 2003, FHWA provided states and the District of Columbia with about  $27.4 billion in federal-aid highway funds. Under TEA-21, from fiscal year  1998 though fiscal year 2003, federal-aid highway funding totaled about  $167 billion. States use these funds to, among other things, construct new  roadways; maintain the interstate highway system through resurfacing,  restoring, rehabilitating, or reconstructing activities; and replace or  rehabilitate highway bridges. While many of these highway improvement  projects may include safety features that affect rural roads, the safety  features are not specifically segregated for reporting purposes. For  example, expanding a stretch of roadway to ease congestion could have an  added impact of improving safety but could be reported as reconstruction  or rehabilitation, depending on the actual project. In addition, construction  projects may include items that can improve or upgrade safety features  such as installing new guardrails or impact barriers but may not be  identified or accounted for as a safety improvement. However, the federal- aid highway funds include two specific safety programs\u2014Hazard  Elimination and Rail-Highway Crossings\u2014that can be used for rural road  safety improvements.

Highway safety projects built with these funds include construction  projects to eliminate highway design hazards, such as narrow lanes or  sharp curves; improve intersections; or improve rail-highway grade  crossings. Under these programs, states can spend funds to address safety  construction issues on any public state or local roadway. Nationwide,  about $1.4 billion, or 49 percent, of the funds spent by states were used for  rural purposes. For fiscal year 2003, about $648 million went to the states  for hazard elimination and highway-rail crossings programs\u2014about $330  million of which went to improve rural road safety.", "Under TEA-21, from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2003, NHTSA  provided about $2.7 billion to states and the District of Columbia for  programs addressing driving behavior through formula grants, incentive  grants, and penalty transfer funds.

Under the formula grants  program, about $859 million was provided to the states to carry out traffic  safety programs designed to influence drivers\u2019 behavior in such areas as  safety belt use, alcohol-impaired driving, regional traffic safety initiatives,  traffic records and safety data collection systems, and pedestrian safety.  Incentive grants of about $1.2 billion under TEA-21 were provided to states  for achieving improvements in safety belt use, reducing drunk driving, and  improving highway safety data. Penalty transfer of funds was required  under TEA-21 for states that did not adopt specific laws prohibiting open  alcohol containers in passenger compartments or setting minimum  penalties for repeat drunk driving offenders. Under these requirements,  states that are currently subject to either penalty must transfer 3 percent of  their federal-aid highway construction funds to the NHTSA programs. The  transferred funds can be used to support behavioral programs to limit  drunk driving or can be spent on highway hazard elimination projects. In  fiscal year 2004, 23 states were subject to one or both penalty transfer  programs. From fiscal year 2001, when the penalties began, through fiscal  year 2003, about $637 million has been transferred under this program.

FHWA also offers training and technical assistance to  states and others through its Resource Center offices in Baltimore, Chicago  (Olympia Fields), Atlanta, and San Francisco. For example, in 2003, the  Safety and Design National Technical Service Team from the Chicago  center conducted 23 different workshops, some of them multiple times, for  state and local officials. An example of a Resource Center activity that  pertained to rural roads was a 1-day workshop on low-cost safety  improvements. The workshop addressed more than 40 improvement  measures and how they might reduce crashes.", "FHWA also offers training to local communities through its Local Technical  Assistance Program. Under this program, FHWA established a center in  every state to provide technical assistance to local highway program  managers. In addition, seven centers have been established to provide  technical assistance for tribal governments. The centers provide training  courses, outreach visits, newsletters, and technical resources to local  highway managers. Program officials said they have a constant demand for  a number of safety-related courses. Examples of course topics include road  safety fundamentals, road safety audits, data collection, safety  management systems, and construction zone flagger training. In addition,  FHWA, along with the Federal Transit Administration, has funded a Safety  Conscious Planning training course offered to state DOT officials and  others that helps them integrate safety as a key planning factor. Lastly,  FHWA provides guidance to states by issuing standards for traffic signs and  signals in a publication called the Manual for Uniform Traffic Control  Devices. The manual sets minimum standards for topics like traffic sign  size, placement, support, and nighttime visibility. In 2000, FHWA revised  the manual and included a new section called \u201cTraffic Control Devices for  Low-Volume Roads.\u201d", "NHTSA provides technical assistance to state traffic safety programs  through its 10 regional offices. This assistance does not have a focus on  rural road safety but rather is intended to help states identify their most  important traffic safety problems, establish goals and performance  measures, and review annual safety plans and reports. NHTSA regional  offices provide training programs for state safety officials and encourage  them to participate in national programs like the \u201cClick It or Ticket\u201d safety  belt campaign. NHTSA staff from the regional offices and headquarters  also provide technical assistance to rural and other areas of the states by  participating in or supporting state assessments and forums on safety  topics like safety belt use, impaired driving, or data improvements. For  example, NHTSA\u2019s Region III provided local governments in their five  states and the District of Columbia with a communication kit for  conducting a sobriety checkpoint campaign. It included background  information on drinking and driving, suggestions for core messages that the  localities could share with news organizations, sample news releases for  increasing public awareness of drunk driving and the checkpoint  campaign, and suggestions for preparing op-ed articles in local  newspapers. In addition, NHTSA published \u201cPartners for Rural Traffic  Safety Action Kit\u201d in 2001, in conjunction with the National Rural Health  Association. This action kit is based on the experience of 15 rural  community demonstration sites that conducted 30-day campaigns to  increase safety belt use.

The task force is responsible for making both infrastructure and  behavioral improvement recommendations to address the safety issue  with these high-risk corridors. In addition, California is supporting a  Traffic Collision Reduction on County Roads Project. For this effort, the  Highway Patrol received $1.9 million from the California Office of  Traffic Safety to reduce crashes on county roads by increasing  enforcement of traffic violations that often lead to collisions:  speeding,  right-of-way violations, failing to drive on the right half of the road,  improper turning, and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  California also uses sobriety checkpoints to discourage drinking and  driving.", "Georgia\u2014Using FHWA hazard elimination funding, the state has  undertaken several roadway improvement programs that address  aspects of rural road safety.

A Georgia  official said that the run-off-the-road and animal crashes were  particularly prevalent in rural settings. A Georgia official said that the  state is adding shoulder rumble strips and centerline reflectors to help  reduce the run-off-the-road crashes, and, to reduce animal crashes, the  state is expanding the recovery zone beyond the clear zone along some  roads, culling deer herds, and researching light and sound devices to  warn drivers of deer presence.", "Minnesota\u2014State traffic safety officials have implemented several  construction and behavioral initiatives to improve rural road safety.

Twenty-nine of these states  have enacted secondary safety belt laws. Secondary belt laws allow  police to issue a safety belt citation only if the motorist is pulled over for  another infraction, such as speeding or an expired license tag. One state  allows occupants over 18 to not use safety belts.

As a result, low-cost  improvements are an option to be considered for many rural roads. For  example, FHWA has identified more than 40 low-cost improvements that  states can use on rural roads at high-crash locations.

About $25.3 million of these funds were provided for the Hazard  Elimination and Rail-Highway Crossing Programs. Using these funds, the  state has undertaken several roadway improvement programs that address  aspects of rural road safety. For example, Georgia identified four problem  areas that it focused on in 2003\u2014run-off-the-road crashes, intersection  crashes, car-train crashes, and animal crashes. A Georgia official said that  the run-off-the-road and animal crashes were particularly prevalent in rural  settings. He said that they are adding shoulder rumble strips and centerline  reflectors to help reduce the run-off-the-road crashes, and to reduce animal  crashes they are expanding the recovery area along some roads, culling  deer herds, and researching light and sound devices to warn drivers of deer  presence. In addition, Georgia is developing a Lane Departure Strategic  Action Plan with the goal of reducing the lane departure serious injury and  death rate from 4.93 per 100 million miles traveled in 2003 to 3.29 in 2008  and preventing 750 serious injuries and deaths annually. A draft of this plan  recognizes that roadway departures on rural highways are a predominate  concern. To meet this goal, Georgia is developing an approach that will use  low-cost construction improvement; corridor enforcement, education, and  engineering enhancements; local lane departure safety initiatives, targeted  use of medium- to high-cost improvements at high-crash locations, and  statewide initiatives to improve safe driver behaviors.", "According to Georgia officials, the state has also replaced its safety data  system. It hopes to upgrade the current system of recording crash locations  by use of more accurate global positioning technology at the crash scene,  which would help them better identify problem areas throughout the state.

The program  provides grants to localities that work with safety officials to coordinate a  plan to reduce traffic fatalities. Other behavioral initiatives include the  following:  NightCAP is a program involving concentrated alcohol patrols  scheduled in conjunction with local events that serve alcohol, for  example, music festivals that attract big crowds and where alcohol is  sold or allowed to be consumed. Local, county, and state law  enforcement patrol roads to look particularly for drivers showing signs  of impairment. Releases are sent out to local press and broadcast media  informing the local population that enforcement will be present during  the event. In fiscal year 2003, $615,000 of federal funding was spent on  the NightCAP program. About 50 percent of the events were in rural  areas of Minnesota.", "Safe & Sober is a project involving municipal and county law  enforcement agencies that target impaired driving and occupant  protection issues through a combination of enhanced law enforcement  and publicity.
