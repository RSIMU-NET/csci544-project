For example, when Congress legislated the use of the CPI to automatically increase Social Security payments, it indicated that this indexation was to offset increases in the cost of living.", "According to BLS, the CPI is not a cost-of-living index but measures the change in prices of a fixed market basket of goods and services. However, the CPI has been used in various ways that are related to the cost of living. For example, the CPI is used as an escalator to adjust income payments, tax brackets, and deductions for personal exemptions. Although some elements of the CPI reflect cost-of-living concepts, the CPI was not designed as a cost-of-living index. To date, the federal government has not developed a comprehensive cost-of-living index.", "The CPI tracks the change in prices of a fixed market basket of goods and services purchased directly by urban consumers. These purchases are for food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation, entertainment, medical services, and other goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. Only expenditures made by consumers are captured in the CPI.", "The CPI does not attempt to measure all changes in the cost of consumption needed for an individual to maintain a constant level of utility, that is, consumer satisfaction. When consumers face rising prices, and especially when some prices rise faster than others, consumers tend to alter their purchasing patterns to maintain as high a living standard as possible. Because the CPI holds the \u201cmarket basket\u201d constant and does not account for what consumers would pay when they change the amounts they buy, or substitute one product for another, it does not measure consumers\u2019 cost of living. The CPI, therefore, is not a cost-of-living index.", "A comprehensive cost-of-living index would be broader in coverage than an index based on consumer expenditures or consumer budgets. In theory, a cost-of-living index would include purchased goods and services; the use of semidurable and durable goods, such as houses and automobiles, owned or rented; free goods of nature; and government-provided goods and services. However, the components of an actual cost-of-living index may vary and there is no single, comprehensive measure of the cost of living.", "Some government-provided goods and services, such as public mass transit, that charge for the service are included in the CPI. However, other items that would be in a comprehensive cost-of-living index, particularly public and free goods of nature, are excluded from the CPI because they cannot be readily measured and consumers do not directly pay for their use."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), within the Department of Labor, produces the CPI by measuring the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a fixed market basket of consumer goods and services.

The items selected for the market basket, such as potatoes, are to be priced each month at retail outlets, such as grocery stores, in urban areas throughout the country. According to BLS, in 1995, approximately 30,000 outlets were visited each month, with prices collected for 94,000 items.", "The CPI is used as a measure of price changes to make economic decisions in the private and public sectors. For example, landlords use the CPI to adjust rental payments for the effects of inflation. According to BLS, the CPI has three major uses: (1) indicator of inflation for policymaking and economic decisionmaking; (2) escalator for wages, income payments, and tax brackets to preserve the purchasing power of people receiving government transfer payments and to adjust the tax burden so that people pay in inflation-adjusted dollars; and (3) deflator of selected economic statistical data series to make adjustments to show real changes in the data over time. For additional information about the uses and construction of the CPI, see appendix II.", "The CPI was initiated during World War I, when rapid increases in the prices of goods and services, particularly in shipbuilding centers, made such an index essential for calculating cost-of-living adjustments in wages.", "In 1921, BLS began regular publication of an index representing the expenditures of urban wage and clerical workers, which was then called the Cost-of-Living Index. The name of the index was changed to the CPI following controversy during World War II over the index\u2019s validity as a measure of the cost of living. According to BLS, it has always been a measure of the changes in prices for goods and services purchased for family living.", "Major revisions were made to the CPI about every 10 years to update the fixed market basket; the next major revision is scheduled to be released in January 1998. Because people\u2019s buying habits changed, new studies were made of what goods and services people were purchasing and major revisions of the CPI were made in 1940, 1953, 1964, 1978, and 1987. In the 1978 major revision, several changes were made, including the publication of a new index for all urban consumers\u2014CPI-U. According to BLS, the CPI-U, which represents the expenditures of about 80 percent of the population, takes into account the buying patterns of professional employees, part-time workers, the self-employed, the unemployed, and retired people, as well as those previously covered in the CPI. BLS continued publication of the original index, the CPI-W, which represents the expenditures of urban wage and clerical workers, about 32 percent of the population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Change to the CPI Recommended in 1961", "paragraphs": ["In 1961, the Price Statistics Review Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, chaired by George Stigler, identified conceptual problems with the CPI and addressed issues concerning the measurement over time of durable goods, such as housing. The Stigler committee acknowledged that the CPI\u2019s original purpose was to measure average price changes of a fixed market basket of goods and services over time, which could measure the change in consumers\u2019 standard of living if the marketplace did not change. However, given that consumers\u2019 tastes change over time, or that higher quality goods at lower prices may become available, the committee determined that a fixed market basket of goods and services did not realistically represent a consumer\u2019s standard of living. The Stigler committee recommended that the conceptual framework of the CPI be modified to represent a cost-of-living index because the CPI was being used in the private sector as a cost-of-living measure. Specifically, the committee recommended that the asset-price approach for measuring homeownership costs be replaced with an approach that determined the cost of consuming a flow of services generated by durable goods like houses. A flow-of-services approach would measure the cost of consuming housing rather than the change in the investment value of a house that the asset-price approach measured.", "According to BLS, the Stigler committee\u2019s effort was the last comprehensive review of price indexes. At the time we were doing our work, a CPI commission appointed by the Senate Finance Committee was conducting a study on the CPI\u2019s accuracy as a measure of the cost of living. The commission issued an interim report in September 1995. According to the interim report, the commission\u2019s formation and charter were motivated by concern that the CPI misstates inflation and leads to inappropriate changes in federal individual income tax brackets and federal benefits. The interim report discusses categories of potential bias in the CPI, such as substitution and quality change.", "The commission\u2019s interim estimate was that the CPI overstates inflation by 1.0 percent per year, which fell within a range of 0.7 to 2.0 percent.

We chose 10 housing measurement experts from a candidate list of more than 50 names; we also chose 10 individuals to serve as medical care measurement experts from a candidate list of more than 50 names. To obtain diverse candidate lists, we conducted a literature review and asked for nominations of potential experts from those experts in the field and representatives of BLS that we met with during our initial discussions. We then contacted the nominated individuals and asked for their nominations of experts. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, we excluded individuals from the lists who were current political appointees, current BLS employees, and previous BLS administrators responsible for making CPI methodological changes. In selecting the experts, we first selected those who were nominated more frequently than the others and then randomly chose thereafter. We verified that these selections included experts from academic and user communities, such as the American Medical Association, and that the selections contained at least one expert suggested by BLS.

BLS staff considered the two methods to be equally powerful in concept; however, problems raised over implementation of the user cost method outweighed its attractiveness. A user cost index measures total cost to owners living in their homes by adding the various explicit costs, such as payments for mortgage interest and property taxes, and implicit costs, such as depreciation, which homeowners incur in providing shelter for themselves. The user cost approach was abandoned after much review because it involved estimating the appreciation or depreciation value of a house over time and the cost of not having access to equity in the house. BLS noted that calculating such estimates was difficult because of substantial variations in housing data. BLS also found that the method sometimes provided some peculiar results.", "Rental equivalence, on the other hand, was easier to explain to the public and the users.

Therefore, it was not changed.", "BLS, however, decided to continue research and consultation and, in 1980, began publication of experimental indexes that represented alternative homeownership concepts.

In this case, cost shifting may occur when the government does not reimburse health care providers for full cost of services to Medicare patients, and providers try to recoup the difference by increasing the costs to their private-pay patients (e.g., those paying for services themselves). CBO found that Medicare reimbursement in the early 1990s paid for 88 percent of the costs of covered services, compared with full reimbursement during the mid-1980s. CBO observed that the CPI for out-of-pocket medical care costs increased faster than the price index for Medicare during the mid-1980s to early 1990s because of cost shifting. The study suggests that the CPI overstates the rate of inflation because it fails to capture the price paid by the federal government.", "However, HCFA disputes CBO\u2019s findings on cost shifting.

A few of the experts said that cost shifting does not occur between government-provided programs and other payers and cited research on cost shifting in Illinois and California hospitals. The study of Illinois hospitals supported CBO\u2019s findings that hospitals offset most of the rise in unreimbursed Medicare costs during the 1980s by generating higher revenues from private payers, which were cited in the background paper sent to the medical care experts.
