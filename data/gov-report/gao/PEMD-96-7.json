Public health efforts to prevent heart disease have emphasized reducing risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and elevated blood cholesterol levels. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in 1985 to encourage Americans to modify their diet and lifestyle and to provide clinical guidelines to help health care professionals identify and treat persons whose risk of heart disease is high because their cholesterol levels are high. The NCEP guidelines suggest that 52 million American adults are candidates for dietary treatment and that 9 million to 18 million of these have cholesterol levels that are sufficiently high to warrant drug treatment.", "High cholesterol is now widely recognized by the scientific community and the general public as an important risk factor for heart disease. Physicians and the public are generally aware of the need to lower cholesterol, and treating patients by lowering their cholesterol has met with some success. National survey data indicate that the proportion of adults whose cholesterol is high (greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl) declined from 26 percent to 20 percent between 1976 and 1991. The NCEP guidelines have contributed to this decline, but key aspects of them have been debated since the mid-1980s. A number of critics have questioned whether the available scientific evidence clearly demonstrates that the benefits of treatment outweigh any possible health risks and whether the benefits are broad enough to support widespread screening and treatment of the population as the NCEP guidelines advocate.", "Concerned about the translation of medical knowledge into national policy and about the high costs of cholesterol treatment, the former Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology asked us to review the clinical trials evidence that was used to support the development of the NCEP guidelines. The guidelines were developed from a broad set of research that included not only clinical trials but also epidemiological, animal, pathologic, and genetic studies. We were asked to review the clinical trials because they are uniquely designed to assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce the incidence of a disease.", "The equivocal results of the many individual clinical trials that have been conducted over the past 30 years, however, have made it difficult to determine the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering treatments in preventing CHD. Several trials have shown clear reductions in heart disease rates for persons who were treated, but many trials showed no improvement either because the types of treatment were not particularly effective in lowering cholesterol or because the studies were not large enough to adequately measure the expected benefits.", "Recently completed studies called meta-analyses, which quantitatively combine the results of many individual trials, provide new insights into the interpretation of the overall benefits and risks of cholesterol-lowering treatments. Therefore, we examined the benefits and risks of lowering cholesterol reported from meta-analyses of available clinical trials. We report these and the results of two recently completed clinical trials that used newer, more effective drug treatments that were not included in the published meta-analyses. These trials provide important new evidence regarding cholesterol treatment and the reduction of CHD. In addition, we assessed the extent to which the trials provide information on different population subgroups, and we determined whether the clinical trials that are currently planned are likely to fill any data gaps that exist."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Nearly half a million persons die from heart disease each year.

Taken together, these figures provide a strong rationale for prevention and treatment.", "Many factors can contribute to the development of CHD. A heart attack\u2014a temporary interruption of blood flow to the heart\u2014stems partly from the chronic buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries. For example, as figure 1 shows, there is a continuous and upward-sloping association between higher cholesterol levels and the incidence of CHD. Some of the best-known risk factors, such as high blood cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and physical inactivity, can be treated or modified; others, such as age and family history of heart disease, cannot."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The National Cholesterol Education Program", "paragraphs": ["National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) education campaigns address several of the modifiable risk factors, including high blood cholesterol levels, smoking, obesity, and hypertension. As a result of an NIH consensus development conference in 1984, NHLBI established NCEP to inform the public of the risks associated with cholesterol and to provide guidelines for physicians on how to manage and reduce those risks. Accordingly, NCEP both promotes the reduction of cholesterol levels in the general population through lifestyle changes and encourages the identification of persons whose cholesterol is high as candidates for intensive treatment to lower it.", "In the latter, high-risk approach, the NCEP guidelines recommend that all adults be tested for cholesterol at least once every 5 years. Test results are used to classify each person free of CHD into one of three groups: desirable, borderline-high, or high total cholesterol levels. Taking other risk factors into consideration, physicians then identify candidates for further testing (to determine low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels) and cholesterol-lowering treatment. The first line of intervention against high cholesterol levels is diets that emphasize lowering the consumption of fat (particularly saturated fat) and dietary cholesterol. Prescription drugs are advised if cholesterol goals are not met through diet. For most patients, treatment is maintained over the course of a lifetime in order to keep cholesterol levels down.", "NCEP revised several elements of the guidelines for adults in 1993, principally by (1) including age with regard to gender in determining risk status and in making treatment decisions; (2) increasing the emphasis on screening and treating persons whose risk of CHD is high, such as elderly persons and those who already have evidence of CHD; and (3) recognizing the importance of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as an independent risk factor for CHD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Controversy on Cholesterol Policy", "paragraphs": ["Debate after the NCEP guidelines were issued focused on the efficacy of lowering cholesterol, on its possible risks, and on the advisability of screening for cholesterol and lowering it among the many population subgroups that had not been included in the trials the guidelines had been based on. Additional, more recent data have brought greater agreement that cholesterol treatment helps prevent deaths among persons who have a history of CHD. Controversy remains, however, on how useful cholesterol-screening is to the broader population of healthy people. The American College of Physicians, professionally representing 85,000 U.S. internists, recently published guidelines under which groups for whom cholesterol-screening has no proven benefit would not be screened.", "While there is considerable agreement about the risks associated with high cholesterol, concerns have been raised about the extent to which cholesterol-lowering treatments reduce the rates of death from CHD and from all causes. Some researchers argue that the clinical trials have shown no difference in total fatalities between groups of people who received treatment and those who did not and that cholesterol-lowering treatments may increase the number of deaths from non-CHD causes. Advocates of the NCEP guidelines argue that the trials were not designed to be large enough or long enough to assess overall mortality; they say that the increases in rates of non-CHD deaths within the treatment groups are likely to have resulted from chance or specific treatments rather than from any adverse effects of lowering cholesterol.", "Because the clinical trials focused almost exclusively on men who had either existing CHD or high cholesterol or both, they provide little information about anyone whose risk of heart disease is lower. Some researchers and health policy analysts therefore suggest that the U.S. guidelines should be more limited in scope, as they are in some other nations. Advocates of the current guidelines, however, believe that some trial data and other, nonclinical trial research, such as epidemiological and laboratory studies, allow the generalization that if cholesterol-lowering benefits the tested groups, it will benefit others."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["As we stated previously, the main objective of our study was to examine the NCEP guidelines\u2019 clinical-trials base of evidence regarding cholesterol-lowering treatment. We limited our scope to mainly randomized clinical trials that, by virtue of their design features, provide the best evidence for assessing the effectiveness of interventions to reduce the incidence of a disease. Other important research was also used in developing the NCEP guidelines. For example, many epidemiological studies have compared population groups across nations, monitored the health status of entire community populations, and assessed changes in the health outcomes of recent immigrants. These studies have increased knowledge about the link between diet, elevated cholesterol levels, and increased risk of CHD. Because we did not review other types of cholesterol-related research, we did not evaluate or report the overall adequacy or utility of the scientific support for the guidelines.", "We reviewed the clinical outcomes of cholesterol-lowering trials through the published results of 15 meta-analyses. The meta-analyses, which statistically summarize the results of a number of individual trials, give an overall assessment of treatment outcomes. By combining the results of several trials, meta-analyses can increase statistical power and the precision of results. Within certain methodological limits, they also provide a means of comparing different subgroups of trials and of exploring issues in ways that individual trials, which may be constrained by their design or intent, cannot.", "The many clinical trials that have evaluated cholesterol-lowering treatments represent diverse types of treatment, health characteristics, overall sample sizes, duration of trial and follow-up, and outcomes. The main treatments consisted of different diets and drugs (alone or in combination). Some studies focused on persons who had existing symptoms of CHD (secondary prevention trials); others concentrated on those who had no evidence of CHD (primary prevention trials); a few combined both. Although virtually all the trials were designed to assess CHD outcomes, not all measured and reported the same outcome variables.", "The meta-analyses that combined the numerical results of these trials are also diverse. They used different rules for deciding what trials to include and exclude; in fact, all excluded one type of trial or another. Most of the meta-analysts, for example, excluded trials that used more than one intervention to treat persons who had multiple risk factors, and most also excluded the hormone trials because the type of hormone treatment they used is no longer recommended for men. As a result, the meta-analyses included as few as 6 to as many as 35 trials.", "To determine the benefits and risks of cholesterol-lowering treatments, we present the results of the meta-analyses. We examined the similarities and differences among them, in terms of the individual trials they included and their analyses. We then compared reported odds ratios (a measure of the relative difference in outcomes between persons who were treated and those who were not treated in the trials) and determined the extent to which there was agreement or disagreement in the direction and statistical significance of the results.", "To address the issue of the coverage and comprehensiveness of the clinical trials data, we identified the demographic and risk-related characteristics of participants in trials included by meta-analysts, the types of treatment they received, and the outcomes. In the same vein, to identify the important data gaps that others have found, we reviewed NHLBI documents, medical literature, and other sets of guidelines developed elsewhere. We also identified and reviewed the designs of ongoing and planned trials in order to determine which data gaps may be filled in the near future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principal Findings", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Benefits and Risks of Lowering Cholesterol", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nonfatal and Fatal CHD Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["The meta-analyses we reviewed consistently reported a statistically significant reduction in the rates of nonfatal heart attacks for the trial participants who were treated for high cholesterol compared to those who did not receive treatment.

All the meta-analyses reported a reduction in the rate of coronary death among the participants who were treated compared to those who were not but not as great a relative reduction as that in nonfatal outcomes. Also, a different pattern is apparent for the death rate of participants who were treated and had a history of CHD compared to participants who were treated and did not. For those who had a history, most of the meta-analyses found a significant reduction favoring the treatment groups. For those who did not, the meta-analyses that examined CHD deaths point in the direction of a small reduction but none found it statistically significant.", "The lack of a statistically significant reduction in the rate of death among participants in the primary prevention trials may be because the trials generally lowered cholesterol levels by only a modest amount and the number of events attributable to CHD during the trials was so small that detecting statistical differences between the treatment and nontreatment groups was difficult. Several of the recent meta-analyses found that the degree to which cholesterol is lowered is related to reductions in CHD events among the trials. For example, one study reported that when cholesterol was lowered by 10 percent or more, deaths from CHD fell significantly, by 13 percent, and another reported that nonfatal heart attacks and CHD deaths fell by 18 percent. Another meta-analysis found that lowering cholesterol by 12 percent or more corresponded to a 27-percent fall in the death rate from CHD.", "The extent to which the rate of death from CHD falls is also associated with the level of risk for CHD that participants have at the start of a trial. In one meta-analysis, participants in primary and secondary trials were categorized according to higher, medium, and lower levels of risk. The results showed a significant 26-percent fall in the rate of death from CHD for those in the higher-risk category but no significant benefit for those in the medium- and lower-risk categories. The higher-risk category was dominated by participants who had a history of CHD (secondary prevention trials), whereas the lower-risk category was dominated by participants who did not (primary prevention trials)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Non-CHD and Total Fatalities", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which overall survival rates improve from lowering cholesterol has been addressed mainly in the meta-analyses.

The meta-analyses similarly point toward an increase within the secondary prevention trials, but only one found it to be statistically significant.", "When the trial data are aggregated through the meta-analyses, total fatality rates increase among treated participants who had no evidence of CHD (see figure 5). However, none of the meta-analyses found these rates to be statistically greater among participants who were treated than among those who were not. The meta-analyses found a small relative decrease in total fatalities for participants who were treated and had a history of CHD; only one found it to be statistically significant (see figure 5). That total fatalities did not fall significantly after cholesterol-lowering treatment may be because fatality rates from non-CHD causes were high among these participants. These high rates were large enough to cancel out the modest reduction in CHD deaths after cholesterol-lowering treatment.", "Some analysts explain the increase in non-CHD fatalities as a matter of chance. Others speculate that lowering cholesterol itself produces these results. Still others point to the side effects of one or more of the drugs used for treatment. Although the meta-analyses have not resolved this issue\u2014because non-CHD deaths were not as carefully reported in some of the individual trials as were deaths from CHD\u2014they have shed some light and have identified areas that warrant further investigation.", "When one meta-analyst differentiated between the trials whose participants had higher, medium, and lower risk for CHD, deaths from all causes fell significantly among those who were at higher risk for CHD and received cholesterol-lowering treatment, whereas deaths increased significantly for those who were at lower risk. Furthermore, a few other meta-analyses have shown that the more that cholesterol is lowered, the greater is overall survival.

The results of both trials are consistent with the several meta-analyses that found that greater reductions in cholesterol yielded greater reductions in CHD events.", "The 4S trial is the first to find that lowering cholesterol can significantly reduce the total fatality rate of cardiac patients who are at very high risk for heart attack. The WOSCOPS trial found that lowering cholesterol lowered CHD fatalities, although this fell short of statistical significance. There were no increases in non-CHD fatality, and total fatalities fell. The reduction in CHD deaths in 4S means that 29 patients diagnosed with CHD would have to be treated with simvastatin at the trial dosages for 5.4 years (the median length of the trial) to prevent one CHD death. Given the WOSCOPS trial data, 143 middle-aged men with no evidence of a previous heart attack would have to be treated for 5 years to prevent one death from cardiovascular causes.", "Another concern in the controversy is that lowering cholesterol may simply substitute one cause of death for another. The meta-analyses summarizing most past trials found that lowering cholesterol had the clearest benefit among men who had been diagnosed with CHD, that the magnitude of coronary benefits is related directly to the degree to which cholesterol is lowered, and that higher rates of non-CHD fatality are likely to be associated with specific treatments. The 4S and WOSCOPS trials, which did not find a greater risk of death from non-CHD causes, support the meta-analytic findings that it is particular treatments to lower cholesterol, rather than the lowering itself, that increase non-CHD fatality rates.

The meta-analyses also show that men with moderate-to-high cholesterol levels and no history of heart disease have lower rates of nonfatal heart attacks but no statistically significant reductions in rates of CHD death or total fatalities as a result of cholesterol-lowering treatment. 3. The trials generally have not evaluated the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering treatment for several important population groups, such as women, elderly men and women, and minority men and women. Thus, they provide little or no evidence of benefits or possible risks for these groups. 4. Two recent trials using a new drug class, the statins, show greater reductions in coronary events with their greater reductions in cholesterol and no increase in non-CHD fatalities.

We recommend that the director of NHLBI take steps to closely monitor these trials, evaluate their outcomes, and determine whether additional trials should be planned in order to fill in data presently lacking on women, elderly men and women, minority men and women, and persons whose cholesterol levels are relatively low or who otherwise are members of low-risk groups."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["Officials from NHLBI reviewed a draft of this report and provided the written comments that are reprinted in appendix VI.

We agree that these recent trials did produce relatively large CHD reductions compared to previous trial results, and we have tried to reflect this in our report.

These studies are important because they enlarged our knowledge of how diet, cholesterol, and the risk of CHD are linked. However, only randomized clinical trials are uniquely designed to attribute potential reductions in CHD specifically to cholesterol-lowering interventions.", "However, the individual trials differed in the collection and reporting of outcome variables. Few of them were designed to respond to the debate about the ability of cholesterol-lowering to extend the life span; they often had too few participants or were too short in duration.

Meanwhile, men whose total cholesterol was between 213 and 271 mg/dl experienced 63 percent of the CHD deaths, by far the majority. Thus, any who would make national cholesterol policy must determine whether to focus on (1) physician- directed cholesterol-lowering efforts at the highest end of the cholesterol range, where men have the greatest individual likelihood of having a heart attack, or (2) preventive activity in the middle range, where most heart attacks occur but individual risk is much lower.

If dietary therapy does not successfully lower LDL to target levels, the physician may then consider cholesterol-lowering drugs, which are usually taken indefinitely.", "Beyond this schematic, the guidelines advise physicians generally for certain subgroups. They urge more-vigorous efforts to lower the cholesterol of CHD patients and elderly persons, in both of whom CHD fatality rates are high. For groups with fewer CHD fatalities, such as premenopausal women (who are protected by higher HDL levels than men) and men younger than 45, the guidelines urge that drugs be delayed in favor of dietary intervention.

As we noted in figure IV.2, NCEP\u2019s separation of desirable cholesterol (or up to 200 mg/dl) from borderline-high cholesterol (200-239 mg/dl) places many persons who are at moderate risk on a route to physician-directed treatment. However, NCEP also refines the cholesterol levels requiring dietary treatment or drugs, as do several other policies: they assign more-intensive action to groups whose CHD rate is high and less-intensive action to groups whose CHD rate is low. This focuses the most intensive preventive interventions on the patients who are most likely to benefit.", "Another point of comparison between the policies is their willingness to generalize from the data on the populations studied in the randomized clinical trials. Most of the policies, including NCEP\u2019s, are based not only on the clinical trials but also on observational research that did not test an intervention or use controlled designs. This research included autopsy reports, cross-country comparisons, community studies, migration studies, and the like.

Since the 1980s, applying meta-analysis to health and medical research has been viewed as a research process in its own right.

In the absence of a constant bias pervading a whole set of trials, the bias of any one analyst within the set is minimized.", "NIH has paid considerable attention to the use of meta-analysis in health and medical research, as evidenced by its 1986 Workshop on Methodological Issues in Overviews of Randomized Clinical Trials. In June 1994, NHLBI sponsored a workshop specifically on meta-analyses of cholesterol-lowering trials. NCEP included meta -analyses in the evidentiary sources it cited in support of the Adult Treatment Panel II guidelines. The federal legislation that established the Agency for Health Care Policy Research required that guidelines on clinical practice be based on systematic reviews of research evidence.", "Our task for this report was to provide an overview of the clinical trials evidence that had been used, among other evidence, to support the NCEP guidelines. Given that, and in view of the conflicting results among individual trials, we believe that our decision to systematically display and discuss the results of the meta-analyses that synthesized results across trials on the five health outcomes we were interested in was an appropriate and efficient way to summarize this large body of data.", "Although the meta-analysts we studied differed in what they included and excluded, most of them excluded outmoded treatments such as hormone treatment in men. We have stated in the report that clinical trials using the more recently prescribed statin drugs are not well represented in the meta-analyses we reviewed. They do not include, for example, the results of 4S or WOSCOPS. However, they do include, to a greater or lesser degree, all the cholesterol-lowering randomized clinical trials that were available when the Adult Treatment Panel II guidelines were published. 2. Table II.2 displays the odds ratios for CHD, non-CHD, and total fatalities. Across the meta-analyses that examined primary prevention trials, we found no statistically significant differences in CHD fatality rates between treatment and nontreatment groups. Further, a statistically significant increase in the non-CHD fatality rate for treated participants was in fact obtained in 5 of the 6 meta-analyses that examined this outcome. The failure to achieve statistically significant reductions in fatality rates from all causes in primary prevention trials should be viewed in the light of Gould\u2019s 1995 meta-analysis, which shows an adverse effect for treatment with fibrates. This drug class predominates in primary prevention trials using drug interventions. 3. Terge Pedersen and other 4S investigators have cautioned that the study\u2019s results should not be extrapolated to studies using other statin drugs, given differences in the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of various drugs. However, we note that both the 4S and WOSCOPS trials\u2014which showed no statistical differences between treatment and nontreatment groups in deaths from noncardiovascular causes\u2014support meta-analysis findings that increased non-CHD fatality rates in treatment groups were associated not with lowering cholesterol but with particular cholesterol-lowering treatments. We agree that safety and efficacy have been demonstrated for simvastatin and pravastatin for the types of primary and secondary patients who participated in these trials. It is also important to recognize that patients may be expected to continue with drug treatment (especially for primary prevention) for a period considerably longer than the 5-year duration of these trials, even while information is not yet complete about the long-term safety of the statin drugs. 4. A consideration of the cost-effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering treatment must also account for costs associated with prevention. For example, the 3.5-percent absolute CHD mortality risk reduction in 4S means that to prevent the death of one patient diagnosed with CHD, an estimated 29 patients would have to be treated with simvastatin at trial dosages. The WOSCOPS authors estimate that 1,000 middle-aged men with hypercholesterolemia and no prior evidence of myocardial infarction would have to be treated for 5 years to prevent 7 deaths from cardiovascular causes. They note that such findings compare favorably with treatment for mild hypertension in middle-aged persons. Nevertheless, any cost-benefit ratio will be less in a primary prevention setting than in a secondary prevention setting, because patients are treated whose risk levels are lower. 5. Clinical trials do constitute the most important type of evidence for the benefit of a medical intervention, because less-rigorously designed cross-country comparisons and other descriptive studies may be confounded by many factors. However, the largest portions of the U.S. population have not been well-represented in cholesterol-lowering trials, including among others women, women and men minorities, young men, elderly persons, and persons with cholesterol levels lower than 250 mg/dl. Past cholesterol-lowering trials have usually been conducted with middle-aged, high-risk, white men and are thus limited in how well they can comment on the benefits of lowering cholesterol for others. When others have been included in trials, the data sets they provide are usually too small to analyze, leaving in question the applicability of cholesterol-lowering from one group to another.", "The contrast that has been best studied is that between people who have already had a heart attack and those who have not. Generally, this can be understood as a contrast between very high-risk persons and those whose risk is lower, although even the primary trials tend to focus on individuals with multiple risks for CHD. The meta-analyses we reviewed consistently found a pattern of greater CHD benefit in secondary than in primary trials. 6. NHLBI cites selected research other than clinical trials in order to support the broad application of the benefits found in the trial results with high-risk men to other groups. Yet different treatments are recommended for men and for women in the guidelines. In 1993, NHLBI revised the NCEP guidelines to \u201cdelay\u201d the application of cholesterol-lowering drugs to beyond age 55 for women. Similarly, NHLBI invited doctors to consider estrogen replacement rather than cholesterol-lowering drugs beyond menopause. Many of the women who display signs of high risk for CHD are older; indeed, elderly persons as a group are disproportionately women. A recent review found no direct evidence of benefit in lowering cholesterol among elderly persons and mixed evidence that higher cholesterol levels are associated with CHD."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Evaluation and Methodology Division", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgment", "paragraphs": ["Douglas M.
