State and DOD work with other agencies to determine whether to use a drawdown authority and identify the assistance to be provided.

Key documents for this process include a memorandum of justification containing background information about the drawdown. However, inconsistent with federal internal control standards, State lacked readily available documents related to drawdowns, and there is no central office or official responsible for maintaining key drawdown documents. As a result, it took several months for State to fully respond to our request for drawdown documents. For example, State officials initially did not provide documentation for the 2011 drawdown to Libya, but provided the documents over 4 months later. Without a mechanism to ensure that key documents relating to the use of drawdown authorities are readily available, State is unable to produce documents in a timely manner.", "DOD provided some reports to Congress on the execution of drawdowns in 2011 and 2013. However, DOD has not submitted certain reports to Congress since 2011 despite a legal requirement to keep Congress fully and currently informed regarding assistance provided through drawdowns under one specific authority. DOD officials said that they have not submitted these reports because they have not closed any of the 13 drawdowns since 2011\u2014 articles and services are still to be delivered.

Before exercising this authority, the President must  determine and report to Congress that an unforeseen emergency exists,  requiring immediate military assistance that cannot be met under any  other law. This special authority was more recently used in 2013 to  provide airlift and refueling support for counterterrorism efforts in Mali; in  2014 to provide defense articles and services, as well as military  education and training to assist the government of Iraq in combating the  Islamic State of Iraq and Syria; and in 2015 to provide military assistance  to Ukraine.

Before exercising this authority, the President must first determine and  report to Congress that any such drawdown is in the national interest of  the United States.

State officials said  they typically begin the process by developing drawdown proposals under  the above authorities when an international crisis arises. Since 2011,  officials said they have used drawdowns in conflict situations, such as in  Ukraine and Syria. State\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs along with  DOD\u2019s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the National  Security Council, the Executive Office of the President, and in some  cases other executive branch agencies participate in an interagency  process to develop a recommendation for articles and services that the  U.S. government should provide under the drawdown authorities (see fig.  2). Based on the estimated value and availability of the articles and  services, the agencies agree on the parameters of the drawdown to  recommend to the President, and State prepares a justification package  that includes the Presidential Determination for the President\u2019s signature,  which is published in the Federal Register. The President may also  delegate authority to make the determination to the Secretary of State,  and documents this delegation in a memorandum that is published in the  Federal Register. State notifies Congress of the President\u2019s intent to  exercise his authority before the President signs the determination and  then notifies Congress once the determination has been made.

A DSCA country program director  creates an execution order with a maximum number of the articles or  services to be provided through the drawdown, which may be updated  over time. The country program directors work directly with the military  services to track the execution of the drawdown, and the military services  are responsible for providing execution data to update an automated  database. The military services provide the defense articles and services  they have available in their existing inventories. The military services  cover the costs of the drawdown from their existing funds and without  new appropriations.

The requirement to provide a  report does not specify a date by which the reports must be submitted,  but instead states that these reports shall be provided upon delivery of  such articles, or upon completion of the services or education and  training. DOD has provided no Section 506 reports for the eight  presidential drawdowns undertaken pursuant to this authority in fiscal  years 2013 through 2015. From 2010 until the end of calendar year 2013,  DOD was also responsible for providing an annual report to Congress on  drawdowns under Section 1247 of the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2010. DOD provided reports to Congress in response to  this requirement.", "Under DOD guidance, DSCA is primarily responsible for preparing  Section 506 reports. DSCA practice has been that this reporting  requirement arises when all articles, services, or both have been  delivered, according to DSCA officials. DSCA officials noted that all of the  drawdowns since 2011 are still being executed, meaning that there are  still articles and services to be delivered. DSCA officials also noted that  they work with State\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to determine the  best time to close a drawdown as completed, and noted that State has  not determined to close out any drawdowns since 2011. State officials  said that they do not have an active role in DSCA\u2019s reporting to Congress  but that they would expect to review Section 506 reports before DOD  submits them to Congress.", "According to DSCA\u2019s guidance, a termination date of not more than 18  months after the initial execution order will be stated in the execution  order, unless otherwise directed by the country program director. DSCA  officials stated that the termination date and the closure date that would  trigger the reporting requirement are not the same. They also stated that  if a particular drawdown reached its termination date with authority left  (for example, only $10 million of the $25 million authorized has been  used), DSCA would not terminate the drawdown if a crisis is still ongoing.  For example, in December 2013 the President authorized $60 million in  assistance to support African Union-led operations in the Central African  Republic, and as of 2015, over $26 million remained undelivered, and the  drawdown remains active more than 2 years later. In addition, DSCA  officials stated that they may choose not to close a drawdown, even if all  the available authority has been used, if a subsequent related drawdown  is still active. For example, in 2013, the President authorized $50 million  under Section 506(a)(1) to provide airlift support to Chad and France to  assist in their operations in Mali. According to DSCA officials and  documents, this drawdown has reached its authorization level but has not  been closed because DSCA is waiting on subsequent drawdowns of the  same nature to be completed before it reports to Congress.", "Although DOD has not submitted Section 506 reports, it submitted  Section 1247 reports until this reporting requirement terminated at the  end of calendar year 2013.

State\u2019s lack of a single point of contact or centralized mechanism for  maintaining drawdown documents weakens its ability to make key  documents associated with the justification for drawdowns readily  available. Furthermore, in making the accommodation in the Foreign  Assistance Act that allows drawdowns to occur without first seeking  specific appropriation from Congress, Congress required in Section  506(b)(2) that the President keep it fully and currently informed on the use  of Section 506 authority. While Congress prescribed no specific  frequency for providing Section 506 reports, DSCA has not submitted any  Section 506 reports since 2011 to Congress on drawdowns because,  according to DSCA, the drawdowns have not yet been closed as  completed.

DOD  agreed with our recommendation, but State did not.  DOD\u2019s and State\u2019s  written comments are reprinted in appendices II and III, respectively.", "In its written comments, DOD concurred with our recommendation that it  report more frequently to Congress on the information outlined in Section  506(b)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act, as amended. DOD also provided  us with technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as  appropriate.", "In its written comments, State did not concur with our recommendation  that the Secretary of State should assign responsibility or develop a  mechanism for maintaining State\u2019s justification package documents.   State noted that there are officials responsible for maintaining key  drawdown documents.  State also noted that the Office of Regional  Security and Arms Transfers is the lead office for security related  drawdowns and maintains the key drawdown documents. In our report,  we do note that State\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Office of  Regional Security and Arms Transfers, leads State and interagency  processes for presidential drawdowns. However, we found that the  bureau was unable to readily produce a complete list of uses of  presidential drawdown authorities. We further noted that the bureau does  not manage all the key documents within the office associated with the  use of drawdown authority, nor is there a mechanism to centrally manage  such documents. We based this information on multiple interviews with  State officials, including those who confirmed on December 4, 2015, that  they do not maintain a central drawdown repository or office dedicated to  drawdowns. For example, an Office of Regional Security and Arms  Transfers official said that she had knowledge of and documentation for  only the specific drawdowns that she worked on. Other Bureau of  Political-Military Affairs officials concurred with her statement.  As such,  there has been no one point of contact within the Bureau of Political- Military Affairs or State to consolidate all of the information and  documentation regarding drawdowns. The State officials also said that  State had to contact individuals who worked on the documents to make  them available.", "State\u2019s written comments further state that it is more useful to have a  single Regional Security and Arms Transfers officer responsible for  leading the entirety of the response to an emergency, including any  drawdowns and the documents related to them, rather than having a  single officer responsible for all drawdowns. We believe it would be  beneficial for State to ensure that key documentation for presidential  drawdowns is centrally maintained. According to federal internal control  standards, documentation provides a means to retain organizational  knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few  personnel, as well as a means to communicate that knowledge as  needed to external parties, such as external auditors. By not  implementing this standard and relying on individual officials to maintain  drawdown documentation, State could not readily identify and provide us  with documentation for drawdowns if those officials responsible for  specific drawdowns were no longer with the bureau. The lack of a central  office or official responsible for maintaining documents relevant to  drawdowns apparently accounted, at least in part, for State\u2019s not  providing us with a list of all drawdowns since 2002, or with  documentation for drawdowns prior to 2011.", "State also disagreed with the amount of time it took to provide  documents. However, we stand by our finding that it took State several  months to fully respond for our request for key documents. Specifically,  on July 29, 2015, we requested a list of all the uses of presidential  drawdown authorities and associated documents. We followed up with  another written request for these same documents on August 4, 2015. On  September 8, 2015, State\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs provided  documents for seven drawdowns, noted it had some additional classified  documents related to the original seven drawdowns, and said that it had  no additional documentation.  At that time State still had not provided a  complete list of its uses of drawdown authorities. We subsequently  identified five other uses of drawdown authorities by examining Federal  Register notices and sent requests for the documentation for these  drawdowns. In one case (Libya) that we highlighted in the report, in  November 2015 we again requested that State provide key documents  related to this drawdown. State did not provide the key documents until  January 2016\u2014over 4 months after the original document request.  Overall, it took State 8 months, from August 4, 2015\u2014the date of our  written request\u2014until March 17, 2016, to provide the documents related  to all 13 uses of drawdown authority since 2011.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and other  interested parties.
