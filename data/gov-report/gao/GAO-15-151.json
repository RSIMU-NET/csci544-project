It also examines how the federal government works with states to improve college affordability and what additional approaches are available for doing so. In conducting this work, GAO analyzed trends in state funding for public colleges, tuition, and state student aid using data from the U.S. Department of Education for all public sector colleges from fiscal years 2003 through 2012, the most recent data available at the time of this study. GAO also identified academic studies on state higher education policies and affordability published since 2011 and interviewed 25 academic experts and organizations in the fields of higher education or state policy.

Specifically, state funding decreased by 12 percent overall while median tuition rose 55 percent across all public colleges. The decline in state funding for public colleges may have been due in part to the impact of the recent recession on state budgets. Colleges began receiving less of their total funding from states and increasingly relied on tuition revenue during this period. Tuition revenue for public colleges increased from 17 percent to 25 percent, surpassing state funding by fiscal year 2012, as shown below. Correspondingly, average net tuition, which is the estimated tuition after grant aid is deducted, also increased by 19 percent during this period. These increases have contributed to the decline in college affordability as students and their families are bearing the cost of college as a larger portion of their total family budgets.", "GAO found that federal support for higher education is primarily targeted at funding student financial aid\u2014 over $136 billion in loans, grants, and work-study in fiscal year 2013\u2014rather than at programs involving states. GAO identified several potential approaches that the federal government could use to expand incentives to states to improve affordability, such as creating new grants, providing more consumer information on affordability, or changing federal student aid programs.

In particular, higher education helps  maintain the nation\u2019s competitiveness in a global economy by providing  students the means to learn new skills and enhance their existing  abilities. The federal government, states, students, and colleges, in turn,  all play important roles in financing higher education costs, thereby  influencing affordability (see fig. 1).

For example,  in fiscal year 2013, Education provided over $32 billion in Pell Grants to  eligible low-income students. In addition to funding for student aid,  Education provides higher education funding for states and colleges.  Funding for states includes two grant programs to support increased  access for low-income students: 1) the Gaining Early Awareness and  Readiness for Undergraduates Programs (GEAR UP) and 2) the College  Access Challenge Grant Program.

Correspondingly, median state  funding per student declined 24 percent\u2014from $6,211 in fiscal year 2003  to $4,695 in fiscal year 2012.

Likewise, 19 of 25  experts and organizations we interviewed cited the 2007 to 2009  recession as a factor that directed trends in state funding. Several of  these experts and organizations described public higher education as the  \u201cbalance wheel of state economies,\u201d where states reduce higher  education funding during constrained economic times, in part because  public colleges can use tuition as an additional funding stream unlike  other program areas that do not have alternative sources of revenue. Our  analysis of funding trends corroborates this characterization by showing  that state funding for public colleges gradually increased between fiscal  years 2005 and 2008, but began steadily declining in fiscal year 2008  during the most recent recession until fiscal year 2012, while tuition  revenue began climbing at a faster pace to fill the gap. These reductions  may have been mitigated to some extent by the Recovery Act. Of the 19  experts and organizations we spoke with about the Recovery Act\u2019s effect  on state support for higher education, 16 cited it as having influenced  higher education funding levels of which 7 believed the effect was short- term. In addition to economic conditions, 19 of 25 experts and  organizations we interviewed cited competing state budget priorities, such  as healthcare and K-12 education, as a factor in declining state funding  for higher education.

Meanwhile, growth in tuition  revenue outpaced that of all other types of revenue over this period,  increasing from 17 percent to 25 percent and making tuition the top single  source of revenue for public colleges. In contrast, shares of federal, local,  and other revenue sources remained relatively stable. Total revenue  figures from each source are displayed in appendix II.

Though tuition is typically higher at 4-year colleges than at 2-year  colleges, the increase over the period was similar between the two types  of colleges: both increased by about 54 percent. Median published tuition  also increased for out-of-state students during this period, though less  dramatically than for in-state students, rising by 31 percent from the 2002- 2003 school year to the 2011-2012 school year.", "Published tuition prices do not necessarily indicate actual costs incurred  by students and families, in part because grant aid can help reduce out- of-pocket costs.

As a result, states are targeting a smaller portion  of their estimated available grant aid to students with the greatest  financial need. Some of the experts and organizations we interviewed  noted that the growth in merit-based aid may be related to its political  popularity, especially among state legislators.

In addition, an individual  state\u2019s budget policies may influence state spending patterns. One study  we reviewed tested whether certain state fiscal policies, such as balanced  budget requirements and debt limits, would reduce state spending on  higher education. That study suggests these policies did not have a  statistically significant relationship with state expenditures on public  higher education. However, the study did show a negative relationship  between another type of fiscal policy\u2014tax and expenditure limits\u2014and  the level of state spending on public higher education. Specifically, in  states with tax and expenditure limits in place, such as those that limit the  amount of revenue a state can take in from taxpayers, spending on higher  education was about 3 percent lower than states without these types of  policies.", "There is wide variation in state policies related to setting tuition, as each  state has its own higher education governance system that may delegate  the primary authority to the governor, state legislature, governing boards,  individual public colleges, or a combination of these stakeholders. Several  experts and organizations who commented on this topic said that when  tuition is set centrally by the state and colleges have less authority, there  are positive effects on affordability for students. Given recent economic  conditions, some states have negotiated agreements with their public  colleges to curb tuition hikes, at times in exchange for more state funding.  Most experts and organizations we spoke with\u201411 of 15 who commented  on this issue\u2014said these limits on tuition growth do not usually have long- term effects on improving affordability for students, or have negative  effects on affordability. However, in the case of Maryland, a few experts  and organizations said the state has successfully suppressed tuition  increases through cost efficiencies achieved by its public colleges, which  may result in more sustainable benefits for students.", "Regardless of how tuition is set, it is clear that specific tuition levels  directly affect students. For example, two studies found that policies  allowing rising tuition negatively affected affordability for students at  public colleges in California, even when considering contributions from  financial aid. In addition, some studies found that tuition levels can also  affect student behavior and decision-making. For example, results from a  survey of students at about 15 large public colleges found that an  estimated 73 percent of students reported buying fewer or cheaper  textbooks, and 46 percent reported skipping meals in response to  increased college costs. Moreover, tuition levels may influence students\u2019  decisions about whether to attend college at all. For example, two  nationwide studies of public colleges found that increased tuition levels  were associated with decreased enrollment.", "Like tuition, state grant aid directly affects students in that it can reduce  their out-of-pocket expenses for college. In addition, evidence from five  recent studies we reviewed suggests that state grant aid, both merit- and  need-based, has positive effects on enrollment. For example, a study of  a state scholarship program in Washington suggests that receiving the  aid increased a student\u2019s probability of enrolling in college by nearly 14 to  19 percentage points, depending on the cohort and controlling for other  factors. This positive effect on enrollment may indicate that students  enroll because they perceive college to be more affordable. Additionally,  a study of selected scholarships in four states shows that the aid helped  students stay in college. Specifically, an additional $1,000 in aid received  was associated with a 2 to 7 percent increase in persistence\u2014the  likelihood that students will continue their education, on average.  Regarding state grant aid programs, there is general consensus among  experts and organizations we interviewed that investing in need-based  grant aid is a more efficient use of resources than merit aid in that the aid  is targeted to those students who need it most. Specifically, 20 of 25  experts and organizations we spoke with said that prioritizing need-based  aid over merit-based aid is important for improving affordability.", "Many states have established or are considering policies that financially  reward public colleges for progress toward performance goals, which  most experts and organizations we spoke with\u201419 of 25\u2014said could  improve affordability for students. The link between these types of policies  (called performance-based funding) and college affordability depends on  the specific goals being measured. For example, goals such as targeting  college-provided aid to low-income students or moderating tuition  increases are more relevant to affordability than to other performance  outcomes. While the studies we reviewed on existing performance-based  funding policies do not examine their effect on affordability, they show  mixed results on their effectiveness in incentivizing desired outcomes in  other areas. For example, a study on performance-based funding in  Washington, a state policy that was designed to incentivize degree  completion, suggests that the policy did not affect the number of  Associates\u2019 degrees that public colleges produced. However, the number  of certificates completed rose after the policy was introduced. The authors  noted the possibility that colleges were encouraged to award certificates  that could be completed more quickly. In another case, a study of  performance-based funding in Tennessee suggests that the financial  incentive tied to the policy, even when doubled, was not associated with  increases in retention rates.  That is, the policy was not successful in  achieving the desired outcome, possibly because there was not enough  of a financial incentive to influence institutional outcomes. Recently,  however, Tennessee started channeling all of its higher education funding  through a performance-based system, and this level of financial  commitment may be effective in shaping colleges\u2019 behavior. Time may  also be a factor in whether performance-based funding policies are  successful incentives. For example, a recent, nationwide study of  performance-based policies shows that there is little evidence tying  performance funding to positive outcomes, in part because so few states  maintain their policies long enough to change colleges\u2019 behavior.  Nevertheless, the study did suggest a positive outcome of performance- based funding\u2014 increased degree completion in several states\u2014but only  after states kept the policy in place for an average of 7 years. As of early  2014, 30 states were in the process of implementing performance-based  funding policies or had already done so, according to a national  organization representing state legislatures. For many of these policies, it  is too soon to know whether they will be effective at improving  affordability or achieving other desired outcomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Time-to-Degree Policies", "paragraphs": ["Experts and organizations also pointed to state policies that allow  students to make more efficient use of their time in college, which may  help them save on tuition costs. While much of the research we reviewed  did not specifically address state policies on timely degree completion, as  many of them are relatively new, there was general agreement among  those we interviewed that reducing the time it takes for a student to  complete their degree can help make college more affordable. Various  states have implemented policies or launched voluntary initiatives  encouraging students to take the appropriate number of credits for their  degree program\u2014neither too few nor too many. For example, Hawaii\u2019s  \u201c15 to Finish\u201d media campaign is designed to raise awareness that  students should take 15 credit hours per semester to graduate on time.", "Several states have policies to limit credit accumulation so that students  do not take\u2014and pay for\u2014more courses than necessary to complete  their degree.", "According to the experts and organizations we interviewed, states and  public colleges are also working to ensure students take and get credit for  courses that count toward their degrees. To that end, states play a role in  enabling credit transfer programs and articulation agreements between  public colleges to ensure that students do not have to re-take courses  they have already passed and paid for at another college. We have  previously noted that students taking additional credits as a result of  being unable to transfer credits would likely have to pay additional tuition,  though the extent to which these costs are borne by the student, for  example, would vary depending on the student\u2019s eligibility for financial  aid.", "There are also state policies that establish dual enrollment programs that  allow high school students to begin earning college credits early, as well  as college preparation programs\u2014like Indiana\u2019s 21st Century Scholars \u2014 that could help students avoid taking remedial college courses that may  not count toward a degree. State aid programs may also help with  college preparation by raising awareness of the academic requirements  to get into college. For example, in a study of merit scholarships offered  to high school graduates in Alaska who planned to attend selected  colleges in-state, eligible students were prepared for a more efficient  college experience. They took far fewer remedial courses and enrolled  in more total credit hours on average than did their non-eligible peers.  Specifically, the study shows that after one semester, the average  scholarship recipient would have accumulated 13.2 credit hours toward a  degree compared to 8.5 hours for a non-recipient, which brings them  closer to a full-time schedule of 15 credit hours.", "Another state or public college policy to minimize students\u2019 time-to-degree  focuses on granting credit for knowledge gained outside of the classroom,  which can ultimately reduce the overall cost of college. This can include  taking tests to demonstrate knowledge or skills developed through work  experience or prior learning. According to a survey of public college  students at about 15 large public colleges, 22 percent of students chose  to take tests for course credit instead of paying to take the actual  courses.

States had the option to apply for a waiver from  this requirement.

Grants may have a matching component that requires the  grant recipient to provide funding along with the federal government.

According to a 2006 report, the LEAP program  provided almost $66 million in federal funding, and states provided $840  million in funding, which exceeded the amount they were required to  match, for need-based grant programs in fiscal year 2005. When the  LEAP program was discontinued in fiscal year 2011, all states had a  need-based grant program for students, up from only 28 when the  program was first authorized as the State Student Incentive Grants in  1972. To help ensure that federal funding does not replace state  spending, some grant programs have maintenance of effort provisions,  which generally require that states maintain a certain level of funding.  According to Education officials, maintenance of effort provisions are one  lever the department has for certain grant programs it administers to  directly influence state spending. They stated, for example, that these  provisions in the College Access Challenge Grant program contributed  toward affordability goals because they incentivized some states to  maintain their funding commitment to higher education with a relatively  small investment from the federal government. Maintenance of effort  provisions were also used in Recovery Act funding for higher education,  and 16 out of 19 experts and organizations said that this funding helped  states alleviate budget cuts to higher education during the recession. Of  this group, four attributed this trend specifically to the maintenance of  effort provision associated with the funding.", "In creating grant programs, it is important to consider how the program  would be monitored and administered. Our prior grants management  work has identified several challenges associated with grants to state and  local governments, such as difficulty in ensuring grant funds are used  appropriately and lack of agency or recipient capacity. There could be  additional challenges for grant programs with maintenance of effort  requirements. For example, Education officials also observed that states  may be more responsive to maintenance of effort provisions when larger  amounts of federal funding are associated with the provision, and funding  for the College Access Challenge Grant program was not large enough to  influence states to a significant degree. In addition, our prior work found  that maintenance of effort provisions have often been difficult to monitor,  and in 2009, we recommended that Education take further action to  enhance transparency associated with maintenance of effort provisions in  the Recovery Act. Creating new grant programs would also have cost  implications for the federal government and could have consequences for  students. Three experts and organizations we spoke with cited limited  funding as a challenge associated with this option, and one organization  indicated that the matching requirements for grant programs could create  incentives for states to increase funding in some higher education  programs while reducing it in others, which could affect students.", "Education proposed a new grant program in its fiscal year 2015 budget  request, the State Higher Education Performance Fund, as a possible  way to incentivize states. This competitive grant program would reward  states that have a strong record of investment and states that show a  commitment to increasing support for higher education. States would be  required to match federal grant funds, and resources would be allocated  to institutions based on performance formulas developed by states. This  program has not been authorized by law. As mentioned previously, state  funding can be a significant source of revenue for public colleges, and  increased state support may have positive effects on affordability if public  colleges do not have to rely as much on revenue from tuition. However,  the ultimate effect of increased state support or maintenance of effort  requirements on college affordability depends on the extent to which  states or public colleges limit or refrain from increasing tuition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information", "paragraphs": ["Providing information for consumers or on best practices is another  approach to influence behaviors, thinking, or knowledge in certain areas.  Information can be provided through a variety of methods, including  public communication or training. Education has undertaken efforts to  disseminate information on affordability to current and prospective  students which could help them make decisions on which colleges\u2014 including those that are state-supported\u2014would provide a good value.  Education provides multiple sources of information, including the College  Navigator and College Scorecard websites, which help students compare  colleges based on various measures, such as costs. Additionally,  Education is currently developing a college ratings system to provide  students with information on the affordability of individual colleges.  Depending on its design, a ratings system could encourage colleges to  improve on measures associated with affordability to garner a higher  rating. One consideration with implementing this initiative may be  concerns about protecting student privacy. For example, we reported in  2010 that states were unclear whether they could disclose data on  individual college graduates to assess program performance without  violating requirements related to student privacy. In particular, student  privacy could be a concern when linking a student\u2019s education record to  their employment records even if earnings and other employment  outcome data could help assess college affordability.", "According to Education officials, the department has used training to  disseminate best practices to state grantees for GEAR UP programs. If  certain state policies are shown to be effective in promoting affordability,  the federal government may be able to use similar methods of providing  information to encourage the adoption of promising practices across  multiple states.

These suggestions  generally fell into two categories:", "Tie a public college\u2019s eligibility to participate in federal student aid  programs or the level of federal student aid its students receive to  certain state activities or the state\u2019s level of investment in higher  education. For example, Pell Grant funding could be increased for  students attending public institutions in states that achieve certain  goals related to investment in higher education.", "Create incentives for students to complete their degrees on time, for  example through changing Pell Grant eligibility requirements, which  Education officials said would require a change in statutory  authorization.", "Education officials, experts, and organizations noted a number of  challenges associated with modifying federal student aid programs. One  such concern is inadvertently reducing students\u2019 access to federal  financial aid. Because students are the ultimate recipients of financial aid,  restricting the aid flowing through states or colleges that do not meet  certain requirements could have the unintended consequence of reducing  aid for some students. Moreover, one organization indicated that this type  of policy change could face resistance from states or colleges. Similarly,  tying financial aid to students\u2019 progress toward a degree could also have  negative effects on students. Education officials noted that changing the  definition of full-time enrollment from 12 to 15 credit hours per semester  could disadvantage students who have difficulty handling an increased  course load, such as students who need to work during the school year to  pay for college costs."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the report to the Department of Education for  review and comment.

Since each sample  could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence  interval (e.g., plus or minus 2.5 percentage points). This is the interval  that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn.

The NASSGAP survey is  administered to states every year through an online instrument to collect  data on state-funded student financial aid programs administered during  the previous school year. NASSGAP reports that the data are collected  over a period of approximately 5 months. During this period, NASSGAP  follows up with any non-respondent state officials to ensure that data are  received from each state. In occasional instances where state officials do  not respond, NASSGAP creates expenditure estimates. Once the survey  is closed, the data are then checked for accuracy and consistency. We  downloaded the survey data directly from the NASSGAP website since its  online database is continually updated as errors and inconsistencies are  detected.", "For this analysis we used data from school years 2003-2004 and 2011- 2012. This time period was chosen to provide the most recently available  data at the time of our analysis and to ensure data were consistent across  time periods, as the instrument was redesigned for the 2003-2004  collection cycle and earlier data may not be directly comparable. Since  data from each state are entered by a different representative, this  dataset has potential for reporting errors and inconsistency among states.  One such inconsistency is that not all states provided a breakout of aid  between graduate and undergraduate students, requiring NASSGAP to  estimate these data for some states.
