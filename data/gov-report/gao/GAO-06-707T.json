We have made several recommendations in the last 3 years to the Secretary of State to address strategic planning issues, private sector engagement, and staffing challenges related to public diplomacy. For example, today's report recommends that the Secretary develop written guidance detailing how the department intends to implement its public diplomacy goals as they apply to the Muslim world. State has consistently concurred with our findings and recommendations for improving public diplomacy, and the department, in several cases, is taking appropriate actions. However, the department has not established a timetable for many of these actions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, State has expanded its public diplomacy efforts globally, focusing particularly on countries in the Muslim world considered to be of strategic importance in the war on terrorism. Since 2001, State has increased its public diplomacy resources, particularly in regions with significant Muslim populations. That funding trend has continued more recently, with increases of 25 percent for the Near East and 39 percent for South Asia from 2004 to 2006, though public diplomacy staffing levels have remained largely the same during that period. The Secretary of State recently announced plans to reposition some staff to better reflect the department's strategic priorities, including plans to shift 28 public diplomacy officers from posts in Europe and Washington, D.C., to China, India, and Latin America, as well as to the Muslim world. In 2003 and again in 2005, we reported that the government lacked an interagency communication strategy to guide governmentwide public diplomacy activities, and it continues to lack this strategy. We also noted that State did not have a strategy to integrate its diverse public diplomacy activities and that efforts to effectively engage the private sector had met with mixed success. Today, although State has developed a strategic framework to focus its public diplomacy efforts and related tactics to achieve these goals, the department has not issued guidance on how to implement these strategies and tactics. In addition, posts' public diplomacy efforts generally lack important strategic communication elements found in the private sector, which GAO and others have suggested adopting as a means to better communicate with target audiences. These elements include having core messages, segmented target audiences, in-depth research and analysis to monitor and evaluate results, and an integrated communication plan to bring all these elements together. State officials indicate that the department has begun to develop communication plans for 15 pilot posts, but it remains to be seen whether these communication plans will contain all of these strategic elements. Posts throughout the world, and particularly in the Muslim world, face several challenges in implementing their public diplomacy programs, including concerns related to staff numbers and language capabilities and the need to balance security with public outreach. For example, we found that 24 percent of language-designated public diplomacy positions worldwide were filled by officers without the requisite language skills. Furthermore, security concerns have limited embassy outreach efforts and public access. State has begun to address many of these challenges, but it is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of many of these efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s work on U.S. public  diplomacy efforts, particularly in the Muslim world.

Much of this increase has gone to regions with significant Muslim  populations, including South Asia (39 percent), East Asia and the Pacific  (28 percent), and the Near East (25 percent).

However, based on our review of  mission performance plans and on fieldwork in Nigeria, Pakistan, and  Egypt, we found that the posts\u2019 public diplomacy programming generally  lacked these important elements of strategic communications planning. In  particular, posts lacked a clear theme or message and did not identify  specific target audiences. According to a senior embassy official in  Pakistan, the United States has too many competing messages, and the  post needs to do a better job of defining and clarifying its message. Posts  also failed to develop detailed strategies and tactics to direct available  public diplomacy programs and tools toward clear, measurable objectives  in the most efficient manner possible. Finally, posts lack detailed, country- level communication plans to coordinate their various activities.", "Recently, State has begun to help posts improve their strategic  communications planning.

If fully implemented, this guidance should begin to  address the shortcomings we found in mission performance plans;  however, it will not be implemented for another 2 years, raising significant  concerns about what the department intends to do now to address  strategic planning shortfalls. Moreover, it is unclear whether this guidance  will include all the strategic elements from private sector communication  practices.", "In addition to this guidance, the department is currently developing a  sample country-level communication plan and has asked 15 pilot posts to  develop specific plans for their host countries.

According to State data, the  department had established 834 public diplomacy positions overseas in  2005, but 124, or roughly 15 percent, were vacant. Compounding this  challenge is the loss of public diplomacy officers to temporary duty in Iraq,  which, according to one State official, has drawn down field officers even  further. Staffing shortages may also limit the amount of training public  diplomacy officers receive. According to the U.S. Advisory Commission on  Public Diplomacy, \u201cthe need to fill a post quickly often prevents public  diplomacy officers from receiving their full training.\u201d", "In addition, public diplomacy officers at post are burdened with  administrative tasks and thus have less time to conduct public diplomacy  outreach activities than previously. One senior State official said that  administrative duties, such as budget, personnel, and internal reporting,  compete with officers\u2019 public diplomacy responsibilities. Another official  in Egypt told us that there was rarely enough time to strategize, plan, or  evaluate her programs. These statements echo comments we heard during  overseas fieldwork and in a survey for our 2003 report. Surveyed officers  told us that, while they manage to attend functions within their host  country capitals, it was particularly difficult to find time to travel outside  the capitals to interact with other communities. This challenge is  compounded at posts with short tours of duty, which include many in the  Muslim world. According to data provided by State, the average tour  length at posts in the Muslim world is about 22 percent shorter than tour  lengths elsewhere. Noting the prevalence of one-year tours in the Muslim  world, a senior official at State told us that Public Affairs officers who  have shorter tours tend to produce less effective work than officers with  longer tours.", "To address these challenges, we recommended in 2003 that the Secretary  of State designate more administrative positions to overseas public affairs  sections to reduce the administrative burden.

In Pakistan, for example, all of the American Centers have  closed for security reasons; the last facility, in Islamabad, closed in  February 2005. These same concerns have prevented the establishment of  a U.S. presence elsewhere. As a result, embassies have had to find other  venues for public diplomacy programs, and some activities have been  moved onto embassy compounds, where precautions designed to improve  security have had the ancillary effect of sending the message that the  United States is unapproachable and distrustful, according to State  officials. Concrete barriers and armed escorts contribute to this  perception, as do requirements restricting visitors\u2019 use of cell phones and  pagers within the embassy.
