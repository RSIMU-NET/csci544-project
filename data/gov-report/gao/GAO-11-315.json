The attempted bombing of an airline on December 25, 2009, renewed concerns about the security of the visa process and the effectiveness of the VSP. For this report GAO assessed (1) the ability of DHS's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to measure the program's objectives and performance, (2) challenges to VSP operations, and (3) ICE efforts to expand the VSP program. To evaluate the VSP, we reviewed VSP data, guidance, and the ICE's 5-year expansion plan. We also interviewed ICE officials, and observed VSP operations at 6 posts overseas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["ICE cannot accurately assess progress toward its VSP objectives. ICE outlined three primary objectives of the VSP--identifying and counteracting potential terrorist threats from entering the United States, identifying not-yet-known threats, and maximizing law enforcement and counterterrorism value of the visa process--and established performance measures intended to assess VSP performance, including situations where VSP agents provide information that results in a consular officer's decision to deny a visa. ICE's VSP tracking system, used to collect data on VSP activities, does not gather comprehensive data on all the performance measures needed to evaluate VSP mission objectives. In addition, data collected by ICE on VSP activities were limited by inconsistencies. ICE upgraded its VSP tracking system in April 2010 to collect additional performance data, but the system still does not collect data on all the performance measures. Therefore, ICE's ability to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the VSP remains limited. While ICE can provide some examples demonstrating the success of VSP operations, ICE has not reported on the progress made toward achieving all VSP objectives. Several challenges to the implementation of the VSP affected operations overseas. DHS and the Department of State (State) have issued some guidance, including several memorandums of understanding, to govern VSP operations. However, some posts experienced difficulties because of the limited guidance regarding interactions between State officials and VSP agents, which has led to tensions between the VSP agents and State officials at some posts. In addition, most VSP posts have not developed standard operating procedures for VSP operations, leading to inconsistency among posts. Additionally, the mandated advising and training of consular officers by VSP agents varies from post to post, and at some posts consular officers received no training. Finally, VSP agents perform a variety of investigative and administrative functions beyond their visa security responsibilities that sometimes slow or limit visa security activities, and ICE does not track this information in the VSP tracking system, making it unable to identify the time spent on these activities. In 2007, ICE developed a 5-year expansion plan for the VSP, but ICE has not fully followed or updated the plan. For instance, ICE did not establish 9 posts identified for expansion in 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, the expansion plan states that risk analysis is the primary input to VSP site selection, and ICE, with input from State, ranked visa-issuing posts by visa risk, which includes factors such as the terrorist threat and vulnerabilities present at each post. However, 11 of the top 20 high-risk posts identified in the expansion plan are not covered by the VSP. Furthermore, ICE has not taken steps to address visa risk in high-risk posts that do not have a VSP presence. Although the expansion of the VSP is limited by a number of factors, such as budgetary limitations or limited embassy space, ICE has not identified possible alternatives that would provide the additional security of VSP review at those posts that do not have a VSP presence. GAO made several recommendations designed to address weaknesses we identified in the VSP. DHS concurred with the recommendations that the VSP provide consular officer training and develop a plan to provide more VSP coverage at high-risk posts. DHS did not concur with the recommendations that the VSP collect comprehensive data on all performance measures and track the time spent on visa security activities. GAO continues to maintain that these recommendations are necessary to accurately assess VSP performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since its establishment in 2002, following the September 2001 terrorist  attacks on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  has been responsible for the issuance of visa policy.

However, both VSP and consular officials  told us that this process has not always worked well in practice and that  security advisory opinions sometimes do not result in the resolution of the  dispute. According to ICE and State officials, because the Secretary of  Homeland Security has not delegated authority to refuse visas under  section 428 of the Homeland Security Act, any irreconcilable dispute about  a visa application ultimately must be elevated to the Secretary level for  final resolution.

According to ICE officials, VSP  agents perform non-VSP functions only after completing their visa security  screening and vetting workload.

Section 428 of the Homeland Security Act states that one of the  functions of VSP employees assigned to overseas posts is to conduct  investigations with respect to consular matters under the jurisdiction of  the Secretary of Homeland Security. For example, VSP agents may  uncover and follow up on leads as a result of their screening and vetting  activities. While the 2003 MOU between DHS and State states that DHS  employees may conduct investigations with regard to consular matters  under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Homeland Security, those  officials shall not conduct investigations that are within the jurisdiction of  the Bureau of Diplomatic Security or the State Inspector General.  Furthermore, VSP agents have the same position description as other ICE  agents and have the authority to perform a wide range of tasks unrelated  to visa security, including the ability to investigate a wide range of cases  within ICE\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, VSP agents pursue cases related to  bulk cash smuggling or human rights violations. According to ICE officials,  ICE has not issued formal guidance that dictates how VSP agents should  spend their time. ICE officials told us that, in some cases, requests to VSP  agents come directly from other agencies, not from ICE itself. The 2011  MOU states that the primary responsibility of VSP agents is visa security.

ICE officials  told us that VSP agents are frequently tasked with collateral requests to  assist other ICE offices with investigations. For example, as part of an  ongoing investigation into a U.S.-hosted Web site, one VSP agent assisted  in the arrest of two individuals who were producing and distributing child  pornography. VSP agents are also tasked with a variety of attach\u00e9  functions, including serving as the liaison between ICE and other U.S.  government agencies. For example, as the only DHS representative in  Saudi Arabia, the VSP in Riyadh is also responsible for supporting the  Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, official visitors, and  detention and removal operations. In addition, the regional responsibilities  of the VSP agent may require the agent to work on other investigations or  respond to collateral requests in other countries in the region. At one post,  VSP agents told us that these responsibilities were essentially nominal and  involved very little additional work. In Riyadh, these regional  responsibilities involved frequent travel throughout the region to perform  other investigations.", "ICE officials told us that agents pursue these other investigations only  after completing Visa Security Program responsibilities.

According to the 2008 joint ICE-State cable to VSP posts, VSP agents\u2019  responsibility to identify the potential exploitation of the visa process by  terrorists frequently overlaps the responsibilities of consular units  investigating fraud and criminal investigations. According to one State  official, all three units have a general understanding of their respective  jurisdictions but sometimes interpret these jurisdictions differently.  Generally, consular fraud investigations begin with consular officers, who  check for fraudulent documentation and application information. When  consular officers notice organized fraud activity, they refer the case to the  post\u2019s Fraud Prevention Unit. When this organized activity is criminal, the  post\u2019s DS office launches an investigation. When the activity is terrorism- related, the post\u2019s VSP agents investigate.

Consular  officers stated that agents in Riyadh are rarely available to answer  questions and that the value of these temporary duty agents was limited,  because it took them several weeks of their 30-day tour to learn VSP  policies and procedures. Additionally, consular officers stated that  temporary duty agents\u2019 grounds for recommending refusal of visa  applications were sometimes inconsistent or insufficient.

The five most recently established VSP  posts, as well as one unit that underwent recent personnel turnover, were  not included in our review.", "To examine DHS\u2019s efforts to expand the Visa Security Program, we  reviewed relevant documents such as the VSP 5-year expansion plan,  which includes the mission and contributions of the program, criteria for  selecting new expansion posts, cost estimates for establishing and  maintaining VSP posts, and projected budget information. In addition, we  reviewed the ranked list of visa-issuing posts identified by ICE, in  consultation with State. We then compared the expansion plan and the  ranked list of posts with the VSP\u2019s actual expansion between 2005 and  2010. In addition, we reviewed the requests submitted by ICE to overseas  posts for expansion of the program. Our interviews with ICE and State  officials at 13 VSP locations worldwide and in Washington, D.C., also  informed this analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Jess T.
