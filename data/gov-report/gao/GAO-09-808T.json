The current study to revise those weights, begun in 2008, uses the same methodology as the study used to develop the current case weights and, as designed, is also likely to result in reasonably accurate workload measures. (1) The time demands on bankruptcy judges are largely a function of the number and complexity of the cases on their dockets, with some cases taking more time than others. To measure these differences, the Judicial Conference uses weighted case filings, which are a statistical measure of the average estimated judge time that specific types of bankruptcy cases are expected to take. Each case filed is assigned a weight, and the total weight of all cases filed in a bankruptcy court divided by the number of judgeships for that court provides a measure of the total average case-related workload per judgeship. (2) In assessing the need for new bankruptcy judgeships, the Judicial Conference relies on the weighted case filings to be a reasonably accurate measure of case-related bankruptcy judge workload. Whether the weighted filings are reasonably accurate depends in turn upon the soundness of the methodology used to develop the case weights. (3) On the basis of the documentation provided for our review and discussions with FJC and Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts officials, GAO concluded in 2003 that the case weights, as approved by the Judicial Conference in 1991 and 1996, were likely to be reasonably accurate. (4) The original case weights are now 18 years old. Changes in the intervening years in case characteristics, case management practices, and the implementation of new statutory or procedural requirements, such as the many changes in 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, may have affected the continued accuracy of the current case weights. (5) To the extent that the case weights now understate or overstate the total time demands on bankruptcy judges, use of the weights could potentially result in the Judicial Conference understating or overstating the need for additional bankruptcy judgeships. (6) In 2008, the Federal Judicial Center began a study to revise the current case weights that is designed to collect data on the time bankruptcy judges spend on cases filed during 5, 10-week data collection periods from May 2008 through May 2009. Each active and recalled bankruptcy judge is to participate during one of the five reporting periods.

In summary, my statement includes the  following major points:    The time demands on bankruptcy judges are largely a function of the  number and complexity of the cases on their dockets.

Some types of cases may  demand relatively little time, and others may require many hours of work.  The federal judiciary has developed workload measures for bankruptcy  judges to estimate the national average amount of a judge\u2019s time that  different types of cases may require. Individual judges may actually spend  more or less time than this average on specific cases within each type\u2014 such as personal chapter 7 bankruptcy cases with assets of less than  $50,000 or chapter 13 cases with liabilities of $50,000 or more (see app. II).", "In assessing the need for additional bankruptcy judgeships in a bankruptcy  court, the Judicial Conference first considers the court\u2019s weighted case  filings. The Judicial Conference has established 1,500 annual weighted  case filings per authorized judgeship as an indicator of a bankruptcy  court\u2019s potential need for additional judgeships. This represents about  1,500 annual hours of case-related judge time. The Conference\u2019s policy for  assessing bankruptcy judgeship needs recognizes that judges\u2019 workloads  may be affected by factors not captured in the bankruptcy-weighted case  filings. Examples of such factors include historical caseload data and filing  trends; geographic, economic, and demographic factors in the bankruptcy  district; and the availability of alternative solutions and resources for  handling a court\u2019s workload, such as assistance from judges outside the  district. However, our analysis focused solely on the weighted case filings  workload measure.", "Each case filed in a bankruptcy court is assigned a case weight. The case  weight statistically represents the national average amount of judicial  time, in hours, each type of bankruptcy case would be expected to require.  The case weights are based on a 1988-1989 study in which bankruptcy  judges completed diaries on how many hours they spent on specific types  of cases and noncase-related work. Total annual weighted case filings for  any specific bankruptcy court is the sum of the weights associated with  each of the cases filed in the court in a year. Total annual weighted case  filings per judgeship represent the estimated average amount of judge time  that would be required to complete the cases filed in a specific bankruptcy  court in a year.", "Weighted case filings per judgeship is the total weighted filings divided by  the number of authorized judgeships. For example, if a bankruptcy court  had 5,100 weighted case filings and three authorized judgeships, the  weighted case filings per judgeship would be 1,700. Because this exceeds  the 1,500 threshold, the Judicial Conference would consider this court for  an additional judgeship. However, it should be noted that the Judicial  Conference\u2019s policy is to consider additional judgeships only for those  courts that request them. Thus, if a court would otherwise be eligible for  an additional judgeship, but did not request one, the Judicial Conference  would not request a judgeship for that court."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How the Case Weights Were Developed", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Judicial Center (FJC) developed the weights, adopted by the  Judicial Conference in 1991, based on a 1988-1989 time study in which 272  bankruptcy judges (97 percent of all bankruptcy judges in those years)  recorded the time they spent on specific cases for a 10-week period.  Unlike the District Court time study, whose goal was to follow each  sample case from filing to disposition\u2014a \u201ccase tracking\u201d study\u2014this study  was a \u201cdiary study\u201d in which judges recorded in a time diary the hours  spent on each case in the study and for other judicial work for the 10-week  period. This period of time may or may not have covered the entire life of  the case from filing through disposition. Appendix III includes a more  detailed comparison of case-tracking and diary time studies as methods of  capturing judge time spent on specific cases.", "The case weights were developed using a two-step process. First, time  data were collected from 272 judges (97 percent of the total of 280  bankruptcy judges at the time of the study). The judges recorded the time  they spent on a sample of cases and other judgeship work over a 10-week  period. The judges were subdivided into five groups and the recording  time period for each group was staggered over a 1-year period. Second, the  researchers assessed the relative impact on judicial workload of different  types of cases\u2014that is, which types of cases seemed to take more or less  time\u2014and developed individual case weights for specific case categories.  The basic case weight computations involved calculating the average  amount of time spent on cases of each type during each month of their life.  These averages were then summed to determine the total amount of time  for each case type.", "Once the case weights had been created, total weighted case filings were  calculated for each bankruptcy court. Then, weighted caseloads were  transformed into initial estimates of required judgeships. These initial  estimates were adjusted to account for factors other than those covered  by the case weight calculation, such as the court\u2019s case management  practices and the time required to travel to divisional offices. After all  adjustments, the study concluded that bankruptcy judges spent about  1,280 hours annually on direct case-related work and an average of 660  hours on matters not directly related to specific cases (e.g., on court and  chambers administration, work-related travel, and other matters related to  the judicial role).", "When it approved the case weights in 1991, the Judicial Conference stated  that it expected that in addition to other judicial duties, a bankruptcy court  should have at least 1,500 annual case-related hours per judgeship to  justify additional judgeships. The federal work year is 2,080 hours per  year, based on a 40-hour work week. Assuming that judges spent 1,500  hours annually on cases, there would remain 580 hours for federal  holidays, annual leave, training, and noncase-related administrative tasks.  Of course, the actual time that individual judges spend on case-related and  non case-related work will vary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Case Weight Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the methodology used to develop the bankruptcy case weights  appears to be reasonable. The methodology included a valid sampling  strategy, a very high participation rate among bankruptcy judges, and a  reasonable means of adjusting for such factors as missing data. A notable  strength of the methodology was the high participation rate by judges\u201497  percent of the bankruptcy judges at the time of the study. Thus,  participating judges represented almost the entire universe of bankruptcy  judges that could be included. The sampling period was not limited to a  single time of year, thus minimizing potential bias due to variations in case  filings by time of year. FJC researchers systematically used the reported  time data to develop the case weights and made an effort to address all  known limitations in the data. In computing the case weights,  assumptions, and adjustments needed to be made to account for time data  that were not linked to specific cases, missing data, and other factors.  Both the assumptions and the methods used to make these adjustments  appeared to be reasonable. It is important to note that the case weights  were designed to estimate the impact of case filings on the workload of  bankruptcy judges. Noncase-related time demands, such as time spent on  court administration tasks, are not included in the case weights. The  Judicial Conference focuses its analysis of the need for additional judges  primarily on the demands that result from caseload, not noncase-related  tasks and responsibilities.", "Potential limitations of the methodology included the possibility of judges  using different standards and definitions to record their time. Although the  judges had written instructions on how to record their time, judges may  have varied in how they interpreted case-related and noncase-related  hours. To the extent this occurred, it may have resulted in the recording of  noncomparable time data among judges. Because some cases require  longer calendar time to complete than others, not all cases in the sample  were completed at the end of the 10 weeks in which judges recorded their  time. In particular, the study captured only a small portion of the total time  required for very large business bankruptcies. Where the cases were not  completed, it was necessary to estimate the judge time that would have  been required to complete the case. However, the method used to make  these estimates was also reasonable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amending the Case Weights\u2014\u201dMega\u201d Chapter 11 Cases", "paragraphs": ["The size and time demands of chapter 11 business bankruptcies vary  considerably. The bankruptcy case weights, which the Judicial Conference  approved for use in 1991, included a weight of 11.234 hours for chapter 11  business filings involving $1 million or more and a weight of 4.021 hours  for chapter 11 business filings with assets between $50,000 and $99,999.", "In 1996, a new method was used for measuring the workload required for  very large (\u201cmega\u201d) chapter 11 business cases. This measure was also  developed by the FJC and approved by the Judicial Conference\u2019s  Bankruptcy Committee. The mega cases were defined as \u201cthose involving  extremely large assets, unusual public interest, a high level of creditor  involvement, complex debt, a significant amount of related litigation, or a  combination of such factors.\u201d The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts  defines mega chapter 11 cases as a single case or set of jointly  administered or consolidated cases that involve $100 million or more in  assets and 1,000 or more creditors. Mega chapter 11 cases are distinct  from other large chapter 11 cases in that they generally involve a larger  number of associated filings and extend over a longer period of time.", "The 1991 case weights did not fully reflect the judge time required for  these very large, complex bankruptcy filings. The weighting scheme was a  particular problem for the Southern District of New York and the District  of Delaware, both of which have a high number of mega cases. At the time  of the 1988-1989 bankruptcy time study, the highest value for chapter 11  cases in the bankruptcy administrative database was $1 million or more.", "Subsequently, changes were made to the database, which now includes  several subcategories for cases above $1 million, the highest being $100  million and above. Also, the time study estimated the judge time required  by cases for the first 22 months after the case was filed, a period which  may not have encompassed the entire calendar time required to dispose of  the case. Both of these factors contributed to the inability to create case  weights for the mega chapter 11 cases.", "Beginning in 1996, the adjustment of weighted case filings to account for  mega chapter 11 cases was implemented in the two districts where most of  these cases have been filed\u2014first in the Southern District of New York and  later in the District of Delaware. FJC\u2019s research suggested there was no  clear linear relationship between asset size and judge time in mega chapter  11 cases. Instead, FJC selected an adjustment method using data routinely  collected on docketed events in bankruptcy cases, such as docketed  hearings. The method used to adjust the case weights for mega chapter 11  cases consists of a preliminary weighted caseload computation, followed  by a ratio adjustment step. The preliminary weighted caseload is the sum  of the bankruptcy case weights for each case filing associated with the  mega chapter 11 cases. For example, if a mega case consisted of two  consolidated cases, one with assets of between $50,000 and $99,999  (weight: 4.021) and one with assets greater than $1 million (weight:  11.234), the preliminary case weight would be 15.255 (4.021 plus 11.234).  In the Southern District of New York, this preliminary case weight is  adjusted by the ratio of docketed events per weighted case-hour for mega  chapter 11 cases to the docketed events per weighted case- hour for  nonmega chapter 11 cases involving more than $1 million in assets. In the  District of Delaware, where mega chapter 11 cases tended to have a larger  number of consolidated filings, several ranges of the number of associated  filings are used to classify mega chapter 11 cases. For each range, a  separate docketing ratio adjustment is calculated in the same manner as it  is for the District of Southern New York. In both districts, the final step is  to report these calculations over a period of several years and use the  average value across the years as the adjusted weighted caseload for mega  chapter 11 cases. The purpose of this final step is to moderate the effect of  fluctuations in the number of mega chapter 11 cases filed from year to  year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assessment of Mega Case Weighting Method", "paragraphs": ["The methodology used to adjust the weighted caseload for mega chapter  11 cases, specifically the ratio adjustment step, cannot be thoroughly  assessed because there are no objective time data to use for comparison.

The preliminary design for the study had a two-phase  structure. In the first phase, a diary time study would be conducted, and  the time study data would be used to develop new case weights. In the  second phase, research was planned to assess the possibility of developing  \u201cevent profiles\u201d that would allow future updating of the weights without  the necessity of conducting a time study for each update. Future updating  of the weights could include revision of case weight values and/or  developing case weights for new case categories. The data from the time  study could be used to validate the feasibility of the new approach.The  preliminary design for this study appeared to be reasonable. In the first  phase, new weights would be constructed using objective data from the  time study. The second part represented experimental research to  determine if it would be possible to make future revisions to the weights  without the requirement of conducting a time study. If the research  determined this were possible, it would then be possible to update the  case weights more frequently with less cost than required by a time study.", "If bankruptcy reform were enacted during the course of the new  bankruptcy time study, FJC officials said they would recommend halting  the time study and allowing some period of time for the implementation of  the new law before restarting the study. This was a prudent plan because  the law had many provisions affecting personal bankruptcy filings and  personal bankruptcy filings represent the vast majority of bankruptcy  filings. The FJC did begin collecting data for new case weights in 2005, but  terminated the effort soon after the Bankruptcy Reform Act was enacted.", "It is possible, indeed likely, that the Bankruptcy Reform Act\u2019s many new  provisions have affected the time that bankruptcy judges spend on cases.  For example, there are new objections that can be filed that require  hearings. These include a U.S. Trustee\u2019s objection to the debtor\u2019s  exemption from credit counseling certification. Under the Bankruptcy  Reform Act, debtors who file for bankruptcy are required to complete  credit counseling prior to filing. The extent to which new provisions in the  Bankruptcy Reform Act affect bankruptcy judges workload depends, of  course, on the frequency with which they are invoked and the time it takes  to address them.", "Although nonbusiness (personal) bankruptcy filings accounted for more  than 96 percent of total bankruptcy filings both before and after the  implementation of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, the Act initially had a  dramatic effect on bankruptcy filings. Total personal bankruptcy filings in  2004 were 1,563,145 and in calendar years 2005 were almost a half million  higher at 2,039,214. By contrast, in calendar year 2006, the first full  calendar year after the Bankruptcy Reform Act became effective, personal  bankruptcy filings were 597,965\u2014a drop of about 71 percent compared to  2005 filings and about 62 percent compared to 2004 filings. Personal  bankruptcy filings have since grown to 1,153,412 in the 12 month period  ending March 31, 2009. Thus, it was prudent for the FJC to suspend its  2005 time study because it would likely take some time for the filings  under the new law to normalize, and there would inevitably be issues  about the law\u2019s implementation that would need to be addressed.", "The FJC has again initiated a new case weight study that includes data  collected over 5 10-week reporting periods from May 2008 through May  2009.

The FJC said  that the experience in the 2005 study indicated that the supplemental  information about judges\u2019 time reports\u2014which was very detailed and  keyed to specific case events\u2014was the most burdensome to provide.  These data elements were not included in the 2008 study in order to  simplify the process, reduce the burden on judges, and contribute to  keeping judges\u2019 participation rate in the 2008 study high, since 125 judges  had already participated in the 2005 study and would be asked again to  participate in the 2008 study.

Some of the Bankruptcy Court case-related time study  data could not be linked to a specific case type due to misreporting errors  and/or errors in the caseload database. Some error of this type likely is  unavoidable because of the requirement to record all time rather than  record time for specific cases only. However, it is plausible that a diary  study collects higher quality data, on average, because all official time is to  be recorded during the study period; judicial personnel become  accustomed to recording their time. In contrast, the data quality for a case- tracking study could decline over the study\u2019s length; for example, after a  substantial proportion of the sample cases are closed, judicial personnel  could become less accustomed to recording time on the remaining open  cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comprehensiveness and Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["In theory, a case-tracking study collects more comprehensive information  about judicial effort on a given case than a diary study, because data for a  sampled case almost always are collected over the duration of the case.

For case types that  simultaneously stay open for a long period and require a substantial  amount of judicial effort, it is possible that a diary study would not be able  to produce suitable estimates of judicial workload due to a lack of data.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
