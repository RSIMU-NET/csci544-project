Such servers approach a composite  theoretical performance of 190,000 MTOPS. Contrary to assertions made in  the report, however, Itanium-based computers with performance  capabilities in the 190,000 MTOPS range are not widely available. We found  that the report\u2019s finding of availability was not based on an independent  analysis but rather on information provided by industry.

Foreign availability assessments identify  foreign sources of items subject to U.S. national security export controls,  such as high performance computers, and are the principal mechanism  recognized in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations for determining  the availability of controlled items. These assessments determine whether  items of comparable quality are available in quantities from non-U.S.  sources that would render U.S. export controls on the items ineffective.  Commerce officials stated that no foreign availability study was conducted  because industry had made its case informally. Instead of conducting a  study to establish that these servers would be widely available by early  2002, Commerce stated that it conducted interagency meetings and  discussions with industry as well as an analysis of the worldwide  availability of high performance computers. Commerce stated that it also  reviewed the Internet sites of the computer manufacturers mentioned in  the report. In commenting on a draft of our report, the Department of  Commerce asserted that it completed a market analysis of the worldwide  availability of high performance microprocessors and computer clustering  capabilities, and held discussions with other executive branch agencies  and foreign governments.

The information provided did not  indicate that the 10 companies listed in the President\u2019s report planned to  introduce 32-way servers or that the servers would be widely available in  early 2002.

Representatives we interviewed stated that their  companies would not introduce these servers in 2002 or had no plans to  manufacture these servers due to the lack of software and a market for  such powerful servers. An official from a leading information technology  market research firm stated that Itanium-based technology is far too new to  allow a reasonable determination of its impact on the server market.  Furthermore, according to the research firm\u2019s information, no 32-way,  Itanium-based servers were shipped in the first quarter of 2002.", "Finally, the report noted that a significant market exists for high-end  servers of up to 32 processors.

In 2001,  Commerce received 16 export license applications for computers with  performance capabilities at or above 85,000 MTOPS; all but one was  approved. Six of the approved applications were for sales to China.

Acquisition of  computers with higher performance levels allows a nuclear weapons  program to conduct studies faster and enables studies that cannot be  conducted on systems of lower performance, thus shortening the time  for design and development to full-scale testing. The report further  concludes that computers with an effective performance of  10,000 MTOPS or greater would be of significant use to China\u2019s  designers in examining likely gaps in their nuclear weapons programs.", "A 2001 executive branch assessment concluded that the increased use  of high performance computers in the weapons of mass destruction  programs of countries of concern could severely complicate U.S. efforts to monitor and assess such programs.

However, as we have reported before, it  may be more difficult to operate custom-built clustered systems than to  build them, according to experts. For example, without vendor-supplied  software to automate key functions on a clustered system, everything must  be done manually, making computing labor intensive and less reliable than  if it were performed on a vendor-manufactured system. With the higher thresholds, countries of concern will not have to rely on more inefficient  clustered systems to obtain greater computing capabilities.", "The report did not address the difficulty that the U.S. government has  had in effectively monitoring the high performance computers that are  exported to countries of concern. Monitoring exported equipment for  proper use is a key element of the U.S. export licensing process.  Approved export licenses for high performance computers typically  stipulate conditions, such as where the computer must be located and  how it should be used. The conditions are designed to deter the end user  from using the computer inappropriately or from transferring the  computer to another location. Monitoring of these conditions is to be  accomplished through required end-use checks conducted by U.S.  government personnel. In our prior report, we found that U.S.  government personnel in China tasked with this job have been unable to  conduct many checks. In testimony before the U.S.-China Security  Review Commission on January 17, 2002, Commerce\u2019s Assistant  Secretary for Export Enforcement stated that the Chinese government  dictates the schedule for conducting end-use checks. As a result, more  than 700 outstanding checks remain to be completed, according to  Commerce.", "The inadequacies of the President\u2019s report are compounded by the  continued use of MTOPS to determine the performance capabilities of  computers. Although industry and government no longer consider  MTOPS a valid measure of computer performance, the executive branch  continues to use it. In our 2000 report on high performance computers,  we recommended that executive branch agencies comprehensively  assess ways to address the shortcomings of computer export controls, including the development of new performance measures. The  President\u2019s December 2001 report stated that the executive branch is  conducting a comprehensive review of export controls on computer  hardware. According to the report, this interagency review will, among  other things, attempt to identify a controllable class of high-end  computer systems of greater military sensitivity and alternative metrics  for controlling such systems.

Changes to control thresholds on dual- use goods are coordinated through the Wassenaar Arrangement. The  arrangement uses a consensus-based approach to establish control  thresholds on these goods. The United States unilaterally raised the  MTOPS licensing threshold to 190,000 without first obtaining the  consensus of other Wassenaar Arrangement members. Due to actions  taken by the United States, the U.S. licensing threshold is now 190,000 MTOPS, while the control thresholds of other Wassenaar  member states remain at 28,000. Consequently, U.S. exporters have a  competitive advantage over their international competitors because U.S.  exporters are not required to obtain an export license for a wider range  of computers.

A more thorough analysis of the  foreign availability and the national security impact of transferring  technology to countries of concern would have provided a better analytical  basis for making changes in the control threshold.

Accordingly, the disparity between market  conditions and industry\u2019s assertions about the widespread availability of  such computers should have prompted Commerce to conduct an  independent foreign availability assessment as allowed by the Export  Administration Regulations.

Regarding State\u2019s comments on computer clustering, we note  that State\u2019s position contrasts with an October 2001 Department of Defense  analysis that concluded that a clustered system does not provide  comparable capabilities as a stand-alone high performance computer.

We disagree that the Commerce Department conducted a thorough  review of U.S. export controls prior to the President\u2019s January 2002  decision to raise the licensing thresholds. As noted in our report, the  President\u2019s justification focused on only one of three elements required  by law\u2014the availability of high performance computers. The  justification did not adequately identify uses of military significance or  the national security impact of changing the thresholds. 2. We agree that this raises a legal issue, which we mentioned in our  testimony on high performance computers on March 15, 2001. Once a  new measure is decided upon, the executive branch could work with  Congress to allow use of other measures. Section 221 of H.R. 2581,  would repeal the National Defense Authorization Act provisions  dealing with export controls on high performance computers. These  controls are expressed in MTOPS. 3. We agree that countries of concern can cluster or link together lower  performance computers to achieve higher computing capabilities.  However, clustering still comes at a cost in terms of speed and  difficulties in operating the clustered systems. Raising the control  threshold to 190,000 MTOPS effectively eliminates these costs and  allows countries of concern to easily purchase high performance  computers. 4. Defense Department officials stated that high performance computers  performing at or below 190,000 MTOPS meet 98 percent of the  Department of Defense\u2019s computational requirements. Therefore, it is  difficult to understand Commerce\u2019s assertion that the United States  continues to seek a means to control computers of the greatest  strategic importance. 5. This comment acknowledges that Commerce used market conditions  as the sole criterion for changing the control thresholds for high  performance computers. The act also requires an assessment of how  these powerful computers could enhance the military capabilities of  countries of concern or affect U.S. national security interests. These  topics were not addressed in the President\u2019s report. 6. We disagree. The practical effect of raising the U.S. license exception  level to 190,000 MTOPS is to raise the control threshold to this level  since computers below this level (190,000 MTOPS) do not require an  export license. Further, according to Commerce officials, not all  Wassenaar members have license exception provisions in their  regulations. Consequently, a disparity exists between U.S. licensing  requirements and the control thresholds used by other Wassenaar  member countries, as we noted in our report. Finally, according to State  Department officials and official documents we reviewed, other  Wassenaar members complained that the United States unilaterally  increased its export control threshold by raising the licensing  exception level to 190,000 MTOPS. 7. Commerce and Defense officials responsible for preparing the  President\u2019s December 2001 report confirmed that the effort to formally  change the licensing threshold and prepare the justification was  prompted by the letter from industry. 8. Commerce data indicate that there are more than 700 outstanding post- shipment verifications that have not been conducted in China. 9. When implemented, the Department of Commerce\u2019s effort to \u201cred flag\u201d  persons for which it has not been able to conduct prelicense checks or  post-shipment verifications may prove to be a useful first step in  improving its ability to counter problems associated with conducting  checks and verifications."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the letter from the Department of  State dated July 19, 2002."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We are encouraged that executive branch agencies continue to explore  alternatives to the current MTOPS metric. We believe the results of this  analysis should be shared with Congress. 2. We agree that some countries subject to the existing controls may be  among the most adept at developing clustering software and  technology. However, this point was not included in the President\u2019s  report. The report simply stated that the impact of clustering will be  assessed in the course of the executive branch\u2019s review of computer  export controls. 3. While computer clustering complicates efforts to maintain effective  export controls, this point was not used as the basis for raising the  export control thresholds for high performance computers. Also, the  executive branch continues to debate the extent that clustering has  rendered the current export control system ineffective. An October  2001 Defense study found that clustered systems do not match the  overall performance capabilities of the stand-alone systems supplied by  U.S. vendors. This study concluded that foreign country\u2019s use of  clustered systems should not be used as a justification for decontrolling  all classes of high performance computers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, David M.
