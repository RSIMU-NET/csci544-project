However, the total number of investments reported by these agencies has varied over time, which impacts the number of investments receiving CIO ratings. For example, Energy reclassified several of its supercomputer investments from IT to facilities and Commerce decided to reclassify its satellite ground system investments. Both decisions resulted in the removal of the investments from the Dashboard, even though the investments were clearly IT. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does not update the public version of the Dashboard as the President's budget request is being created. As a result, the public version of the Dashboard was not updated for 15 of the past 24 months, and so was not available as a tool for investment oversight and decision making.", "Of the 80 investments reviewed, 53 of the CIO ratings were consistent with the investment risk, 20 were partially consistent, and 7 were inconsistent. While two agencies' CIO ratings were entirely consistent, other agencies' ratings were inconsistent for a variety of reasons, including delays in updating the Dashboard and how investment performance was tracked. For example, the Department of Justice downgraded an investment in July 2012, but the Dashboard was not updated to reflect this until April 2013. Further, the Social Security Administration resets investment cost and schedule performance baselines annually, an approach that increases the risk of undetected cost or schedule variances that will impact investment success.", "Of the eight investments that were at highest risk in 2012, seven were reviewed by their agencies using tools such as TechStat sessions--evidence-based reviews intended to improve investment performance and other high-level reviews. Each of these resulted in action items intended to improve performance. The final investment was scheduled to have a TechStat, but instead, according to department officials, a decision was made to modify its program cost and schedule commitments to better reflect the investment's actual performance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB make Dashboard information available independent of the budget process, and that agencies appropriately categorize IT investments and address identified weaknesses.

Each year, OMB and federal agencies work  together to determine how much the government plans to spend on IT  projects and how these funds are to be allocated. OMB also guides  agencies in developing sound business cases for IT investments and  establishing management processes for overseeing these investments  throughout their life cycles. The scope of this undertaking is quite large: in  planning for fiscal year 2014, 27 federal agencies reported plans to spend  about $82 billion on IT.investments, $37.6 billion is to be spent on non-major IT investments, and  $5.5 billion is to be spent on classified Department of Defense IT  investments.", "Of that, $38.7 billion is to be spent on major IT  Within OMB, the Office of E-Government and Information Technology,  headed by the Federal CIO, directs the policy and strategic planning of  federal IT investments and is responsible for oversight of federal  information technology spending."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OMB\u2019s Dashboard Is Intended to Provide Visibility into the Performance of Federal IT Investments", "paragraphs": ["In June 2009, OMB deployed a public Web site to further improve the  transparency and oversight of agencies\u2019 IT investments.

For  example, in response to our recommendations (further discussed in the  following section), OMB changed how the Dashboard calculates the cost  and schedule ratings in July 2010 to include \u201cin progress\u201d milestones  rather than just \u201ccompleted\u201d ones for a more accurate reflection of current  investment status. While the required cost and schedule data have  changed, the thresholds for assigning cost and schedule ratings have  remained constant over the life of the Dashboard.

OMB requires agencies to update these ratings as  soon as new information becomes available which will affect an  investment\u2019s assessment. After agencies assign a level of risk to each  investment, the Dashboard assigns colors to CIO ratings according to a  five-point scale, as illustrated in table 3.", "An OMB staff member from the Office of E-Government and Information  Technology noted that the CIO rating should be a current assessment of  future performance based on historical results and is the only Dashboard  performance indicator that has been defined and produced the same way  since the Dashboard\u2019s inception.", "Furthermore, OMB issued guidance in August 2011other things, that agency CIOs shall be held accountable for the  performance of IT program managers based on their governance process  and the data reported on the IT Dashboard, which includes the CIO  rating.

We recommended that OMB report on its planned  changes to the Dashboard to improve the accuracy of performance  information and provide guidance to agencies to standardize  milestone reporting. OMB agreed with our recommendations and, as  a result, updated the Dashboard\u2019s cost and schedule calculations to  include both ongoing and completed activities.", "Similarly, our report in March 2011 noted that OMB had initiated  several efforts to increase the Dashboard\u2019s value as an oversight tool,  and had used its data to improve federal IT management. We also  reported, however, that agency practices and the Dashboard\u2019s  calculations contributed to inaccuracies in the reported investment  performance data. For instance, we found missing data submissions  or erroneous data at each of the five agencies we reviewed, along  with instances of inconsistent program baselines and unreliable  source data. As a result, we recommended that the agencies take  steps to improve the accuracy and reliability of their Dashboard  information, and that OMB improve how it rates investments relative  to current performance and schedule variance. Most agencies  generally concurred with our recommendations and three have taken  steps to address our recommendation. OMB agreed with our  recommendation for improving ratings for schedule variance. It  disagreed with our recommendation to improve how it reflects current  performance in cost and schedule ratings, but more recently made  changes to Dashboard calculations to address this while also noting  challenges in comprehensively evaluating cost and schedule data for  these investments.", "We also reported on OMB\u2019s guidance to agencies for reporting their IT  investments in September 2011 and found that it did not ensure  complete reporting.

OMB did not agree that further  efforts were needed to clarify reporting in regard to the types of  systems.", "Subsequently, in November 2011, we noted that the accuracy of  investment cost and schedule ratings had improved since our July  2010 report because OMB had refined the Dashboard\u2019s cost and  schedule calculations. Most of the ratings for the eight investments we  reviewed as part of our November 2011 report were accurate,  although we noted that more could be done to inform oversight and  decision making by emphasizing recent performance in the ratings.  We recommended that the General Services Administration comply  with OMB\u2019s guidance for updating its ratings when new information  becomes available (including when investments are rebaselined). The  agency concurred and has since taken actions to address this  recommendation. Since we previously recommended that OMB  improve how it rates investments, we did not make any further  recommendations.", "More recently, in October 2012 we reported that CIOs at six agencies  rated a majority of investments listed on the federal IT Dashboard as  low or moderately low risk from June 2009 through March 2012. Additionally, two agencies, the Department of Defense and the  National Science Foundation, rated no investments as high or  moderately high risk during this time period. Agencies generally  followed OMB\u2019s instructions for assigning CIO ratings, although the  Department of Defense\u2019s ratings were unique in reflecting additional  considerations, such as the likelihood of OMB review. Most of the  selected agencies reported various benefits associated with producing  and reporting CIO ratings, such as increased quality of their  performance data and greater transparency and visibility of  investments. We recommended that OMB analyze agencies\u2019  investment risk over time as reflected in the Dashboard\u2019s CIO ratings  and present its analysis with the President\u2019s annual budget  submission, and that the Department of Defense ensure that its CIO  ratings reflect available investment performance assessments and its  risk management guidance.

In particular, we reported that OMB used  CIO ratings from the Dashboard, among other sources, to select at- risk investments for reviews known as TechStats. OMB initiated  these reviews in January 2010 to further improve investment  performance, and subsequently incorporated the TechStat model into  its 25-point plan for reforming federal IT management. We reported  that OMB and selected agencies had held multiple TechStat sessions  but additional OMB oversight was needed to ensure that these  meetings were having the appropriate impact on underperforming  projects and that resulting cost savings were valid.

Furthermore, Agriculture and Commerce  both attributed improved ratings to enhanced timeliness and sufficiency of  investment reporting. Both of these agencies factor investment reporting  into CIO ratings and increased ratings as better performance and risk  information was provided by investment management. This suggests that  caution should be exercised when interpreting changing risk levels for  investments, as rating changes by agencies may not be entirely due to  investment performance. Agencies also commented that the CIO ratings  and Dashboard reporting had spurred improved investment management  and risk mitigation.", "Additionally, the total number of investments that the eight agencies  reported on the Dashboard has varied over time, which impacts the  number of investments receiving CIO ratings (see fig. 5).", "The variation in the number of investments reported on the Dashboard  can be attributed, in part, to agencies\u2019 ability to add, downgrade, and  remove investments throughout the annual federal budget process.  However, as we concluded in September 2011, OMB\u2019s guidance also did  not ensure complete reporting of IT investments by agencies.  Specifically, we found that OMB\u2019s definition of an IT investment is broad,  and the 10 agencies we evaluated differed on what systems they included  as IT investments. For example, 5 of the 10 agencies we reviewed  consistently considered investments in research and development  systems as IT, and 5 did not. Consequently, we recommended that OMB  clarify its guidance on reporting IT investments to specify whether certain  types of systems\u2014such as space systems\u2014were to be included. OMB  did not agree that further efforts were needed to clarify reporting in regard  to the types of systems.", "Now, 2 years later, and given the continuing lack of clarity in investment  reporting guidance, agencies have elected to withdraw investments from  the Dashboard that are clearly IT. Because we have continued to identify  inappropriate reclassifications of IT investments, we continue to believe  this recommendation has merit. For example, as part of the most recent  budget process, Energy officials reported several of Energy\u2019s  supercomputer investments as facilities rather than IT, thus removing  those investments from the Dashboard and accounting for a portion of the  recent decrease in investments. Energy officials also stated that OMB  approved this change. These investments account for $368 million, or  almost 25 percent, of Energy\u2019s fiscal year 2012 IT spending, and include  the National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s Sequoia system, which  Energy reported as the most powerful computing system in the world as  of June 2012. According to Energy officials, these investments were  recategorized because they include both supercomputers and laboratory  facilities (which are not IT).", "As another example, the Deputy Secretary of Commerce issued a  directive in September 2012 which resulted in the removal of Commerce\u2019s  satellite investments from the Dashboard. As we found in 2011,  Commerce only reported the ground systems of a spacecraft as IT  investments, and not the technology components on the spacecraft  itself. With this directive, Commerce removed the ground-based  portions from IT investment reporting as well, accounting for $447 million,  or 26 percent, of the department\u2019s fiscal year 2012 IT spending. In making  this decision, Commerce determined that it needed to refocus oversight  efforts to a more appropriate level and consequently minimized the role of  the CIO and others in the oversight of satellites.

For  example, both of Commerce\u2019s inconsistent investments had a  discrepancy during 1 of the 12 months which we reviewed.

Further, in September 2012 a senior management oversight  committee determined the investment to be off-track and unable to  resolve the issues. However, the investment remained rated on the  Dashboard as moderately low risk until November 2012, when it was  updated to medium risk.

See figure 6 for a list of  those at-risk investments and the associated CIO ratings.", "Of the eight investments receiving a red rating in 2012, the agencies  reviewed seven using tools such as TechStat sessions,investment review boards, and other high-level reviews. Each of these  resulted in action items intended to improve performance. The final  investment, Agriculture\u2019s Human Resources Line of Business: Service   department  Center was scheduled to be reviewed using a TechStat session, but in  August 2013 officials from Agriculture\u2019s Office of the CIO stated that this  investment was in the process of going through a rebaseline. As noted  earlier, such changes should be infrequent and reinforce the need for  agencies to review the highest-risk investments to ensure that root  causes of baseline changes are effectively addressed.", "Each of these agencies we reviewed had similar approaches to  identifying and conducting these reviews. The agencies with red-rated  investments in 2012\u2014Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, and  Transportation\u2014monitored investment performance, identified troubled  investments using a variety of criteria, reviewed investments in need of  attention, and assigned and tracked action items. For example, both  Agriculture and Commerce identified investments for review using the  Dashboard\u2019s CIO ratings. All four agencies further ensured that  investments implemented corrective actions resulting from management  reviews. For example, as a result of its November 2012 TechStat,  Agriculture leaders assigned 17 action items to the Farm Program  Modernization investment, which were to be completed by January 2013.  Additionally, the four remaining agencies without red-rated investments\u2014 Energy, Treasury, VA, and SSA\u2014have documented processes which  provide comparable monitoring and oversight capabilities. For example,  VA\u2019s process relies on missed deliverable dates as the key requirement  to hold a review, after which senior management makes a determination  as to the future of the investment. Alternatively, Energy reviews all major  IT investments on a quarterly basis and requires those which fall outside  expected thresholds to complete corrective actions. As such, all of the  agencies have focused management attention on troubled investments  and once identified, have established and followed through on clear  action items to turn around or terminate such investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since its inception in 2009, the IT Dashboard has increased the  transparency of the performance of major federal IT investments. Its CIO  ratings, in particular, have improved visibility into changes in the risk level  of investments over time, as well as agencies\u2019 ability to accomplish their  goals. To that end, over the past 4 years, the agencies we reviewed have  reported lower risk for more than one quarter of all their investments.  However, the effectiveness of the Dashboard depends on the quality of  the information that agencies submit. We previously recommended that  OMB clarify guidance on whether certain types of systems should be  included in IT reporting, but OMB did not agree. Agencies\u2019 subsequent  decisions to remove investments from the Dashboard by changing  investments\u2019 categorizations represent a troubling trend toward  decreased transparency and accountability. Thus, we continue to believe  that our prior recommendation remains valid and should be implemented.  Additionally, OMB\u2019s annual freeze of the Dashboard for as long as 8  months negates one of the primary purposes of this valuable tool\u2014to  facilitate transparency and oversight of the government\u2019s billions of  dollars in IT investments.", "Beyond the transparency they promote, CIO ratings present an  opportunity to improve the data and processes agencies use to assess  investment risk. Each of the agencies we examined had established such  processes, and most of the resulting Dashboard ratings were consistent  with underlying documentation. While two agencies, Transportation and  Treasury, had ratings that accurately reflected their investments\u2019  supporting documentation, other agencies\u2019 Dashboard ratings were  inconsistent with the actual risk of the associated investment. These  inconsistencies\u2014such as inaccurate reflection of negative performance,  questionable decisions about the recategorization of investments, and  too-frequent changes to performance baselines\u2014highlight the continued  need for agencies to populate the Dashboard with an accurate  representation of the full breadth and health of their investments. In  providing this information, agencies will help the Dashboard accomplish  its goal of providing transparency and oversight of millions of dollars in  federal IT investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that the Dashboard provides meaningful ratings and  reliable investment data, we are recommending that the Director of OMB  direct the Federal CIO to make accessible regularly updated portions of  the public version of the Dashboard (such as CIO ratings) independent of  the annual budget process.", "In addition, to better ensure that the Dashboard provides accurate ratings,  we are making three recommendations to the heads of three of the  selected agencies.

However, OMB  also noted that the manner in which agencies submit Dashboard  information to OMB makes it difficult to separate materials it believes  are predecisional or deliberative. Despite this, OMB agreed to explore  whether it would be practical to make the Dashboard more accessible,  and to consider how it could separate predecisional or deliberative  materials. We support OMB in its efforts to increase public  transparency and accountability.", "OMB continued to disagree with the 2011 recommendation that we  believe continues to have merit, related to the clarity of its guidance  on whether certain types of systems should be included in IT  reporting. OMB believes that the existing guidance is appropriate and  does not have plans to review it. However, as noted earlier in this  report, we believe that the recommendation is appropriate because  the existing guidance does not address key categories of IT  investments where we continued to find inconsistencies.", "OMB also disputed our characterization of two issues. First, OMB  noted that up-to-date Dashboard information is available to the  agencies and OMB during the budget development period, who use it  as a tool for investment oversight and decision making. While we  acknowledge that OMB and federal agencies continue to have access  to the Dashboard during the budget process, the public display of  these data is intended to allow other oversight bodies, including  Congress and the general public, to hold government agencies  accountable for progress and results. Secondly, OMB stated that it  began using the IT Dashboard to help identify at-risk investments  starting with its launch in June 2009, rather than 2010. We modified  the report to reflect OMB\u2019s statement. OMB also provided technical  comments, which we have incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "OMB\u2019s written comments are provided in appendix III.", "In written comments, Agriculture\u2019s CIO stated that the department  concurred with the content of the report and had no comments.

Specifically, Commerce stated that  although it is no longer reporting publicly on its satellite ground system  investments through the Dashboard, neither the department CIO nor  OMB has relinquished its oversight role. Moreover, Commerce stated  that it is reviewing its satellites more frequently and in more detail; as  an example, the department noted that Commerce\u2019s CIO conducts  monthly Dashboard-like assessments that cover the status of the  satellite investments. However, regardless of these additional efforts,  the removal of the satellite investments from the Dashboard prevents  the public display of these data intended to allow OMB and other  oversight bodies, including Congress, to hold the government  agencies accountable for progress and results. Additionally, as  discussed in this report, Commerce\u2019s recategorization of its satellite  ground system investments is contrary to the definition of IT as set  forth in the Clinger-Cohen Act. Based on these facts, we continue to  believe that our recommendation to Commerce that its CIO ensure  that the department\u2019s investments are appropriately categorized in  accordance with existing statutes and that major IT investments are  included on the Dashboard has merit and should be implemented.  Commerce\u2019s written comments are provided in appendix V.

Specifically, while agreeing that Energy should ensure  that its IT investments are appropriately categorized, the department  stated that it would continue to report investments that it believes  should be categorized and managed on the Dashboard, noting that  supercomputers would be an exception to this policy. However, this  exception runs contrary to the finding on which this recommendation  is based, namely that Energy removed $368 million in investments  from the Dashboard, including a supercomputer reported in 2012 as  the most powerful in the world. While Energy agreed to partner with  OMB to develop an alternate mechanism to track and report  supercomputer investments to OMB, it is not clear whether this  information will be publicly available. Additionally, Energy\u2019s  recategorization of its supercomputer investments is contrary to the  definition of IT as set forth in the Clinger-Cohen Act, as discussed in  this report. Therefore, we disagree that the department\u2019s planned  actions adequately address existing requirements for open and  transparent reporting of major IT investments, and we stand by our  assessment that Energy\u2019s CIO should ensure that the department\u2019s  investments are appropriately categorized in accordance with existing  statutes and that major IT investments are included on the  Dashboard.

The eight  agencies are the Departments of Agriculture (Agriculture), Commerce  (Commerce), Energy (Energy), Justice (Justice), Transportation  (Transportation), the Treasury (Treasury), and Veterans Affairs (VA), and  the Social Security Administration (SSA). The results in this report  represent only these agencies. We downloaded and examined the  Dashboard\u2019s CIO ratings for all major investments at the eight agencies  (a total of 383 investments reported by these agencies). To characterize  the numbers and percentages of major IT investments at each risk level  at each of our subject agencies, we analyzed, summarized, and\u2014where  appropriate\u2014graphically depicted average CIO ratings for investments by  agencies over time during the period from June 2009 to August 2013.  Specifically, we compared each investment\u2019s first and last CIO ratings  (including those investments that were not on the Dashboard at its  inception, and those that were downgraded or eliminated) and  summarized the data by agency. To describe whether CIO ratings  indicated higher or lower investment risk over time, we calculated the  numbers and percentages of investments (by agency and collectively for  all the agencies) that maintained a constant rating over the entire  performance period, and those that experienced a change to their CIO  rating in at least one rating period. Then we analyzed the subset of  investments that experienced at least one changed rating and compared  the first CIO rating with the latest CIO rating (no later than August 2013)  to determine the numbers and percentages of investments (by agency  and collectively for all the agencies) that experienced a net rating  increase, a net rating decrease, or no net change. We also reviewed  investments which had been removed from the Dashboard due to  recategorization and compared their definitions to the Clinger-Cohen  Act\u2019s definition of IT.
