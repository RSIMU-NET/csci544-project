Of the agencies that submitted the required obligations data, 8 of 9 met SBIR spending requirements and all 4 met STTR spending requirements for fiscal year 2015. GAO could not determine compliance for 2 agencies\u2014the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2014because these agencies did not submit the required obligations data. Officials at most agencies, including DOD and EPA, identified difficulties in using extramural R&D obligations data to calculate spending requirements and determine compliance. A working group of several participating agencies is considering proposing an alternative methodology to calculate spending requirements, according to an agency official involved in leading the effort. Until DOD and EPA find ways to provide obligations data or until the calculation methodology is changed, these 2 agencies will not know whether they have met the spending requirements, which limits SBA's reporting of that information to Congress.", "Agencies inconsistently met certain requirements to report to SBA on their methodologies for calculating their extramural R&D budgets in fiscal year 2015, and SBA officials said they are taking steps to expedite SBA's required reporting to Congress. Five of the 11 agencies submitted their required methodology reports on time. Most agencies provided detailed information in these reports, but they did not consistently provide all of the information required. Regarding SBA's own reporting requirements, as of May 2017, SBA had not submitted its report for fiscal year 2015. GAO has previously made recommendations to SBA to address these issues, and SBA is in the process of implementing them.", "GAO's analysis shows that basing SBIR and STTR spending requirements on an agency's total R&D budget authority instead of on its extramural R&D obligations for fiscal year 2015 would have increased spending requirements and the number of agencies required to participate in the programs. Officials from each of the participating agencies identified benefits or drawbacks of this potential change. For example, agency officials identified more awards to small businesses as a benefit, but officials from several agencies also stated that such a change could limit resources for other R&D programs.", "Total administrative spending for the SBIR and STTR programs for fiscal year 2015 is unknown, but 9 agencies participating in an administrative pilot program\u2014which permits agencies to fund new administrative activities\u2014reported spending about $33.9 million on these activities for that year.

Through these programs, federal agencies awarded about  5,200 contracts and grants, totaling about $2 billion, in 2015 and have  awarded about 159,000 contracts and grants, totaling about $44 billion,  since the programs\u2019 inceptions in 1982 and 1992, respectively. These  awards are intended to support the development and commercialization  of innovative technologies. For example, one award from 2015 was  intended to help a company develop a tool to prevent surgical wound  infections. Another award from 2015 was intended to help a company  identify and evaluate improved materials and designs for components of  aerospace wind tunnel facilities. The SBIR and STTR programs are  similar in that participating agencies identify topics for R&D projects and  support small businesses, but the STTR program requires the small  business to partner with a nonprofit research institution, such as a  nonprofit college or university or a federally funded research and  development center.", "Federal agencies with obligations of $100 million or more for extramural  R&D are required to participate in the SBIR program, and federal  agencies with obligations of $1 billion or more for extramural R&D are  required to also participate in the STTR program. Currently, 11 agencies  participate in the SBIR program, and 5 of these agencies also participate  in the STTR program, as shown in table 1.", "The Small Business Act, which authorizes the SBIR and STTR programs,  establishes the minimum percentage of an agency\u2019s extramural R&D  obligations that it must spend on the programs annually. In fiscal year  2015, agencies participating in the SBIR program were required to spend  at least 2.9 percent of their extramural R&D obligations on the program,  and agencies participating in the STTR program were required to spend  at least 0.40 percent of their extramural R&D obligations on the program.  The SBIR and STTR policy directives, which provide direction to the  participating agencies for the general operation of the programs, require  participating agencies to submit data to the Small Business  Administration (SBA) each year on the amount of their extramural R&D  obligations and the amount they obligate for SBIR and STTR awards,  among other information.", "The Small Business Act also establishes certain reporting requirements  for participating agencies and SBA. Among other things, within 4 months  of the enactment of agencies\u2019 annual appropriations, the agencies must  report to SBA on their methodologies for calculating their extramural R&D  obligations. Furthermore, SBA must annually report to Congress on the  participating agencies\u2019 SBIR and STTR programs.", "Both programs were reauthorized in 2011. The SBIR/STTR  Reauthorization Act of 2011 (reauthorization act) directed SBA to allow  agencies to participate in a pilot program, known as the administrative  pilot program, that permitted the funding of administrative and certain  other costs in fiscal years 2013 through 2015. This administrative pilot  program, as outlined in the reauthorization act and policy directives,  allows agencies to use not more than 3 percent of the funding allocated to  the SBIR program for new activities, including program administration;  outreach; commercialization; standardization and simplification of  program procedures; prevention of waste, fraud, and abuse; and  reporting. The SBIR and STTR policy directives specifically note that  funding under the pilot program may not replace current agency  administrative funding for SBIR or STTR activities. Instead, the  administrative pilot program is intended to supplement the agency\u2019s  existing administrative efforts. In November 2015, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 extended the pilot program through  September 30, 2017. In December 2016, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 extended the SBIR and STTR  programs through fiscal year 2022 but did not extend the pilot program.", "The reauthorization act includes a provision for us to annually review the  participating agencies\u2019 compliance with spending and reporting  requirements for the programs, as well as other aspects of the programs.  We issued four reports from September 2013 through May 2016 in  response to this provision. This report covers fiscal year 2015 and  addresses (1) the extent to which participating agencies met SBIR and  STTR program spending requirements, (2) the extent to which  participating agencies and SBA met certain program reporting  requirements, (3) the potential effects of basing the spending  requirements for the programs on an agency\u2019s total R&D budget authority  instead of on its extramural R&D obligations, and (4) what is known  about the amounts agencies spent to administer the programs.", "To accomplish these objectives, we generally followed the methodology  that we used for our previous four reports on these issues. Specifically, to  examine the extent to which participating agencies met SBIR and STTR  program spending requirements in fiscal year 2015, we used the data that  agencies submitted to SBA and calculated each agency\u2019s spending  requirement by applying the mandated percentages to the agency\u2019s  reported extramural R&D obligations for fiscal year 2015. We then  compared the spending requirements we calculated with the total  program obligations data the agency submitted to SBA for fiscal year  2015. We reported that an agency met its spending requirement if the  agency\u2019s spending for these programs was greater than or equal to the  spending requirement we calculated. To assess the reliability of the  data, we interviewed agency officials about the sources and quality  control procedures for the data; examined the integrity of the data, which  included looking for outliers and obvious errors; and reviewed relevant  documentation. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of assessing whether agencies met their spending  requirements. In cases in which agencies did not submit extramural R&D  obligations data, we interviewed officials from those agencies and SBA  about the data submitted to identify the reasons an agency did not  provide the required data. In these cases, we determined the data these  agencies submitted could not be used to determine whether these  agencies met their spending requirements. We also discussed agencies\u2019  compliance with the spending requirements\u2014including reasons agencies  did not meet the spending requirements\u2014with program managers at each  of the participating agencies.", "To examine the extent to which participating agencies and SBA met  certain program reporting requirements for fiscal year 2015, we compared  information in the reports that agencies submitted to SBA to describe the  methodology for calculating their extramural R&D obligations, referred to  as their methodology reports, with requirements in the Small Business Act  and program guidance. We reported that a participating agency met its  reporting requirements if the agency submitted a methodology report to  SBA, submitted the report on time (within 4 months of receiving  appropriations), itemized exclusions from its extramural R&D obligations,  and explained those exclusions. We also examined whether the  methodology reports included other information requested by SBA.  Additionally,  we discussed the status of SBA\u2019s required reports to  Congress with SBA program officials.", "To examine the potential effects of basing spending requirements for the  SBIR and STTR programs on an agency\u2019s total R&D budget authority  instead of on its extramural R&D obligations, we used fiscal year 2015  data on total R&D budget authority as reported by the Office of  Management and Budget. We used these data to calculate potential  spending requirements for each federal agency under alternate  scenarios, assuming that the same spending percentages currently  required by the Small Business Act would apply to total R&D budget  authority. We also assumed that current spending thresholds that, under  the current law, require agencies to participate in SBIR and STTR  programs would apply to the total R&D budget authority. As in our  previous reports, we compared the spending requirements from the  alternate scenarios with requirements under current law to determine the  potential effects that changing the methodology for calculating spending  requirements would have had in fiscal year 2015. We also analyzed  additional scenarios that used smaller percentages than those currently  required by the Small Business Act to determine whether they would lead  to different outcomes. We spoke to program managers at all participating  agencies about how potential changes to the calculation methodology  could affect their programs.", "To examine what is known about how much agencies spent to administer  the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal year 2015, we requested and  analyzed administrative spending data from the 11 participating agencies  and spending data associated with the administrative pilot program from  the 9 agencies that participated in the pilot. We discussed these data  with officials and determined that the administrative spending data for the  participating agencies were incomplete and came from such varied  sources that we could not calculate the total amount the agencies spent  to administer their programs. We also reviewed the total amounts the 9  agencies had estimated they would spend on the administrative pilot  program in fiscal year 2015 as described in their proposals for the  program; we then compared those amounts with the amounts the  agencies reported spending. Further, we reviewed how the agencies  used administrative pilot program funds to meet program goals. To  assess the reliability of the data associated with the administrative pilot  program, we discussed the completeness and accuracy of the data with  officials from the 9 agencies that participated in the program. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  determining the amounts that agencies spent on the administrative pilot  program.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to May 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The STTR program was initiated a decade  later, in 1992, and has three main purposes: (1) stimulate technological  innovation, (2) foster technology transfer through cooperative R&D  between small businesses and research institutions, and (3) increase  private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&D.

For STTR, these awards generally last 1 year.", "In phase II,  small businesses with phase I projects that demonstrate  scientific and technical merit and feasibility, in addition to commercial  potential, may compete for awards of up to $1 million to continue the  R&D for an additional period, normally not to exceed 2 years.", "In phase III,  small businesses pursue commercialization of technology  developed in prior phases. Phase III  work derives from, extends, or  completes an effort made under prior phases, but it is funded by  sources other than the SBIR and STTR programs. In this phase, small  businesses are expected to raise funds from private investors, the  capital markets, or funding sources within the agency that made the  initial award other than the agency\u2019s SBIR or STTR program.  Agencies can also participate in phase III  by, for example, purchasing  the technology developed in prior phases.", "SBA\u2019s Office of Investment and Innovation  is responsible for overseeing  and coordinating the participating agencies\u2019 efforts for the SBIR and  STTR programs. As part of SBA\u2019s oversight and coordination role, the  agency issued SBIR and STTR policy directives to explain and outline  requirements for agencies\u2019 implementation of these programs.

In general, the programs are similar across participating  agencies. All of the participating agencies follow the same general  process to obtain proposals from and make awards to small businesses  for both the SBIR and STTR programs. However, each participating  agency has considerable flexibility  in designing and managing specific  aspects of these programs, such as determining research topics,  selecting award recipients, and administering funding agreements. At  least annually, each participating agency issues a solicitation requesting  proposals for projects in topic areas determined by the agency. Each  participating agency uses its own process to review proposals and  determine which proposals should receive awards.

In our June 2014 report  covering SBIR and STTR spending for fiscal year 2012, we  recommended that SBA provide additional guidance to agencies about  submitting data and calculating spending requirements. In response to our recommendation, SBA provided guidance in the template that  agencies used to report data for fiscal year 2013; this guidance directed  agencies to report actual obligations for both extramural R&D and the  SBIR and STTR programs. SBA\u2019s reporting template for fiscal year 2015  continued this effort by providing the definition of total extramural R&D  obligations and asking agencies to confirm that the amount reported was  the amount actually obligated.

Moreover, they said they have no plans to  establish such procedures, and establishing them would be challenging.  For example, EPA officials told us that their agency\u2019s financial system  does not distinguish extramural from intramural R&D funds, and that the  agency\u2019s multi-year appropriations, which allow funds to be obligated over  2 years, make it hard to know in which fiscal year the extramural R&D  funding was obligated. DOD officials told us that obtaining obligations  data would require requesting information from more than 10 individual  program offices that, in turn, would have to request the information from  various DOD comptrollers, which would be a major effort. In contrast, all  of the other agencies reported fiscal year 2015 obligations.", "Officials at most agencies, including DOD and EPA, identified difficulties  in using extramural R&D obligations data to determine spending  requirements.

Because of these  difficulties, a working group of several participating agencies is  considering proposing a recommendation to base spending requirements  on extramural R&D budget authority, according to a Department of  Energy (DOE) official involved in leading the effort.

Consistent with our previous reviews, agency officials said that it  is difficult to meet the minimum spending requirements because the  spending requirements are based on extramural R&D obligations,  which are not known until after the end of the fiscal year. If an  agency\u2019s actual extramural R&D obligations at the end of the fiscal  year turn out to be higher than estimated, the agency\u2019s estimate of  spending requirements for the programs may turn out to be too low,  according to some agency officials. For example, USDA officials told  us that their agency estimated total extramural R&D spending for  fiscal year 2015 would be $697 million, which set their SBIR program  budget at $20.2 million. USDA data submitted to SBA shows that  USDA spent $22.7 million, which was more than the amount  estimated earlier in the year. However, some agencies, including  USDA, receive multi-year appropriations, which generally may be  carried forward from one fiscal year to the next. According to the  USDA officials, other programs that provide extramural R&D funding  carried over about $240 million from fiscal year 2014, which increased  extramural R&D obligations in fiscal year 2015 and thus increased the  agency\u2019s SBIR spending requirement by about $6 million beyond the  amount officials had estimated based on 2015 appropriations. As a  result, USDA did not meet the spending requirement for fiscal year  2015 even though, according to USDA program managers, the  agency spent the amount it budgeted for the SBIR program.", "Agency cannot always issue all expected awards. Agency officials  said that they cannot always make all of the awards that they  anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year. For example, officials at  DOE and the Department of Commerce (Commerce) told us of  instances when, late in the award process, a small business declined  an award or was found to be ineligible to receive the award and the  agency was not able to make an award to another small business  before the end of the fiscal year, hindering its ability to meet the  minimum spending requirements.", "Agency carries over program funds to the next fiscal year. According  to some agency officials, agencies do not always spend their SBIR or  STTR funding in the fiscal year in which it is appropriated for various  reasons. For example, DOD officials told us that circumstances such  as receiving agency appropriations later in the fiscal year can delay  spending, as we have previously reported. This can make it difficult  to meet the spending requirement for that year. USDA officials  explained that they may choose to spend their SBIR funds over  multiple fiscal years to help spend the funds properly and efficiently.  However, DOE officials told us that if an agency carries over SBIR or  STTR funds into the next fiscal year, it might not spend enough to  meet the spending requirement in the current fiscal year, although the  carried-over funds may help the agency meet or exceed the spending  requirement in the following year.", "Despite the difficulties cited above, officials at most agencies told us that  they had developed practices to help ensure they meet the minimum  spending requirements. Those practices include:", "Budget more than the minimum estimated spending requirement.", "Commerce officials told us that in fiscal year 2015, one of their  subunits estimated its SBIR budget using a higher percentage than  the minimum spending requirement. According to agency officials, this  helps ensure that the subunit meets the spending requirement, even if  actual extramural R&D obligations exceed the amount estimated.  DOE officials told us that they estimated the required SBIR budget  based on the statutory minimum percentage but used some  assumptions that led to an estimate of the agency\u2019s total extramural  R&D obligations that exceeded the actual obligation amount, which  helped DOE exceed its minimum spending requirement in fiscal year  2015. Department of Education (Education) officials told us they  budget a set amount each year, $7.5 million, which has been higher  than their minimum SBIR spending requirement.", "Spend funds beyond the minimum estimated spending requirement  budgeted.

SBA generally agreed with the recommendation, and SBA officials sent  an e-mail to participating agencies in February 2016 requesting that they  submit their fiscal year 2016 methodology reports on time. Given that  SBA\u2019s request may have improved the timeliness of agencies\u2019  submissions for fiscal year 2016, we are not making a new  recommendation on requesting the methodology reports at this time.", "While most agencies provided detailed information in their methodology  reports, they did not consistently provide all of the information required by  SBA. According to the program policy directives, in addition to describing  their methodology for calculating their extramural R&D budgets, agencies  are to itemize the programs they exclude from their extramural R&D  calculations and the reasons for the exclusions. For fiscal year 2015, all  11 participating agencies submitted descriptions of their methodologies, 9  agencies at least partially itemized exclusions from their calculations of  extramural R&D, and 8 agencies at least partially explained the reasons  for these exclusions.", "Further, where agencies did provide the required information, they did so  using different levels of detail. For example, 5 of the 11 agencies provided  dollar amounts for total, intramural, and extramural R&D budgets. EPA  and Commerce officials told us that providing such information reflects  guidance that SBA had provided in prior years. Six agencies provided the  dollar amounts of their planned SBIR funding. This funding information  was explicitly requested in SBA\u2019s August 2015 e-mail, but SBA sent this  guidance to only those agencies that had not yet submitted their reports.", "In our April 2015 report, we concluded that the varying detail in agencies\u2019  methodology reports makes it difficult for SBA to analyze the reports and  provide accurate information to Congress, and we recommended that  SBA assess the methodology reporting requirement and revise its  guidance, if necessary, to require adequate information. SBA included  updated reporting requirements in a proposed policy directive. If  implemented, the language in the proposed policy directive would expand  the required information to include the planned amount of SBIR funding,  which SBA officials said would make the reporting more useful for SBA\u2019s  analysis of agencies\u2019 program funding. SBA\u2019s proposed policy directive was not in force for fiscal year 2015, so we could not evaluate the effect  of this guidance on methodology reporting, and we are not making  additional recommendations at this time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBA Has Not Submitted Its Required Report to Congress for Fiscal Year 2015, but Officials Said Steps Have Been Taken to Expedite Reporting", "paragraphs": ["The Small Business Act requires SBA to report to certain congressional  committees on the SBIR and STTR programs\u2014including an analysis of  the agencies\u2019 methodology reports\u2014not less than annually, but the act  does not specify a date when the report is due.

Specifically, we estimated that the total  spending requirements for the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal year  2015 would have increased from $2.5 billion to $4.4 billion, or by 76  percent, assuming the same percentages and participation thresholds  defined in current law. The increase would have occurred for two  reasons: (1) an agency\u2019s total R&D budget authority is larger than its  extramural R&D obligations, and therefore agencies that currently  participate would have been required to spend more on the programs,  and (2) additional agencies would have been required to participate.  Figure 3 shows the effects at each agency of changing the calculation  methodology from current law, which is based on a percentage of  extramural R&D obligations, to an alternative scenario that applies the  same percentages to total R&D budget authority. These effects are  consistent with our findings in previous reports.", "As shown in figure 3, some agencies\u2019 spending requirements would have  increased more than others under the alternative scenario. This variation  is due primarily to differences in the relative proportions of the agencies\u2019  extramural and intramural R&D obligations, but it is also affected by how  many programs are excluded by statute. Under the alternative scenario,  agencies that fund primarily extramural research would have seen smaller  increases to their spending requirements for the SBIR and STTR  programs, while agencies that fund more intramural research would have  seen larger increases in their spending requirements, a finding consistent  with those of our previous reports. Examples are as follows:", "NSF used 96.4 percent of its total R&D budget authority to fund  extramural research in fiscal year 2015 and was required, based on  data it submitted to SBA, to spend $156 million on its SBIR program  that year. Under the alternative scenario, NSF\u2019s SBIR spending  requirement would have been $162 million, an increase of about 4  percent.", "Commerce, on the other hand, used 24.5 percent of its total R&D  budget authority to fund extramural research in fiscal year 2015 and  was required to spend about $9 million on its SBIR program that year.  Under the alternative scenario, Commerce\u2019s spending requirement  would have more than quadrupled to about $37 million. Furthermore,  assuming that the thresholds for participating in the program did not  change, this scenario would have required Commerce to spend  approximately $5 million on a new STTR program in fiscal year 2015.  The alternative scenario would have required Commerce to spend  about $33 million more on the SBIR and STTR programs in fiscal year  2015, an increase of more than 360 percent.", "As noted above, changing the calculation methodology from basing the  spending requirement on extramural R&D obligations to basing it on total  R&D budget authority would also require additional agencies to  participate in the SBIR and STTR programs, assuming that the dollar  thresholds for participation remain the same. Under the alternative  scenario, 3 additional agencies\u2014the Department of Veterans Affairs, the  Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Agency for International  Development\u2014would have been required to participate in SBIR during  fiscal year 2015. Adding these agencies to the SBIR program would  have increased total SBIR spending requirements by $65 million, in  addition to the $1.6 billion increase in spending requirements at the 11  agencies that currently participate in the SBIR program. Likewise, under  the alternative scenario, 3 additional agencies\u2014USDA, Commerce, and  the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2014would have been required to  participate in STTR. Adding these agencies to the STTR program would  have increased total STTR spending requirements by $19 million, in  addition to the $210 million increase in spending requirements at the 5  agencies that currently participate in STTR.", "Alternatively,  basing the SBIR and STTR spending requirements on an  agency\u2019s total R&D budget authority and applying a lower percentage  than required under current law could result in total spending  requirements similar to those under current law. However, our analysis  shows that such a scenario would lower spending requirements at some  agencies and raise them at others. As shown in figure 4, if the percentage  applied to an agency\u2019s total R&D budget authority had been 1.65 percent  for the SBIR program and 0.23 percent for the STTR program in fiscal  year 2015, and the thresholds for participation had remained the same,  total required spending on the programs would be similar to required  spending under current law. Using these lower percentages, spending  requirements would have increased at agencies that primarily fund  intramural research, such as EPA and Commerce. In contrast, spending requirements would decrease at agencies that primarily fund extramural  research, such as HHS and NSF. In this scenario, the spending  requirement reductions, including $203.7 million at HHS and $63.8 million  at NSF, were large enough to offset increases in spending requirements  at other agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Officials Identified Potential Benefits and Drawbacks to Changing the Calculation Methodology to Total R&D Budget Authority", "paragraphs": ["Officials at each of the participating agencies identified potential benefits  or drawbacks to changing the calculation methodology for their SBIR and  STTR spending requirements to use total R&D budget authority rather  than extramural R&D obligations.

However, officials also told us that the change could also  have drawbacks for their agencies. First, changing the spending  requirement to total R&D budget authority and keeping the same  percentage requirement could negatively affect other R&D efforts,  including intramural R&D, by shifting resources away from them to the  SBIR and STTR programs, according to officials at several agencies.  Shifting these resources could more broadly undermine their agency\u2019s  ability to accomplish its mission, according to officials from Commerce\u2019s  National Institute of Standards and Technology. For example, these  officials said that work that is done within the agency may need highly  specialized and unique equipment that may not be available to small  businesses. In addition, agency officials at DOD, DOT, and NASA told us  that a significant increase in the spending requirements resulting from the  change could also strain their administration of the SBIR and STTR  programs by requiring additional staffing and resources to manage the  larger programs. As a result, officials at these agencies suggested that if  the calculation methodology is changed to base spending requirements  on total R&D budget authority, the percentages should be lowered to  avoid shifting resources away from other programs and straining the  administration of the SBIR and STTR programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Total Administrative Spending for Fiscal Year 2015 Is Unknown, but Nine Agencies Spent $33.9 Million on the Administrative Pilot Program", "paragraphs": ["Total administrative spending for the SBIR and STTR programs for fiscal  year 2015 is unknown because the agencies that participate in the  programs generally do not\u2014and are not required to\u2014fully track these  costs.
