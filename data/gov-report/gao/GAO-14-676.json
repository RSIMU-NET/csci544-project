GAO conducted a literature search, interviewed VA and DOD officials, and held eight nongeneralizable discussion groups with a total of 45 veterans and family members. GAO also conducted interviews with relevant officials at VA facilities in four states. GAO selected these sites based on diversity of military service branches in a local area, geography, a high concentration of veterans, and proximity to VA resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While many veterans who served in the military after September 11, 2001, have successfully readjusted to civilian life with minimal difficulties in the first few years after they were discharged, others have experienced difficulties, according to veterans GAO heard from in discussion groups and studies GAO reviewed. These readjustment difficulties include financial and employment, relationships, legal, homelessness, and substance abuse. According to VA's strategic plan, one of its strategic objectives is to improve veteran wellness and economic security, and it states that the ultimate measure of VA's success is the veteran's success after leaving military service. However, there is limited and incomplete data to assess the extent to which veterans experience readjustment difficulties. Therefore, it is not known to what extent veterans are facing one or a combination of problems when they readjust to civilian life. There is relatively more information available on the number of veterans who had a physical or mental condition within a few years of leaving the military. For example, one 2010 study shows that 32 percent of recently-separated veterans were diagnosed by either the Department of Defense (DOD) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with a disease or injury of the musculoskeletal system. In this and other studies reviewed by GAO, estimates for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) varied from 10 to 12 percent. According to these studies, some groups of veterans--those who had served in combat and younger veterans--were more likely than others to experience readjustment difficulties or be diagnosed with a mental health condition.", "While an array of VA benefits and services are available during a veteran's first few years out of the military, GAO has identified long-standing challenges with VA's delivery and management of this support. Specifically, VA provides a wide range of services and benefits through several programs, such as education, health care, counseling, employment, home loans, and insurance. VA informs veterans of these benefits and services before they leave military service through outreach and education. However, GAO's prior work over the last decade has shown that VA has struggled for years to, among other issues, (1) provide timely access to medical appointments, (2) make timely disability compensation decisions, and (3) coordinate the transfer of medical records from DOD. GAO has made numerous prior recommendations to address these issues, and VA has taken some actions to implement them; however, some recommendations remain unaddressed, and GAO continues to monitor VA's progress. Agency officials and veterans GAO spoke with during this review suggested additional actions that VA can implement to improve its assistance for transitioning veterans. For example, a few VA staff suggested that VA conduct additional research to identify veterans who are predisposed to PTSD and better understand why some veterans do not use VA services. Veterans at all of the sites GAO visited suggested that it would be beneficial for separating servicemembers to have additional time to adjust to the idea of being a civilian and relearning what civilian life is like. Without comprehensive information on the difficulties experienced by recently-separated veterans, VA cannot assess risks to achieving its objectives and may be missing opportunities to enhance assistance to veterans by not providing needed services early in the veteran's readjustment process. GAO recommends that VA take steps to better understand the difficulties faced by readjusting veterans and use this information to determine how best to enhance its benefits and services for these veterans. VA concurred with GAO's recommendation and described its recent efforts and plans for improvement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA take steps to better understand the difficulties faced by readjusting veterans and use this information to determine how best to enhance its benefits and services for these veterans.

As has been the case with past generations of  veterans, making the transition from military to civilian life can be  challenging for post-9/11 veterans as well. While the U.S. Department of  Defense (DOD) has a role in assisting servicemembers with preparing for  their transition, it is primarily VA\u2019s role to assist veterans after they  separate from the military and begin readjusting to civilian life. To that  end, VA administers a wide variety of benefits and services for veterans  including health care, education benefits, and disability compensation  benefits. While many veterans have made the readjustment without major  difficulty, others may struggle with physical and mental health problems,  financial difficulties, and unemployment. In the past few years, veterans  experiencing these struggles have been the subject of numerous  Congressional hearings and have received prominent media attention.

We  screened over 500 articles and identified 18 that had reliable quantitative  information that was relevant for our review. We also interviewed officials  from VA and DOD, as well as representatives from veteran service  organizations. In examining how VA assists veterans in their  readjustment, and what challenges and opportunities exist, we reviewed  VA\u2019s strategic plan, annual performance reports, and other documents,  and visited four sites: San Diego, California; Baltimore, Maryland;  Fayetteville, North Carolina; and San Antonio, Texas. We selected these  sites based on geographic diversity, diversity of military services (i.e.,  Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines) in a local area, a high concentration  of veterans among the local population, and proximity to VA resources. At  each location, we visited a VA Medical Center and Readjustment  Counseling Service (Vet Center) and interviewed relevant program  officials, representatives, and veterans.

The VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011(VOW Act) made several changes to  the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), a program that provides  departing servicemembers counseling and offers employment assistance  and information on federal veteran benefits, among other things.  Concurrent with this Act, the administration initiated a redesign of TAP.  The law also generally required servicemembers to attend TAP prior to  separating from their service. The VOW Act required departing  servicemembers to participate in a workshop on finding employment as  part of TAP, among other changes. Other provisions of the VOW Act  include allowing servicemembers to apply for civilian federal government  positions as veterans prior to separating from the military, ensuring the  program is tailored to individuals and the 21st century job market.", "Furthermore, VA and DOD collaborated in the development of several  programs for servicemembers to receive VA disability compensation. The  Benefits Delivery at Discharge program provides separating and retiring  servicemembers the ability to apply for VA disability compensation when  they have between 60 and 180 days remaining on active duty. Similarly,  through the Quick Start program, VA and DOD provide the same service  for those servicemembers who have less than 60 days remaining on  active duty. In addition, VA collaborates with DOD to operate the  Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES).

VA officials  confirmed that some veterans have experienced a range of difficulties  after separating from the military, especially if they had no source of  income as they readjust to civilian life. One of the veterans we spoke to  said that his income dropped by four-fifths when he lost his military pay  and benefits and could not find anything but a minimum wage job. Other  veterans at one of the sites we visited described the challenge of paying  for their living expenses during long waits for civilian employment or VA  benefits to be processed. According to a 2008 study that examined  unemployment among OEF/OIF veterans who had separated from the  military by the end of 2006, veterans had a higher unemployment rate  (6.5 percent) than nonveterans (4.7 percent). Veterans at three of the  four sites we visited reported experiencing financial difficulties as they  started civilian employment or received benefits. Several veterans we  interviewed said they had applied for VA benefits in order to support  themselves and endured lengthy waits for a VA decision. VA officials at  two of the sites we visited and veterans at three of the sites mentioned  that many veterans faced difficulties with the costs of civilian life,  particularly housing, food, transportation, and child care.

Those  who had talked to their families felt that their family members did not  understand them very well. One veteran reported unintentionally  assaulting his wife during nightmares while sleeping; another said he was  reluctant to spend time individually with his children for fear of becoming  angry and losing control. VA officials at two of the four sites we visited  noted that they are seeing many veterans with marital issues and at one  VA medical center, officials told us that some veterans seem to have no  support system in place.

Some veterans recently separated from the military also  face legal difficulties, including being arrested, convicted of a crime, and  sentenced to serve time in jail. Although we found some data related to  this issue, these may not represent the extent that veterans experience  legal difficulties.

Physical health conditions are the most  common for recently-separated veterans. According to a 2010 study, 32  percent of veterans had been diagnosed by either DOD or VA with  diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissues after  separating from the military, and about 27 percent had been diagnosed  with diseases of the nervous system and sense organs.

Estimates could be influenced by methodologies  that tended to include either veterans\u2019 self-reported conditions or a review of clinical  records.

More specifically, a  2007 study of recently-separated veterans who were diagnosed with a  mental health condition by VA shows that 56 percent of them had more  than one mental health diagnosis. Another study noted that high  percentages of veterans who sought treatment had both PTSD and  depression. Veterans who had experienced trauma were far more likely  to screen positive for depression than those who had not experienced  trauma. VA officials at two sites we visited also mentioned the effects of  Military Sexual Trauma (MST) on victims, including the sense of betrayal  that results. Victims are often reluctant to divulge such incidents (whether  in the military or after separation). If military commanders ignored victims\u2019  allegations, VA officials said that it creates a second betrayal.  Experiences with MST may lead to PTSD and depression. Finally, VA  officials at one site we visited mentioned that experiencing both physical  and mental health conditions at the same time were challenging during  their readjustment. A 2008 study noted that the severity of PTSD was  significantly associated with poorer physical health functioning, even after  accounting for demographic factors, combat and chemical exposure, and  health risk behaviors.

Another study that tracked OEF/OIF veterans seeking treatment with the  VA shows that younger veterans of active duty service were at a higher  risk for diagnoses of PTSD or mental health compared with active duty  veterans at least 40 years old, which the authors attribute to younger  veterans more likely being at lower rank and having had greater combat  exposure.", "Studies we reviewed showed that younger veterans experienced higher  rates of mental health diagnoses and alcohol abuse than older veterans.

In addition, all post-9/11 veterans who enter the  VA health care system are referred to the Operation Enduring  Freedom(OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation New Dawn  (OND) Care Coordination Program, which screens these veterans to  determine if and the extent to which care is needed and assists them with  accessing VA and community resources.designed to identify combat veterans and the degree of care that is  needed to treat their medical conditions. If the screenings indicate case  management is needed, veterans are referred to the Post-Deployment  Integrated Care Initiative (PDIC). The PDIC provides an integrated  approach to health care by treating the veteran with physical and mental  health care, and social work simultaneously, rather than identifying and  treating one problem at a time. According to program managers, this  approach provides patient-centered care and increased coordination  between providers. It also includes a comprehensive psychosocial and  medical intake process for combat veterans with full integration of all  services as well as regular meetings by medical care providers to discuss  patient care and system issues. VA officials told us that while only  veterans who have experienced combat situations are eligible to receive  care through PDIC, VHA is exploring the possibility of expanding this  practice to all veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lengthy Wait Times for Benefits and Services, among Other Factors, Can Hinder Veterans\u2019 Readjustment", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA\u2019s Continuing Service Provision Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Medical care. VA continues to face long-standing challenges in providing  some benefits and services in a timely way, which can hinder veterans as  they readjust to their civilian lives. Our past reports, as well as reports by  VA, have highlighted the continuing challenges VA faces in ensuring  veterans are able to access medical care. For over a decade we have  reported on continuing issues with VA medical service delivery including,  in 2004, we found that some veterans in Chattanooga, Tennessee,  encountered difficulties with accessing VA\u2019s inpatient and outpatient  health care services. We recommended that VA explore alternatives to  further improve access to health care for these veterans by expediting the  opening of additional VA medical facilities.", "Subsequently, VA reviewed  Chattanooga veterans\u2019 access to inpatient and outpatient health care and  opened two clinics. However, in 2009, VA reported that its facilities were  unable to keep up with a steady increase in the demand for outpatient  care services, leading to veterans not being able to access medical care.  The report noted that VA added new guidance and performance  measures to help alleviate excessive wait times for medical  appointments. In 2011, we found that veterans were hindered from  accessing mental health care from VA in part because of difficulty in  scheduling appointments. Although VA reported that they were making  improvements toward achieving timely access to medical appointments,  in 2012, we found that medical appointment wait times reported by VHA  were unreliable. We recommended that VA improve the reliability of its  medical appointment wait time measures, ensure medical centers  consistently implement the scheduling policy, and require medical centers  to allocate staffing resources based on scheduling needs. VA reported  revising its scheduling policy and developing a training module that  schedulers were required to complete, implementing revised wait time  measures, and studying options to better understand staffing level gaps.  That same year, VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General found that VA had  overstated its success in providing veterans with timely appointments for  mental health treatment.", "In 2014, VA completed an audit to determine if broader, more systemic  problems existed and found multiple deficiencies with VA\u2019s appointment  scheduling practices for medical care. However, veteran complaints about long wait times persist. VA officials and veterans also told us during  our site visits that veterans continued to wait a long time to see VA  physicians. At two of the four medical facilities we visited, VA officials told  us that veterans have expressed frustration with how long it was taking to  see a physician. Officials from one of the medical centers told us that  there are long wait times to get appointments and some veterans stop  using VA services because of the lack of timely appointments. Veterans  from three of the four sites we visited complained about the lengthy wait  times to see their physicians. One veteran told us that VA does not give  veterans a choice of appointment times, and added this can be  problematic if one is employed or attending school. He also told us that  veterans do not want to miss these appointments because it can take  months to reschedule.", "Disability compensation. We have reported for over 10 years, and we  heard confirmations during interviews with VA officials and veterans, on  the continuing challenge VA faces in processing disability compensation  in a timely fashion. For example, in 2003, we found that while VA acted to  improve the timeliness of its disability claims processing, the agency  remained far from achieving its goals. At a 2008 congressional hearing,  we testified that despite VA taking steps to improve its disability claims  process, challenges remained in reducing the backlog and wait times for  processing claims. In 2012, we reported that the number of days to  process disability compensation benefits was increasing and  recommended that VA partner with other federal agencies to reduce  timeframes and ensure the development of a robust backlog plan. VA  agreed with our recommendations and reported initiating a pilot program  to centralize records requests and published a strategic plan to eliminate  the disability compensation claims backlog. While VA addressed several  of our recommendations, we concluded that additional follow up would be  needed. In fiscal year 2014, VA reported that 58 percent of veterans  experienced wait times that were longer than its goal of 125 days and the  average time to complete a claim was 378 days. For veterans,  especially those in the beginning phases of their readjustment, making  timely decisions on disability compensation benefits can potentially lessen  the accompanying financial transition difficulties. Veterans from three of  the sites we visited pointed to claims processing timeliness as a factor in  their difficulty with readjusting to civilian life. For example, one female  veteran told us that VA took 15 months to process her claim, and during  this time, she was unable to support herself and had to reside with her  family. Another veteran told us he has been waiting 2 years for his  disability compensation to be processed, has run out of unemployment  benefits, and is now on the verge of becoming homeless.", "Post-9/11 GI Bill. Since the Post-9/11 GI Bill was implemented in 2009,  VA has had challenges informing veterans about the program and  protecting them from questionable recruiting practices by some post- secondary schools. In 2011, we reported that veterans wanted more  information about the program, including how to compare Post-9/11 GI  Bill benefits with other VA education benefits, as well as the effect of  dropping or adding classes. We recommended that VA develop  performance measures for outreach to servicemembers and veterans and  for the quality of information provided by its Right Now Web service. We  also recommended VA consider developing and maintaining an online  policy manual for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and provide updates to school  certifying officials nationwide. VA addressed some of our  recommendations but we concluded that additional monitoring of its new  outreach performance measures was needed, and we continued to urge  VA to measure the quality of its Right Now Web service. In 2014, we  reported that VA\u2019s response to protecting veterans from schools that were  using inappropriate or aggressive recruiting practices was not always  sufficient. More specifically, we found that while VA offered education  counseling services to students, applying for the services was difficult and  not all veterans were aware of its availability. We concluded that if  veterans are not better protected and informed, they may end up using  their educational benefits on programs that do not meet their career goals  and recommended that VA improve outreach and accessibility of its  education counseling services.and noted that it was taking additional steps to enhance the outreach and  delivery of its education counseling services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Continuing Issues Collaborating with DOD", "paragraphs": ["Integrated Disability Evaluation System. Similarly to VA\u2019s Disability  Compensation, VA and DOD\u2019s Integrated Disability Evaluation System  (IDES) has had difficulty with making timely decisions on  servicemembers\u2019 claims for VA disability compensation. In 2010, we  testified that the time to make decisions on IDES claims was affected by  insufficient staffing and VA and DOD medical staff disagreeing over  servicemember diagnoses. In 2011, we found that as program  participation increased, so did the processing times for benefits. We  recommended that VA and DOD develop a system-wide IDES monitoring  mechanism. VA reported upgrading the IDES tracking system to include  data fields that can capture, monitor and report when diagnostic  disagreements occur, but we are continuing to monitor the tracking  system to determine whether the agency can effectively monitor cases  with diagnostic disagreements. In 2012, we reported that the processing  times for decisions made for IDES claims continued to increase. We  recommended that VA ensure care coordination and disability evaluation  issues are fully resolved by the agencies and that its partners have  sustained leadership attention and collaboration to ensure continuity of  care and seamless transition for servicemembers. VA agreed with our  recommendation and reported that the agency had established a  committee with DOD to address comprehensive overhaul of the care  coordination process. In 2013, VA reported that 16 percent of  servicemembers were awarded VA disability compensation benefits  within 30 days of their discharge from the service. Being able to provide  compensation benefits to veterans shortly after they were discharged  from the service would bring greater financial security, thereby reducing  the risk for negative outcomes such as bankruptcy and homelessness.", "Electronic medical records. In addition, VA continues to face long- standing problems coordinating with DOD on sharing electronic medical  records. Developing a method for sharing electronic health records that  can be accessed throughout a patient\u2019s military and veteran status is  particularly important. This method can help ensure greater availability of  health care information for servicemembers and veterans at the time and  place of care. Since 1998, VA and DOD have tried different ways to  enable the sharing of electronic servicemember medical records, but our  past reports and VA reports have shown ongoing challenges. For  example, in 2003, we found that VA faced problems in developing an  information technology strategy for sharing information with DOD on  patients and that VA and DOD continued to operate separate information  technology systems. A 2008 VA report noted that service treatment  records continued to be transferred from DOD to VA by paper copy  because the infrastructure to transfer the records electronically had not  yet been built and its current efforts to have a health information  exchange had one or more serious flaws. In 2011, VA highlighted its  efforts to address the incompatibility between VA and DOD electronic  health records systems by attempting to create a virtual lifetime electronic  record, but we found impediments persisted in the agencies\u2019 efforts to  electronically view or exchange health information. Our report cited  insufficient real-time and electronic access to comprehensive health  information possibly delaying the receipt of care and benefits. We  recommended that VA ensure electronic sharing of health records issues  are fully resolved by the agencies and its partners have sustained  leadership attention and collaboration to ensure continuity of care and  seamless transition for servicemembers. VA agreed with our  recommendations, and reported establishing a committee to review the  care coordination of servicemembers; however, VA did not identify  actions it would take to address electronic sharing of health records. In  2013, VA and DOD testified that their long-term plans for sharing medical  record data were too expensive to continue and that they were exploring  a different strategy. Veterans from all of the sites we visited told us of  the difficulties they had with obtaining copies of their medical records. For  example, one veteran told us that his medical records were not centrally  located, making it difficult for him to collect his full record. Without medical  records describing the treatment veterans received while in the military,  VA faces difficulties with ensuring continuity of care when veterans  transition to VA\u2019s health system.", "Medication. VA has also had long-standing problems collaborating with  DOD on managing medications during veterans\u2019 readjustments. As early  as, 2002, we found there was an increased risk for patient medication  errors because VA and DOD had separate and uncoordinated information  and formulary systems\u2014lists of available medicines. We recommended  that VA and its partner improve its capabilities for sharing electronic  information. VA had agreed with our recommendations and in fiscal  2007 it had started to deploy a system to view patient medication and  allergy information. However, in 2003, we reported that VA and DOD  providers and pharmacists were still unable to electronically access  health information to aid in making medication decisions for veterans,  such as verifying drug allergies and interactions. A decade later, in  2013, we again found that VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s efforts in managing  servicemember medications during their transition of care were somewhat  limited because not all DOD military treatment facilities offered such  transition assistance. We recommended that VA and DOD identify and  apply best practices for managing servicemembers\u2019 medication needs  during transitions of care. While both agencies agreed with our  recommendations, VA and DOD did not identify any actions to address  them. During our site visits, one veteran at a medical facility told us how  medications that were prescribed by DOD medical staff were not  forwarded to VA, resulting in him being prescribed different medications.  As our previous work has found, medication management is critical to  effective continuity of care for servicemembers transitioning out of the  military because of the potential adverse health effects that could arise if  not taken as intended."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Officials and Veterans Report a Range of Challenges and Opportunities to Better Support Readjusting Veterans", "paragraphs": ["During our interviews with agency officials and discussions with veterans  and other stakeholder groups, we heard a number of challenges that VA  faces in helping veterans during the readjustment experience. First,  although VA has an agreement with DOD to let VA know when  servicemembers are leaving the military, some VA officials told us it can  be difficult to identify recently separated veterans, including those who  may be experiencing readjustment difficulties, because they did not know  who was leaving the military. Second, at two of the sites we visited,  veterans we spoke with told us they separated too quickly from the  military without the time they needed to prepare for certain aspects of  civilian life, such as finding a job, making sure they were financially  stable, or becoming better acquainted with what VA offered. Third, we  repeatedly heard from VA official and veterans that some veterans may  hesitate to use VA services. For example, officials at one site we visited  told us that some younger veterans do not want to be diagnosed as  having PTSD because it will keep them from entering certain civilian  careers, such as homeland security. Officials at two of the sites we visited  told us that some veterans try to manage their own issues or problems,  instead of seeking assistance. At one of the sites we visited, veterans told  us they hesitated to enroll in VA services because they did not want to  ask for help. Lastly, VA officials told us that despite an increased effort to  educate National Guard and Reserve members, before and after they  demobilize, some are likely being missed. Should these veterans not  receive VA\u2019s assistance in a timely way, any difficulties they may be  experiencing during their readjustment to civilian life may worsen.", "In light of the difficulties we heard, several VA officials suggested ways  that VA could improve its support to veterans with an elevated risk of  experiencing a difficult readjustment. First, some called for additional VA  research. At one site we visited, VA officials suggested there were  opportunities to research ways to identify individuals who are predisposed  to PTSD as well as conducting a study on reasons veterans are not using  VA services. Second, in discussing the issue of the speed of transition out  of the military, VA officials at one site we visited suggested establishing a  \u201cbuffer zone\u201d that would allow servicemembers time to readjust to being a  civilian, before they are discharged from the military. Such a buffer zone  has the potential to enhance VA\u2019s ability to reach out to servicemembers  before they become veterans, assess their needs, and prepare the  appropriate services for when they leave. While this effort would need to  be developed and coordinated with DOD, veterans at all of the sites we  visited noted that having time to adjust to the idea of being a civilian and  relearning what civilian life is like would be beneficial.", "Consistent with the importance that VA\u2019s strategic plan places on  veterans\u2019 success after leaving military service, the opportunity to  possibly better serve veterans at risk for having readjustment difficulties  could also be informed by the approach VA takes to support ill and injured  veterans. For example, veterans who enter the OEF/OIF/OND Care  Coordination Program receive a full mental health assessment. These  assessments inform case managers about the difficulties veterans are  facing and helps inform where they refer veterans for further assistance.  Senior VA officials told us the assessments conducted by the  OEF/OIF/OND Care Coordination Program can be used as gateways to  provide veterans, who are experiencing difficulties such as, TBI,  depression, and alcohol abuse, with an integrated treatment approach.  These officials added that the goal is to treat veterans holistically, rather  than offering mental, physical and social work care separately. Similarly,  the FRCP was designed to coordinate clinical and nonclinical services for  the most seriously wounded, ill, or injured. Servicemembers and veterans  who are enrolled in the program are offered assistance with developing a  plan that sets recovery goals and then guides them through the  continuum of care of medical treatment and stabilization, rehabilitation,  and community reintegration. FRCP employs dedicated care coordinators  to guide servicemembers, veterans, and their families through the  complex systems of health care, services, and benefits provided by DOD,  VA, other federal agencies, and the private sector. To the extent that VA  does not consider this approach for veterans likely to experience difficult  transitions, especially those with known risk factors, some veterans may  be left to themselves to deal with the after effects of combat. Importantly,  some veterans we spoke with said that obtaining support early in the  readjustment process is crucial because veterans who receive assistance  immediately after separating from the military may have a better chance  of achieving a successful readjustment. According to Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, agencies should identify  risks, estimate the risk\u2019s significance, assess the likelihood of its  occurrence, and decide how to manage the risk and what actions should  be taken.is not occurring as early as possible, VA could be missing an opportunity  to use its resources most efficiently and effectively. That is, if veterans do  not receive the fullness\u2014or any\u2014of the support they need, the difficulties  that emerge early in the readjustment process may worsen, resulting in  potentially greater harm to the veteran and putting the agency at risk for  an increase in the amount of resources it must then provide in the  veteran\u2019s readjustment process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As over 1 million servicemembers separate from the military over the next  6 years, many will rely upon the programs administered by VA for support  during their transition. For some veterans, this transition will go smoothly  and without major difficulty. For others, however, the first few years after  they leave the military will be difficult. Even though hundreds of articles,  studies, and reports have been written about the experiences of veterans,  relatively few discuss how recently separated veterans are adjusting to  civilian life, and the issue of how well veterans are faring is still not well  understood. Meanwhile, despite VA\u2019s network of outreach efforts and the  range of benefits and services it administers, many veterans continue to  struggle to access support, and the agency continues to face long- standing challenges in providing benefits in a timely manner. And, while  the Transition Assistance Program may help identify some of those at risk  for having a difficult readjustment, the program does not cover the  breadth of issues many veterans face once they leave the military. As a  result, some veterans who need support may be missed. However, until  VA has a better understanding of the needs of recently-separated  veterans, and which veterans may be more likely to face difficulties, it is  difficult to know what steps VA should take. For instance, if many  veterans face multiple problems that need to be addressed across its  organizational boundaries, from health care, disability, and employment  services, then more coordinated case management services may be  needed. If veterans wait too long to seek out the help they need, then an  effort to identify and target veterans for early intervention may be needed.  If VA discovers severe struggles exist among a relatively narrow but  identifiable small group of veterans during the initial years of civilian life,  then VA is better positioned to take an early and cost-effective approach  to helping rebuild lives. For veterans, having timely access to programs  and services may improve their chances of having positive health,  economic, and social outcomes. For VA, better-supported veterans may  be less likely to end up in need of more intensive care and case  management services over time, which would put less strain on VA\u2019s  limited resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs take steps to better  understand both the difficulties faced by readjusting veterans and the  characteristics of those who may be more likely to face such difficulties,  and use the results to determine how best to enhance its benefits and  services to these veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA for review and comment.
