Specifically, GAO found the program", "lacked guidance on key requirements with the level of specificity necessary to provide clear direction, making self-policing difficult, and raising concerns that the guidance could be interpreted in ways that were inconsistent with its intent. In particular, GAO found HRSA's guidance lacked needed specificity on the definition of a patient eligible for drugs discounted under the program, criteria hospitals not publicly owned or operated needed to meet to qualify for the program, and nondiscrimination guidance manufacturers needed to follow to ensure drugs were distributed equitably to both covered entities and non-340B providers.", "had increasingly been used in settings, such as hospitals, where the risk of diverting 340B drugs to ineligible patients was greater, because these settings were more likely to serve such patients.", "To address these oversight inadequacies and to ensure appropriate use of the program, GAO recommended HRSA (1) conduct selective audits of covered entities to deter potential diversion; (2) further specify its nondiscrimination guidance for cases in which distribution of drugs is restricted and require reviews of manufacturers' plans to restrict distribution of drugs at 340B prices; (3) finalize new, more specific guidance on the definition of a patient eligible to receive discounted drugs; and (4) issue guidance to further specify the criteria that hospitals not publicly owned or operated must meet to be eligible for the 340B Program.", "In fiscal year 2012, HRSA implemented two of GAO's four 2011 recommendations.

With regard to the other two recommendations, HRSA planned to address the definition of a patient and hospital eligibility criteria in a comprehensive 340B Program regulation it submitted to the Office of Management and Budget in April 2014. However, HRSA withdrew this proposal following a May 2014 federal district court ruling addressing HRSA's statutory authority to issue a separate 340B regulation, which found that HRSA's rulemaking authority for the 340B Program is limited to specified areas.

The  program, created in 1992 and named for the statutory provision  authorizing it in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), requires drug  manufacturers to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to eligible  clinics, hospitals, and other entities\u2014commonly referred to as covered  entities\u2014in order to have their drugs covered by Medicaid. According to  the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the agency  within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible  for administering and overseeing the 340B Program, the purpose of the  program is to enable covered entities to stretch scarce federal resources  to reach more eligible patients, and provide more comprehensive  services.oversight of the 340B Program, particularly given growth in the program  over time. According to HRSA officials, as of 2015 more than 11,000  covered entities were participating in the 340B Program\u2014an increase of  approximately 30 percent since 2008. According to the most recent  estimate available from HRSA, covered entities\u2019 spending on 340B drug  purchases was estimated to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2013.", "In recent years, questions have been raised regarding HRSA\u2019s  Participation in the 340B Program is voluntary for both covered entities  and drug manufacturers, but there are strong incentives to participate.  Covered entities can realize substantial savings through 340B price  discounts\u2014an estimated 20 to 50 percent of the costs of the drugs,  according to HRSA. In addition, covered entities can generate 340B  revenue. For example, they can purchase drugs at 340B prices for all  eligible patients regardless of the patients\u2019 income or insurance status  and generate revenue that may exceed the 340B price paid for the drugs,  such as through a patient\u2019s insurance reimbursement. Because they must  participate in the 340B Program to receive Medicaid reimbursement for  their drugs, incentives for participation by drug manufacturers also are  strong. According to HRSA, most manufacturers that produce outpatient  drugs have participated in the program since its inception.", "HRSA requires program participants to meet certain conditions set forth  both in law and agency guidance. For example, under the PHSA, covered  entities are prohibited from diverting 340B drugs\u2014that is transferring  340B drugs to individuals who are not eligible patients of the entities.  Similarly, to help ensure covered entities receive the discounts they are  entitled to, HRSA has issued guidance prohibiting drug manufacturers  from distributing drugs in ways that would discriminate against covered  entities compared to non-340B health care providers (referred to as  HRSA\u2019s nondiscrimination guidance throughout this statement), such as  by imposing minimum purchase requirements or other restrictive  conditions.", "In a September 2011 report, we identified inadequacies in HRSA\u2019s  oversight of this program and recommended actions that should be taken  to improve program oversight and ensure appropriate use of the  program.

Upon enrollment into the program, HRSA required participants to self- certify that they would comply with applicable 340B Program  requirements and any accompanying agency guidance. HRSA also  expected participants to develop the procedures necessary to ensure  compliance, maintain auditable records that demonstrated compliance,  and inform HRSA if violations occurred. For example, covered entities  had to develop adequate safeguards to prevent drugs purchased at 340B  prices from being diverted to non-eligible patients, such as by using  inventory tracking systems that separately processed the purchase and  logged the dispensation of 340B drugs. Similarly, manufacturers had to  ensure that they properly calculated the 340B price of their drugs.

As a result, covered entities could  interpret the definition either too broadly or too narrowly. At the time of  our report, agency officials told us that they recognized the need to  provide additional clarity around the definition of an eligible patient, in  part because of concerns that some covered entities may have  interpreted the definition too broadly to include non-eligible  individuals, such as those seen by providers who were only loosely  affiliated with a covered entity.", "HRSA had not issued guidance specifying the criteria under which  hospitals that were not publicly owned or operated could qualify for  the 340B Program.

We found that HRSA did not outline  any criteria that must be included in such contracts, such as the  amount of care a hospital must provide to these low-income  individuals, and did not require the hospitals to submit their contracts  for review by HRSA. As a result, hospitals with contracts that  provided a small amount of care to low-income individuals not eligible  for Medicaid or Medicare could claim 340B discounts, which may not  have been what the agency intended.", "HRSA\u2019s nondiscrimination guidance was not specific in the practices  that manufacturers should follow to ensure that drugs were equitably  distributed to covered entities and non-340B providers when  distribution was restricted.

We concluded that  increased use of the 340B Program by contract pharmacies and hospitals  may have resulted in a greater risk of drug diversion to ineligible patients,  in part because these facilities were more likely to serve patients that did  not meet the definition of a patient of the program. According to HRSA  officials, the number of covered entities using contract pharmacies had  grown rapidly after it issued its guidance allowing all covered entities to  use multiple contract pharmacies; as of July 2011 there were more than  7,000 contract pharmacy arrangements in the program.
