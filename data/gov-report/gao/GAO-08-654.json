Both types of IRAs have rules governing eligibility to contribute, and all IRA contributions are subject to an annual limit. For example, eligibility to deduct (from taxable income) contributions to a traditional IRA and to contribute to a Roth IRA depends on taxpayer income and filing status, while coverage by an employer-sponsored retirement plan only affects eligibility for deductible contributions to a traditional IRA. Tax rules for distributions diverge for traditional and Roth IRAs, but both types are generally subject to a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty, with some exceptions. Further, traditional IRA owners over age 70? must take minimum distributions or face a 50 percent penalty on the required distribution amount. Rollovers, where a taxpayer moves money from one account into an IRA account, must be completed within 60 days, or the amounts are taxable and subject to penalty. To assist taxpayers in voluntarily complying with IRA rules, IRS offers special publications and telephone assistance for taxpayers with IRA questions. Even with IRS's service efforts, IRS data show that some taxpayers fail to comply with rules for reporting contribution deductions and taxable distributions from traditional IRAs. IRS's National Research Program showed that nearly 15 percent of taxpayers who took traditional IRA contribution deductions as well as 15 percent of those who took taxable distributions misreported on them on their tax returns in 2001 (the most recent data available). IRS has automated enforcement programs--matching tax returns with information reported by IRA custodians--to detect and correct these types of IRA misreporting. For tax year 2004, IRS assessed additional taxes of $23.2 million for ineligible traditional IRA contribution deductions or exceeding the deduction limits and $61.1 million in taxes and penalties for early withdrawals from traditional IRAs. As partly shown by taxpayer misreporting to IRS, taxpayers face challenges in figuring how much they can contribute, navigating the various distribution rules, and rolling over their IRAs between custodians. For example, according to representatives of financial firms and advisors GAO interviewed, taxpayers may not understand that the annual contribution limit applies across traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs in combination. On the distribution side, interviewees said that older taxpayers make mistakes in determining when they must start distributions and calculating the correct amount. Interviewees identified some options for IRS to clarify guidance, such as for the combined contribution limit rule, or develop tools to help taxpayers, such as a Webbased calculator for required minimum distributions. IRS could explore actions such as requiring additional reporting by custodians or simplifying the required minimum distribution rule to strengthen compliance with this complicated rule. Other options to reduce the complexity of IRA rules, such as eliminating income limits on eligibility, pose trade-offs and could be considered in the context of broader tax reform"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Created over 30 years ago, individual retirement accounts\u2014popularly  known as IRAs\u2014are a key tax-preferred vehicle for individuals to save for  retirement. According to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) latest  analysis, about 51 million taxpayers held $3.3 trillion in IRAs at year-end  2004. IRAs also are increasingly important as a way for individuals to roll  over savings from pension plans. Total assets in IRAs in 2007 surpassed  assets held in either employer-sponsored defined benefit or defined  contribution plans.", "According to estimates by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury),  IRAs cost the federal government an estimated $9.5 billion in forgone  revenue for fiscal year 2007. This reflects the revenue losses by the federal  government due to the preferential tax treatment of both traditional and  Roth IRAs. The traditional IRA allows tax deferral on investment earnings  until retirement distribution with an up-front tax deduction from taxable  income for contributions by eligible taxpayers. To limit the tax deferral,  taxpayers over age 70\u00bd cannot contribute to, and must begin taxable  distributions from, their traditional IRAs. In contrast, Roth IRA  contributions are not tax deductible and distributions are generally not  required for the account owner. Instead, subject to income limitations,  taxpayers regardless of age can make after-tax contributions to Roth IRAs  with retirement distributions, including investment earnings, generally  being tax-free. To limit revenue losses and tax benefits from accruing  disproportionately to the wealthy, the law imposes a total annual limit on  IRA contributions as well as income limits on the deductibility of  traditional IRA contributions and eligibility for Roth IRAs. Contributions  exceeding the limits are subject to a 6 percent additional tax to penalize  excess contributions.", "Even with tax incentives for retirement saving, personal saving in the  United States remains near historic lows. To improve personal saving,  Congress has changed the IRA rules over the years, for example, by  increasing the contribution limits and allowing workers to tap IRA assets  for certain nonretirement purposes without the early withdrawal penalty.  In addition to the traditional tax-deferred IRA, Congress in 1997 created  the after-tax Roth IRA. There are also two kinds of employer-based  IRAs\u2014Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE) and  Simplified Employee Pensions (SEP). Although providing taxpayers with  more IRA options, these changes also added complexity to the rules  governing IRA contributions and distributions. This complexity coupled  with the various penalties on IRA rule violations add to the compliance  burden for taxpayers, financial services firms acting as IRA custodians,  and financial planners and advisors, as well as the burden for IRS in  enforcing the IRA rules.", "Some taxpayers\u2014whether intentionally or unintentionally\u2014fail to comply  with the rules. Some taxpayers may inadvertently contribute more than  allowed given their income limits. A taxpayer may have an incentive to lie  about the reason for an early withdrawal to avoid penalty. Noncompliance  with IRA rules\u2014for example, overstated deductions for contributions and  underreported distributions from traditional IRAs\u2014can contribute to the  gross tax gap, last estimated at $345 billion for tax year 2001. The gross tax  gap is the annual difference between what taxpayers pay in taxes  voluntarily and on time and what they should pay under the law. Because  of taxpayer noncompliance, the burden of funding the nation\u2019s  commitments falls more heavily on taxpayers who willingly and accurately  pay their taxes.", "You asked us to examine taxpayer compliance and challenges with key  IRA rules.

For  both IRA types, eligibility is limited to taxpayers with taxable  compensation. For a traditional IRA in tax year 2008, eligibility for a full  or partial deduction from taxable income depends on whether a taxpayer  or spouse is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan as well as  limits on modified adjusted gross income (AGI) and filing status, as  shown in table 2. For example, a single taxpayer not covered by an  employer plan can take a full deduction regardless of income, and a  married taxpayer filing jointly whose spouse is covered by an employer  plan can take the full deduction if the couple\u2019s modified AGI was $159,000  or less for 2008. A taxpayer ineligible for any deduction based on pension  coverage or modified AGI can still make nondeductible contributions to a  traditional IRA. A taxpayer in the phaseout range who is married and filing  jointly or a qualified widower has to figure out the deductible contribution  portion and decide whether to contribute the rest on a nondeductible  basis.", "For a Roth IRA, eligibility also depends on modified AGI and filing status,  as shown in table 3. For example, a single taxpayer with modified AGI of  less than $101,000 is eligible for a full contribution in 2008, and married  taxpayers filing jointly with modified AGI of less than $159,000 also are  eligible for a full contribution. A single taxpayer with AGI of at least  $116,000 or married taxpayers filing jointly with AGI of $169,000 or more  cannot contribute to a Roth IRA for 2008. Taxpayers in the income  phaseout range have reduced contribution limits. Coverage by an  employer-sponsored retirement plan does not affect eligibility for a Roth  IRA.", "Both traditional and Roth IRAs are subject to annual contribution limits.  Table 4 shows how the annual limit has changed over time and varies  depending on a taxpayer\u2019s age. For 2008, taxpayers under age 50 can  contribute up to $5,000 and those over the age of 50 and under age 70\u00bd  can contribute up to $6,000 to traditional and Roth IRAs. Taxpayers age  70\u00bd and older can contribute to a Roth IRA only. Contributions can be  made any time during a year or by the due date for filing a tax return, not  including extensions. For example, contributions for 2008 must be made  by April 15, 2009. A taxpayer who contributes less than the annual limit  cannot make up the difference after that date.", "Total contributions to Roth and traditional IRAs in any year cannot exceed  the combined contribution limit. Any contribution in excess of the limit or  made by an ineligible taxpayer is subject to a 6 percent penalty annually if  the excess amount\u2014and any earnings\u2014is not withdrawn by the date the  return for the year is due, including extensions. A taxpayer can choose to  either withdraw an excess contribution to avoid the penalty or carry the  excess forward as a contribution for a later year but still is liable for the  excess contribution penalty. For example, if a taxpayer contributes more  than allowed in 2008, that taxpayer has until April 15, 2009, to remove the  excess, or the taxpayer can pay the penalty for 2008 and apply the excess  as contributions for 2009. A taxpayer also can treat a contribution made  to one IRA as having been made to a different IRA type; this is known as a  recharacterization.

Under 2002 regulations, which simplified the calculation, required  minimum distributions for a traditional IRA are calculated using the  previous year\u2019s fair market value divided by life expectancy based on a  uniform table. A taxpayer must begin required minimum distributions by  April 1 of the year after turning age 70\u00bd. The second distribution must be  made by December 31 of the year containing this April 1, and subsequent  required minimum distributions must be made by December 31. Failure to  take the required minimum is subject to a 50 percent penalty on the  required amount not distributed. A taxpayer may request that IRS excuse  the penalty if the excess accumulation is due to reasonable error and the  taxpayer is taking steps to draw down the excess.

If a taxpayer does not roll over money within the  allowed time or rolls over an IRA too frequently, the transaction does not  qualify for tax-free treatment. For a failed rollover, the distribution from  the first IRA is taxable and subject to the 10 percent early distribution  penalty if the taxpayer is younger than age 59\u00bd. Further, amounts  contributed in excess of the annual limit to the second IRA are subject to a  6 percent additional tax to penalize excess contributions. IRS has  authority to waive the 60-day requirement and extend the rollover period  where the failure to do so would be against good conscience, such as in  the event of a disaster or an event beyond the taxpayer\u2019s reasonable  control.

Because of resource constraints, IRS officials said that they do not  contact taxpayers in all cases where the AUR program finds a mismatch  between what was reported on an information return and what was  reported on a tax return. If a mismatch occurs over a certain tax threshold,  IRS decides if the mismatch warrants a notice, asking the taxpayer to  explain the discrepancies, such as when a taxpayer inadvertently fills in  the wrong line on the tax return, or pay any taxes assessed. AUR reviewers  are directed to consider the reasonableness of the taxpayers\u2019 responses to  notices but generally do not examine the accuracy of the information in  the responses because they do not have examination authority.", "For tax year 2001, AUR contacts represented about 2 percent of the  noncompliant taxpayers estimated by NRP of either taking an ineligible  deduction or overdeducting contributions for traditional IRAs, with about  9,000 taxpayers assessed by the AUR program compared with nearly  555,000 taxpayers estimated by NRP. For tax year 2004, the last full year  for which data are available, of 25,000 mismatches for taxpayers  potentially ineligible for the contribution deduction, IRS assessed  additional taxes of $7 million for nearly 9,000 taxpayers. Of about 85,000  mismatches for taxpayers who potentially overdeducted their traditional  IRA contributions, the AUR program assessed additional taxes of   $16.2 million for about 15,000 taxpayers for tax year 2004. Table 5 shows  the numbers of taxpayers and total additional taxes assessed for  misreported traditional IRA deductions for tax years 2001 to 2004. The  AUR program does not necessarily work these IRA cases on a stand-alone  basis and may pursue potential IRA deduction misreporting along with  other discrepancies for taxpayers in the AUR inventory.", "We could not isolate the AUR data on additional taxes assessed on  taxpayers who misreported distributions from traditional IRAs because  those data are combined with misreporting of taxable distributions from  other retirement plans. The AUR program does, however, capture separate  data for taxpayers who misreported early distributions from their  traditional IRAs. In tax year 2004, of about 420,000 mismatches, the AUR  program assessed taxes against about 38,000 taxpayers. As shown in table  5, the AUR program assessed total taxes and penalties of $61.0 million on  taxpayers who misreported early distributions from traditional IRAs in  that year. In addition to those cases with assessments, the AUR program  follows up with taxpayers on some cases where the Form 1099-Rs filed by  custodians reported that no known penalty exception applies for an early  distribution. According to a financial industry organization representative  we interviewed, custodians play a limited role in reporting whether an  exception applies because a custodian may not know why a taxpayer took  a distribution and is not in a position to validate exceptions reported by  the taxpayer.", "IRS is considering a new compliance initiative that could alert more  taxpayers about their misreported IRA transactions. According to IRS  compliance officials, when fully implemented a new AUR \u201csoft notice\u201d  program would send letters to many taxpayers in the AUR inventory  asking them to voluntarily fix their noncompliance by filing amended  returns, or to not repeat the action the following year. A soft notice  requires a taxpayer to take minimal actions and is intended to educate and  stimulate compliance without IRS having to invest substantial resources.

Some contribution rule challenges span  both traditional and Roth IRAs, while other challenges related to whether  a traditional IRA contribution is deductible and how to keep records for  nondeductible contributions.", "Some taxpayers may not understand the annual limits on IRA  contributions in part because the limits have changed over recent years  and vary by taxpayer age. For example, the 2007 limit for both kinds of  IRAs was $4,000 for taxpayers under age 50 and $5,000 for taxpayers age  50 and older, and the 2008 limits are $5,000 and $6,000, respectively. As  IRS\u2019s math error data show for tax years 2003 to 2006, some taxpayers try  to deduct more than their legal limit for traditional IRA contributions.  According to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration  (TIGTA), taxpayers over age 70\u00bd continue to improperly claim traditional  IRA deductions. Financial industry organization and advisor  representatives we interviewed agreed that the annual contribution limit  rule, with the amount indexed for inflation beginning in 2009, could  confuse some taxpayers, but they did not see complying with the  contribution limit as a major challenge. According to interviewees, IRS  publishes the limits well ahead of when they become effective, and IRA  custodians and financial advisors reach out to advise taxpayers on any  changes. While custodians typically would not accept a contribution  exceeding the annual limit, a custodian would not know if a taxpayer  contributed to other IRAs for the same tax year.", "According to some interviewees, taxpayers may be confused by the  combined limits and some may not understand that the total limit applies  across traditional and Roth IRAs and is not a limit for each type. Currently,  the 2007 IRS Publication 590 discusses the total contribution limit in the  traditional IRA chapter on page 11: \u201cIf you have more than one IRA, the  limit applies to the total contributions made on your behalf to all your  traditional IRAs for the year.\u201d Page 11 also has a caution: \u201cContributions  on your behalf to a traditional IRA reduce your limit for contributions to a  Roth IRA. See chapter 2 for information about Roth IRAs.\u201d On page 60 in  the Roth IRA chapter, traditional IRA and Roth IRA contribution limits are  discussed, as follows: \u201cIf contributions are made to both Roth IRAs and  traditional IRAs established for your benefit, your contribution limit for  Roth IRAs generally is the same as your limit would be if contributions  were made only to Roth IRAs, but then reduced by all contributions for the  year to all IRAs other than Roth IRAs. Employer contributions under a  SEP or SIMPLE IRA plan do not affect this limit.\u201d Even though the  publication explains the rule separately in each chapter, we believe the  various statements could be confusing to some taxpayers, particularly  those who may not read both chapters. According to IRS officials we  interviewed, other options to help clarify the guidance about the rule  could include repeating the total contribution limit in the general reminder  section up front in Publication 590 as well as on the IRS Web site and in  other IRS outreach materials. For example, IRS included a reminder about  the total contribution limit in its summer 2008 employer plans newsletter  for tax practitioners, and IRS could include a similar reminder in the  annual press release announcing the new contribution limits for the  upcoming year.", "Income eligibility rules are a challenge for both traditional and Roth IRAs.  Taxpayers over certain income limits cannot contribute to a Roth IRA and  cannot deduct traditional IRA contributions. Interviewees also said that  one reason taxpayers may be ineligibly contributing is because their year- end modified AGI exceeds the eligibility limit after they have already made  the contribution. In addition, taxpayers must determine their partial  deduction amounts if their modified AGI falls within certain phaseout  ranges near the income limit for eligibility. The phaseouts, thus, introduce  opportunities for some taxpayers to err by overdeducting their traditional  IRA contributions or overcontributing to a Roth IRA. IRA contributions  errors can contribute to the gross tax gap. For example, for tax year 2004,  IRS\u2019s AUR program assessed $23.2 million in additional tax on nearly  24,000 taxpayers who overdeducted or ineligibly deducted traditional IRA  contributions.", "Interviewees generally agreed that the pension participation rule is a  major challenge for taxpayers trying to determine their eligibility for a  traditional IRA contribution deduction. Taxpayers who are single, heads of  households, or qualifying widows/widowers and married couples not  covered by any employer retirement plan are eligible for the full deduction  regardless of income. Interviewees said that taxpayers might be ineligibly  contributing because they are unaware that their employers made  contributions to their employer-sponsored retirement plans until they  receive their W-2s in January, after having already made their IRA  contributions. According to some interviewees, some taxpayers may not  understand the definition of \u201cactive participant.\u201d One representative  suggested that the definition for active participant in an employer- sponsored plan could be clarified to reduce confusion among employers  and taxpayers and to ensure that employers mark the W-2 correctly.  However, an IRS official knowledgeable about employer plans said that  the W-2 guidance details how employers are to handle the W-2 checkbox.  In turn, individuals need to know their participation status but not the full  rule. According to the official, individuals receive a breadth of benefit  information when hired, and they simply may not remember that they are  enrolled in their new employer\u2019s retirement plan until they receive their W- 2s.", "When a taxpayer contributes to a Roth IRA when he or she is ineligible  because of filing status or the modified AGI limits, one way to correct the  ineligible contribution and avoid the 6 percent penalty is to recharacterize.  However, the recharacterization process\u2014treating a contribution made to  an IRA as having been made to a different IRA type and transferring the  amount between IRAs\u2014can be confusing for taxpayers, according to  representatives we interviewed. To avoid possible errors and the burden  of recharacterization, taxpayers could, for example, wait until they receive  their 2008 W-2s to check their 2008 income eligibility and retirement plan  coverage and then make their eligible 2008 IRA contributions by April 15,  2009. However, some taxpayers may not want to wait until the end of the  year to make contributions and forgo the accruals on that year\u2019s  contribution. Some interviewees suggested basing eligibility on the  previous year\u2019s modified AGI, which taxpayers would already know and  could then use to better plan their contributions over the upcoming year  and avoid contribution errors.", "Nondeductible contributions to traditional IRAs pose their own challenges  for taxpayers because of recordkeeping needs. Interviewees said that  taxpayers may find it difficult or forget to track the basis of nondeductible  contributions over time in part because these contributions do not appear  on the Form 1040. They added that taxpayers who did not complete the  supplemental Form 8606 to track their nondeductible contributions may  find it challenging to determine the taxable amount of their distribution.  Some may potentially pay tax on the full distribution amount rather than  their taxable basis, while others face the burden of trying to locate the  information needed to determine the taxable amount and filing an  amended return. Representatives suggested that taxpayers may need more  IRS help to understand how to report and track nondeductible  contributions to traditional IRAs. Suggested options include clarifying the  tax return and Form 8606 and related guidance on tracking the basis for  nondeductible contributions, conducting research to determine where  taxpayer errors are occurring and developing corrective actions, and  implementing a minimum threshold for requiring basis calculation to  reduce taxpayer burden in making complicated calculations for small  distribution amounts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges with IRA Distribution Rules", "paragraphs": ["On the distribution end, some taxpayers may be confused about which  IRA distributions are taxable or subject to penalty, and older taxpayers in  particular may not understand when they must begin required minimum  distributions from traditional IRAs.

According to one  representative we interviewed, some taxpayers initially forget to report  traditional IRA distributions to IRS in part because retirement income is  not taxable in some states. Other taxpayers make mistakes in determining  the taxable portion of their distributions because of their original failure to  track the basis for nondeductible contributions.

Interviewees disagreed on  whether IRA early distribution rules should be conformed across different  types of retirement plans. Some representatives said that differences  among plans made sense, while other interviewees said that the  complexity introduced by different rule exceptions for different types of  retirement plans confuses taxpayers and conforming the early distribution  rules would be beneficial.", "One interviewee said that some taxpayers make mistakes when taking  early distributions from Roth IRAs because qualified distributions within  the 5-year holding period for a Roth IRA, while not subject to the 10  percent penalty, are still subject to taxation. Moreover, a taxpayer taking  an early distribution from a Roth IRA has to calculate the taxable portion  of distribution and that requires recordkeeping of all contributions and  earnings for the account.", "One interviewee said that taxpayers were sometimes confused about how  custodians report reasons for early distributions to IRS on the Form   1099-R. One representative suggested that Publication 590 could better  explain to taxpayers that IRA custodians are only obligated to report to  IRS whether an early withdrawal was taken, not whether the early  withdrawal qualified as an exception to the 10 percent penalty rule. In  addition, some IRA custodians suggested that to reduce taxpayer and  custodian confusion about temporary or newly enacted qualified  exceptions, IRS could designate a special code, such as for hurricane relief  or charitable giving, that custodians could use to complete the Form   1099-R until further guidance could be developed.", "Financial industry organization and advisor representatives generally  agreed that the required minimum distribution rule for traditional IRAs  was particularly challenging for older taxpayers in terms of both  determining the timing of the first distribution and calculating the correct  amount. For example, the carryover date for the first distribution, April 1,  does not coincide with the filing deadline of April 15, and some taxpayers  may not realize that subsequent distributions must be done by December  31. To help taxpayers comply with the rule, in 2002 IRS issued uniform  tables to simplify the calculation and effective for 2003 required that  custodians notify taxpayers through a check box on the Form 5498 that  the taxpayers are required to take a distribution in the following year.  Even with the added service, the complexity of the required minimum  distribution rule is challenging for taxpayers to navigate.", "Representatives said that the age of 70\u00bd was a confusing concept for  taxpayers. Although IRS\u2019s tables for calculating each year\u2019s minimum  distribution were updated in 2002 to reflect current life expectancy, the  required beginning age of 70\u00bd has been in place since IRAs were created  in 1974. Although some suggested changing the required minimum  distribution rule, one representative noted that changing the age, which  likely benefits the taxpayer through simplification, would likely create  some burden for financial institutions to adjust their information  technology systems.  Interviewees also suggested that IRS could help taxpayers comply with  required minimum distribution rules by developing an online tool on IRS\u2019s  Web site to help taxpayers calculate the correct minimum distribution  amounts or directly notifying taxpayers approaching age 70\u00bd that they will  be subject to the required minimum distribution rule.", "Some representatives we interviewed expressed concern that the 50  percent penalty on minimum distributions not taken was harsh and that  taxpayers may not understand how to request that IRS waive the penalty  for reasonable errors. Through tax year 2004, IRS directed taxpayers to  pay the penalty first and then request a waiver to get the penalty refunded.  In tax year 2005, IRS dropped the requirement for a taxpayer to pay first to  request a waiver. For tax year 2007, IRS revised the instructions for Form  5329\u2014the form for reporting additional taxes due on IRAs and other tax- favored accounts\u2014to clarify that a taxpayer is to provide documentation  explaining the issue and does not have to pay the penalty in advance to  request a waiver.", "Whereas IRA custodians provide educational assistance and notice to the  original taxpayer that the required minimum distribution rule applies for  the coming year, beneficiaries inheriting IRAs are likely to be less  prepared to deal with required distributions.

They added that system enhancements are being  explored, but currently, transfer options may be limited for some  taxpayers who wanted to directly transfer IRA assets.  Interviewees also pointed out that some taxpayers preferred not to  directly transfer their IRAs in part because some may want to use the  funds as a temporary loan during the 60-day window in which they are to  complete a rollover. This situation can be problematic, according to some  representatives, because taxpayers might cash out their funds or miss the  deadline to complete the rollover. Other interviewees said that the 60-day  rollover window benefits taxpayers and may increase savings because it  makes assets seem more accessible, which may alleviate some  apprehension about setting assets aside in the IRA. Taxpayers who miss  the 60-day window may qualify for an automatic waiver for custodian  mistakes in depositing funds or providing erroneous advice.

We also analyzed data on taxpayer misreporting  supplied by the Math Error program and the Automated Underreporter  (AUR) program. The Math Error program electronically checks for  obvious math errors as tax returns are processed, and the AUR program  matches taxpayer returns with IRA custodian-reported information. We  followed our guidance for assessing the reliability of computerized  databases in using these data sources, and determined that the data are  reliable for the purposes of this engagement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objective 3: Describe Challenges That Taxpayers Face with Key IRA Rules and Options for Strengthening Taxpayer Compliance", "paragraphs": ["To describe the challenges taxpayers face with key IRA rules and some  options for strengthening taxpayer compliance with these rules, we  reviewed prior GAO reports, IRS documents from its enforcement and  service programs that address IRA rules, and documents from other  organizations, such as IRS Publication 590 and reports issued by financial  industry organizations and research agencies. We also spoke with IRS  officials and financial industry organization and advisor representatives  knowledgeable about IRAs who provide tax planning advice or serve as  IRA custodians to get their perspectives on challenges related to IRA  compliance and how those challenges could be addressed. Specifically, we  interviewed representatives from financial industry organizations,  including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association;  Investment Company Institute, which represents the mutual fund industry;  Financial Planning Association; American Bankers Association; American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants; and AARP.", "We conducted two rounds of interviews with financial industry  organizations and advisor representatives. In our first round of interviews,  we asked open-ended questions to obtain information about the range of  challenges and options for strengthening compliance. Because we asked  open-ended questions, the frequency of our interviewees\u2019 responses is not  comparable. Therefore, we report responses without reporting the total  number of officials or representatives associated with each response. After  analyzing the information gathered to identify some common challenges  raised by the interviewees, we used a standard set of questions in a second  round of interviews with the representatives to try to verify responses and  obtain additional context for the challenges and options mentioned, such  as whether the challenges were major or frequent or whether an option  might impose significant burden on taxpayers or IRA custodians. We also  shared the list of challenges with IRS and Treasury to obtain concurrence  about taxpayer challenges. Finally, we limited the discussion of challenges  and options identified to only those related to the key IRA rules reviewed  in this report. These challenges and options are not exhaustive nor are the  trade-offs associated with each option. Many of the options are concepts,  rather than fully developed proposals with details on how they would be  implemented.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2008 through August  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
