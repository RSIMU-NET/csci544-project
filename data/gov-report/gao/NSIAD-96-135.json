In responding to these audit findings, NASA required its major space station contractors and product group subcontractors to establish detailed contract budgets and baselines, and to report periodic cost and schedule performance status using validated performance measurement systems. NASA also stipulated that (1) the performance measurement baseline would be changed only by formal modifications to the contract for scope of work changes, (2) cost growth on the contract would be proposed by the contractor and authorized by NASA before the additional costs were incurred, (3) an estimate to complete work would be evaluated on a monthly basis, and (4) the contract would include an incentive fee feature to encourage and motivate contractor cost performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman of the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, House Commerce Committee, asked us to review the program\u2019s cost and schedule status and NASA\u2019s actions to improve cost reporting.

However, program managers believe that it is unlikely that all known contingencies will require funding. They also said that they are continuing their efforts to identify future cost savings and develop other strategies that could be used to offset the potential cost growth threats. Recently, they were able to increase the reserves by negotiating with the Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences to fund some items, such as laboratory support equipment, that were to have been funded by the development budget.

As of January 1996, the contractor-estimated value of the remaining changes was, therefore, just over $400 million. In April 1996, NASA budgeted funds to accommodate most, but not all, of this amount because ISS program managers expect to negotiate these changes for less than the contractors\u2019 estimates.

Problems include the development of the node, which is scheduled to be launched on the first U.S. launch in December 1997, and the U.S. Laboratory section. Most of the adverse cost and schedule variances are due to development problems being experienced by lower tier subcontractors. Data from the Performance Measurement Status Report show that 67 percent of the over cost and 52 percent of the behind schedule conditions at the end of 1995 existed at lower tier subcontractors where performance measurement oversight is limited. Program managers have identified lower tier subcontract performance as a top program risk. The program manager for the largest product group subcontractor also told us that subcontractor performance is one of his major concerns.", "These unfavorable trends indicate developing cost and schedule problems that may be difficult to overcome. Contractor analyses in early 1996 showed that the unfavorable cost variance could exceed $114 million by July 1996 if the trends continued and recovery actions were unsuccessful.

Understated costs will ultimately further strain the limited financial reserves.", "Accurate information and analyses of cost and schedule status and estimates of total completion costs are important because they provide cost visibility of the actual funding requirements for the approved scope of work. At a minimum, estimates of completion costs should consider actual performance and costs to date, projections of future performance, and estimates of the cost of work remaining. Research has shown that once a project is about 15-percent complete, it becomes increasingly unlikely that unfavorable cost or schedule trends will be reversed and more likely that the percent overrun at completion will be greater than the percent overrun to date. Such circumstances heighten the importance of contractors detailing their recovery plans when they claim that there will be no or little cost overrun at completion.

Reasons for the current overruns included increased spending to recover from schedule delays, purchase substitute parts, and pay premiums for accelerated deliveries; testing taking longer than planned; and poor vendor performance.

The narrative said that some elements had experienced technical development problems and testing failures and that they will experience cost overruns at completion. However, the narrative also said that the unfavorable cost variances will be offset by good performance elsewhere within this cost account and that a subcontractor will cover other unanticipated costs with management reserve funding. The narrative did not say how the current overrun would be corrected, but stated that the primary tier II subcontractor was managing to reduce budgets, which, if successful, would produce savings to offset the overrun.", "With 46 percent of work completed, the thermal control line item shows a $3.9-million, or 7-percent, overrun, and the estimate at completion predicts a $1.8-million overrun.

However, this subcontractor reported completing the project with no overrun, although a lower tier subcontractor performing the work forecast a $2.6-million overrun at completion for its portion of the work. The narrative explained that because the lower tier subcontractor had started cost recovery actions to potentially reduce some of the current overrun and was evaluating other actions, the product group subcontractor chose not to recognize any variance at completion until additional studies were completed.", "The performance measurement status reports also do not show the most recent bottom-up project completion cost estimates of the largest product group subcontractor, McDonnell Douglas, which was conducted prior to the July 1995 negotiations with the prime contractor. The estimate totaled $1.99 billion, $210 million more than the amount negotiated with Boeing and currently reported in the performance measurement system.

Some of this potential cost is included in the potential threats to the financial reserves previously discussed in this chapter. However, a total and sudden RSA withdrawal would likely prevent the ISS program from achieving the completion of assembly within its current $17.4-billion estimate. NASA officials stated that a complete and sudden withdrawal by RSA could result in a renegotiation of the annual $2.1-billion funding profile and the overall $17.4-billion assembly completion estimate.", "Initially, RSA committed to provide a Service Module for habitation and for guidance, navigation, and control; Soyuz vehicles to provide for emergency return through the completion of station assembly; and Progress vehicles to resupply dry cargo (food, clothing, etc.) and the propellant needed to maneuver and reboost ISS to maintain orbit. RSA\u2019s December 1995 proposed revision to that commitment included two options. Both essentially called for ISS elements to be attached to the MIR Space Station. One would have allowed RSA to delay development of the Service Module and the upgrading of Progress vehicles. Under the other, RSA would deliver the Service Module on time, but all other modules would be deferred past 2002. The most significant change for both options was the deletion of the Zenit launch vehicle, thereby eliminating RSA\u2019s use of upgraded Progress vehicles with larger payload capacity and its ability to launch the Science Power Platform.", "NASA rejected RSA\u2019s proposal because of unacceptable safety, cost, and operational impacts. However, it countered with an offer to ease RSA\u2019s launch requirements by using the space shuttle to fly supplies to MIR, and to launch the Science Power Platform. RSA accepted and, in return, committed to, among other things, delivering the Service Module on time, increasing the capacity of the Progress vehicle, developing a new vehicle for resupplying propellant and dry cargo, and modifying the Soyuz vehicles to accommodate a larger percentage of the U.S. astronaut corps.", "Despite RSA\u2019s recommitment, NASA officials continue to be concerned about RSA\u2019s ability to meet its obligations. If RSA is totally or substantially unable to meet its obligations, NASA would have to make up the shortfall.

For example, NASA has designated $250 million for developing a Control Module as a potential substitute for the Service Module. However, other additional costs are not currently identified as threats to reserves, including, for example, the cost of modifying shuttle orbiters to enable them to resupply propellant to the station.", "NASA headquarters officials said that the cost impact could not be entirely met by using reserves, if RSA is totally or substantially unable to meet its commitments. Early estimates of the cost and schedule impacts are currently being analyzed. The specific impacts are not yet known since they depend on the timing and extent of RSA\u2019s withdrawal.

Examples include the Mission Systems and Training Systems contracts and portions of the space shuttle and space suit contracts managed by the Johnson Space Center, and the utilization contract managed by the Marshall Space Flight Center.", "The Mission Systems and Training Systems contracts were awarded in 1989 and the Johnson Space Center\u2019s Mission Operations Directorate, which oversees these contracts, began pursuing performance measurement reporting for these two contracts in late 1992. As a result, these two contractors have implemented performance measurement systems. NASA has reviewed and approved both contractors\u2019 systems. The contractors provide NASA with monthly performance measurement status reports using DOD-specified formats.", "The space shuttle and space suit contractors are also providing performance measurement assessments for some ISS-related tasks, even though their contracts do not require a validated performance measurement system or specify the type of performance data to be provided. However, NASA has not verified that these contractors are properly using performance measurement systems to track and report progress. The reports provided by these contractors do not include variance analyses or corrective action plans.", "NASA last conducted a review of the utilization contract at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 1992, when that contract was a part of the Space Station Freedom Work Package 1 contract. However, with the inception of ISS, the Freedom contract was novated, resulting in the current utilization contract. The contractor\u2019s system has not been reviewed since the novation. NASA officials at the Marshall Space Flight Center told us that they plan to conduct a review as soon as the contractor establishes a new baseline, most likely sometime in the summer of 1996. Changes in the content of the contract, budget changes, and NASA\u2019s efforts to reduce its funding requirements have led to the current instability in the contract\u2019s baseline. NASA officials at the Marshall Space Flight Center said that the instability had prevented them from using the performance measurement system to its fullest advantage."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "What Is a Performance Measurement System and What Is It Supposed to Do?", "paragraphs": ["Performance measurement is a management tool for planning, monitoring, and controlling all aspects of program and project management\u2014cost, schedule, and technical requirements. Performance measurement has its origins in the Department of Defense (DOD) programs of the 1960s.Interest and application of the performance measurement concept spread to other government agencies in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, it is being applied to major programs of DOD, the National Security Agency, the Department of Energy, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).", "NASA\u2019s ability to track the development schedule for the International Space Station (ISS) is critical as the total program is spending over $5 million a day. To improve cost control and management of space station development contracts, NASA committed its contractors to implementing validated performance measurement systems. Also, in July 1995, NASA issued a draft policy directive and procedures to adopt DOD\u2019s Cost/Schedule Management Guide on all NASA contracts. The new directive established a set of performance measurement system criteria for NASA that were identical to those used by DOD. The intent of standardizing NASA and DOD requirements was to enable NASA contractors to use DOD processes and management reports and save the cost of creating and operating separate systems.", "When fully implemented, a performance measurement system has a detailed baseline program from which to measure whether tasks are ahead of or behind schedule, and/or under or over budget. The system is intended to provide early identification of potential cost and schedule problems and accurate information to help program managers take corrective actions. Trends can be extrapolated from the data to produce a range of cost and schedule estimates at completion for part or all of a project or its major segments.", "Effective performance management requires a stable budget baseline that is consistent with an integrated master program schedule. A properly integrated time-phased budget baseline and program schedule identifies detailed work requirements or milestones against which ongoing contract performance can be measured.", "The performance measurement monthly status reports compare planned budgets and schedules with actual work performed. The amount of work accomplished against the work schedule is called the \u201cearned value.\u201d Knowledge of the earned value is essential to monitoring progress because it provides insights into the cost and schedule status of tasks. The performance measurement status reports also highlight significant variances against the baseline cost and schedule. Variances that exceed established thresholds require analyses of the nature and cause of the problem. These analyses are required to describe the impact of the variance on the program and corrective actions taken or planned. Trend analyses of the cumulative costs and of the schedule for completing the project can be used to further assess project progress and to project the total cost and schedule to complete the project called the \u201cestimate at completion.\u201d", "Realistic estimates at completion permit program managers to compare estimated final costs to the budgeted and contracted amounts and provide cost visibility with regard to what the actual funding requirements might be for the approved scope of work. To be meaningful, an estimate at completion should include actual costs and accomplishments to date, knowledgeable projections of what remains to be accomplished, and realistic estimates of how much the remaining work will cost. Such estimates should be examined on a monthly basis and updated when warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s Comments on NASA\u2019s letter dated May 16, 1996."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.
