These networks can serve a variety of legitimate business purposes, but they also can be used in complex tax evasion schemes that are difficult for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to identify. GAO was asked to (1) describe what IRS knows about network tax evasion and how well IRS's traditional enforcement programs address it and (2) assess IRS's progress in addressing network tax evasion and opportunities, if any, for making further progress. To do this, GAO reviewed relevant documentation about IRS programs and interviewed appropriate officials about those programs and IRS's plans for addressing such tax evasion. GAO also interviewed relevant experts and agency officials in developing criteria needed to perform the assessment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS views network-based tax evasion as a problem but does not have estimates of the associated revenue loss in part because data do not exist on the population of networks. IRS does know that at least 1 million networks existed involving partnerships and similar entities in tax year 2008. IRS also knows that many questionable tax shelters and abusive transactions rely on the links among commonly owned entities in a network. IRS generally addresses network-related tax evasion through its examination programs. These programs traditionally involve identifying a single return from a single tax year and routing the return to the IRS division that specializes in auditing that type of return. From a single return, examiners may branch out to review other entities if information on the original return appears suspicious. However, this traditional approach does not align well with how network tax evasion schemes work. Such schemes can cross multiple IRS divisions or require time and expertise that IRS may not have allocated at the start of an examination. A case of network tax evasion also may not be evident without looking at multiple tax years. IRS is developing programs and tools that more directly address network tax evasion. One, called Global High Wealth Industry, selects certain high-income individuals and examines their network of entities as a whole to look for tax evasion. Another, yK-1, is a computerized visualization tool that shows the links between entities in a network. These efforts show promise when compared to GAO's criteria for assessing network analyses. They represent new analytical approaches, have upper-management support, and cut across divisions and database boundaries. However, there are opportunities for more progress. For example, IRS has no agencywide strategy or goals for coordinating its network efforts. It has not conducted assessments of its network tools, nor has it determined the value of incorporating more data into its network programs and tools or scheduled such additions. Without a strategy and assessments, IRS risks duplicating efforts and managers will not have information about the effectiveness of the new programs and tools that could inform resource allocation decisions. Among other items, GAO recommends that IRS establish an IRS-wide strategy that coordinates its network tax evasion efforts. Also, IRS should assess its network programs and tools and should evaluate adding more data to its current tools. IRS generally agreed with these recommendations and noted additional organizational changes the agency is making that will address networks."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Taxpayers can use networks to carry out a wide variety of legitimate  business functions; however, networks also can be used to evade federal  tax obligations.

This allows the taxpayers to shift expenses or hide income, resulting in  lost federal revenue. In one recent example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Ninth Circuit held that a family used transactions between commonly  owned entities to improperly eliminate $200 million in capital gains and  avoid $4 million in taxes. The extent of network-related tax  noncompliance has not been estimated, but in a 2007 tax compliance  forum we sponsored with the Joint Committee on Taxation and the  Congressional Budget Office, tax policy experts cited flows of income  among related entities as a potentially large problem.

Because we could not find existing  criteria that could be used for assessing IRS\u2019s network compliance efforts,  we developed criteria. To do this, we conducted semistructured interviews  with researchers who specialized in areas such as network analysis and  computer science, interviewed relevant officials at select federal agencies  that operate programs analyzing related entities or networks, and  interviewed IRS examiners about their work. We selected the researchers  based on our literature search of studies applying network analysis  techniques to noncompliance behavior as well as from referrals from the  researchers we had already interviewed.

Table 1 briefly describes some of the entities that will be discussed  in this report.  Certain entities file tax returns with IRS to report their  taxes owed, such as subchapter C corporations (C corporations), which  file Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return. Other entities may  operate as pass-throughs. A pass-through entity generally has the legal  right to impute or pass net income or losses through to its partners,  shareholders, and beneficiaries untaxed. Pass-through entities are required  to provide each partner, shareholder, or beneficiary with a Schedule K-1  stating the individual share of net income or loss to be reported. The  entities also provide this information to IRS. The partners, shareholders,  or beneficiaries are responsible for reporting this income or loss on their  individual income tax returns and paying any tax. Entities that may serve  as pass-throughs include subchapter S corporations (S corporations) and  partnerships.", "The various types of entities that make up networks can be linked in  multiple ways. Table 2 summarizes how a select set of individuals, various  forms of businesses, and trusts may own or control other entities.  The  ownership, beneficiary status, or family connections within a network may  not be initially apparent. Individual entities connected to an owner may in  turn own other entities or be the beneficiaries of other trusts, thus creating  the potential for a large, complex network. For illustrative purposes,  appendix II includes diagrams showing how certain entities can be linked  and how the income generated by these entities can pass around a  network.", "When taxpayers use multiple pass-through entities, they create what IRS  calls a \u201cmultitiered\u201d network. In IRS\u2019s definition, a multitiered network  exists when a pass-through entity is itself a partner, shareholder, or  beneficiary of another pass-through entity, leading to a situation where  income is allocated from one pass-through entity to another.  Figure 1,  adapted from an IRS study, is an illustration of a hypothetical, complex  network. In IRS\u2019s example, the allocation from the observed partnership  on the far left side of the diagram crosses nine pass-through entities along  the red line before it reaches one of its ultimate owners on the right.", "Owners of a network could use transactions among entities in the network  to create tax evasion schemes in which taxpayers   improperly conceal property ownership or income by diverting assets or  income from one entity to another;   improperly inflate an asset\u2019s basis to reduce capital gains taxes by selling  the asset within the network;  improperly generate losses or tax deductions, which are passed through to  other entities that use the losses or tax deductions to offset gains;   inappropriately shift losses, deductions, or credits from entities not  subject to U.S. federal income tax, such as foreign entities, to those who  are; or   inappropriately shift income from those entities subject to U.S. federal  income tax to those entities that are not.", "One example of a network tax evasion scheme is what IRS calls an  installment sale bogus optional basis transaction (iBOB). In an iBOB  scheme, taxpayers use commonly owned or controlled entities to  artificially adjust the basis of an asset and evade capital gains taxes. The  scheme can involve many layers of ownership, can take place over many  tax years, and can be shrouded by legitimate transactions. IRS  understands how the scheme works and has alerted examiners to its  existence. IRS\u2019s Web site also describes a similar abusive transaction. In  cooperation with IRS, we developed a video explaining how an iBOB  works and the challenges IRS faces in ensuring those who are engaged in  such schemes are caught. In our simplified example, a hypothetical  taxpayer, Mr. Jones, sells a hotel that has appreciated in value resulting in  capital gains that are taxable income.

IRS most recently estimated that the tax gap was a  net of $290 billion in 2001.  The tax-gap estimate relies on National  Research Program (NRP) data.

IRS management and technical staff reviewed the video  throughout its development, and we incorporated their technical  comments where appropriate.", "Because no existing criteria that we could find directly applied to  reviewing the progress of IRS\u2019s network analysis programs, we developed  our own. We conducted two groups of interviews with network analysis  users and experts to develop our criteria for network analysis program  development and implementation. The first group of interviews was with  academic researchers considered to be experts whom we identified  through detailed literature reviews and recommendations from other  experts. The second group of interviews was with federal agencies that  use network analysis tools. We also interviewed IRS auditors about their  work.", "To identify relevant academic experts, we reviewed the research literature  using network analysis and related methods. We then created a literature  search matrix and entered all studies obtained through the search that  involved some quantitative/automated form of network analysis and an  empirical application to a substantive area that had potentially direct  applications to our review. We selected a subset of these studies for a  more detailed review and used professional judgment to focus on studies  of most immediate relevance. The literature review was the primary tool  used for selecting researchers and experts for further follow up, which  was ultimately based on ensuring a balance of experts with expertise  across the entire array of substantive research topics and methodological  approaches that we identified in our search and on determining that  individual experts\u2019 research agendas were both broad and deep. We  conducted semistructured interviews with these experts, during which  time we asked for recommendations of other network analysis and data  mining experts. Often these recommendations were for researchers or  experts we had already identified. Not every expert we identified was  available to speak with us. The experts we spoke with included Wayne E.  Baker, University of Michigan; Stephen P. Borgatti, University of  Kentucky; Kathleen M. Carley, Carnegie Mellon University; Sean Everton,  Naval Postgraduate School; Mark Granovetter, Stanford University; David  Jensen, University of Massachusetts Amherst; Mark Mizruchi, University  of Michigan; Carlo Morselli, University of Montreal; Daniel M. Schwartz,  Criminal Intelligence Service Ontario; Duncan Watts, Yahoo! Research;  and Jennifer Xu, Bentley University. We used our interviews with these  experts to aid only in developing our criteria; they did not otherwise  contribute to the content of the report.", "To identify federal agencies to interview, we first reviewed academic  literature and reports on government agencies that conduct network  analyses, including our own reports. Through this review, we identified  Customs and Border Patrol (CBP); Federal Bureau of Investigation;  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; Immigration and Customs  Enforcement; Risk Management Agency at the United States Department  of Agriculture; and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also  identified the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which is  not a federal agency but has an oversight and enforcement component  similar to that of federal financial regulators. We conducted  semistructured interviews with relevant program staff that use network  analysis tools at these agencies and FINRA. During each interview, we  asked about what works well in their network analysis program; what  about their network analysis program needs improvement; what tools they  feel could improve their program; what are best practices for developing a  network analysis program; and what other agencies use network analysis  programs. Of those other agencies that were mentioned that had network  analysis programs, we chose not to meet with the Central Intelligence  Agency and National Security Agency due to time constraints and data  sensitivity issues. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) was also  recommended to us to speak with; while we did not directly speak with  DEA due to time constraints, we were able to speak with a DEA liaison at  CBP who briefly described DEA\u2019s network analysis program.", "From these two rounds of interviews, we distilled the common themes in  those responses to establish the criteria. We first read through all the  interviews, recording potential criteria. We then systematically reviewed  the entire set of interviews to identify all that contained our initial criteria;  this resulted in the rephrasing or elimination of some of these criteria, as  well as the addition of a number of new ones. The themes that emerged  from the interviews fell into the following categories: strategy,  management support, program evaluation, data management, staffing,  collaboration, methodology, and other. We determined that for our review  of IRS, it would not be appropriate to set criteria for the exact  methodology the agency should use in its network analysis program, or  particular software packages. Therefore, we eliminated any particular  research or methodological approaches and techniques from our final  criteria list. We also eliminated ideas where there was a clear division of  opinion among the experts we interviewed. For example, experts and  users did not agree on the benefits of including narrative data in network  analysis programs. We presented the criteria to IRS for its feedback.", "The final 14 criteria were categorized by theme: overall strategy;  programming and data; and collaboration. The criteria were neither  prioritized nor made to be specific to IRS. Each criterion was supported,  at minimum, by five interviews; many were supported by eight or more  interviews. The criteria with the fewest interviews for support generally  pertain to organizational structure issues. The academic experts generally  did not address these issues because they tend to use network analysis  programs for research purposes compared to a federal agency\u2019s use for  enforcement purposes. In these instances, we also had support from prior  GAO work.", "To assess IRS\u2019s progress in identifying and addressing network tax  noncompliance, we reviewed IRS documentation on its auditing  procedures and interviewed officials involved with identifying and  addressing noncompliance related to networks. We then compared the  evidence we collected in these reviews and interviews with the criteria we  had developed and identified specific instances where IRS has  demonstrated progress towards meeting each of the criteria. We also  identified opportunities for further progress in meeting the criteria. We  determined for the purposes of this review that the data used were  reliable. Because some of the efforts to address noncompliance were  under development during the time of our review, we presented the  assessment to IRS officials for their feedback and for related updates that  might affect the assessment.", "Our review of key studies applying quantitative network analysis methods  to areas of noncompliance or illicit activity (see app. III) focused on  identifying analytical approaches that individuals developing network  analysis systems may find useful. The criteria for selection of these studies  were similar to those used in selecting experts.

We included two additional  criteria to ensure more direct applicability of the studies to the report  topic.", "The selected studies applied network analysis directly to a specific set of  activities most directly related to the report topic, particularly criminal  intelligence, organized crime, fraud detection, public safety or security,  and international trafficking.", "Studies focused on counterterrorism applications of network analysis and  studies in the link analysis research area, which is focused on algorithms  for identifying relationships among items in large databases of  textual/narrative information, were largely excluded.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2009 through September  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

For example, higher centrality of  individuals in a network may be associated with higher levels of criminal  activity. Further, high levels of brokerage/network efficiency may be  associated with a leadership role in a criminal network and with success  in criminal activity. At the network level, chain structures often  characterize criminal networks, though more interconnected structures  (measured as density) in criminal networks may correspond with higher- risk activities.", "Second, tracking how network measures change may provide insight into  how criminal behavior evolves. One study suggests that network leaders  more effectively disguise involvement in criminal networks over time by  using indirect relationships.

Extending the  key player approach by incorporating data on individuals\u2019 or entities\u2019  attributes also may help. Approaches identifying cohesive subgroups and  clusters, including the presence or absence of links between them, may  suggest effective interventions.

Link  prediction, for example, uses machine-learning to identify unknown links  in a network. An alternative method is anomalous link detection, which  identifies links that are more likely to involve illicit/criminal/fraud activity.  A third method is anonymous identity matching, which uses known  relationships of unknown entities to predict their identities.
