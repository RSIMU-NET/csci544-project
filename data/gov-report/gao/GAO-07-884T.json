Although Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has taken steps to secure the 170 ports of entry on the northern and southern U.S. borders, Congress is concerned that unmanned and unmonitored areas between these ports of entry may be vulnerable. In unmanned locations, CBP relies on surveillance cameras, unmanned aerial drones, and other technology to monitor for illegal border activity. In unmonitored locations, CBP does not have this equipment in place and must rely on alert citizens or other information sources to meet its obligation to protect the border. Today's testimony will address what GAO investigators found during a limited security assessment of seven border areas that were unmanned, unmonitored, or both--four at the U.S.-Canada border and three at the U.S.-Mexico border. In three of the four locations on the U.S.-Canada border, investigators carried a duffel bag across the border to simulate the cross-border movement of radioactive materials or other contraband.

In some of these locations, the proximity of the road to the border allowed investigators to cross without being challenged by law enforcement, successfully simulating the cross-border movement of radioactive materials or other contraband into the United States from Canada. In one location on the northern border, the U.S. Border Patrol was alerted to GAO activities through the tip of an alert citizen. However, the responding U.S. Border Patrol agents were not able to locate GAO investigators. Also on the northern border, GAO investigators located several ports of entry that had posted daytime hours and were unmanned overnight. On the southern border, investigators observed a large law enforcement and Army National Guard presence on a state road, including unmanned aerial vehicles. Also, GAO identified federally managed lands that were adjacent to the U.S.-Mexico border. These areas did not appear to be monitored or did not have an observable law enforcement presence, which contrasted sharply with GAO observations on the state road. Although CBP is ultimately responsible for protecting federal lands adjacent to the border, CBP officials told GAO that certain legal, environmental, and cultural considerations limit options for enforcement--for example, environmental restrictions and tribal sovereignty rights."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our investigation of potential  security vulnerabilities on northern and southern U.S. borders. The United  States shares over 5,000 miles of border with Canada to the north, and  1,900 miles of border with Mexico to the south. Individuals attempting to  legally enter the United States by land present themselves to a Customs  and Border Protection (CBP) officer at one of the 170 ports of entry  located along these borders. Any other method of land entry is illegal.Because CBP checks the identification of entrants into the United States  and searches vehicles for contraband at ports of entry, individuals entering  the United States illegally may attempt to avoid screening procedures by  crossing the border in areas between ports of entry. The U.S. Border  Patrol, which is part of CBP, is responsible for patrolling and monitoring  these areas to stop cross-border violators. However, given limited  resources and the wide expanse of the border, the U.S. Border Patrol is  limited in its ability to monitor the border either through use of technology  or with a consistent manned presence. Commensurate with the perceived  threat, there is a sharp contrast between how CBP distributes human  resources on the northern border as opposed to the southern border.  According to CBP, as of May 2007, it had 972 U.S. Border Patrol agents on  the northern border and 11,986 agents on the southern border.", "Given the potential security vulnerabilities on our borders, you expressed  concern that cross-border violators may attempt to enter the United  States, possibly bringing with them radioactive materials or other  contraband, such as explosives, drugs, counterfeit money, and bogus  credit cards. We were therefore asked to perform a limited security  assessment to identify vulnerable border areas where CBP does not  maintain a manned presence 24 hours per day or where there is no  apparent monitoring equipment in place. You also requested that, where  possible, our investigators attempt to simulate the cross-border movement  of radioactive materials or other contraband to demonstrate the existence  of serious security vulnerabilities. To perform this work, our investigators  visited seven border areas that were unmanned, unmonitored, or both\u2014  four at the U.S.\u2013Canada border and three at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. We  identified these areas by reviewing information that is publicly available  and by reviewing our previous work on border security. These areas were  located in four states on the northern border and two states on the  southern border. We did not attempt to evaluate all potential U.S. border  security vulnerabilities. Investigators used a global positioning system  (GPS) in some cases and geographic landmarks in others to determine the  location of the border. In three out of four locations on the U.S.\u2013Canada  border, investigators crossed into the United States from Canada carrying  a duffel bag to simulate the cross-border movement of radioactive  materials or other contraband. Safety considerations prevented our  investigators from attempting to cross north into the United States from a  starting point in Mexico.", "We conducted our investigation from October 2006 through June 2007 in  accordance with quality standards for investigations as set forth by the  President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Northern Border", "paragraphs": ["According to CBP, the ease and speed with which a cross-border violator  can travel to the border, cross the border, and leave the location of the  crossing, are critical factors in determining whether an area of the border  is vulnerable.
