According to senior DOD officials DOD is not required to track all contingency construction projects separately from all other DOD projects, but DOD has been able to generate specific data on MILCON-funded contingency construction projects when requested. Senior DOD officials stated that they were unaware of the magnitude of their use of O&M funds because DOD has not tracked the universe and cost of O&M-funded unspecified minor military construction projects in support of contingency operations. GAO identified O&M-funded construction costs for fiscal years 2009-12 of at least $944 million for 2,202 of these projects in Afghanistan, costs that are significant compared with the $3.9 billion DOD reported as enacted for MILCON-funded projects there in the same period. DOD has routinely used O&M funding to more quickly meet requirements because the MILCON review process can take up to 2 years. However, DOD's use of O&M funding has posed risks. For example:", "Financial risk: In 2010, DOD identified needed concrete shelters at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, staying below the O&M maximum by dividing a single requirement into separate projects. DOD reported in 2015 that it should have used MILCON funds for the shelters, determining that the obligations incurred had exceeded the statutory maximum for O&M-funded unspecified minor military construction projects, resulting in an Antideficiency Act violation.", "Duplication risk : In 2015, officials at a base in the CENTCOM area of responsibility decided to use O&M funding for temporary facilities for a squadron while in the same year requesting MILCON funding for a permanent facility for the same squadron, which could result in providing the same service to the same beneficiaries.", "For MILCON-funded contingency construction projects, DOD has guidance used for determining the appropriate level of construction, or building standard, based on the facility's life expectancy requirements, but as of July 2015 had not documented the rationale for such determinations for 11 of the 39 projects in fiscal years 2011-15 that cost over $40 million each. Further, for 8 of the 11 projects, senior DOD officials could not confirm what level of construction the projects represented based on DOD standards aimed at helping to match investments with requirements. Senior DOD officials acknowledged that an absence of such documentation could lead to DOD constructing facilities in excess of requirements because of the resulting lack of communication with those who design and construct the facilities.", "DOD has not developed a formal process for reevaluating ongoing contingency construction projects when missions change. According to CENTCOM documentation, beginning in November 2011 DOD undertook five rounds of reviews of planned and ongoing projects in Afghanistan anticipating a change in the mission. However, without a requirement for such reviews, DOD risks constructing facilities that may be unneeded to support U.S. forces in the CENTCOM area of responsibility and in future contingencies worldwide."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made six recommendations including that DOD track the universe and cost of O&M-funded projects (DOD did not concur), review construction projects to ensure funds were properly used (DOD did not concur), examine approaches to shorten project approval times (DOD partially concurred), document level-of-construction determinations (DOD partially concurred), and require project reviews when missions change (DOD partially concurred).

The range, complexity,  and cost of contingency construction projects can vary greatly. For  example, with respect to troop housing, contingency construction projects  might range from tents on concrete slabs to brick-and-mortar barracks. To  help match the investment in these projects with requirements, DOD  identifies three levels of construction for contingency environments:  \u201cinitial\u201d (for use for up to 6 months), \u201ctemporary\u201d (generally for use for up  to 5 years), and \u201csemi-permanent\u201d (for use for up to 10 years and, with  maintenance and upkeep, for up to 25 years).

We determined the data to be sufficient and reliable  for the purposes of our reporting objectives by interviewing  knowledgeable agency officials, tracing selected construction projects to  source documents, and manually testing data for outliers and obvious  errors. For both MILCON- and O&M-funded contingency construction  projects, we assessed existing contingency construction project review  and approval, identification, documentation, information quality, and  control activity processes against GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government, which state among other things that agencies  should use quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives and  design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks by, for  example, clearly documenting all transactions and other significant events  in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for  examination. We also reviewed DOD and CENTCOM guidance and  standards for contingency construction, as well as roles and  responsibilities for managing, executing, and overseeing projects. We  discussed with officials at service component commands and bases in the  CENTCOM area of responsibility the approaches commanders used to  manage these projects, including the use of available statutory authorities  for funding them and the potential risks to individual projects\u2014identified  by base officials or in our review of project files\u2014that relied on O&M  funding for contingency construction.

We  compared these processes, along with relevant DOD and CENTCOM  guidance, with GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which states among other things that management should  establish an organizational structure, assign responsibility, and delegate  authority to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. In addition, we reviewed  available data from the Army Corps of Engineers database as of February  2015 for MILCON-funded contingency construction projects in the  CENTCOM area of responsibility. Out of these data we analyzed all  projects with programmed amounts equal to or over $40 million, to  account for the highest value projects equating to the top one-third of  programmed amounts for projects, to determine the extent to which DOD  had documented level-of-construction determinations for the projects with  the highest programmed amounts. The results of this analysis were not  generalizable to projects with programmed amounts below $40 million.

We compared these reviews with  DOD guidance, which states that the combatant commanders are  responsible for assessing the operational environment at critical  milestones to determine contingency basing requirements within their  respective area of responsibility.  Contingency basing includes the  planning, designing, constructing, operating, managing, and transitioning  or closing of a non-enduring location supporting a combatant  commander\u2019s requirements.

During the course of our review,  we found that the Army, which programs the majority of these O&M- funded unspecified minor military construction projects in the CENTCOM  area of responsibility, had not tracked or documented these projects and  was unable, therefore, to provide us with a comprehensive list accounting  for them. DOD officials from other organizations, including the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics; the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller);  CENTCOM; the Army Central Command; the Air Force Central  Command; the Army Corps of Engineers; and the Air Force Civil Engineer  Center also could not provide us with a comprehensive list of O&M- funded unspecified minor military construction projects in the CENTCOM  area of responsibility.

For example, though  O&M-funded contingency construction project files for fiscal years 2009  through 2010 for construction projects in Afghanistan are located in hard  copy in filing cabinets at Army Central Command headquarters at Shaw  Air Force Base, South Carolina, neither U.S. Forces-Afghanistan nor  Army Central Command could provide records prior to 2009. Further,  according to a U.S. Forces-Afghanistan official, an effort to review,  collect, and analyze historic construction project data after the fact would  be too resource-intensive given the drawdown of operations in  Afghanistan and the other higher priorities occupying the limited U.S.  Forces-Afghanistan personnel available to undertake such an effort.", "Absent a comprehensive list of DOD\u2019s O&M-funded unspecified minor  military construction projects, we used the limited information available to  identify O&M-funded unspecified minor military construction projects  supporting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and found that these  projects constituted a substantial segment of overall contingency  construction. Specifically, using available U.S. Forces-Afghanistan  information for fiscal years 2009 through 2012, we identified records  indicating that the command had approved at least $944 million in O&M  funding for 2,202 of these projects in Afghanistan alone. This use of  O&M funding appears significant when compared with the $3.9 billion  DOD reported as enacted for other construction projects in Afghanistan  over the same period using MILCON funding. Further, the 2,202  contingency construction projects we identified in the U.S. Forces- Afghanistan data may not include all construction projects funded under  section 2805 of Title 10, U.S. Code, in Afghanistan during fiscal years  2009 through 2012 because, according to Army Central Command  officials, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan delegated authority to its four regional  commands to approve and fund projects independently. Therefore, the  $944 million in O&M funding we identified may not include construction  projects independently approved at the regional command level during  this period. Additionally, Army Central Command officials were not able to  provide information on O&M-funded unspecified minor military  construction projects in Afghanistan prior to 2009, as discussed earlier.  Nor were they able to provide this information for projects in Iraq and  other countries in their area of responsibility for all fiscal years where,  according to Army Central Command officials, O&M-funded construction  activities took place. During the course of our review, we shared the  results of our analysis with DOD officials, who agreed that the amount of  O&M funding we identified constituted a significant segment of  contingency construction expenditures. Army Central Command officials  further noted that on the basis of their experience the costs that we had  identified were likely conservative relative to the universe of O&M-funded  unspecified minor military construction projects in the CENTCOM area of  responsibility. These officials told us that it is likely that the majority of  contingency construction projects are funded as unspecified minor  military construction projects using O&M appropriations. Further, Army  Central Command officials acknowledged that while individual projects  may not warrant tracking on the basis of their specific construction cost,  collectively across all projects the amounts are likely to be more  significant, as was the case with the $944 million we identified. According  to GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks by, for example, clearly documenting all transactions and  other significant events in a manner that allows the documentation to be  readily available for examination. DOD\u2019s O&M-funded unspecified minor  military construction projects collectively constitute significant events and,  therefore, DOD\u2019s control activities should include a means for  documenting and tracking these projects.", "According to a senior official from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment and senior DOD  Comptroller officials, DOD does not plan to collect and analyze data on  these O&M-funded projects, either in the CENTCOM region or in any  other location. The officials noted that, while DOD could invest resources  to track and document how much O&M funding they have used and are  using for construction projects to support contingency operations, current  DOD systems and processes are not set up to automatically provide this  level of detail for these projects. Further, they noted that without changing  DOD\u2019s current systems and process, identifying this information would be  resource and labor intensive. However, Army Central Command officials  noted that each project undertaken using O&M funding for construction  under the authority of section 2805 of Title 10, U.S. Code, requires a  documented identification and classification of a project\u2019s estimated  construction costs and a legal determination to validate the base  commander\u2019s construction cost estimates for each project, to ensure that  the $1 million maximum is not exceeded. While we recognize that locating  all records of construction costs for completed construction projects at  this point would be problematic, data on the construction costs for  ongoing and future projects should continue to be readily available at the  time of a project\u2019s approval decision. Base commanders could therefore  compile these readily available cost data and report them through the  chain of command, for example, to the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) and other decision makers. Given the magnitude of these  O&M funds we identified that DOD used for contingency construction  projects in Afghanistan in fiscal years 2009-12, establishing a means to  track and document information on the universe and cost of all ongoing  and future unspecified minor military construction projects funded with  O&M would improve DOD\u2019s ability to manage and oversee funds made  available for such projects using O&M funding. Further, GAO\u2019s Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management  should use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives\u2014such as  executing construction responsibilities and administering funds\u2014by, for  example, designing a process that identifies the information requirements  needed. In the context of O&M funds, which are available for a variety of  functions including construction, quality information on the use of O&M for  construction activities in the contingency environment would be helpful for  understanding the overall cost of contingency operations and the  availability of funds for other operational purposes. Clearly tracking O&M- funded unspecified minor military construction projects is important for  administering O&M funds and determining the funding needed to support  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as for projecting funding  needed for future contingency operations. DOD officials agreed that  without comprehensively tracking and documenting unspecified minor  military construction projects funded with O&M appropriations, the military  services and other stakeholders are limited in their ability to manage and  oversee funds made available for military construction, including  contingency construction projects. Without information on the universe  and cost of these projects funded with O&M, the military services cannot  maintain awareness of how much O&M funding they are using for  construction projects to support contingency operations versus other  O&M-funded operational requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Reliance on O&M Funding for Contingency Construction Projects Creates Financial, Operational, and Duplication Risks", "paragraphs": ["CENTCOM commanders have frequently relied on O&M funding to  support contingency construction projects because, according to officials,  O&M-funded projects take less time from development through  construction than do MILCON-funded projects. However, this reliance on  O&M funding has the potential to create financial, operational, and  duplication risks.", "Due to the urgency of contingency operations, CENTCOM personnel  must often construct facilities as rapidly as possible in their area of  responsibility. For example, CENTCOM Regulation 415-1 notes that  contingency basing locations support immediate but temporary  contingency operations. It also states that O&M funds will be used to the  maximum extent possible. However, for projects exceeding a cost of $1  million\u2014the maximum amount currently available for O&M-funded  projects under section 2805 of Title 10, U.S. Code\u2014base officials in the  CENTCOM area of responsibility stated they do not have a funding  process that adequately supports contingency construction projects  needed within a short time frame, since MILCON-funded projects can  take up to 2 years for review and approval in addition to the time needed  to complete construction.", "CENTCOM officials noted that a construction project can use either  MILCON or O&M funding, and should be designed to address a single  construction requirement. Under general construction authorities (i.e.,  major military construction specified in the National Defense Authorization  Act and unspecified minor military construction under section 2805 of Title  10, U.S. Code), commanders must use MILCON funding for projects  costing more than $1 million ($750,000 prior to fiscal year 2015). Army  Central Command officials, however, stated that MILCON-funded projects  can take 12 to 18 months to develop and submit, 12 to 24 or more  months to review and approve, and 18 to 24 months to construct,  equating to about 3 to 5 years in total before a project is completed and in  use. By comparison, commanders can use O&M funding to meet  construction requirements for projects at or below that maximum, and  such projects can usually be reviewed and approved at the component or  subordinate command level in 2 to 3 months and constructed in less than  1 year. Officials noted that even unspecified minor military construction  projects using MILCON funds involve a lengthy review process, and  commented that commanders seeking to use these funds must compete  with projects from around the world within their respective service for a  relatively limited amount of funding.", "In addition to the general construction authorities, DOD may use other  authorities for construction projects in emergency and contingency  circumstances. According to senior officials in the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment, these  authorities can provide a means for funding contingency construction  projects that exceed the O&M-funding maximum. For example, according  to these officials, in an extraordinary instance the department could  review, approve, and fund a contingency construction project in as few as  60 days using the Contingency Construction Authority. Nonetheless,  these officials acknowledged that this process is still time-consuming in  the eyes of commanders. Further, while service component and base  officials in the CENTCOM area of responsibility acknowledged that these  authorities are available and can be used in certain instances, they view  them as inadequate because of the time required to get projects  approved. Specifically, according to Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment and Army Central  Command officials, these authorities involve an approval process from  higher military department headquarters and DOD similar to that required  under general construction authorities that can be lengthy (6 months or  longer) and involve considerable DOD and congressional scrutiny.  According to Army Central Command officials, in some instances, use of  these other authorities also involves a request to reprogram funds,  thereby adding another 3 to 8 months to the process. Officials noted that  units on relatively short rotations (about 9 to 10 months) may no longer  need the project by the time construction begins. Further, officials noted  that commanders may perceive these authorities as requiring competition  among various projects for funding, sometimes on a worldwide basis, and  as a result believe that they will be unable to obtain approval.", "However, when using O&M funds for construction, base commanders  must be careful as they consider the scope of a project, particularly when  developing multiple projects to address similar requirements or an  overarching or single requirement. Specifically, section 2801 of Title 10,  U.S. Code provides that a military construction project includes all military  construction work necessary to produce a complete and usable facility or  a complete and usable improvement to an existing facility. GAO and the  military departments have noted that the construction of a single  \u201ccomplete and usable\u201d facility or project may involve the construction of  several related buildings, structures, or other improvements to real  property. As GAO has previously noted, the key factor is that a single  building, structure, or other improvement could not satisfy the need that  justified carrying out the construction project. Military department  guidance provides that a single project or requirement may not be split  into smaller projects solely in order to stay below the funding \u201cthreshold\u201d  (i.e., maximum). Whether multiple buildings should be programmed and  funded as one project is a case-by-case determination that depends on  various factors. However, multiple construction projects in support of a  similar requirement may raise funding concerns or, in extreme cases,  result in a violation of the Antideficiency Act.", "During our site visits to CENTCOM bases, officials told us that using O&M  funding for projects is the quickest option available to address immediate  contingency construction requirements. However, during the course of  our review, we found instances of contingency construction requirements  that might have entailed projects with construction costs above the $1  million maximum ($750,000 prior to fiscal year 2015) for O&M-funded  projects but that, according to officials, needed to be completed more  quickly than would have been possible under the existing MILCON review  and approval process, which can take 2 years. While the extent of DOD\u2019s  use of the practice is unknown because DOD has not tracked the  universe and cost of O&M-funded unspecified minor military construction  projects, we identified examples where commanders had modified a  project\u2019s specifications or where commands had developed multiple  projects below the O&M maximum to address a single requirement, which  could then be completed more quickly. DOD\u2019s reliance on O&M funding in  these instances increased the risks of (1) potential concerns regarding  the appropriate use of funding, (2) negative operational impacts, and (3)  unnecessary duplication of effort.", "Following are the examples that we identified where commanders had  modified a project\u2019s specifications or commands had developed multiple  projects to address similar requirements or an overarching or single  requirement, potentially raising concerns or underrating risk regarding the  appropriate use of funding:  In August 2010, base officials at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan,  identified the need for additional housing at the base and designed 28  projects for the construction of concrete shelters\u2014referred to as B- huts\u2014classifying the project costs as construction costs. As the  projects progressed, contingency-related changes resulted in base  officials combining the 28 projects into 6 larger projects. Moreover,  concurrent with the combination of the projects, base officials also  modified the project specifications by re-designating the B-huts as  \u201crelocatable buildings,\u201d the costs for which were then classified as  other-than-construction. These actions significantly reduced costs  designated as construction for each of the 6 larger projects putting  them below the general $750,000 maximum for O&M funded projects  in effect in 2010, after which base officials used O&M funds to finance  their construction. Nonetheless, subsequent to the completion of the  concrete shelters the department reported in September 2015 that it  should have used MILCON funds to construct the shelters and  determined that the obligations incurred for the projects had exceeded  the statutory limit for O&M-funded unspecified minor military  construction projects, thus resulting in a violation of the Antideficiency  Act.", "In October 2009, Forward Operating Base Leatherneck officials  identified a requirement for a headquarters building for a Marine Wing  Support Squadron, which they estimated would have a total project  cost of $847,491. Officials classified $740,193 of this amount as  construction and the remainder as non-construction costs. However,  the items classified as non-construction included a $44,600 generator  used to power the building. According to Army Regulation 420-1,  generators affixed as a permanent part of a facility that provide power  to the facility are classified as real property and should be funded with  military construction funds. If the generator for this project had been  properly classified as construction, the project\u2019s construction costs  would have been $784,793, which exceeded the general $750,000  O&M maximum in effect at that time. In this instance, it is unclear why  base officials did not classify the attached generator as part of the  construction cost for the project. However, such circumstances have  the potential for raising concerns about the appropriate use of funds.", "In October 2009, anticipating a large surge in personnel beyond  Kandahar Airfield\u2019s capacity, Regional Command South, a component  of the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, identified an operational requirement  to construct additional housing for these personnel. Instead of  planning, designing, and constructing the housing as a single, large  MILCON project to address the requirement, Regional Command  South programmed six separate, smaller, company-size projects with  $655,685 each in construction costs. Regional Command South then  used O&M funding to finance the construction of each of the smaller  projects. If the additional housing were constructed as a single project  (i.e., the construction costs from all six projects were combined), the  likely total construction cost, $3,900,000, would have exceeded the  general $750,000 O&M maximum in place at the time and would have  required the use of MILCON funds. Although Army documentation  identified each project as a complete and useable facility and noted  advantages to dividing the overall housing requirement at the  company level, the practice of dividing a requirement into separate,  smaller projects could raise concerns about the appropriate use of  funding.", "Following are the examples that we identified where commanders had  modified a project\u2019s specifications or commands had developed multiple  projects to address a single requirement and in the process had created  an operational risk\u2014that is, had risked negatively affecting DOD\u2019s ability  to efficiently or effectively achieve operational objectives:  In 2015, officials at a base in Southwest Asia divided a single  requirement for a critical air control facility into four separate projects  for four separate buildings\u2014each of which cost $650,000\u2014instead of  one project for a single building that would have exceeded the $1  million O&M funding maximum. According to base officials, the four- building design does not align with the design of similar air control  facilities elsewhere. Moreover, these officials also stated that housing  the facility in four separate buildings is suboptimal because it does not  fully enable the integration of operations and maintenance functions  and could, therefore, negatively affect the operational capability of the  facility. Nevertheless, given the urgency and importance of the  capability the facility provides, base officials stated that they could not  wait for MILCON funding for a single project and building. In addition  to the operational risk, this practice also has the potential for raising  concerns about the appropriate use of funds.", "In June 2015, officials at an air base in Southwest Asia identified a  requirement for and designed an unmanned aerial vehicle shelter at  an estimated cost of $377,000. This amount did not exceed the O&M  maximum but did exceed the air base commander\u2019s approval  authority for O&M-funded construction projects, which was  $100,000. Consequently, in order to complete the project quickly,  according to base officials, they changed the scope of the project to  keep the construction costs within the base commander\u2019s $100,000  approval authority. Specifically, they reduced construction costs by  removing the concrete floor and asphalt taxiway from the project\u2019s  scope, replacing them with temporary flooring. Base officials  estimated that the re-scoped project would cost $97,000. According to  base officials, while reducing the project\u2019s scope in this manner is a  common practice, in this instance the removal of the asphalt taxiway  increases the risk of damage to the unmanned aerial vehicle\u2019s landing  gear and electronic sensors when it is moved in and out of the shelter.  Had base officials been able to design and construct the project as  originally intended, this risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle\u2019s  operational capability would have been mitigated.", "In May 2014, the Air Force identified a requirement for a new air  passenger terminal at Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait, because the  harsh environment and heavy passenger traffic had deteriorated its  existing facilities and they were no longer adequate to sustain the  mission. The requirement included space for receiving and processing  6,500 personnel a month, with baggage; briefing and holding areas;  and a U.S. Customs processing area. According to base officials, a  single building housing these three functions would be preferable  because the activities are sequential and are best performed indoors  without having to travel between buildings. However, to do so would  have required MILCON funding because the total would have  exceeded the $750,000 O&M maximum in effect at that time.  According to base officials they divided the requirements into three  projects for (1) an air passenger terminal for $660,000; (2) a baggage  control center for $527,000; and (3) a customs processing facility for  $660,000\u2014totaling about $1.8 million. As a result, according to base  officials, terminal operations will be negatively affected by the  unnecessary movement between three buildings, which will likely  increase processing time for passengers and baggage. Further, this  practice also has the potential for raising concerns about the  appropriate use of funds.", "Following are the examples that we identified where commanders had  modified a project\u2019s specifications or commands had developed multiple  projects to address a single requirement, or relied on O&M funding in  other ways, and in the process had created the duplication risk of  unnecessarily providing the same service to the same beneficiaries:", "According to Al Udeid Air Base officials, in 2015 base officials decided  to move the base\u2019s North Squadron operational and administrative  facilities to another location on the base because the host nation  (Qatar) wanted to reclaim the space then occupied by the squadron.  Base officials decided to construct eight O&M-funded, semi- permanent facilities (that have a useful life of up to 25 years with  maintenance and upkeep) to temporarily house the squadron at  various locations on the base at a cost of about $650,000 each.  During the same year, base officials also initiated a request for $24  million in MILCON funding through the Air Force to construct a  permanent facility at the new location that would house both North  Squadron personnel and personnel from other Air Force entities. The  use of these two funding sources creates the potential for  unnecessarily duplicative expenditures of up to $5.2 million, which is  the total amount in O&M funding for the eight semi-permanent  facilities that will no longer be needed to house the North Squadron  once the permanent facility for the squadron and other Air Force  entities is complete.", "According to Army Central Command officials, in 2009, bases in  Kuwait needed additional dining facilities to support a surge in  personnel. To satisfy this requirement, DOD entered into an O&M- funded food service contract, which included the contractor providing  four dining facilities (with an estimated useful life of up to 25 years  with maintenance and upkeep) in Kuwait for government lease. The  contract included provisions providing that:  the U.S. government  cannot purchase or take ownership or title of the dining facilities, the  U.S. government cannot pay all of the direct costs of building them,  and the dining facilities remain the property of the contractor and are  to be removed at the end of the period of performance. According to  DOD figures, the department spent $43.8 million for leasing and  operating these four dining facilities in Kuwait over the 5-year period  of the contract. In 2015, upon the expiration of the old food service  contract, Area Support Group Kuwait officials requested $64 million in  O&M funding to solicit a new food services contract, which according  to officials would have included $27 million to construct five dining  facilities to replace the four scheduled to be removed as a result of the  expiring contract. When the request came to the Army Central  Command Engineer in Kuwait for review, officials expressed concern  that the requested contract would be an inappropriate expenditure of  O&M funds because MILCON appropriations must be used for  construction when project costs exceed the $1 million O&M maximum.  According to a senior Army Central Command official, if the Area  Support Group Kuwait dining facilities in the requested 2015 food  service contract were completed as a construction project, it would  require the use of MILCON funds. As of January 2016, it was still  unclear how the four existing dining facilities will be replaced and the  new ones financed, but according to an Army Central Command  official, the Army will have to expend additional funds in some form to  duplicate the dining facilities, thereby providing the same service  (dining facilities) a second time to the same beneficiaries (bases). If  this were to be the case, the construction of the replacement dining  facilities would create duplicative expenditures of up to $7.1 million,  the appraised cost of the four contractor-owned dining facilities when  new that will be removed after the current food service contract has  expired.", "While senior officials in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Energy, Installations, and Environment stated that the existing  additional construction authorities should provide an adequately  expedited process to fund contingency construction projects, none of the  base officials in the CENTCOM area of responsibility we interviewed  agreed. Instead, the base officials we interviewed stated that it is the  absence of an expedited process to fund contingency construction  projects that is the reason they use the approaches we identified (i.e.,  modifying a project\u2019s specifications and using multiple, smaller projects).  Further, according to Army Central Command officials, the length of  commanders\u2019 deployments\u2014typically lasting 1 year or less\u2014adds  urgency to complete projects quickly. As a result, commanders in the  CENTCOM area of responsibility may have routinely opted to use O&M  funds for contingency construction projects to the maximum extent  possible in order to avoid the more lengthy review and approval  processes that may be involved when using MILCON funding, a process  that can take 2 or more years before construction begins.", "While the practice of maximizing the use of O&M funds for contingency  construction may help base commanders in the CENTCOM area of  responsibility meet urgent requirements, they acknowledge, as do officials  at the Army Central Command, that the routine use of O&M funds in lieu  of DOD\u2019s other authorities has the potential to create risks regarding the  appropriate use of funding and could lead to negative operational impacts  and unnecessarily duplicative construction expenditures. GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should design and implement control activities\u2014policies,  procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce management\u2019s  directives\u2014to achieve objectives and respond to risks. In the case of  contingency construction projects, these control activities could include  policies and procedures that would allow base commanders to better  support immediate contingency basing and operational needs\u2014including  for projects with construction costs greater than the $1 million O&M  funding maximum that are not suited to the existing lengthy MILCON  review and approval process. These control activities, for example, could  include processes that improve the use of existing authorities while  finding ways to shorten review and approval time frames or seeking  additional authorities as appropriate.", "As noted earlier, DOD Directive 3000.10 assigns responsibility to the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics to, among other things, designate a senior official to be  responsible for the oversight of all aspects of contingency basing policy.  The guidance also assigns the Under Secretary responsibility to develop  criteria for facilities, equipment, and services for contingency locations.  According to a senior official in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment, this office is working  with the Joint Staff to develop new contingency basing construction policy  and Unified Facilities Criteria for construction projects that support urgent  operational requirements. However, according to an official from this  office, these changes to policy and criteria will not include provisions to  collect and analyze data on the extent to which O&M funding is used for  construction projects as part of these efforts, limiting DOD\u2019s ability to  address the financial, operational, and duplication risks we have  identified. Analyzing the extent to which O&M funding is being used for  construction projects in the contingency environment may better enable  DOD to determine the magnitude of DOD\u2019s risk from using O&M funding  for construction and identify opportunities to encourage the use of other  authorities\u2014including the use of O&M funds under the Contingency  Construction Authority. The information may also enable DOD to  determine whether existing departmental processes implementing those  authorities sufficiently support urgent construction needs or could be  expedited.

As discussed earlier,  DOD guidance notes that cost engineers\u2014including those from the Army  Corps of Engineers\u2014must thoroughly understand a project\u2019s scope of  work and other aspects of a project being estimated. It further indicates  that the cost engineer should always remain mindful of the documentation  necessary to support cost estimate submission requirements for each  phase. For certain estimates, the guidance describes use of a project  narrative, which includes assumptions made during the preparation of the  estimate and describes project requirements that must be performed in  sufficient detail to give a clear understanding of the scope of work.  According to Corps officials, the level of construction needed to meet the  service components\u2019 respective requirements is among these underlying  assumptions that the Army Corps of Engineers should sufficiently detail.", "Although Corps officials stated that the level-of-construction determination  from the service components should be included in the documentation  supporting the cost estimate prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers,  they noted that there are other means to communicate level-of- construction determinations, to include design directives, general  construction guidance, or verbal communications from project  stakeholders. Furthermore, Corps officials noted that, for some projects, it  sends multi-discipline teams of engineering and construction experts to  work with customers to review and refine facility construction proposals,  plans, and cost estimates before the final approval and submission of  budget requests. In none of the 11 projects outlined above, however,  were Corps officials able to provide evidence that these other means  were used because the available documentation is silent on level-of- construction determinations and Corps officials were unable to provide  evidence that they and the project requestors had communicated about  levels of construction before the Army Corps of Engineers began  designing the 11 projects.", "Due to the absence of documentation, it is unclear whether level-of- construction determinations occurred and were communicated prior to the  projects\u2019 design and cost estimation. According to GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, management should use  quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objective. In the case of  contingency construction in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, DOD\u2019s  objective could mean building to meet the minimum military requirement.  GAO\u2019s standards also state that management should design appropriate  control activities, which may include clearly documenting all transactions  and other significant events in a manner that allows the documentation to  be readily available for examination and ensuring a clear segregation of  incompatible duties. Because DOD does not have a control mechanism to  ensure that the Army Corps of Engineers maintains a documented record  of level-of-construction determinations and communicates with the  service component commands about those determinations before  designing and estimating the cost of contingency construction projects,  DOD risks constructing facilities that exceed minimum military  requirements and expending more resources than required in a resource- constrained environment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Developed a Formal Process for Reevaluating Ongoing Contingency Construction Projects When Missions Change, but Has Conducted Ad Hoc Reviews to Reduce or Cancel Projects", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not developed a formal process for reevaluating ongoing  contingency construction projects when missions change, but has  undertaken ad hoc reviews of planned and ongoing projects. Under DOD  guidance, combatant commanders are responsible for assessing the  operational environment at critical milestones in order to determine  contingency basing requirements within their respective areas of  responsibility. According to CENTCOM and Joint Staff officials,  however, DOD has not established a recurring formal process at their  respective levels for reevaluating planned or ongoing construction  projects based on mission changes. In a 2014 committee report, the  Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concern over the status  of unfinished military construction projects in Afghanistan and DOD\u2019s  plans for the divestment of these and other military construction facilities  that will no longer be required to support U.S. military operations there.", "According to CENTCOM, Joint Staff, and Army Corps of Engineers  officials, in general, DOD is aware of the need to be a careful steward of  resources, including those devoted to construction projects in contingency  environments, especially following major changes in mission  requirements. To this end various DOD entities have reviewed  construction projects on an ad hoc basis when such changes have  occurred. For example, an examination of the limited documentation  available corroborates that beginning in November 2011, U.S. Forces- Afghanistan undertook five separate reviews of planned and ongoing  construction projects in Afghanistan to determine whether to de-scope,  cancel, or continue the construction projects in anticipation of the  transition of operational responsibility to the Government of the Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan, coalition force reductions, and other changes to  mission requirements. The documentation indicates that on the basis of  the first four reviews the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan reduced or cancelled  123 construction projects totaling approximately $1 billion in programmed  funding. For example, during a review conducted in March 2013, the U.S.  Forces-Afghanistan cancelled a $7 million project for an Army aviation  headquarters facility at Bagram Airbase. According to an Army Corps of  Engineers official who was involved in project management in Iraq from  2007 through 2010, similar reviews, reductions, or cancellations of  planned or ongoing projects were also conducted there. For example, the  Army Corps of Engineers official described participation in a September  2008 assistance team that visited Iraq to work out project details for 30  planned projects. Subsequently, however, Army Central Command  officials stopped the design process for these projects and withdrew  funding because the mission upon which the original projects were based  had concluded.", "Service supporting documentation for these reviews was not available,  and we could not determine the extent to which construction project  reviews have been conducted in Iraq and Afghanistan, the cost savings  accrued as a result of these reviews, and the rationale behind the  decisions. According to CENTCOM officials, the entities that conducted  the ad hoc reviews cited above were not required to systematically report  the results of their reviews and hence no such documentation is filed with  the Joint Staff, CENTCOM, or the military services. Moreover, CENTCOM  officials point out that cost savings realized as a result of construction  projects being cancelled or reduced in scope does not capture the full  magnitude of their review efforts. For example, these officials pointed out  that in some cases construction projects that were no longer needed  because of changed mission requirements were not cancelled because  doing so would have cost as much if not more than completing the  project. In other cases, projects were reviewed and decisions were made  to continue construction because, despite changed mission requirements,  it was still determined that there was a need for the facility.", "Nonetheless, while the ad hoc reviews cited above resulted in positive  outcomes in terms of cost savings or cost avoidance, absent a specific  policy or guidance requiring a fully documented, formal process for review  of construction projects when missions change, DOD risks not  consistently and routinely evaluating whether to continue, reduce in  scope, or discontinue the construction of facilities in support of future  contingencies as missions change. For example, with fully documented  reviews, DOD would retain and could benefit from information regarding  prior decisions, gain efficiency by using an established review process,  and ensure that all construction projects defined by the review process  are consistently and routinely evaluated. Further, absent a specific policy  or guidance requiring a fully documented, formal process for the review of  construction projects when missions change, DOD officials may not have  the information they need to manage contingency construction operations  by assessing the operational environment at critical milestones in order to  determine contingency basing requirements within their respective area of  responsibility.", "DOD has taken steps to rectify some of the concerns highlighted above.  According to DOD Comptroller officials, in September 2015, the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) updated the DOD Financial  Management Regulation in response to a May 2015 Special Inspector  General for Afghanistan Reconstruction report on an unused command  and control facility in Afghanistan, to require additional training and  establish policy that would improve the stewardship over resources,  including those used for contingency construction projects for which the  underlying mission changes. As revised, the regulation requires the  heads of DOD components to include course materials in Antideficiency  Act training that clearly state that taxpayer funds should not be spent  when a requirement is no longer needed. Additionally, under the updated  regulation, DOD commanders, supervisors, and managers must provide  fiscal law training to educate DOD personnel with regard to their fiduciary  and legal responsibilities to prevent the wasteful spending of appropriated  funds. The regulation also provides that key fund-control personnel must  review and verify on a continuous basis that goods and services are still  needed, and must not spend taxpayer funds when goods and services  are no longer needed. While these new requirements could improve  contingency basing determinations, they provide broad guidance covering  goods and services generally and are not focused on contingency basing  and construction. Therefore, implementing guidance specific to  contingency basing and construction would help clarify expectations and  establish a review process. Based on our analysis of the U.S. Forces- Afghanistan\u2019s documentation regarding its reviews of planned and  ongoing construction projects, this implementing guidance could include  mechanisms for establishing (1) the frequency of construction project  reviews or what event or impetus might trigger a review; (2) the criteria  that should be used to select construction projects for a review; and (3)  the documentation required for the construction projects selected for  review, including the process and rationale for each decision to cancel,  de-scope, or continue a project. Without such implementing guidance, the  department risks continuing or completing military construction projects  that are no longer needed to support U.S. military operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Established the Joint Lessons Learned Information System, but Has Not Used It to Share Lessons Learned from Contingency Construction Projects in Iraq and Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["DOD has established an approach for recording and sharing lessons  learned through its Joint Lessons Learned Information System, but  CENTCOM and its components have not used this system for  contingency construction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2000, DOD  developed and implemented its Joint Lessons Learned Information  System, which is its system of record for recording and sharing lessons  learned in DOD\u2019s Joint Lessons Learned Program, including those  identified during operations. The Joint Lessons Learned Program  process consists of five phases\u2014discovery, validation, resolution,  evaluation, and dissemination\u2014through which observations are identified,  assessed, and as appropriate, shared through lessons learned. New  observations can be derived from experiences occurring during  contingency operations, including lessons related to construction.  However, as of September 2015, the Joint Lessons Learned Information  System had no lessons learned recorded for contingency construction.  The system did contain 14 contingency construction-related notes or  comments, but these were from the perspective of individuals who had  experienced them first-hand and had not been validated by the  department. While it is unclear whether lessons were identified and  learned but not recorded in the system, the absence of validated lessons  learned recorded in the Joint Lessons Learned Information System for  this area indicates that this could potentially be the case.", "In March 2015, we reported that the Joint Lessons Learned Information  System is also not being fully utilized for another key area\u2014operational  contract support. Specifically, we reported that DOD was generally not  sharing operational contract support lessons learned in the Joint Lessons  Learned Information System because the system is not functional for  users searching operational contract support issues due to, among other  reasons, not having a label for this area and not having a designated  location, or \u201ccommunity of practice,\u201d in the system for sharing relevant  lessons learned. We recommended in that report that DOD implement a  label and designate a single community of practice for operational  contract support in the Joint Lessons Learned Information System. DOD  concurred and established a community of practice for operational  contract support in November 2015.", "Although DOD has developed and made available its Joint Lessons  Learned Information System, deployed U.S. forces in the CENTCOM  area of responsibility rely on mechanisms outside of the joint system for  sharing lessons learned related to contingency construction projects in  support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Specifically, according to  Army Central Command and Air Force Central Command officials,  deployed U.S. forces rely on unit rotation overlap, experienced personnel  outside of the contingency area, expert organizations, and contingency- related DOD boards to share up-to-date lessons important to contingency  construction in the CENTCOM area of responsibility.", "Unit rotation overlap. When one military unit arrives at its deployed  location to replace another, the outgoing unit remains at the deployed  location for a period overlapping the incoming unit\u2019s arrival. During  this overlapping period, the outgoing unit shares the latest information  and relevant lessons learned with the incoming unit. In the case of  construction-related units, they can provide construction-related  lessons learned specific to the contingency location or more broadly  applicable to contingency construction in general.", "Experienced personnel outside of the contingency area.", "Deployed U.S. forces undertaking contingency construction projects  interact with DOD personnel outside of contingency areas\u2014for  example, at the Army Central Command and the Air Force Central  Command Headquarters\u2014with years of construction experience,  including with projects undertaken in support of contingency  operations. These experienced personnel are available to answer  questions, relay experiences, provide perspectives, and share  important lessons learned related to contingency construction.", "Expert organizations. Deployed U.S. forces also have access to  specialized DOD organizations with construction project expertise,  including those in support of contingency operations, such as the  Army Corps of Engineers. These organizations advise and guide  deployed U.S. forces on the design and construction of contingency- related projects, sharing important lessons learned in the process.", "Contingency-related DOD boards. Proposed contingency-related  projects in the CENTCOM area of responsibility may be subject to  review and approval by multi-discipline boards in theater, such as the  Joint Facilities Utilization Board. In the process of reviewing and  approving contingency construction projects, board members raise  questions based on their experience and share important lessons  learned from reviewing other construction projects in support of  contingency operations.", "Although deployed U.S. forces may rely on these mechanisms to share  contingency construction lessons learned, it can be an ad hoc or  incomplete approach. By contrast, as described by Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff Manual 3150.25A, the Joint Lessons Learned Program  provides both a vehicle for facilitating awareness of observations, issues,  best practices, and lessons learned across DOD and a forum for  institutionalizing lessons learned across the joint force. The guidance  notes that recording, analyzing, and developing improved processes,  procedures, and methods based on lessons learned are primary tools in  developing improvements in joint force readiness, capabilities, and overall  performance. In addition, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction  3150.25F notes that program stakeholders\u2014including the Joint Staff, the  services, the combatant commands, and combat support agencies\u2014 when appropriate, will contribute information, data, and lessons learned  that are germane to improving joint capabilities and readiness. The  guidance further indicates that combatant commands will provide and  maintain Joint Lessons Learned Program support for theater- and  function-specific joint and interoperability lessons learned activities. It  notes that lessons are derived from the full range of joint activities and  operations, which could include construction during contingency  operations.", "However, CENTCOM guidance does not reinforce the DOD guidance  regarding the Joint Lessons Learned Program. Specifically, the  CENTCOM regulation governing construction, including contingency  construction, does not discuss lessons learned or establish who within  the command and its service component commands should be  responsible for recording and sharing construction-related lessons  learned in the CENTCOM area of responsibility through the Joint Lessons  Learned Program. Further, the regulation does not contain the terms  \u201clesson\u201d or \u201clearned\u201d in combination or separately, illustrating that  recording and sharing lessons learned is not a focal point of the guidance  and may not carry adequate leadership emphasis on the importance of  recording and sharing lessons learned. Another factor affecting the  recording and sharing of lessons learned is leadership emphasis.  According to DOD\u2019s Joint Lessons Learned Program officials, increasing  the recording and sharing of lessons learned in the DOD Joint Lesson  Learned Information System can be improved with leadership emphasis  at a combatant command. For example, according to these officials, in  fiscal year 2015, leadership emphasis at another combatant command  (Special Operations Command) on collecting lessons learned generally  resulted in an over tenfold increase in the number of recorded lessons  compared with those that CENTCOM recorded during the same fiscal  year. According to Joint Lesson Learned Program officials, improved  recording of contingency construction lessons learned could result if  CENTCOM leadership increased its emphasis on the importance of  discovering, validating, and disseminating relevant contingency- construction-related observations.", "In the absence of specific CENTCOM guidance and leadership emphasis  to record and share contingency construction lessons learned in DOD\u2019s  Joint Lessons Learned Information System, CENTCOM and its service  component commands are likely to continue to rely on mechanisms  outside this system to share lessons learned related to construction  projects in support of contingency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As  a result, commanders may repeat errors in the planning and design of  contingency construction projects that CENTCOM and service component  commands have identified. For example, an important potential lesson  relating to the CENTCOM area of responsibility occurred in fiscal year  2011 when concrete housing units were constructed at Bagram Air Base,  Afghanistan, that later developed toxic mold due to poor engineering and  construction shortcuts. Specifically, the heating, ventilation, and air  conditioning system did not provide adequate ventilation and the concrete  was not properly sealed, which in combination created an environment  where the toxic mold could form and accumulate. As a result, personnel  were evacuated until the housing units could be remediated, denying  critically needed hardened shelters to help protect service members at  Bagram, Afghanistan, from indirect fire attacks. According to an Army  Central Command engineering official, this experience may contain a  lesson for construction project managers in the CENTCOM area of  responsibility regarding the need to involve adequate engineering  expertise regarding the health and safety aspects of a project\u2019s design.  Officials at Al Udeid Air Base identified another important potential lesson,  which was related to ammunition storage facilities. Specifically, after  construction of aboveground munitions storage facilities at the air base,  officials determined that the facilities\u2019 lightning protection system was not  adequate, putting high-dollar munitions stored in the facilities at risk of  damage or destruction and creating a safety risk. For example, the  officials stated that during lightning storms all personnel have to evacuate  due to the lighting-strike risk and operations halt as a result. According to  Al Udeid Air Base officials, they learned from this experience that a more  robust lightning mitigation system was needed to provide adequate  protection for facilities of this type. While those persons involved in these  examples can share their observations as long as they continue working  at CENTCOM, because the experiences were not recorded and shared in  DOD\u2019s system of record\u2014the Joint Lessons Learned Information  System\u2014there is a risk that different people at other locations, or during  other contingencies, could repeat these or similar errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has spent billions of dollars on construction in support of  contingency operations since 2001, but has some weaknesses in the  management and oversight of the contingency construction program.  While DOD has taken some steps to improve its management of  construction projects, such as conducting ad hoc reviews of projects in  Iraq and Afghanistan to identify potential reductions or cancellations,  DOD faces challenges developing full oversight of contingency  construction. Actions to improve the quality of information and  documentation of O&M-funded contingency construction projects could  help DOD oversee funds for construction and improve awareness of how  much funding the department uses for construction projects. Additionally,  the urgency of contingency construction requirements coupled with the  absence of a review and approval process to support quickly funding  contingency construction projects needed in fewer than 2 years that are  expected to cost more than $1 million may result in DOD\u2019s continued use  of questionable approaches when constructing facilities\u2014potentially  leading to unintended results. Moreover, until DOD improves control  mechanisms for documenting and communicating level-of-construction  determinations, DOD risks constructing facilities that exceed minimum  military requirements, expending more resources than required in a  resource-constrained environment. Additionally, absent a requirement for  a formal process to reevaluate contingency construction projects when  missions change, DOD risks constructing facilities that may not be  essential to support existing missions or may not be sufficient for revised  missions in the CENTCOM area of responsibility and in future  contingencies worldwide. Lastly, without specific guidance and leadership  emphasis to record and share contingency construction lessons learned  in DOD\u2019s Joint Lessons Learned Information System, CENTCOM and its  service component commands may repeat errors in the planning and  design of contingency construction projects in future contingencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following five recommendations to improve DOD\u2019s  management and oversight of contingency construction in the CENTCOM  area of responsibility and in other geographic combatant commands  where applicable:", "To improve DOD\u2019s awareness of how much O&M funding the  department uses for construction projects to support contingency  operations, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the  Secretaries of the military departments, in coordination with the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), to track the universe and cost of  ongoing and future contingency construction projects that are funded  from O&M appropriations under section 2805 of Title 10, U.S. Code  (unspecified minor military construction authority).", "To improve DOD\u2019s ability to quickly fund contingency construction  projects that are not ideally suited to the current standard MILCON  and O&M processes and time frames and reduce reliance on funding  approaches that pose risks regarding the appropriate use of funding,  negative operational impacts, and unnecessary duplication, we  recommend that DOD evaluate and improve the use of existing  processes and authorities to the extent possible; determine whether  additional authorities are needed to support urgent construction  needs; and revise existing departmental processes or seek additional  authorities, as appropriate.", "To help ensure that DOD limits demands on available resources to  those necessary to meet contingency construction project  requirements and communicates those requirements effectively, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the  Secretary of the Army, direct the Army Corps of Engineers to develop  a control activity for documenting level-of-construction determinations  before the Army Corps of Engineers designs the projects and  estimates their costs.", "To ensure that DOD avoids constructing facilities that may be  unneeded to support U.S. forces and to comprehensively document  the results of its reviews of ongoing construction projects when  changes in mission requirements occur, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, direct the Secretaries of the military departments and  the Commander of CENTCOM to develop implementing guidance for  the review and verification of ongoing contingency construction  projects when mission changes occur.", "To improve the awareness of the combatant and service component  commands\u2019 responsibilities to record and share lessons learned and  to ensure that important contingency-construction-related lessons are  recorded, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense, in  coordination with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, direct the  Commander of CENTCOM to revise Central Command Regulation  415-1 or issue other guidance as appropriate to specifically detail the  role of the combatant command and service component commands in  recording contingency construction lessons learned from the  CENTCOM area of responsibility in the Joint Lessons Learned  Information System.", "Additionally, in light of potential concerns regarding the appropriate use of  funding raised by several of the examples identified in this report, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretaries of the  Army and the Air Force to review these and, as appropriate, other  construction projects in the contingency environment presenting similar  circumstances to ensure that funds were properly used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment.

Further,  DOD stated that expanding section 2805 oversight and tracking  responsibilities beyond its current practices would limit the benefit of that  authority and that it is unaware of any systemic abuses of the section  2805 authority that would warrant collecting these data.", "With regard to DOD\u2019s statement that the department does not have a  data system that can track these projects and that it would not be cost  effective to develop and implement such a system, we are not suggesting  that DOD develop and implement a new system, but instead that DOD  adapt an existing system or mechanism for recording and capturing these  data in an automated form. For example, the Army\u2019s existing Element of  Resource code is a four-digit code that the Army uses to record and  classify funds transactions and the nature of the funds\u2019 use in its  accounting and finance system. The Army could also use this mechanism  to create a specific code to track contingency construction projects that  are funded using O&M appropriations under section 2805. In this way  data on the universe and cost of contingency construction projects would  be readily available in the Army\u2019s existing accounting and finance system.  In addition, we disagree with DOD\u2019s statement that tracking the universe  and cost of ongoing and future contingency construction projects would  not improve the department\u2019s decision making given that DOD was not  aware of the magnitude of its use of O&M funds for construction projects  under section 2805. As noted in our report, we found that these projects  constituted a substantial segment of overall contingency construction, and  that, according to Army Central Command officials, it is likely that the  majority of contingency construction projects are funded under this  authority. Therefore, we continue to believe that knowing the universe  and cost of all O&M-funded construction projects supporting contingency  operations is important for decision making, particularly as that  knowledge would improve decision makers\u2019 administration and oversight  of O&M funds, as well as aid in determining and projecting the funding  needed to support ongoing and future contingency operations. Finally, the  primary purpose of our recommendation for tracking construction funded  from O&M appropriations under section 2805 is not to identify abuses of  that authority, but rather to understand to what extent DOD uses O&M  funds for construction during contingency operations. That information  could assist the department in planning for current and future contingency  operations, by determining the portion of O&M spent on construction  activities that is therefore unavailable for other purposes. As we reported,  that portion may be substantial. This information could also assist the  department in evaluating the necessary actions to implement our second  recommendation. Finally, during our review we found several instances  where commanders had developed multiple construction projects, each  below the O&M maximum for unspecified minor military construction  under section 2805, to meet what may have been an overarching  construction requirement. We noted that these instances have the  potential to raise concerns regarding the appropriate use of funding.  Although not the primary purpose of our recommendation, to the extent  that reliance upon O&M-funding in the contingency environment  increases this risk, tracking the universe and cost of O&M-funded  construction projects in the contingency environment may aid the  department in identifying circumstances posing an increased risk.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the department  evaluate and improve the use of existing processes and authorities to the  extent possible; determine whether additional authorities are needed to  support urgent construction needs; and revise existing departmental  processes or seek additional authorities, as appropriate. In its comments,  DOD stated that it already conducts periodic reviews of the available  military construction authorities to determine if changes are needed to  improve or enhance speed and flexibility in providing urgent or emerging  facility requirements. However, during our review, several officials we  interviewed who were responsible for making construction decisions at  contingency bases confirmed that the current process for funding  contingency construction projects is not sufficient to provide for the  needed speed and flexibility. Therefore, we continue to believe that DOD  should evaluate its use of existing processes and authorities. To the  extent that DOD uses the processes that it described in its response to  our recommendation to address the issues we raised, DOD\u2019s actions will  meet the intent of our recommendation.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Army Corps of  Engineers develop a control activity for documenting level-of-construction  determinations before designing projects and estimating their costs,  stating that the appropriate level of construction is determined by the  facility user rather than the construction agent. DOD also noted that the  department has other construction agents in addition to the Army Corps  of Engineers. We are not recommending that the construction agent  determine the level of construction for a facility, but rather that the  construction agent develop a control activity for documenting the level-of- construction determination obtained from the facility user. During this  engagement, we reviewed projects managed by the Army Corps of  Engineers in the CENTCOM area of responsibility and therefore made  specific reference to the Army Corps of Engineers in our  recommendation. However, should the department determine that  another construction agent, such as the Naval Facilities Engineering  Command or the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, is in need of a similar  control activity, the department should apply the recommendation  accordingly.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the military  departments and the Commander of CENTCOM, develop implementing  guidance for the review and verification of ongoing contingency  construction projects when mission changes occur, stating that the  department believes all combatant commanders involved in contingency  operations should conduct periodic reviews of new or ongoing  construction projects to ensure they still meet operational needs. Because  our review was focused on CENTCOM, we cited that combatant  command in our recommendation. However, we agree that all combatant  commanders involved in contingency operations should conduct periodic  reviews of new or ongoing construction projects to ensure they still meet  operational needs. Therefore, DOD would meet the intent of the  recommendation by expanding its planned action to ensure that it applies  to all combatant commands, not only to CENTCOM.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Commander of  CENTCOM, revise Central Command Regulation 415-1 or issue other  guidance as appropriate to specifically detail the role of the combatant  command and service component commands in recording contingency  construction lessons learned from the CENTCOM area of responsibility in  the Joint Lessons Learned Information System.", "Finally, DOD did not concur with our recommendation that the Secretaries  of the Army and the Air Force review the examples presented in our  report and, as appropriate, other construction projects in the contingency  environment presenting similar circumstances, to ensure that funds were  properly used, in light of potential concerns raised by these examples  regarding the appropriate use of funding. The department stated that the  recommendation is redundant of current practice and referenced  department processes to conduct periodic reviews to ensure compliance,  among other processes, guidance, and training. Our recommendation is  not that DOD create new processes but instead that DOD use the  periodic review processes it referenced to evaluate the examples in our  report and ensure that funds were appropriately used. These examples  present instances where the department had developed multiple  construction projects, each below the O&M maximum for unspecified  minor military construction, to meet what may have been an overarching  construction requirement. We noted a similar instance where the  department had used its review process and found that an Antidefiency  Act violation had occurred.

Therefore, we concluded that they were not sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of identifying the universe of contingency construction projects.  To determine whether projects funded using O&M appropriations under  section 2805 of Title 10, U.S. Code, represented a substantial segment of  contingency construction, we reviewed readily available data on  construction projects that consisted of those reviewed by the U.S. Forces- Afghanistan\u2019s Joint Facilities Utilization Board for fiscal years 2009-12.  We determined the data from U.S. Forces-Afghanistan to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report by interviewing knowledgeable  agency officials, tracing a selection to source documents, and manually  testing data for outliers and obvious errors.

We also reviewed DOD Directive 3000.10, Contingency Basing  Outside the United States, and CENTCOM Regulation 415-1 to  understand contingency basing responsibilities. Further, we compared  existing DOD and CENTCOM contingency construction project review  and approval processes  and the availability of DOD information on  contingency construction projects funded with O&M appropriations with  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which  state among other things that management should use quality information  to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives and design control activities to achieve  objectives and respond to risks by, for example, clearly documenting all  transactions and other significant events in a manner that allows the  documentation to be readily available for examination. We also analyzed  and discussed the use of available statutory authorities for funding  contingency construction projects and the potential risks to individual  projects with officials at service component commands and bases in the  CENTCOM area of responsibility to understand mechanisms  commanders used to manage projects that relied on O&M funding for  contingency construction. The projects discussed included (1) those we  identified in reviewing U.S. Forces-Afghanistan data on construction  projects for fiscal years 2009-12 that contained similar or identical dollar  amounts, dates, and project narratives and (2) those identified by base  officials, during site visits, that illustrated the potential risks of relying on  O&M funding for contingency construction projects. We discussed the  advantages and disadvantages associated with available alternatives for  funding contingency construction projects. We also reviewed DOD  Directive 4270.5 and DOD Directive 3000.10 to understand the roles and  responsibilities of various DOD entities involved in the management,  execution, and oversight of contingency construction in the CENTCOM  area of responsibility.  We interviewed senior officials from the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), CENTCOM, the Army Central  Command, the Air Force Central Command, the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan,  the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Air Force Civil Engineer Center  and conducted site visits at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait; Camp Buering, Kuwait;  Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait; Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar; Camp As  Sayliyah, Qatar; and Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates in the  CENTCOM area of responsibility. We selected bases for site visits that  (1) had the highest number of MILCON projects at the base, (2) had  projects in close proximity to bases with the highest number of MILCON  projects and reachable without extensive additional travel, and (3) were  identified by DOD officials as containing projects illustrating contingency  construction using O&M appropriations.

DOD operates under these statutory authorities to  fund military construction projects through either the Military Construction  (MILCON) or Operation and Maintenance (O&M) appropriations.", "DOD may use general statutory authorities for construction projects.  Specifically,", "The Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military  departments may carry out military construction projects that are  authorized by law. Specified military construction projects are listed  in the annual National Defense Authorization Act and the explanatory  statement accompanying the annual appropriations act. These  projects are funded through the MILCON appropriation.", "Section 2805 of Title 10, U.S. Code, authorizes the Secretaries of the  military departments to carry out unspecified minor military  construction projects not specifically authorized by law, using  MILCON or O&M funds. As of 2015, unspecified minor military  construction projects must have an approved cost equal to or less  than $3 million, or $4 million if intended solely to correct a life-, health- , or safety-threatening deficiency. From January 2008 until December  2014, the maximums were $2 million and $3 million, respectively, and  $1.5 million and $3 million prior to January 2008. DOD may use O&M  funds to carry out projects costing $1 million or less, and must use  MILCON funds above that level. The O&M maximum was $750,000  prior to fiscal year 2015. In the case of projects above the O&M  maximum, the military department Secretary must approve the project  in advance; submit a notification to the appropriate congressional  committees; and wait 21 days, or 14 days if the notification is  submitted electronically.", "In addition to the general construction authorities, there are several other  statutory authorities that DOD may use for construction projects in  emergency and contingency circumstances. Specifically,", "Section 2803 of Title 10, U.S. Code, authorizes the Secretaries of the  military departments to carry out emergency construction projects not  otherwise authorized by law. The Secretary must determine that the  project is vital to national security or the protection of health, safety, or  the quality of the environment, and so urgent that it cannot be delayed  until the next authorization act. The Secretary must submit a  justification to the appropriate congressional committees and wait 7  days before carrying out the project. Projects using this authority must  be carried out using unobligated military construction funds, up to a  maximum of $50 million in any fiscal year.", "Section 2804 of Title 10, U.S. Code, authorizes the Secretary of  Defense to carry out contingency construction projects not otherwise  authorized by law or to authorize a military department Secretary to  do so, if the Secretary determines that delay until the next  authorization act would be inconsistent with national security or  national interest. The Secretary of Defense must submit a justification  to the appropriate congressional committees and wait 14 days, or 7  days if notification is provided electronically. DOD guidance notes  that the Secretary of Defense has retained this authority and that the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics  is responsible for coordinating requests for its use. Combatant  commanders are to verify the need for project requests and forward  them through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is  responsible for assigning priority among competing requests and  forwarding them to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics. The military departments are also  responsible for forwarding requests through the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics along with  specified information. Projects must be carried out using amounts  specifically appropriated for this authority. However, in recent years,  there have been no specific appropriations for contingency  construction under section 2804.", "Section 2808 of Title 10, U.S. Code, authorizes the Secretary of  Defense to undertake and to authorize the military department  Secretaries to undertake military construction projects not otherwise  authorized by law that are necessary to support the armed forces in  the event of a declaration of war or national emergency. DOD must  notify congressional committees when using this authority. Similar to  use of the authority under section 2804, DOD guidance provides that  combatant commanders and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  are to assign priority among competing requests and forward them to  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics. The Secretaries of the military departments also forward  requests along with specified information through the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to the Secretary  of Defense, who has retained authority for use of the provision.", "Finally, since November 2003, legislation has authorized DOD to use  O&M funds to carry out construction projects in specified areas  outside the United States, including in the U.S. Central Command  (CENTCOM) area of responsibility, that meet certain conditions.  DOD refers to the authority, which is annually authorized and  updated, as the Contingency Construction Authority. The construction  must be necessary to meet urgent military operational requirements of  a temporary nature in support of a declaration of war, a declaration of  a national emergency, or a contingency operation. With the exception  of Afghanistan, the construction must not be at a military installation  where the United States is reasonably expected to have a long-term  presence. Finally, the level of construction must be the minimum  necessary to meet temporary operational requirements, and the  United States must have no intention of using the construction after  operational requirements have been satisfied. DOD must provide a  notice with specified information to congressional committees before  using funds for a project in excess of the general O&M construction  maximum (currently $1 million) and wait for 10 days or 7 days,  depending on the form of the notice, before carrying out the project.  The legislation also previously required DOD to submit a quarterly  report on the use of the authority, although the requirement was  eliminated for fiscal year 2016. There is an annual limit on the total  cost of construction projects carried out using this authority, presently  $100 million. The Secretary of Defense has delegated approval  authority for the use of the Contingency Construction Authority to the  Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller, who issues updated  guidance on requirements and processes for proposed projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, individuals who made key  contributions to this report include Guy LoFaro, Assistant Director; Adam  Anguiano; Mae Jones; Michael Shaughnessy; Michael Silver; and John  Strong."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
