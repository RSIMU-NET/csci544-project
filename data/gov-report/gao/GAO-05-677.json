As a result, TSA was unable to determine either the number of TSA employees actually designating information as SSI or the number of documents designated SSI. Further, apart from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests or other requests for disclosure outside of TSA, there are no written policies and procedures or systematic reviews for determining if and when an SSI designation should be removed. TSA also lacks adequate internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that its SSI designation process is being consistently applied across TSA. Specifically, TSA has not established and documented policies and internal control procedures for monitoring compliance with the regulations, policies, and procedures governing its SSI designation process, including ongoing monitoring of the process. TSA officials told us that its new SSI Program Office will ultimately be responsible for ensuring that staff are consistently applying SSI designations. This office, which was established in February 2005, will also develop and implement all TSA policy concerning SSI handling, training, and protection. More detailed information on how this office's activities will be operationalized was not yet available. Specifically, TSA officials provided no written policies formalizing the office's role, responsibilities, and authority. TSA has not developed policies and procedures for providing specialized training for all of its employees making SSI designations on how information is identified and evaluated for protected status. Development of such training for SSI designations is needed to help ensure consistent implementation of the designation authority across TSA. While TSA has provided a training briefing on SSI regulations to certain staff, such as the FOIA staff, it does not have specialized training in place to instruct employees on how to consistently designate information as SSI.

Although it is not classified national security  information, SSI is a category of sensitive but unclassified information  that, along with protected critical infrastructure information, is specifically  exempted by statute from release under the Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA), and that it is to be disclosed only to covered persons on a need to  know basis. While the Transportation Security Administration (TSA),  through its SSI authority, may share SSI with regulated entities, it  generally prohibits the public disclosure of information obtained or  developed in the conduct of security activities, which would constitute an  unwarranted invasion of privacy, reveal trade secrets or privileged or  confidential commercial or financial information, or be detrimental to the  security of transportation.", "Questions have been raised about TSA\u2019s practices and procedures for  determining whether information should be protected as SSI. For example,  certain written responses to questions submitted by TSA to the House  Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee were designated as SSI.  However, 1 month earlier, the agency had not treated this same  information as sensitive. Further, in an October 2004 memorandum, TSA  itself recognized that the handling and identification of SSI had become  problematic.", "In response to your request concerning TSA\u2019s handling of SSI, we are  reporting on (1) TSA\u2019s procedures for determining whether information  should be protected under the SSI designation, as well as procedures for  determining if and when the designation should be removed, (2) internal  control procedures in place to ensure that TSA consistently complies with  laws and regulations governing the designation of information as SSI and  how TSA oversees the procedures to ensure that they are consistently  applied, and (3) TSA\u2019s training to its staff who designate SSI.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed applicable federal laws and  regulations, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and TSA policies  and procedures, and other documents related to the SSI designation, and  oversight and training processes. We also interviewed TSA and DHS  officials involved in the SSI designation, oversight and training processes.  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  provided benchmarks and standards against which we assessed TSA\u2019s SSI  designation policies and procedures.

Included in the responsibilities of this new agency was the  authority to designate information as SSI. Originally housed in the  Department of Transportation, TSA was transferred to DHS as a result of  the Homeland Security Act of 2002.", "According to TSA officials, SSI designated information is created by TSA  and by airports, aircraft operators, and other regulated parties when they  are establishing or implementing security programs or documentation to  address security requirements. Information that is designated SSI can be  shared with those who have a need to know in order to participate in or  oversee the protection of the nation\u2019s transportation system. Those with a  need to know can include persons outside of TSA, such as airport  operators, aircraft operators, foreign vessel owners, and other persons.  SSI cannot be shared with the general public, and it is exempt from  disclosure under FOIA.", "There are 16 categories of SSI. TSA has distinguished these 16 categories  into 3 types of SSI.  Four categories are termed \u201ccategorical\u201d and  automatically designated SSI. Eleven categories require a judgment or  analysis to determine if the SSI designation is warranted. One category  requires a written determination by an office with determination authority  to be deemed SSI. This category is \u201cother information,\u201d which is a catchall  exemption for information that TSA may wish to designate SSI that does  not fit into the other 15 categories.", "Additional background information on the SSI regulatory authority,  including a list of the 16 categories, is included in appendix I."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["\u201c. . . exacting specificity with respect to what information is covered and what is not  covered.

TSA\u2019s regulations allow anyone within  TSA to designate information SSI. Further, TSA has no policies on  accounting for or tracking documents designated as SSI. While TSA  officials told us that only a limited number of employees routinely make  SSI designations, they were unable to provide documentation to confirm  this. One consequence of a lack of control of personnel able to designate  documents as SSI is that TSA is unable to determine the number of  employees designating information as SSI or the volume of documents  designated SSI.", "Once a document is designated SSI, it can remain designated as SSI in  perpetuity unless a FOIA request or other request for disclosure outside of  TSA results in removal of its SSI status. If a FOIA request is received for an  SSI designated document, or a document that contains some SSI  designated material, the SSI Program Office works in conjunction with the  FOIA Office to review its initial designation. If TSA officials determine that  the document should no longer be considered SSI, it can be released to the  FOIA requester. If TSA officials feel that the SSI designation should remain  but some portions of the document are not SSI, the FOIA Office can  determine whether it is appropriate to release the document without the  SSI material, or not to release the document at all. Other than the FOIA  process, no procedures exist for the review of allegations that a document  has been erroneously designated as SSI.  If there is no FOIA request for a  particular document, according to TSA, documents marked as SSI are  reviewed for continued applicability upon any request for disclosure  outside of TSA.  However, TSA officials provided us with no information  on the number of documents released as a result of these requests for  public disclosure.  TSA\u2019s SSI regulations indicate that TSA may determine  in writing that information should no longer be designated as SSI because  it no longer meets SSI criteria, but TSA has not done this to date.", "TSA lacks adequate internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that  its SSI designation process is being consistently applied across TSA and  for monitoring compliance with the regulations governing the SSI  designation process, including ongoing monitoring of the process.  GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control call for (1) areas of authority and  responsibility to be clearly defined and appropriate lines of reporting  established, (2) transactions and other significant events to be  documented clearly and documentation to be readily available for  examination, and (3) controls generally to be designed to ensure that  ongoing monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations.  In  addition, the standards also require that information be communicated  within an organization to enable individuals to carry out their internal  control responsibilities.  However, our review of TSA\u2019s oversight activities  noted weaknesses in each of these areas.", "First, TSA has not clearly defined responsibility for monitoring compliance  with regulations, policies and procedures governing the SSI designation  process and communicated that responsibility throughout TSA.  Without  clearly identifying the responsibility for monitoring compliance with  regulations governing its SSI designation, this function may not receive  adequate attention, leaving TSA unable to provide reasonable assurance  that those making SSI designations within TSA are designating documents  properly. \u201cLacking a central policy program office for SSI has led to confusion and unnecessary  classification of some materials as SSI.  Adherence to handling requirements within TSA  has been inconsistent, and there have been instances where SSI has been mishandled  outside of TSA.  Identification of SSI has often appeared to be ad-hoc, marked by confusion  and disagreement depending on the viewpoint, experience, and training of the identifier.", "Strictures on the release of SSI and other SSI policy or handling\u2013related problems have  occasionally frustrated industry stakeholders, Congress, the media, and our own  employees trying to work within the confines of the restrictions.  Significant time and effort  has been devoted to SSI issues, and it is not likely that the current approach to addressing  such issues can be sustained.\u201d", "TSA officials told us that its new SSI Program Office will ultimately be  responsible for ensuring that staff are consistently applying SSI  designations.  This office, which was established in February 2005, will  also develop and implement all TSA policies concerning SSI handling,  training, and protection. Officials said that TSA is also currently drafting a  summary that provides a definition and brief overview of the SSI authority  and is designing materials that will further educate all TSA employees on  policies, procedures, responsibilities, and guidance for identifying and  designating SSI.  More detailed information on how this office\u2019s activities  will be operationalized was not yet available.  Specifically, TSA currently  does not have written policies formalizing the office\u2019s role,  responsibilities, and authority.", "Second, TSA has not yet established policies and procedures for how it  will monitor compliance with the regulations governing the SSI  designation process.  Without written policies and procedures  documenting how it plans to monitor compliance with the regulations  governing the SSI designation process, TSA is unable to demonstrate  evidence of its monitoring activities.", "Third, TSA has no formally defined policies or procedures for ongoing  monitoring reviews to assess compliance with the laws and regulations  governing the process for designating information as SSI.  Without clearly  defined policies and procedures for conducting periodic internal  monitoring to assess compliance with the regulations governing the SSI  designation process, TSA lacks structure to support continuous assurance  that those employees making SSI designations within TSA are designating  documents properly.", "TSA has not developed policies and procedures for providing specialized  training for all of its employees making SSI designations on how  information is to be identified and evaluated for protected status.   Development of specialized training for SSI designations must be preceded  by the establishment of guidance and associated policies and procedures  so that an adequate training curriculum can be developed.

Further,  internal control policies and procedures for monitoring the compliance  with regulations governing the SSI designation process, including internal  controls for ongoing monitoring, communicated to all staff, would help  ensure accountability and consistency in the implementation of TSA\u2019s SSI  regulations.

We have included a copy of the  comments in their entirety in appendix II. In addition, DHS provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In its June 14, 2005, comments, DHS generally concurred with our  recommendations and stated that they are consistent with ongoing TSA  efforts to improve sensitive security information program processes. In its  comments, DHS discussed the actions it has already taken and will  implement in response to the recommendations, including developing  internal controls and audit functions, which will define responsibility for  monitoring compliance with regulations, policies, and procedures  governing the SSI designation process, and which will be communicated  throughout TSA. However, as discussed below, DHS took exception to the  report\u2019s analyses and conclusions. While we disagree with the thrust of  DHS\u2019s comments, we believe we fairly and accurately characterize the  implementation and monitoring of SSI at DHS.  We made clarifying  changes where appropriate.", "DHS said that our report mischaracterized the nature of SSI by incorrectly  applying concepts associated with classified information management to  SSI information, which falls within a sensitive but unclassified information  category. DHS said that this construct may lead the reader to fundamental  misunderstandings regarding the issues surrounding SSI. Although  mentioned as a basis for comparison, neither the GAO review nor its  report was intended to apply concepts associated with classified  information management to SSI. Rather, our analyses were intended to  provide a factual summary of the key similarities and differences in the  classified information and SSI processes. We compare the two processes  only to help clarify the distinctions that exist and thereby avoid any  misunderstandings by readers who are familiar with the processes for  classified information. We included additional language in the report  clarifying that SSI is a form of sensitive but unclassified information,  rather than classified national security information.", "DHS also stated that SSI is the only practical means for sharing security  information with regulated parties and that the absence of a robust SSI  program would degrade both the prompt distribution of security  information to persons with a need to know and the free exchange of  ideas. We agree that SSI is a practical means for sharing security  information with regulated parties. In fact, the findings and  recommendations in this report should help DHS improve the SSI process.   That is, providing specific procedures and guidelines on how individual  employees are to identify and evaluate information for SSI protected  status is an intrinsic part of DHS\u2019s responsibility for effectively managing  its SSI process and should provide both DHS and the regulated parties  with confidence that information is given the proper protective status.", "DHS said that if a TSA employee incorrectly designates a document as SSI  while it remains within TSA, there is no impact on the public\u2019s right to  access because the FOIA review process will always result in an  independent determination regarding the SSI designation and that TSA and  DHS are committed to releasing as much information as possible. We view  the management improvements discussed in this report as helping to  ensure that information that should be withheld from the public is  protected as well as helping to ensure that other information is available  to the public. In addition, the fact that an incorrectly designated SSI  document remains within TSA does not obviate the fact it is wrongfully  exempted from disclosure. The potential lack of visibility to the public that  SSI documents exist and the time and expense to the public and TSA  involved in seeking disclosure of an SSI document through FOIA could  inhibit the release of information that could and possibly should have been  in the public domain but for an incorrect application of SSI.", "DHS also states that we make no distinction between the obligation to  \u201cmark\u201d information as SSI, held by all TSA employees, and the authority to  \u201cdesignate,\u201d held by only a very few high-level employees. It explains that  all employees can \u201cmark\u201d documents that fall within 15 categories as SSI  but only the high-level employees can \u201cdesignate\u201d the 16th category of  \u201cother information\u201d by documenting the designation as SSI. As we point  out in this report, the responsibility of all TSA employees goes beyond just  marking a document as SSI and includes making judgments about what  information should be marked as SSI. As we state on page 3, while TSA  requires a written determination by an office with determination authority  for information deemed SSI for 1 of its 16 SSI categories, according to  TSA, only 4 of the remaining 15 categories automatically becomes SSI  because of the type of document.  The other 11 require a judgment or  analysis to be made to determine if the SSI designation is warranted by  any TSA employee. Therefore, we continue to believe that appropriate  guidance and controls are needed to effectively manage the process.", "In addition, DHS said that its SSI designation processes are consistent with  every sensitive but unclassified system in the federal government. While  we did not review these other systems, we believe that the management  principles and controls discussed in this report are appropriate for the  TSA system and would be appropriate for similar systems elsewhere.", "DHS said that we made an implied suggestion to quantify and identify all  documents that have been marked as SSI, and to identify all personnel  who have marked such documents. We did note in our discussion of  internal controls that TSA has no policies on accounting for or tracking  documents designated as SSI. As DHS notes, we did not recommend that  TSA provide an inventory of the titles or numbers of SSI documents. In  terms of identifying staff that designate documents as SSI, since we are  recommending training for all those who designate SSI, identification of all  personnel who are going to be applying this designation would be needed  to ensure that all are trained.", "Further, DHS states that we obliquely criticize TSA\u2019s ability to protect SSI  without a date by which the document automatically loses its SSI status  based on time duration requirements similar to those applicable to  classified information. We did not recommend that TSA should implement  time limits for SSI information.  Our review showed that TSA has no  written policies and procedures or systematic reviews for determining if  and when an SSI designation should be removed. Moreover, other than the  FOIA request process and other requests for disclosure outside of TSA, no  procedures exist for a review to determine whether a document has been  appropriately designated as SSI. Such procedures would allow TSA to  periodically review SSI designations and identify and correct erroneously  marked SSI documents while still protecting those with valid reasons.", "In commenting on our recommendation that DHS establish clear guidance  and procedures for using the TSA regulations to determine what  constitutes SSI, DHS said that TSA\u2019s SSI Program Office has already taken  some steps in line with our recommendation by developing internal  guidance that expands on the SSI regulation structure to provide examples  of the types of information that should fall within each SSI category.  It  expects to publish the guidance for general use by TSA employees and  regulated parties in identifying and handling SSI.", "In commenting on our recommendation that DHS establish clear  responsibility for the identification and designation of information that  warrants SSI protection, DHS stated that limiting the number of  individuals who may designate a document as SSI would lead to  operational bottlenecks, could lead to inappropriate release of security  information, and would not be operationally feasible. If it is properly done,  we do not see how establishing clear responsibility for performing a  governmental task would lead to these effects.  We wish to make a  distinction between a set of personnel who would have responsibility for  SSI and a potentially much larger set of employees who would be able to  designate documents SSI.  Those responsible for SSI would be  accountable for ensuring that those in their domain of responsibility have  appropriate training and are applying SSI appropriately. DHS would then  be in a much better position to ensure that those responsible for SSI are  held accountable, have appropriate training, and are applying SSI  appropriately.", "DHS agreed with our recommendation for DHS to establish internal  controls that clearly define responsibility for monitoring compliance with  regulations, policies, and procedures governing the SSI designation  process and communicate that responsibility throughout TSA. DHS said it  had already undertaken action to develop internal controls, including audit  functions, which will define responsibility for monitoring compliance with  regulations, policies, and procedures governing the SSI designation  process and will communicate that responsibility throughout TSA.", "In commenting on our recommendation that DHS establish policies and  procedures within TSA for providing specialized training to those making  SSI designations on how information is to be identified and evaluated for  protected status, DHS said that it conducts specialized SSI training for the  SSI Program Office and FOIA staff, and other TSA offices making SSI  designations. In addition, it is expanding specialized training to those  offices within the agency that create the majority of SSI. This is a good  first step in addressing our recommendation, but falls short of its overall  intent because SSI regulations extend the SSI designation authority to all  TSA employees and does so without giving them specific procedures and  guidance, beyond the regulations, upon which to base their judgments.  Thus, policies and procedures for providing specialized training to all TSA  employees authorized to make an SSI designation will still be needed. In  this regard, in our report, we quote an October 14, 2004, TSA  memorandum that says in part, \u201cidentification of SSI has often appeared to  be ad-hoc, marked by confusion and disagreement depending on the  viewpoint, experience, and training of the identifier.\u201d We believe this  statement speaks to the need for specialized training for all those who  designate materials as SSI.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
