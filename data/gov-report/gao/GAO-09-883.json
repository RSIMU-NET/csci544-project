However, these officials noted Saudi Arabia's neighbor, Yemen, is emerging as a base from which Al Qaeda terrorists can launch attacks against U.S. and Saudi interests. U.S. and Saudi officials also report progress on efforts to prevent financial support to extremists, citing, for example, the Saudi government's regulations on sending charitable contributions overseas, and the arrest and prosecution of individuals providing support for terrorism. However, U.S. officials remain concerned about the ability of Saudi individuals and charitable organizations to support terrorism outside of Saudi Arabia, and noted limited Saudi enforcement capacity and terrorists' use of cash couriers as challenges. Despite these concerns, some performance targets related to countering terrorism financing were removed from State's current MSP.

Like hajj, charitable  giving, or zakat, is one of the five pillars or duties of Islam. Zakat, a form  of tithe or charity payable for those in need, is an annual flat rate of 2.5  percent of a Muslim\u2019s assessable capital.

In part, this prosperity, combined with the Islamic  religious obligation toward charitable giving or zakat, led to the  establishment of charitable organizations headquartered in Saudi Arabia,  known as multilateral charitable organizations. These organizations\u2014 which include the Muslim World League and the World Assembly of  Muslim Youth\u2014were established in the 1960s and 1970s by Saudi royal  decree to spread Islam and provide humanitarian assistance around the  world, and received funds from the Saudi government and citizens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S.-Saudi Relations", "paragraphs": ["Relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia have a long  historical context.

According to U.S. officials, since 2005, several targets to assess progress of  the U.S. government\u2019s counterterrorism and antiterrorism financing  collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have been met. However,  some performance targets, specifically those related to combating  financing of terrorism, were removed from the MSP for Saudi Arabia even  though U.S. agencies remain concerned about the ability of Saudi  individuals and multilateral charitable organizations to fund terrorist  organizations in other countries. U.S. agencies stated that, despite the  omission of these targets, they continue to engage with the government of  Saudi Arabia on efforts to prevent financial support to extremists. Given  that State uses MSP targets to assess progress in countering terrorism and  terrorism financing in Saudi Arabia, it is important that the U.S. mission  include targets related to key areas of concern to more effectively  prioritize U.S. efforts and to formulate resource requests for these  activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of State direct the U.S. mission in the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to reinstate, in consultation with relevant U.S.  agencies, performance measures related to preventing the flow of alleged  financial support, through mechanisms such as cash couriers, to terrorists  and extremists outside Saudi Arabia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Comments, Third-Party Views, and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["State and DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report, which  are reproduced in appendices V and VI, respectively.

We focused on these agencies and components  as a result of previous work undertaken by GAO regarding efforts to  address violent extremism, our review of information since GAO\u2019s  previous work indicating which agencies were involved in efforts to  collaborate with Saudi Arabia, and discussions with U.S. agency officials  regarding the agencies with which they collaborate.", "To examine the U.S. government strategy to collaborate with and assist  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to counter terrorism and terrorism financing,  we reviewed relevant U.S. strategic documents, including the U.S.  Strategy Toward Saudi Arabia, Report Pursuant to Section 2043(c) of  the Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act,  and Mission Strategic Plans (MSP) for Saudi Arabia (previously called  Mission Performance Plans) for fiscal years 2005 to 2011. While we did not  assess these documents for key elements of a strategy as identified by  GAO, we used the performance targets stated in these documents as  criteria against which we assessed progress.

Additionally,  we developed and administered a data collection instrument to agencies  providing training and technical assistance to the Saudi government\u2014 including State, Treasury, DOJ, DHS, DOD, and DOE\u2014to obtain  information on programs and activities, including goals, description,  indicators, assessments, and associated funding. We corroborated  information reported to us in the data collection instrument with  information obtained during interviews with agency officials and reported  in agency evaluation documents. Further, we obtained and examined  documentation from Saudi officials regarding their domestic efforts to  counter terrorism and terrorism financing, including Rules Governing the  Opening of Bank Accounts and General Operational Guidelines in Saudi  Arabia, Third Update, December 2008, and reviewed public information  available on the embassy Web site.
