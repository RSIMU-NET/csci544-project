Although some states had difficulty expanding their program infrastructure in the first 2 years of increased funding, the amount of funds states returned to HHS declined the second year. Differences in funding also appeared in the amounts available per eligible foster care youth. Following the passage of FCIA, 40 states reported in our survey expanding independent living services to younger youth, and 36 states expanded services to older youth, but gaps remain in providing some key services to youth. State differences in serving youth may have been caused by gaps in the availability of critical services, such as mental health services, mentoring, and housing, as well as challenges engaging youth and foster parents to participate in the program. Almost all states that we surveyed reported increased levels of coordination under FCIA, but linkages with other federal and state youth-serving programs were not always in place to increase services available across local areas. Despite some coordination efforts, states may not make full use of available resources. One of the barriers in linking program services reported by the 4 states we visited included the inconsistent availability of information on the array of programs that were operating in each state and local area. States and HHS have taken action to fulfill the accountability provisions of FCIA, but little information is available to assess the effectiveness of independent living services. All states submitted required plans and reports, but the absence of a uniform reporting format and lack of standard monitoring practices among HHS regional offices hindered assessments of state performance. HHS is developing an information system that may improve program accountability and reported that it expects to issue a proposed regulation in 2005."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Almost 40 percent of the more than 530,000 youth in foster care are  adolescents age 13 or older, and approximately 19,000 youth leave the  foster care system each year without being adopted or having a permanent  living arrangement. Research studies have shown that many of these  young people face serious problems once on their own, including  homelessness, a lack of education and stable employment, and difficulties  obtaining medical and mental health services. In response to concerns that  youth leave foster care poorly prepared to live self-sufficiently, in 1986  Congress created the Independent Living Program, which provided states  with funding to prepare foster care adolescents for adulthood. To  strengthen this program, Congress later passed the Foster Care  Independence Act of 1999 (FCIA) and created the John H. Chafee Foster  Care Independence Program (Chafee Program), which doubled overall  federal funding for independent living programs from $70 million to   $140 million. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has responsibility  for overseeing and evaluating the Chafee Program, which comprises about  2 percent of the approximately $6 billion obligated to foster care and  adoption programs under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.", "In addition to providing increased funding, FCIA resulted in other  significant changes for the independent living program. The law expanded  state flexibility to offer independent living services to youth younger than  16 and to assist youth 18 to 21 years old who are no longer in the foster  care system with room and board, Medicaid health insurance, and other  support services. Further, FCIA called for states to make every effort to  coordinate their independent living programs with other federal and state  programs that provide services to youth, such as housing and school-to- work programs. All states were required to submit a multiyear plan  describing how they planned to use the Chafee Program funds, and HHS  required states to submit annual reports on the progress made to  implement their programs. In addition, states were required to submit  certifications that they would comply with various aspects of the law.  Finally, FCIA directed HHS to develop outcome measures to be used to  assess state performance in operating independent living programs and to  conduct evaluations of state programs deemed to be innovative or of  potential national significance.", "We previously reported on HHS\u2019s and states\u2019 efforts to implement  independent living programs prior to changes under FCIA. Because of  your interest in how HHS and states have implemented FCIA and progress  made to assist foster youth achieve self-sufficiency, you asked us to  determine (1) how states\u2019 funding allocation changed to serve youth after  FCIA, (2) the extent to which states have expanded independent living  services and age groups of foster youth served since the passage of FCIA  and what challenges remain, (3) the extent to which states have used other  federal and state programs to coordinate the delivery of independent living  services to foster youth, and (4) how the states and HHS have fulfilled the  program accountability provisions of the law and assessed the  effectiveness of independent living services.", "To conduct our work, we surveyed the independent living coordinators in  all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico regarding their  experiences in developing and implementing their Chafee Programs in  federal fiscal year 2003. We received responses from 50 states and the  District of Columbia. We compared results with those of a similar survey  we administered to state independent living coordinators that gathered  information on state independent living programs operating in federal  fiscal year 1998. We checked for obvious errors and conducted some  follow-up with states, but we did not independently verify states\u2019  responses. We analyzed federal funding amounts to the 50 states, the  District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico for independent living programs  before and after the passage of FCIA, using federal financial and foster  care population data, as well as data reported by states in our 2004 survey.  We analyzed Chafee Program plans from 49 states, the District of  Columbia, and Puerto Rico for federal fiscal years 2001-2004 to determine  states\u2019 program strategies for meeting the goals of FCIA. We also analyzed  a total of 90 annual progress and services reports (annual reports) that  states submitted regarding the progress made in implementing their  Chafee Program plans for federal fiscal years 2001 and 2002. In addition,  we visited 4 states\u2014Connecticut, Florida, Texas, and Washington\u2014and 2  local areas within each state to obtain information on their experiences  developing and implementing their independent living programs. We spoke  with state and local officials, caseworkers, several groups of youth, foster  parents, and contract provider staff. We selected states that represented a  variety of approaches to implementing independent living services and  geographic diversity. Finally, we interviewed HHS officials, federal  contractors, and child welfare experts, and reviewed relevant documents  and literature.

This program  was designed to prepare adolescents in foster care to live self-sufficiently  once they exited the child welfare system. As with many adolescents,  foster care youth face a time of uncertainty and change as they approach  age 18. However, research suggests that they may be at greater risk of  experiencing negative consequences in adulthood, such as unemployment,  incarceration, or poor health outcomes. For example, research indicates  that 30 to 40 percent of youth in foster care are affected by chronic  medical problems, but barriers exist to meeting those needs, such as  prolonged delays in getting referrals to specialists. In addition, research  shows that children and youth in foster care have poorer academic  experiences than do their peers not in care. For example, twice as many  youth in foster care than those not in foster care had repeated a grade,  changed schools during the year, or enrolled in a special education  program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Foster Care Independence Act and the Chafee Program", "paragraphs": ["Several amendments were made to the Independent Living Program over  the years, but the passage of FCIA and the creation of the Chafee Program  represented the most significant changes in the federal independent living  program since its creation. FCIA doubled the federal funds available for  independent living programs to $140 million each year. These funds are  allocated to states based on their share of the nation\u2019s foster care  population.", "In addition to providing increased funding, FCIA eliminated the minimum  age limit of 16 years and provided states with the flexibility to define the  age at which children in foster care are eligible for services to help them  prepare for independent living, as long as services are provided to youth  who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age. The law  provided states the flexibility to develop programs that met the needs of  the adolescents in their care, as long as states designed and conducted  their programs based on the five key purposes outlined in the law (see  table 1).", "The law also provided several new services to help youth make the  transition to adulthood. First, it allowed states to use up to 30 percent of  their state allotment for room and board for former foster care youth up to  age 21. Second, it allowed states the option to expand Medicaid coverage  to former foster care adolescents between 18 and 21. Title IV-E was  amended again in 2002 to provide foster youth vouchers for postsecondary  education and training under the Education and Training Vouchers (ETV)  program and authorized an additional $60 million for states to provide  postsecondary education and training vouchers up to $5,000 per year per  youth. Eligible participants include youth otherwise eligible for services  under the states\u2019 Chafee Programs, youth adopted from foster care after  attaining the age of 16, and youth participating in the voucher program on  their 21st birthday (until they turn 23 years old) as long as they are  enrolled in a postsecondary education or training program and are making  satisfactory progress toward completion of that program. In federal fiscal  year 2003, approximately $41 million in federal funds was available for  states\u2019 ETV programs. The amount increased slightly in federal fiscal year  2004 to approximately $44 million.", "In addition, the law required that states make every effort to coordinate  their Chafee Programs with other federal and state programs for youth,  such as the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, abstinence education  programs, local housing programs, programs for disabled youth, and  school-to-work programs offered by high schools or local workforce  agencies.

They hold the responsibility for reviewing and  approving the state plans, certifications, and annual reports. In addition,  the regional offices provide assistance and guidance to the states on  implementing and operating their programs. Technical assistance is also  available to states from 10 national resource centers. In particular, the  National Resource Center for Youth Development (NRCYD) provides  states and tribes assistance with helping youth in care establish permanent  connections and achieve successful transitions to adulthood.

The CFSR measures  state performance on 45 performance items, which correspond to   7 outcomes and 7 systemic factors. States that were reviewed during the  first year of the CFSR were rated on the provision of independent living  services to youth in their care 16 years or older. This item was removed  from the CFSR in subsequent reviews when ACF redesigned the review  instrument to focus more on setting and achieving appropriate  permanency goals for children and less on service delivery. With the  redesigned instrument, reviewers were instructed to consider the  provision of independent living services in other measures, such as when  determining if the youths\u2019 needs were assessed and if appropriate services  were provided."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FCIA Increased Independent Living Allocations for Most States, but Some States Had Difficulty Absorbing Large Increases in Funds", "paragraphs": ["While overall federal funding for state independent living programs  doubled with the passage of FCIA, there were significant variations in the  changes to state allocations, and some states had difficulty expanding  their programs quickly enough to spend all of the new funds. Prior to the  passage of FCIA, states were awarded independent living funds based on  the number of children receiving federal foster care payments in 1984.  The new law updated the formula, which generally allocates funds to each  state based on the state\u2019s proportion of the nation\u2019s population of children  in foster care\u2014regardless if the child is receiving federal or state funded  foster care payments. In addition, the new formula includes a hold- harmless provision to ensure that each state will receive at least the  amount it received in federal fiscal year 1998 or $500,000, whichever is  greater. Once the states subject to the hold-harmless provision are funded,  the remaining funds within the cap of $140 million are allotted to the other  states. Under the previous independent living program, states received  funds ranging from $13,000 in Alaska to more than $12 million in  California. In the first year of funding under FCIA, Alaska and eight other  states received the minimum of $500,000, while California received more  than $27 million (see table 2). In most cases, states received an increase of  funds. However, the District of Columbia, Louisiana, and New Jersey  received no additional funds the first year because their allocations under  the new formula were initially lower than the amounts they received in  1998. Therefore, because of the hold-harmless clause, they received the  same amount awarded in 1998.", "Some states were unable to spend all of their federal allocations in the first  2 years of increased funding under the program. In 2001, 20 states returned  nearly $10 million in federal funding to HHS, and in 2002, 13 states  returned more than $4 million. ACF regional officials reported that one  reason for these unspent funds was that some states did not initially have  the infrastructure in place to quickly absorb the influx of funds. Texas, for  example, planned to use some of its $2.75 million in additional funds to  develop services for youth in rural areas, but state officials said that the  process of identifying and issuing contracts to service providers was  lengthy and initially hampered by the need to identify service providers  who were able to provide matching contributions required to receive  federal funds under FCIA. As a result, over $500,000 of the state\u2019s total   $4.6 million allocation went unspent in federal fiscal year 2001.", "We could not determine the amount of FCIA funding states had available  to spend on each youth eligible for independent living services because of  the lack of data on eligible youth emancipated from foster care. However,  available data on youth in foster care suggest that states may have  different amounts of funds available for services to youth in foster care.  We compared each state\u2019s 2004 FCIA allocation with its 2002 population of  eligible youth in foster care. This comparison showed that funding for  independent living services ranged from $476 per foster youth in West  Virginia to almost $2,300 per youth in Montana, as shown in figure 1.  These differences were due in part to the new provision in FCIA that  allowed states to define the age ranges within which youth were eligible  for independent living services. For example, 4 states reported in our  survey offering independent living services to youth at age 12, while   27 states reported offering services at age 14. In addition, the funding  formula is based on the total number of all children in foster care.  However, some states have a larger share of youth eligible for independent  living services than other states. For example, of the 15 states reporting in  our survey that youth are eligible for services between the ages of 14 and  21, 3 states had 25 percent or less of their foster care population within  this age range, while in 3 other states, this age range accounted for over   40 percent of the total foster care population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Expanded and Improved Services for Youth after FCIA, but Gaps in Critical Services Remain", "paragraphs": ["Following the passage of FCIA, many states reported expanding eligibility  for independent living services to younger and older youth and to provide  new services, such as Medicaid health insurance, to youth who had  already left the foster care system.

Texas was developing a strategy  to redesign the provision of social services in the state, including services  to youth in the independent living program. The goals of this effort  included establishing a local, cross-system network composed of youth in  foster care, emancipated youth, caregivers, and professionals to facilitate  linkages between stakeholders and improve the delivery of services to  youth transitioning out of foster care.", "Additional strategies states developed to establish linkages with other  federal, state, or local programs included establishing liaisons between  agencies or programs or through less formal collaborative arrangements.", "In Connecticut, the child welfare agency established a liaison position with  the Job Corps program to meet with foster care youth to determine  whether they were appropriate candidates for the program, and to monitor  their progress, address any obstacles or concerns, and help youth plan for  the future. In addition, a liaison between the independent living program  and Connecticut\u2019s mental health agency assists youth in their transition to  the adult mental health system to ensure that youth who need the  continued support maintain access to medication and services after youth  leave the foster care system.", "In local areas in Texas and Florida, child welfare officials worked with  local housing authorities to assist youth in accessing federal housing  vouchers provided by HUD. For example, in Tallahassee, Florida, the local  housing authority secured 30 of 100 available housing vouchers for youth  emancipating from foster care and established a case manager position  especially for the youth in the program.", "In Florida, the independent living program officials worked with the state\u2019s  youth mental health department to access the Assertive Community  Treatment for Teens Program. The program consisted of community-based  teams\u2014nurses, job developers, housing and education officials, and other  relevant stakeholders\u2014who worked together to develop integrated service  plans for youth with serious and persistent mental illness.", "In addition, officials reported developing linkages with other private  resources in their communities, such as business owners, to provide  services to youth in the independent living program.", "Connecticut independent living officials collaborated with business  owners, nonprofit organizations, and other state agencies to develop an  experiential employment training program that gave youth 16 and older  the opportunity to learn skills through participation in workshops covering  all aspects of a local business. For example, some youth worked in a boat- building business and learned skills ranging from carpentry and  construction to sales and financial management.", "In one Florida county, independent living staff utilized a community  resource know as the speakers\u2019 bureau\u2014a service that links members of  the community with youth to talk about a wide range of professions and  activities. Caseworkers said as youth moved through their daily living  skills curriculum they were asked to decide whom they wanted as guest  speakers.", "In Texas, the child welfare agency worked with the Orphan Foundation of  America\u2014a nonprofit organization\u2014so youth could access a Web-based  mentoring program. Youth participating in the program were matched  with online mentors based on mutual interests, and they communicated  regularly via e-mail or by phone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Reported Barriers to Establishing Linkages between the Independent Living Programs and Other Youth-Serving Programs", "paragraphs": ["While table 3 shows that states are using a wide variety of programs to  provide independent living services, officials in the 4 states we visited  reported several barriers that hinder their ability to establish linkages with  other agencies and programs, including the lack of information on the  array of programs available in each state or local area and differences in  program priorities. Officials from 3 states we visited said that they relied  on local officials to identify potential partners and initiate and maintain  coordination efforts; and while individuals in some local areas may have  developed successful collaborations with service providers in their area,  these relationships have not always been expanded statewide. To some  extent, this has been due to the fact that state and local child welfare  officials differ in their awareness of resources available from various  federal and state agencies.", "Local officials in one area of Florida were working with a U.S. Department  of Labor workforce program, while officials in another local area of the  state were not familiar with this program to train and find employment for  youth.", "In one local area in Washington, independent living coordinators and  caseworkers expressed concern about access to affordable health care for  youth emancipating from foster care and were not aware of a federal  health center located nearby that was required to provide medical and  mental health services on a sliding fee scale.", "These gaps in awareness may be partly due to turnover rates for  caseworkers reported by the states we visited. Caseworkers\u2019 lack of  knowledge about available programs may have contributed to foster  parents and youth reporting that they were unaware of the array of  services available from other federal, state, or local programs.", "Officials in the independent living programs in the states we visited also  cited barriers to establishing linkages with other federal and state  programs because of different program priorities.", "Difference in performance goals among programs can affect the ability of  independent living staff to obtain services for foster youth from other  agencies. For example, child welfare and workforce officials in Florida  reported that performance goals for workforce programs may act as  barriers to serving youth in the child welfare system who may be more  difficult to place in employment and might not maintain the jobs once  placed, potentially bringing down workforce program performance  measures. As a result, the officials reported that local workforce  programs may target those individuals with whom they can most easily  achieve successful outcomes and foster youth may be unable to access  services they need to achieve positive employment outcomes.", "According to independent living service providers in one local area in  Washington, privacy concerns were a barrier to developing linkages with  education programs. For example, schools in one area we visited would  not allow anyone besides biological parents\u2014including caseworkers and  foster parents\u2014access to youths\u2019 individualized education programs. Yet  according to caseworkers, foster parents, and service providers, lack of  access to these plans made it difficult to align the individualized education  programs with the youths\u2019 independent living plans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States\u2019 and HHS\u2019s Actions in Response to FCIA Requirements Have Not Yet Established Accountability for Independent Living Programs", "paragraphs": ["All states developed multiyear plans as required under FCIA and  submitted annual progress reports to ACF for their independent living  programs, but the absence of standard comprehensive information within  and across state plans and reports precludes using them at the state and  federal level to monitor how well the programs are working to serve foster  youth. HHS has not yet implemented its plan to collect information to  measure states\u2019 program performance, and while some states reported  collecting some data, states have experienced difficulties in contacting  youth to determine their outcomes.

To  assist states in preparing these documents, ACF developed guidance that  set out broad expectations for the plans and reports that would meet the  FCIA requirements. However, while ACF officials stated that the plans and  annual reports served as the primary method the agency used to monitor  states\u2019 use of the Chafee Program funds, ACF did not require states to use  a uniform reporting format, set specific baselines for measuring progress,  or report on youths\u2019 outcomes. As a result, each state developed plans and  reports that varied in their scope and level of detail, making it difficult to  determine whether states had made progress in preparing foster youth to  live self-sufficiently. Our review of plans from 51 states covering federal  fiscal years 2001 through 2004, and annual reports for 45 states from  federal fiscal years 2001 and 2002 showed that    Few states both organized the information in their plans to address the  purposes of FCIA and presented specific strategies they would use to  meet these purposes. For example, Nebraska\u2019s plan was aligned according  to the five purposes of FCIA, but when describing how the state would  help youth receive the education, training, and services necessary to  obtain employment, the plan provided only a broad statement about the  collaborative efforts between state agencies without mention of specific  strategies to deliver the services. In contrast, New Hampshire submitted a  comprehensive state plan that described the state\u2019s holistic approach to  providing services to youth transitioning out of care, such as specialized  trainings for youth, foster parents, and independent living staff; programs  offered through community resources; and resources available for youth  with emotional and physical challenges, but these services were not  attached to any one purpose of FCIA.", "The plans vary in their usefulness in establishing outcomes the states  intended to achieve for youth. For example, the District of Columbia  indicated that it will use Chafee Program funds to establish a computer lab  where current and former foster care youth can search for jobs, but the  plan does not establish any outcomes the District hoped to achieve with  this service, such as the percentage of youth that find employment over a  period of time. In contrast, the Nevada plan identified 2001 and 2002 as the  baseline years for the number of foster youth who graduate or receive a  general equivalency diploma (GED) and planned to increase by 3 percent  each year the number of youth who receive a high school diploma or GED  until the youth are within the overall state average.", "Annual reports for all 45 states contained information that did not  directly relate to information in their state plan making it unclear  whether the differences were due to service changes or missing  information. For example, in Hawaii\u2019s plan, the state listed several  services and supports provided to youth, including employment services,  such as career exploration and job placement and retention. However, in  each of the annual reports, the state does not mention offering or  providing any employment-related services.", "Of the 90 annual progress reports we reviewed, 52 reports did not  include clear data that could be used to determine progress toward  meeting the goals of the states\u2019 independent living program. For  example, Arkansas\u2019 report for federal fiscal year 2002 listed several  workshops provided to youth, such as money management and college  preparation, and a count of the number of youth who participated in the  workshops. In contrast, Nevada consistently reported data on youths\u2019  participation in different independent living activities, including the  changes between each year, progress towards meeting the goals  established in their plan, and reasons for not yet meeting the goals.", "ACF officials said that they recognize the limitations of these documents  as tools to monitor states\u2019 use of independent living program funds, but  explained that they rely on states\u2019 to self-certify that their independent  living programs adhere to FCIA requirements. Staff in ACF\u2019s 10 regional  offices conduct direct oversight of the program by reviewing the multiyear  plans and annual reports, interpreting program guidance, and  communicating with states when clarification about their plans or reports  is needed. However, officials in three offices said that their review of the  documents was cursory and that the plans and annual reports do not serve  as effective monitoring tools. Only three regions reported that they  conducted site visits to observe independent living programs in at least  some states in their regions. The other regions reported that they do not  have the funds to travel or when they do, the review is focused on other  programs or planning efforts. One region commented that even if it had  funds, ACF had not developed a standard mechanism for regional offices  to use in monitoring states\u2019 use of FCIA funds.", "Alternatively, ACF officials reported that the Child and Family Services  Review used to evaluate the states\u2019 overall child welfare systems could  serve as a tool to monitor independent living programs, but the CFSR is  limited in the type and amount of data collected on youth receiving  independent living services. While states evaluated under the first year of  the CFSR were rated on the provision of independent living services to  youth in care, this item was removed in subsequent reviews. ACF  redesigned its review instrument with the intent of focusing on setting and  achieving appropriate permanency goals for children rather than  evaluating specific services. Despite the fact that independent living  services are no longer a specific focus of the CFSR, ACF officials believe  that two broader measures used in the review will provide opportunities to  evaluate states\u2019 performance in assisting youth: the measurement of the  stability of foster care placements and the review of permanency goals of  other planned permanent living arrangements, such as the goal of  emancipation. However, some regional officials performing these reviews  reported that the on-site portion of the CFSR is limited in scope and does  not present an opportunity to determine if states are delivering  independent living services to youth and if youth receiving such services  are achieving better outcomes than their peers. Further, the CFSR  includes a review of a small number of foster care case files and does not  include a review of emancipated youth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Not Yet Complied with Requirements to Collect Program Data to Assess States\u2019 Programs, and Some States Collecting Information on Youth Are Experiencing Difficulties", "paragraphs": ["ACF has not completed efforts to develop a plan to collect data on youths\u2019  characteristics, services, and outcomes in response to the FCIA  requirement, and some states that are attempting to collect information on  youths\u2019 outcomes are experiencing difficulties.

However, HHS  officials stated that as of August 2004, implementation had not yet  occurred.  The agency has completed many of the steps laid out in its  original plan dated September 2001, including consulting with child  welfare and information technology professionals, developing a set of  preliminary data elements and outcomes measures, and pilot testing the  data collection instruments with 7 states. However, HHS reported that it  had not taken the next step of publishing the notice for proposed rule  making because the agency decided to develop regulations for the data  collection system in order to fulfill a statutory requirement to assess  penalties on states for noncompliance. As a result, the proposal has been  under internal review since the conclusion of the pilot test process in  November 2001.

Many states reported in our 2004 survey that they  already collect many of the data elements HHS had developed as part of  the consultation and pilot testing process (see table 4).", "In addition, some states are attempting to collect outcome information on  former foster care youth but have experienced difficulties. According to  results from our survey, in federal fiscal year 2003, 30 states attempted to  contact youth who had been emancipated from foster care for initial  information to determine their status, including education and  employment outcomes. Of those states, most reported that they were  unsuccessful in contacting more than half of the youth. Further, 21 states  reported attempting to follow up with emancipated youth after a longer  period of time had elapsed but had trouble reaching all the youth.", "Officials in the states we visited reported that collecting outcome data is  especially challenging since there is little they can do to find youth unless  the youth themselves initiate the contact. Further, some officials were  concerned about the value of the outcome data since they believe that  youth who are doing well are more likely to participate in the follow-up  interviews, thus skewing the results. Similarly, an ACF regional official  reported that the value of the NYTD would be determined by the resources  available to states to support the follow-up component. Some state  officials, caseworkers, and youth we interviewed suggested strategies  states may need to develop to maintain contact with former foster care  youth, including offering incentives to the youth to stay in touch;  establishing a toll-free telephone line that will make the process of staying  in touch as easy as possible; or using other resources that may help locate  the youth or provide the necessary data, such as other service providers or  other social services information systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Begun Multiyear Evaluation of Four Approaches to Delivering Independent Living Services", "paragraphs": ["By December 2007, ACF expects to complete the evaluations of four  approaches to delivering independent living services. As required by FCIA,  these evaluations will use rigorous scientific standards, such as an  experimental research design that randomly assigns youth in independent  living programs to different groups: one that is administered the  experimental treatment and one that is not. HHS initiated this effort in  2001 with a nationwide review of potentially promising approaches to  delivering independent living services. HHS contracted with a research  institute to conduct a nationwide search to identify independent living  programs that meet the criteria of the evaluation and to conduct 5-year  evaluations of the selected programs. On the basis of the search and the  established criteria, HHS selected four programs for the evaluation (see  table 7).", "The study is designed to answer the following questions: (1) How do the  outcomes of youth randomly assigned to the identified interventions  compare with those of youth who are assigned to \u201cservices as usual\u201d?

States have generally expanded their independent living  programs to provide new and enhanced services to a wider age range of  youth, but some states have been slower to implement the program, and  foster youth across the nation may not have access to the full array of  services they may need to lead independent and successful lives. While  many other federal, state, and private resources exist to cover some  shortfalls in service, the absence of information on resources available in  local areas may continue to hinder efforts to establish needed linkages  among programs. Similarly, while ACF provides some assistance to states,  there is still a lack of awareness about available resources among  caseworkers, foster parents, and youth that may further limit youths\u2019  ability to access needed services once emancipated from the foster care  system.", "While the Chafee Program funding is small compared with that of other  child welfare programs, effective federal oversight requires reliable  information on states\u2019 implementation efforts and results. At a minimum,  information from state plans and annual reports could be useful in federal  oversight and monitoring. However, the ability of ACF to monitor state  performance continues to be hindered by an absence of standard,  comprehensive information within and across state plans on each state\u2019s  goals, services, and youth outcomes as measured against baselines of past  achievement. Oversight is similarly hindered by a lack of standard  monitoring practices across ACF regional offices. While ACF is developing  an information system that may address some of these limitations, it may  be unavailable for several years.

HHS stated that taking action to  standardize the reporting format for state plans and annual reports would  be overly prescriptive and impose an unnecessary burden on states.  HHS  added that a significant change under the law was to require states to self- certify their compliance with statutory requirements in their state plan,  and that rather than report on performance outcomes, the plan was  intended to be a narrative to ensure state adherence to plan requirements  and assurances.  In addition, HHS reported that when standard data are  available through the National Youth in Transition Database, the agency  would be better positioned to determine how best to assess state  performance.  HHS further reported that ACF did provide regional office  staff with a checklist to review and approve the first state plan and that in  fiscal year 2005, ACF will develop and provide a review protocol to be  used in regional office desk reviews of states\u2019 annual progress reports.", "We continue to believe that strengthening the state reporting process is  needed to provide assurance of program accountability at the state and  federal level.  HHS officials stated that they consider their review of the  state plans and annual reports as the primary method the agency uses to  monitor states\u2019 use of Chafee Program funds. However, comments by ACF  regional officials conducting the oversight reviews\u2014as well as our own  review\u2014have shown that the diverse format and content of these  documents are insufficient for this purpose. Developing a standard  reporting format that states can use for their plans and annual reports  would help HHS improve the efficiency of the reporting process by  clarifying the broad guidance ACF provides to the states, allowing ACF  reviewers to quickly identify states\u2019 progress toward meeting program  goals, and thereby reduce the burden of the reporting process currently in  place. As we reported, some states have already taken action to establish  baselines and goals as well as strategies for action in their state plan that  can be linked with information in the annual progress reports to identify  areas of strength and needed improvement.  HHS should consider these  efforts undertaken by states and take a cooperative approach in working  with them and cognizant national organizations in developing a standard  report format to garner support and reduce perceptions of burden. HHS  could, for example, continue its partnership with the workgroup that  contributed to the NYTD proposal or convene a session at the annual  conference with state independent living coordinators.
