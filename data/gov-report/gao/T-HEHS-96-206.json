Of the approximately 400 health plans available to federal employees, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association\u2019s plan is the largest, covering almost 42 percent of about 4 million federal enrollees.", "In recent years, prescription drug costs have accounted for an increasing share of the total benefits paid by the Association\u2019s federal employee health plan. To help control the plan\u2019s drug costs, as of January 1, 1996, the Association began requiring enrollees insured under the plan\u2019s Standard Option and covered by Medicare part B to pay 20 percent of the price of prescriptions purchased at participating retail pharmacies. Before this change, these federal enrollees, like those in some other federal health plans, did not have to pay anything for retail prescription drugs. The enrollees may continue to receive drugs free of charge, however, if they purchase them through the plan\u2019s mail order program.", "The benefit change gave enrollees an incentive to use the plan\u2019s mail order program. It also raised concerns, however, from Members of Congress and retail pharmacies about the quality of mail order services and the change\u2019s effect on the business of retail pharmacies that serve the plan\u2019s enrollees. To provide pharmacy services to its federal employee health plan (referred to as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan), the Association contracts with two pharmacy benefit managers (PBM): PCS Health Systems, Inc., provides the plan\u2019s retail prescription drug services, and Merck-Medco Managed Care, Inc. (referred to as \u201cMedco\u201d), provides mail order drug services.", "As part of an ongoing study of federal employee health plans\u2019 use of PBMs, we are looking at several issues concerning this benefit change and the performance of the PBMs that serve the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan. Today, I would like to discuss the Association\u2019s reasons for the benefit change, how it was implemented, the change\u2019s effect on retail pharmacies, and the extent to which PCS and Medco have met their contract requirements for all services they provide to the Association\u2019s federal health plan.", "To obtain information on the benefit change, we met with representatives of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Medco, PCS, National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), and American Pharmaceutical Association. Regarding the potential effect of the benefit change on retail pharmacies, we reviewed PCS data on recent changes in payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions dispensed to the Association\u2019s federal enrollees. To determine the extent to which Medco and PCS met their contract requirements, we reviewed the Association\u2019s contracts with the PBMs and analyzed reports submitted to the Association on their performance in meeting contract requirements.", "In summary, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association made the benefit change to try to control an average annual 21-percent increase in its federal health plan\u2019s drug costs and, as a result, hold down enrollees\u2019 premiums. At the inception of the change in early 1996, however, the volume of prescriptions the mail order pharmacy received was much greater and occurred more quickly than Medco or the Association had anticipated. During the last week of January, for example, prescriptions reached 233,000\u2014an amount about 66 percent greater than anticipated. As a result, Medco could not meet its customer-service performance measure for prompt dispensing and delivery of prescriptions to enrollees for several weeks during the benefit change\u2019s implementation. Medco, PCS, and the Association collaborated, however, to respond to this increased volume, and, by mid-March 1996, Medco was meeting its customer-service performance measure.", "Although the Association and Medco appear to have corrected the problems experienced in implementing the benefit change, NACDS and other critics of the change are concerned about its economic effect on retail pharmacies. Federal enrollees\u2019 shift to the Association\u2019s mail order program has been substantial. During the first 5 months of 1996, the total amount paid retail pharmacies for prescriptions dispensed to the enrollees affected by the benefit change decreased by about 36 percent, or about $95 million, from the amount paid during the same period in 1995.", "In addition to assessing Medco\u2019s performance related to the benefit change, the Association reviewed both PBMs\u2019 overall performance in meeting their contract requirements in 1995. According to the Association, the PBMs saved the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan about $505 million. The Association also indicated that the PBMs met most customer-service performance measures, such as dispensing prescriptions or answering customer calls within specific time frames."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["OPM contracts with almost 400 health plans, including fee-for-service plans and health maintenance organizations, to operate the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).

The Association\u2019s contract with PCS for retail prescription drug services began in 1993; its contract with Medco for mail order drug services began in 1987.", "In operating the retail drug program, PCS contracts with a network of pharmacies to provide the Association\u2019s federal employee health plan prescriptions at discounted prices. In 1996, this network included 44,751 pharmacies, about 60 percent of which were chain drug stores; the remaining 40 percent were independently owned. In operating the mail order program, Medco provides the plan prescriptions also at discounted prices.

Between 1988 and 1995, the Association\u2019s payments for the plan\u2019s prescription drugs increased at an average annual rate of about 21 percent, compared with an average annual rate of about 12 percent for total benefit payments. Moreover, prescription drug payments have constituted an increasingly greater share of total benefit payments, rising from about 13 percent in 1988 to about 23 percent in 1995 (see fig. 1). These payment increases appear to result mainly from increases in the number of prescriptions per enrollee and the price of prescriptions.", "Before the benefit change, the approximately 800,000 people insured under the Association\u2019s Standard Option Plan who also had Medicare part B coverage did not pay anything for prescription drugs purchased at network retail pharmacies or through the mail order program. These people must now pay 20 percent of the price of prescriptions purchased at network retail pharmacies. Copayments for retail prescriptions were already required of other enrollees and are similar to those required in several other federal employee health plans.

According to Medco officials, they estimated the size and timing of the increase by relying primarily on their own claims experience in managing pharmacy benefits for about 50 million people as well as data from a comparable benefit change made by Massachusetts Blue Cross and Blue Shield.", "The resulting Medco forecast estimated a gradual 64-percent growth in 1996 mail order prescriptions. Using this data, Medco planned to gradually increase its capacity to handle prescriptions from about 110,000 a week during the last quarter of 1995 to 180,000 a week during the last quarter of 1996. Medco also planned to handle occasional surges in demand of up to 13 percent more than the forecasted number and increase its telephone capacity to respond to greater demand for customer service. More immediate growth in mail order prescriptions could have been expected from this cost-conscious group of enrollees, however, according to our actuarial consultant\u2019s review of this forecast.", "OPM notified the Association that the benefit change had been approved in September 1995. Both OPM and Association officials contended that the change would promote more cost-effective use of the prescription drug benefit by encouraging enrollees to use the less expensive mail order program. According to the Association\u2019s actuarial analysis, which included Medco savings estimates related to its contract, the benefit change would save the plan about $193 million in 1996. OPM\u2019s actuarial analysis supported this estimated level of savings. Although these analyses did not include an audit of Medco\u2019s estimates or related supporting documentation, our actuarial consultant\u2019s review of the Association and OPM analyses indicated that the overall savings estimates were reasonable, though possibly understated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Demand for Mail Order Service Surpassed Expectations", "paragraphs": ["The number of prescriptions received by Medco quickly surpassed Medco and Association expectations.

By the week ending March 9, 1996, and continuing through the week ending April 6, 1996, the number of weekly prescriptions received ranged between 175,000 and 187,000. Enrollees with Medicare part B benefits accounted for most of the increase in prescriptions. About 9 percent of these enrollees\u2019 prescriptions were purchased through the mail order program in 1995, a percentage that increased to about 38 percent by February 1996. Figure 2 shows the increase in mail order prescriptions contrasted with the number of forecasted prescriptions.", "Medco\u2019s processing capacity could not absorb this rapid increase. The number of pharmacists was insufficient to handle prescription orders, and many enrollees did not get their prescriptions filled promptly. For example, although Medco\u2019s contract requires that it dispense or return 99 percent of the prescriptions it receives daily within 5 business days, Medco reported that this performance measure was met about 87 percent of the time in January 1996 and about 94 percent of the time in February 1996. In addition, many customer calls were delayed or went unanswered during January and February 1996. Medco\u2019s contract specifies that no more than 2 percent of customer calls a week receive a busy signal, known as call blockage. Although the call blockage rate averaged 1.8 percent a week for the 2-month period, about 8 percent, or 11,000 calls, received a busy signal during the week ending January 20, 1996.", "During the last week of January 1996, OPM informed Association officials of its disappointment with the customer service being provided to enrollees using the mail order program and indicated that corrective measures should be taken."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions Restored Service", "paragraphs": ["Medco responded to the unanticipated demand and associated service problems by moving quickly to increase processing capacity.

Medco also reassigned pharmacists who normally performed other Medco jobs to confirm phone and fax prescription orders. Medco officials also brought pharmacists and support personnel from pharmacies across the country to one Tampa pharmacy to increase processing capacity.", "OPM and the Association agreed that Medco would send medications by overnight mail to customers who would not otherwise receive their prescriptions within 5 business days. Between the weeks ending January 6, 1996, and April 27, 1996, Medco sent approximately 160,000 prescription packages by overnight mail at a cost of almost $1 million. In February 1996, OPM also indicated that the Association should arrange for mail order customers who needed delayed medications to get up to a 21-day supply from PCS network retail pharmacies without paying the 20-percent copayment. This ad hoc arrangement required PCS to respond quickly to the needs of the Association and over 5,000 enrollees who used this service. The copayments for over 10,000 retail prescriptions dispensed to these enrollees cost the plan approximately $291,000.", "Although Medco continued to use extra means to deliver prescriptions to enrollees through the last week of April 1996, Association data show that the mail order program began to meet performance expectations for turning around prescriptions within 5 days the week ending March 16, 1996.
