For fiscal year 2006, DOD reported obligations of approximately $8.5 billion for travel. Congress mandated that GAO assess the reasons why DOD is not fully in compliance with IPIA related to travel expenditures. In May 2007, GAO issued an initial report in response to this mandate. To further respond, GAO assessed (1) the completeness and accuracy of DOD's fiscal year 2006 IPIA travel disclosure in its performance and accountability report (PAR), and (2) DOD's planned efforts to improve and refine its processes for estimating and reporting on travel improper payments. To complete this work, GAO reviewed DOD's IPIA reporting, IPIA, Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) IPIA implementing guidance, and met with cognizant DOD officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In its fiscal year 2006 PAR, DOD reported an estimate of approximately $8 million in travel improper payments, reflecting about 1 percent of reported travel payments. While this estimate would indicate the program was not at risk of significant erroneous payments under OMB guidance, DOD's improper payment travel disclosure for fiscal year 2006 was incomplete. The DOD travel payment data used to assess the program's risk of significant improper payments only included payments processed by the Defense Travel System (DTS)--approximately 10 percent of the $8.5 billion of DOD travel obligations reported for fiscal year 2006. Further, DOD's 2006 PAR described a travel postpayment review process that may mislead readers to believe that the reported travel improper payment estimate represents more than DTS-processed travel. The travel improper payment estimate also excluded the largest user of DTS, the Army, which would likely have increased DOD's estimate by over $4 million. Finally, the statistical sampling methodology and process used by DOD to estimate DTS improper payments as reported for fiscal year 2006 had several weaknesses and did not result in statistically valid estimates of travel improper payments. DOD is taking steps to more fully assess and report on its travel program for improper payments for future IPIA reporting. DOD's planned assessment is to be based on an annual Improper Payments Survey conducted by the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller). However, GAO's review identified several weaknesses with the survey and reported results, including limited guidance on how to estimate travel improper payments and a lack of oversight and review over implementation of the survey and its results. As shown in the figure below, there were substantial discrepancies among the travel populations reported in the PAR, improper payment survey, and fiscal year 2006 travel obligations. The exclusion of such a significant portion of travel expenditures in the survey decreases its effectiveness as an improper payments assessment tool.

The survey also identified $20 million in  travel improper payments, a $12 million increase from the $8 million  reported in DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2006 PAR. Eight entities, other than DFAS,  reported information in the fiscal year 2006 IPIA survey for travel pay. A  summary of the improper payment survey results for travel is shown in  table 2.", "Going forward, considering the complexity of DOD, extent of travel  throughout the department, and information reported in the survey of  fiscal year 2006 payments, the guidance issued by the Office of the  Comptroller does not provide adequate information to allow components  to properly report improper payment information needed for a useful  assessment. Our internal control standards identify information and  communications as one of the five standards for internal control. This  standard states that information should be communicated to those within  the entity in a form that enables them to carry out their responsibilities.  The guidance issued by the Office of the Comptroller to DOD components  does not provide adequate guidance specific to DOD to allow for  components to prepare reliable estimates of improper payments. For  example, while OMB guidance requires that agencies obtain a statistically  valid estimate of the annual amount of improper payments in a program,  Office of the Comptroller guidance does not adequately address sampling  methodologies to employ, or provide contact information on how to seek  assistance with this matter. Further, the guidance does not offer detailed  information on the steps needed to adequately implement IPIA at DOD or  examples of improper payments relevant to DOD.", "In addition, the guidance does not provide sufficient procedures on how to  identify or assess risk factors to assist DOD components in identifying  programs and activities vulnerable to improper payments, such as  assessments of internal control, audit report findings, and human capital  risks related to staff turnover, training, or experience. Assessing the effect  of risk conditions identified during the risk assessment plays a major role  in effectively determining the overall risk level of an agency\u2019s operations.  Some risk conditions may affect a program or activity to a greater or lesser  degree. Likewise, not all risk conditions may be relevant to each program  or activity. This type of risk identification and assessment is consistent  with our previous recommendation that OMB establish risk factors in its  guidance for agencies to consider, and is also consistent with our  standards of internal control and executive guide on strategies to manage  improper payments, which provides a framework for conducting a  comprehensive risk assessment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improper Payment Estimate Process for Non-DTS Travel Is Decentralized", "paragraphs": ["The process each DOD component uses to estimate its travel improper  payments and report to the Office of the Comptroller varies throughout  the department and is largely decentralized. Further complicating the  assessment for travel improper payments are the numerous systems used  to process travel throughout the department. For survey reporting, DFAS  (Indianapolis) is responsible for reporting all travel processed through  DTS and certain payments processed through IATS for Army and some  other defense agencies. The determination of all other travel pay and  associated improper payments is the responsibility of the component that  computed the entitlement. The Office of the Comptroller relies on each  component to determine and report this information. In our review of the  fiscal year 2006 Improper Payments Survey, we noted that the survey  results were not always statistically valid and in some cases appear  unreasonable. Improved guidance by the Office of the Comptroller will be  necessary to assure that survey information is reliable and complete for  IPIA reporting.", "DFAS is responsible for estimating and reporting travel improper  payments for travel processed for the Army by the IATS system. In fiscal  year 2006, DFAS (Indianapolis) did not conduct a statistically valid sample  and review of travel payments processed through IATS. Instead, officials  from DFAS performed limited reviews of IATS vouchers paid to determine  if any such payments were improper. For example, DFAS reviewed  payments to determine if payments for the same travel activity had been  paid in both DTS and IATS\u2014essentially a duplicate payment review. This  review found $1.5 million in improper payments in fiscal year 2006, which  was reported in the survey, as shown previously in table 2. Such DFAS  IATS reviews cannot be used to estimate the value of improper payments  to the entire IATS population.", "The Air Force reports improper payment information on travel processed  through the Reserve Travel System. For fiscal year 2005, the Air Force  sought the guidance of the Air Force Audit Agency to determine if the Air  Force had developed and used an effective methodology to estimate and  report the dollar amount of improper travel payments processed through  the Reserve Travel System. The Air Force Audit Agency reported that the  methodology used by the Air Force to estimate Reserve Travel System  improper payments did not meet IPIA requirements. As part of the audit,  the Air Force Audit Agency developed and provided the Air Force with a  statistically valid sampling methodology for centralized reviews that it  reported would meet IPIA reporting requirements. The Air Force told us  that it now follows the sampling methodology developed by the Air Force  Audit Agency. As shown in table 2, utilizing this methodology, the Air  Force estimated nearly $4.6 million in travel improper payments were  processed in fiscal year 2006 by the Reserve Travel System\u2014an improper  payment estimate of approximately 4.5 percent of the $101 million in  payments processed by the Reserve Travel System during this period.  However, after reporting its estimated results in the survey for fiscal year  2006 payments, the Air Force revised the results of its IPIA review. In a  memo dated August 8, 2007, the Air Force disclosed an underestimation of  total Reserve Travel System payments, revising the reported amount to  $1.5 billion, instead of the $101 million originally reported. Based on a  centralized review, the Air Force projected its improper payments to be  $13.6 million\u2014an error rate of 0.9 percent.", "The Army also has a decentralized review process for non-DTS travel  reimbursements for improper payments. As described above, DFAS  (Indianapolis) is responsible for identifying and reporting Army IATS  payments calculated and disbursed by DFAS. However, the Army also  reported travel improper payments for three other programs or activities  in the fiscal year 2006 improper payments survey: Army--Korea;           Army--Europe; and the Army Corps of Engineers.", "Staff responsible for the improper payment review for the Korea command  explained the process they follow to estimate and report improper  payments, which is completed as part of the internal control process and  includes an annual inspection. In fiscal year 2006, this review included a  reinspection of every voucher for a 1-month period. This review  discovered few improper payments. The future plans for improper  payment reviews were unknown when we spoke to the Army-Korea staff  due to ongoing DTS implementation there. In the fiscal year 2006 survey,  Army--Korea reported no improper payments and over $12.6 million in  travel payments.", "The improper payment review for Army--Europe is even more  decentralized, with finance officers throughout the region preparing  improper payment information independently. From our discussion with  Army--Europe staff, there is no formal process for reviewing and reporting  improper payment information throughout the region beyond the IPIA  guidance provided by the Office of the Comptroller. In the fiscal year 2006  survey, Army--Europe reported no improper payments and over               $3.9 million in payments.", "During fiscal year 2006, the Army Corps of Engineers processed all of its  travel using IATS. The Army Corps of Engineers finance center is  responsible for compiling and reporting travel improper payments.  Officials from the Army Corps of Engineers finance center reported that  all TDY and PCS vouchers greater than or equal to $2,500 were subject to  postaudit review, and a sample of every 366th TDY voucher less than  $2,500 was also reviewed by finance center staff. The sampling plan was  designed to have a 95 percent confidence level plus or minus 2 percent. A  DFAS statistician attested to the validity of the sampling methodology  used by the Army Corps of Engineers.

These weaknesses include  a survey that does not consider the entire population of travel payments  for fiscal year 2006 and information reported that appears unreliable.  Without improved oversight by Office of the Comptroller, the department\u2019s  future reporting under IPIA could be compromised.", "Our internal control standards include monitoring as one of the five  standards for internal control. The standards provide that internal control  should generally be designed to assure that ongoing monitoring occurs in  the course of normal operations and includes regular management and  supervisory activities, comparisons, and reconciliations. During our  review of the fiscal year 2006 improper payments survey, we noted several  weaknesses that indicate a lack of appropriate monitoring or oversight by  the Office of the Comptroller. The most notable weakness we found in the  survey is the population of travel payments from which improper  payments were estimated. As shown in figure 2, in fiscal year 2006,         $8.5 billion was obligated for travel by DOD as reported in the DOD budget  for fiscal year 2008. The improper payments survey for this same time  period reported a total travel expenditure population of $3.4 billion\u2014a  difference of $5.1 billion. The survey results were more complete than the  PAR reporting, which reported on approximately $824 million in travel  payments. The exclusion of such a significant portion of travel payments  in the survey decreases its effectiveness as an improper payments  assessment tool and indicates inadequate monitoring of the survey process  by the Office of the Comptroller. A strong internal control environment,  particularly monitoring, should have included regular reconciliations and  comparisons that would have brought this discrepancy to management\u2019s  attention in a timely manner.", "The Office of the Comptroller did not clearly define DOD\u2019s travel  population before collecting the improper payment information for its  fiscal year 2006 improper payment survey. Because DOD did not clearly  define the full population of travel payments, the full extent of travel  improper payments at the department is unknown. Further, until DOD  establishes guidance with sufficiently detailed procedures on how to  define its population for travel IPIA reporting, future annual reporting is  unlikely to be comparable across fiscal years, which could prevent users  of IPIA information from determining progress made in reducing improper  payments.", "When we met with Office of the Comptroller officials in March 2007, we  discussed the importance of a complete travel payment population. At that  time, Office of the Comptroller officials said they were not aware that the  travel payment population was a potential problem. However, after  discussion they agreed to reconcile the difference between the budget  obligation amounts ($8.5 billion) and the payment amounts reported in the  fiscal year 2006 improper payments survey ($3.4 billion). In September  2007, the Office of the Comptroller provided reconciliation information for  approximately $1.9 billion in travel payments and described the following  factors that may have contributed to the remaining variance:    classified program expenditures that are not included in IPIA reporting,  timing differences between obligations and expenditures, and  reviews and reporting based on audit month rather than actual reporting  period (e.g., audit and reporting year may run from August through July  while the fiscal year is October through September).", "As reported in the PAR, DOD travel improper payments appear immaterial  and the fiscal year 2006 reported travel payment population was  substantially less than other programs reported on by DOD. While this  might decrease the focus given to the travel program, we do not consider  the information reliable and if, for example, the total population of         $8.5 billion was reported on, with an improper error rate of 1 percent as  estimated by DOD, travel improper payments would be approximately    $85 million. This is a substantial amount of improper payments and would  exceed the improper payment estimates for all but two programs as  reported in fiscal year 2006\u2014military health benefits and commercial pay.", "In addition to the incomplete travel payment population, we noted  weaknesses in the oversight and review of some data reported in the  improper payments survey. Four program/activities (Marine Corp Travel  Pay (IATS), Army\u2013Korea, Army\u2013Europe, and the Defense Security Service  PCS travel) reported no improper payments on $17 million in associated  travel payments. We did not review vouchers to determine if any improper  payments existed in this population but based on the description of the  improper payments review we obtained from Army\u2013Korea and            Army--Europe, we do not believe the review process used provided a  reliable basis for IPIA reporting for those components. For example,  Army\u2013Korea\u2019s review only considered a review of payments during a         1-month period, instead of a statistically valid sample of payments for the  fiscal year. Additionally, one entity reporting under Army\u2013Europe reported  that because they preaudit their travel vouchers they have very few  improper payments. Another official told us that Army\u2013Europe does little  to identify and report travel improper payments. Army\u2013Europe staff told  us they were not trained in the proper method for reporting improper  payment information. While it is possible there may not be any improper  payments in a population, the review process was inadequate to provide a  basis for reporting no improper payments on $17 million in travel  payments. When we discussed these concerns, Office of the Comptroller  staff informed us that they are doing further analysis to determine the  accuracy and completeness of the information. Further, the staff told us  that they use variance analysis to determine if the information submitted is  reasonable based on previously reported information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Office of the Comptroller Taking Steps to Improve Reporting of Travel Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["While there are serious challenges facing the Office of the Comptroller in  the assessment and reporting of travel improper payments, the office is  taking steps to improve its oversight of the IPIA estimating and reporting  process.

This is not a simple task and will not be easily  accomplished, particularly in light of the decentralized nature of DOD\u2019s  travel program. For example, although DTS is intended to centralize travel  processes at DOD, that goal has not yet been achieved, and an estimated  90 percent of DOD\u2019s travel payments for fiscal year 2006 were computed  outside of DTS. Improved guidance and oversight by the Office of the  Comptroller will be key to ensuring that complete and reliable estimates of  improper payments are reported. With the ongoing imbalance between  revenues and outlays across the federal government, and the Congress\u2019s  and the American public\u2019s increasing demands for accountability over  taxpayer funds, improving DOD\u2019s ability to identify, reduce, and recover  travel improper payments is even more critical."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve the usefulness and completeness of IPIA reporting for  DOD\u2019s travel program, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the DOD Comptroller to take the following four actions:    Establish and implement policies and procedures to reliably identify the  complete population of DOD travel payments.", "Establish and implement policies and procedures to report a valid  improper payment estimate for the population.", "Develop and implement guidance for the preparation of improper payment  estimates, to include (1) how to compute a statistically valid estimate of  improper payments, and (2) the consideration of risk factors associated  with vulnerability to improper payments.", "Establish and implement policies and procedures specifying actions to  oversee the data collection process for travel improper payments to be  included in the annual PAR, including, at a minimum: (1) periodic reviews  of processes used by components to prepare improper payment estimates,  and (2) reviews of information reported in the improper payment survey to  assure that the population being reported is complete, and the improper  payment estimate data reported are reliable and complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report, which are  reprinted in appendix II.

Although it concurred  with the intent of our recommendation, DOD stated that OMB\u2019s Circular  No. A-123, Appendix C, provided guidance for statistical sampling and for  identifying risk factors and that the decentralized nature of the DOD  components and the varying systems used for travel pay computations  make a detailed universal approach impractical. We agree that DOD is a  decentralized organization, with a wide breadth of activities and  components. Indeed, this is the primary reason for our recommendation  that DOD develop and implement additional guidance for use by its  components.
