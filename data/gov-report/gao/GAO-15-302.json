For example, most states have a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) mandating that retail service providers obtain a specific amount of the electricity they sell from renewable energy sources, which creates additional demand for renewable energy. In addition, most states supported new renewable and traditional projects through regulatory policies that set electricity prices, which allowed utilities to recover the costs of building new projects or purchasing electricity from them.", "Federal financial supports aided the development of new projects, but limited data hinder an understanding of the effectiveness of tax expenditures. From fiscal year 2004 through 2013, programs at the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Energy (DOE), and the Treasury (Treasury) provided supports including outlays, loan programs, and tax expenditures. For example, one Treasury program provided payments in lieu of tax credits and accounted for almost all of the $16.8 billion in outlays that supported 29,000 megawatts (MW) of new renewable generating capacity. Tax expenditures accounted for an estimated $13.7 billion in forgone revenue to the federal government for renewable projects and $1.4 billion for traditional projects. The two largest tax expenditures GAO examined\u2014the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Production Tax Credit (PTC)\u2014supported renewable projects and accounted for $11.5 billion in forgone revenue. However, the total generating capacity they supported is unknown because the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is not required to collect project-level data from all taxpayers claiming the ITC or report the data it does collect, nor is it required to collect project-level data for the PTC. IRS officials stated that IRS is unlikely to collect additional data on these tax credits unless it is directed to do so. Since 1994, GAO has encouraged greater scrutiny of tax expenditures, including data collection. Without project-level data on the ITC and PTC, Congress cannot evaluate their effectiveness as it considers whether to reauthorize or extend them.", "Developers combined state and federal supports to finance renewable projects, and reducing these supports would likely reduce development of such projects. Demand created by state RPSs allowed developers of renewable projects to obtain power purchase agreements (PPA)\u2014long-term contracts to sell power at specific prices. Federal supports, in turn, lowered developers' costs to build renewable projects, which allowed them to offer lower PPA prices than they otherwise could have. According to most stakeholders, these lower prices were then passed on to retail customers. Overall, if the level of support is reduced, fewer projects would likely be built. For example, GAO's modeling suggests that reducing the ITC or eliminating the PTC would likely reduce the number of renewable projects built because developers' returns would decline unless PPA prices increased to compensate for the reduction in federal support. The extent to which development would decrease depends on how states respond to reduced federal support and the associated increase in prices. For example, many states limit the amount retail prices could increase, limiting PPA price increases, which could reduce development."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider directing IRS to (1) collect and report project-level data from all taxpayers who claim the ITC and (2) collect and report similar data for taxpayers who claim the PTC.", "DOE, Treasury, and USDA did not provide formal comments in response to a draft of this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The economic productivity and high standard of living of the United States  depend, in part, on the availability of affordable electricity to power  homes, businesses, and industries.

When making direct loans,  the federal government disburses funds to nonfederal borrowers  under contracts requiring the repayment of such funds either with or  without interest. When making loan guarantees, the federal  government provides a guarantee, insurance, or other pledge  regarding the payment of all or a part of the principal or interest on  any debt obligation of a nonfederal borrower to a lender.

Unlike the ITC and PTC, which have expiration dates and have been  subject to congressional review as part of efforts to expand, extend, or  reauthorize them, accelerated depreciation for energy property\u2014like  other accelerated depreciation provisions\u2014does not have a specific  expiration date and, as such, is not subject to periodic review by  Congress.", "Credit for Investment in Clean Coal Facilities. This credit for traditional  fuel sources is estimated to have accounted for $1.4 billion in forgone  revenue to support the development of clean coal projects. The credit  provides up to 30 percent of qualified investments in clean coal  facilities greater than 400 MW in size. Unlike the ITC, PTC, and  accelerated depreciation for renewable energy property\u2014for which all  eligible taxpayers may claim the tax expenditure\u2014the Credit for  Investment in Clean Coal Facilities is subject to a specified amount  authorized by Congress. As such, developers must submit an  application that includes a description of the project, the project\u2019s  financing structure, and the proposed technology to apply for the  credit. According to IRS officials, DOE\u2019s NREL reviewed the  applications to determine whether the projects met the required  technical criteria, and then made recommendations to IRS about  whether the projects should receive an allocation of the tax credit.  According to IRS officials, 12 awards have been made for projects  included in our scope, and 4 of those projects had been placed in  service as of September 2014. Additionally, according to the officials,  further allocations of the credit are available. IRS announced a 2015  reallocation round on March 9, 2015 and the agency plans to send  acceptance letters by April 30, 2015.", "Projects that received support through federal tax expenditures may also  have received support through outlay or loan programs. See appendixes  VI and VII for program descriptions and details on estimates of forgone  revenue for all federal tax expenditures that supported the development  of utility-scale electricity generation projects.", "While some project-level data are collected for the projects supported  through outlays, loan programs, and the Credit for Investment in Clean  Coal Facilities, basic information such as projects supported or MW of  generating capacity added is not collected or available about the ITC and  PTC. The ITC and PTC\u2014which accounted for an estimated $11.5 billion  in forgone revenue from 2004 to 2013\u2014are the two largest tax  expenditures supporting these projects and in the past 5 years, the  estimated forgone revenues from them have more than tripled from $870  million to $2.8 billion. Key information is not available because the IRS  does not collect certain project-level data, such as the total generating  capacity added. Specifically,", "For the ITC, the IRS requires all developers to report the total amount  of the credit they are claiming for all eligible projects aggregated as a  single line item; therefore, the IRS does not know the total number of  projects for which an individual developer is claiming the credit.  Developers who were eligible for the PTC but instead elected to claim  the ITC must also submit supporting documentation that includes  project-level data, such as the generating capacity and technology of  each specific facility for which they are claiming the credit; however,  the IRS does not require such project-level information from  developers eligible only for the ITC. Consistent with the Internal  Revenue Code, in general, the IRS is not allowed to make individual  taxpayer information available for analysis, but IRS can and does  make available certain aggregated data. However, IRS does not make  available the project-level data it collects for the ITC.", "For the PTC, as with the ITC, the IRS requires all developers to report  the total amount of the credit they are claiming for all eligible projects  aggregated by technology as a single line item; therefore, the IRS  does not know the total number of projects for which an individual  developer is claiming the PTC. Unlike the ITC, the IRS requires  developers to report the technology type (e.g. wind, geothermal, solar)  for which they are claiming the PTC. IRS does not require developers  to submit any project-level data, such as generating capacity, when  they claim the PTC.", "The IRS is not required to collect or evaluate data other than those which  are required for administration of the tax code unless it is legislatively  mandated to collect additional information. IRS officials stated that, given  a number of factors, IRS is unlikely to collect additional information on  these tax expenditures without being directed to do so by Congress. IRS  has not evaluated the costs of collecting these data. As we have  previously found, collecting additional data to identify users and specific  properties would require changes in IRS forms and information  processing procedures. To some extent, the increasing number of  taxpayers filing electronically could make it easier for IRS to collect  additional data without expensive transcription costs. In considering  additional data requirements, it is important that Congress weigh the need  for more information with IRS\u2019s other priorities because such  requirements likely would increase, to some degree, the administrative  costs for IRS and the compliance burden on taxpayers. If policymakers  conclude that additional data would facilitate examining a particular tax  expenditure, additional considerations on what data are needed, who  should provide the data, who should collect the data, how to collect the  data, what it would cost to collect the data, and whether the benefits of  collecting additional data warrant the cost of doing so would be important.", "Nonetheless, since 1994, we have encouraged greater scrutiny of tax  expenditures to help policymakers make more informed decisions about  using such mechanisms as a means of supporting policies. For example,  since 1994, we have found that substantial revenues are forgone through  tax expenditures, yet policymakers have had few opportunities to make  explicit comparisons or evaluate trade-offs between tax expenditures and  federal spending programs. Based on these and other findings, we  recommended that Congress explore opportunities to exercise more  scrutiny over indirect spending through tax expenditures, and Congress  took action by subjecting certain tax expenditures to closer examination.  In addition, in 2005, we found that tax expenditures may not always be  efficient, effective, or equitable and, consequently, we concluded that  information on tax expenditures could help policymakers make more  informed decisions as they adapt current policies in light of fiscal  challenges and other overarching trends. We also concluded that  reviews of tax expenditures could help establish whether these programs  are relevant to today\u2019s needs and, if so, how well tax expenditures have  worked to achieve specific objectives and whether the benefits from  particular tax expenditures are greater than their costs.", "We have also previously concluded that limited data about specific tax  expenditures can hinder analysis of their effectiveness. For example, in  2008, we determined that the data the IRS collected were insufficient for  examining efforts to use a tax expenditure to encourage economic  development on Indian reservations. As a result, we suggested that  Congress consider requiring IRS to collect additional information about  the tax expenditure. Similarly, in examining a broad range of tax  expenditures in 2013, we concluded that it was becoming more pressing  to determine whether tax expenditures were achieving specific  objectives.", "Additionally, the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization  Act of 2010 established a framework for providing a more crosscutting  and integrated approach to focusing on results and improving government  performance. This act makes clear that tax expenditures are to be  included in identifying the range of federal agencies and activities that  contribute to crosscutting goals, and guidance from the Office of  Management and Budget directs agencies to do so for their agency  priority goals. Such information can be used to inform congressional  decisions about authorizing or reauthorizing provisions in the tax code.", "In requesting this report, Congress asked us to evaluate federal supports  for the development of utility-scale electricity generation projects, for  example, by providing information about how many projects were built,  the technologies supported, and the amount of generating capacity  added. The absence of project-level data for the ITC and PTC\u2014such as  is available for projects that took Treasury\u2019s payments in lieu of these tax  credits\u2014precluded us from examining and providing this information.  Without it, Congress and others do not have basic information about what  has been supported, including how many projects used these tax  expenditures or how much generating capacity was added.

Similar to a home mortgage, debt is incurred  when a developer borrows funds with  prescribed repayment terms\u2014such as an  interest rate and a specified number of  payments. The lender has no ownership in the  property but may be able to take over the  property if the borrower does not make  payments as agreed. In addition, in the event  of a bankruptcy or other loan default, the  lender typically has the first right to any  assets. Equity is invested funds that give the  investor an ownership interest in the  operations and assets of a business and a  right to a portion of any income remaining  after payment of operating costs and  payments on debt. The investor is not entitled  to repayment if the project fails. Because  investors consider debt to be less risky than  equity, it is typically the cheaper form of  private financing. However, lenders typically  will not lend the total costs of a project and  they often place limits on the amount of  money they will lend by limiting the amount of  the payment on the loan to a specified  percentage of the expected income of the  project.", "Developers combined state and federal supports to finance renewable  projects. As previously noted, state supports in the form of RPSs and  RPGs mandated that retail service providers obtain a certain percentage  or amount of the electricity they sell from renewable sources. These  supports created additional demand for electricity from renewable  sources. Retail service providers comply with this requirement by either  generating their own electricity from renewable sources or by purchasing  this electricity from a third party, such as an independent power producer.  To purchase renewable electricity, retail service providers often issue  solicitations seeking bids for PPAs\u2014long-term contracts in which the  retail service provider agrees to purchase power and which provides the  developer with an expectation of stable revenue. In response to these  solicitations, developers bid for these PPAs. Once bids are selected and  developers are awarded PPAs, developers generally then attempt to  secure debt and equity to finance their projects through private markets.  In seeking project financing, developers combine the value of the  revenues guaranteed in their PPAs and the value of the federal supports  to secure favorable financing terms.", "Tax Equity Partnerships   In several cases, developers of renewable  projects had to enter into complex financial  partnerships\u2014tax equity partnerships\u2014to use  certain tax expenditures. For example, the  use of tax expenditures like the Investment  Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit required  developers\u2019 tax liability to equal or exceed the  value of the tax expenditure. Developers with  substantial corporate profits generally had  enough tax liability to be able to directly use  these tax expenditures. However, developers  with lower tax liability had to enter into  arrangements known as tax equity  partnerships with third parties\u2014usually large  financial institutions, such as investment  banks\u2014that had sufficient tax liability in order  to use tax expenditures. Under these  partnerships, the third party typically provided  equity for the project in exchange for the right  to use nearly all of the tax benefits and  receive a share of the project revenues.  According to stakeholders, the partnerships  typically incurred legal, administrative, and  other transaction costs that reduced the value  of tax expenditures to the developers\u2019 projects  by 10 to 30 percent. Nonetheless, some  stakeholders reported that tax equity  partnerships were critical for projects to move  forward.", "Federal supports reduced the price of renewable electricity for retail  customers by reducing the cost to the developers to build projects in two  key ways. First, some federal loan programs reduced the cost of capital\u2014 i.e., the funds necessary to build the projects. For example, some  stakeholders said USDA loan programs offered lower interest rates than  were available through the capital markets, which lowered the overall cost  of borrowing. Second, federal tax expenditures and payments allowed  developers to recover some of their costs. For example, the ITC allowed  developers to recover up to 30 percent of eligible project costs for solar  and other qualifying renewable energy facilities by reducing the amount of  taxes they owed. However, many stakeholders noted that, in some cases,  developers needed to enter into complex financial partnerships\u2014tax  equity partnerships\u2014to utilize federal tax expenditures, which reduced  the value of the federal support to the developer. According to several  stakeholders, the amount that developers can bid for a PPA depends on  how much federal support the project expects to receive; therefore, these  supports allowed developers to offer lower prices in their PPAs than they  otherwise could have. These lower prices were then passed on to retail  customers. In this way, these supports can be thought of as reducing the  price of electricity that retail customers pay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing State or Federal Supports Would Likely Reduce the Development of Renewable Projects", "paragraphs": ["Reducing state or federal supports would likely reduce the development  of renewable projects. To understand the effects of changes to federal tax  expenditures, we modeled hypothetical utility-scale solar photovoltaic and  wind projects and found that reducing or eliminating the ITC or PTC  would likely reduce the number of renewable projects built because either  developers\u2019 returns would decline or PPA prices would increase. For our  analysis, we held investor rates of return\u2014which stakeholders typically  refer to as the internal rate of return\u2014constant. We modeled the two  projects with variations in the levels of the ITC\u2014at 10 and 30 percent\u2014 and PTC\u2014with no PTC and with the PTC at $0.023 per kilowatt-hour.", "Our modeling suggests that reducing or eliminating federal financial  supports could result in substantially reduced returns for developers,  which could reduce the number of new renewable utility-scale electricity  generation projects built. For example, in the case of the solar project,  we found that with a reduced ITC and constant PPA prices, the  developer\u2019s returns could decrease by as much as 76 percent (see table  2). Likewise, for the wind project, we found that without the PTC, the  developer\u2019s returns could decrease by 68 to 109 percent\u2014in other words,  in the extreme case, the developer would lose money by developing the  project. Our modeling results are consistent with the effects of past  expirations of the PTC. As we have previously found, in the years  following the PTC\u2019s expiration, new additions of wind capacity fell  dramatically.", "Alternatively, we found that if we held the developer\u2019s returns constant, a  reduction or elimination of federal supports could mean that, for future  projects to remain viable, electricity prices in PPAs would have to  increase. Specifically, for the solar project with the lower ITC, we found  that the electricity prices in PPAs would need to increase by 20 to 27  percent if developers were to maintain their returns. For wind projects  without the PTC, we found that electricity prices would need to increase  by 32 to 62 percent if developers were to maintain their returns (see table  3).", "Placed in a broader context, because PPA prices are determined through  negotiations between developers and retail service providers, the  willingness of these providers and state regulators to agree to higher  prices will likely constrain the ability of developers to maintain their  returns. If expected returns from renewable energy projects are reduced  past a certain point, developers may seek alternative investments, either  in the energy sector or elsewhere. Collectively, the constraints faced by  developers with reduced or eliminated federal supports would likely lead  to a reduction in the level of investment in new renewable utility-scale  electricity generation projects.", "The extent to which development of renewable projects would decrease  depends on, among other factors, how states respond to the effects of  reduced federal supports. Specifically, reducing federal supports would  reduce developers\u2019 returns unless PPA prices increased to compensate  for the reduction in federal support. The amount PPA prices could  increase may be constrained by how close states are to completing their  RPSs. Four of the 24 state regulatory commissions that responded to our  survey question about progress made by investor-owned utilities toward  completing their RPSs reported that they have either met or exceeded  their RPSs (see fig. 4). In these states, if PPA prices were to increase  beyond the prices available for other sources of electricity, renewable  development would likely decline because investor-owned utilities would  not be required to purchase the more expensive renewable electricity.  However, assuming that RPSs remain the same in the 20 states that  reported not having met their RPSs, investor-owned utilities will need to  obtain additional renewable capacity even if the price to do so increases.", "The amount PPA prices could increase may also be constrained by state  cost-containment mechanisms. Cost-containment mechanisms are  sometimes included in state RPS legislation to limit costs associated with  RPS compliance. For example, some RPSs allow state regulatory  commissions to freeze or delay RPS requirements if purchasing  additional renewable energy forces retail prices to exceed a threshold  deemed excessive. Of the 27 states that reported having an RPS in our  survey, 18 reported having cost-containment mechanisms in place, and 8  reported having no such mechanism. Looking forward, however, some  states may revise or implement cost-containment mechanisms if prices of  renewable electricity increase. Some stakeholders noted that, in the  absence of federal supports, developers would continue to build  renewable projects to meet existing RPSs even if doing so increased  electricity prices for retail customers, unless states had existing cost- containment mechanisms or implemented new ones."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has demonstrated a commitment to supporting  the development of utility-scale electricity generation projects through a  variety of federal programs.

We then used the \u201csnowball sampling\u201d technique and selected  stakeholders to interview who had experience or knowledge related to our  objectives. We conducted semistructured interviews with nearly 50  stakeholders including project developers and owners; attorneys and  experts who specialize in project finance; industry trade associations;  nongovernmental organizations; banks that provide and arrange equity  and debt financing; investor-owned utilities, municipally-owned utilities,  and electric cooperatives; state energy agencies; and an independent  system operator.

Using our previous reports, we compiled a  list of federal supports for these projects, and during our interviews with  stakeholders we asked which of the supports were key to the  development of projects. The federal programs described in this report  reflect those supports that stakeholders considered key for the  development of new utility-scale electricity generation projects. We also  collected and analyzed agency data on outlays, loan programs, and tax  expenditures that supported these projects from fiscal year 2004 through  2013 as follows:", "Outlays: We collected and analyzed data on outlays, projects and  generating capacity added from USDA, DOE, and Treasury.

Only a subset of the loans in USDA\u2019s portfolio is  within our scope, therefore, our estimates will not match the  estimates found in the fiscal year 2014 Federal Credit Supplement  to the Budget of the U.S. Government. Because USDA does not  calculate estimates on a loan-by-loan basis but does so on a  cohort basis, applying a cohort\u2019s subsidy factor to only those loans  included in our scope represents an estimate of the expected cost  to the government.

From this review, we  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our report and agency officials concurred with our results.", "Tax expenditures: We compiled estimates of forgone revenue to the  government from energy-related tax expenditures calculated by  Treasury and the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to  estimate the cost to the government of supporting these projects. Both  Treasury and JCT estimate the revenue loss associated with each tax  provision they have identified as a tax expenditure. Treasury\u2019s list is  included in the President\u2019s annual budget submission; JCT issues  annual tax expenditure estimates as a stand-alone product. Both  organizations calculate a tax expenditure as the difference between  tax liability under current law and what the tax liability would be if the  provision were eliminated and the item were treated as it would be  under a \u201cnormal\u201d income tax. Revenue loss estimates do not  incorporate any behavioral responses and thus do not reflect the  exact amount of revenue that would be gained if a specific tax  expenditure were repealed. In general, the tax expenditure lists that  Treasury and JCT publish are similar, although these lists differ  somewhat in the number of tax expenditures reported and the  estimated revenue losses for particular expenditures. Specifically, we  used the most recent tax expenditure estimates for fiscal years 2004  to 2013 developed by Treasury and reported by Office of  Management and Budget in the Budget of the U.S. Government for  fiscal years 2006 to 2015. Similarly, we used the most recent tax  expenditures estimates developed by JCT and reported in their  Estimates of Federal Tax Expenditures reports for fiscal years 2004 to  2012. For fiscal year 2013 data, we used estimates from the 2012  JCT report, which reflect the provisions in federal tax law enacted  through January 2, 2013. Although we present the tax expenditure  estimates in aggregate, and the sums are reliable as a gauge of  general magnitude, they do not take into account interactions between  individual provisions.

These tools can provide information to participants in the  renewable energy sector, including policy analysts and developers of  renewable energy projects. SAM provides the flexibility to allow the user  to input either highly detailed configurations of equipment and financing or  generalized assumptions. For example, a solar flat-plate photovoltaic  project could be specified in terms of individual solar panel and inverter  modules installed with very specific details as to tilt and ability to track the  sun, and with component-by-component acquisition and installation costs.  Alternatively, the project can be described in a less specific manner, with  an aggregate installation cost per watt.", "SAM is composed of the following two modules:", "Performance module: SAM can be used to analyze many aspects of  the expected energy performance of large, utility-scale solar and wind  projects. SAM also allows users to compare differences in how  specific equipment may perform and can estimate equipment  conversion efficiencies for specific modules of solar panels, wind  turbines, and other equipment that can be used to develop estimates  of electricity production. SAM also includes data on typical, as well as  historical weather patterns for a wide range of locations.", "Financial module: In SAM\u2019s financial module, the user specifies  values for cost and other financial characteristics, including the value  of federal tax credits and accelerated depreciation for renewable  energy property. The financial module begins with energy inputs  automatically transferred from the performance module\u2014specifically,  the estimated amount of annual electricity generated. The financial  module assumes that the project earns its revenues from sales of this  electricity to an electric utility through a contract referred to as a power  purchase agreement (PPA). The financial module generates a cash  flow analysis over the life of the project given the specification of  revenues, costs, and information about the nature of the investment in  the project. The financial module is flexible in that different investment  structures can be examined. Specifically, the project finance  structures that can be analyzed in SAM include two partnership flip  structures\u2014a structure in which the vast majority of project cash and  tax benefits and liabilities go to one partner until certain financial  conditions are met, at which point they flip so that the other partner  receives the vast majority of cash and tax responsibilities\u2014 and a  structure in which the developer owns the project\u2014referred to as the  single owner structure. The user must specify other financial  parameters, including desired rates of return for the investors\u2014 specifically after-tax internal rates of return (IRR)\u2014project borrowing  costs, and how project revenues and tax expenditures will be  allocated among partners in the two partnership structures.", "SAM\u2019s ability to analyze different investment structures is important. As  noted elsewhere in this report, some developers have to enter into  complex financial partnerships\u2014tax equity partnerships\u2014with third party  entities in order for the project to make use of these tax benefits. For this  analysis, we examined two such partnerships as follows:", "All equity partnership flip: In the all equity partnership flip structure,  the developer and tax equity partner create a special-purpose entity,  formed exclusively to build and operate the project, which is funded  entirely by the equity contributions from both partners. The tax equity  partner provides the majority of funding for the project in return for  nearly all project revenues and tax expenditures (as well as any tax  liabilities) generated by the project for a specified amount of time from  the beginning of the project. This period of time, which can vary by  project, depends on the tax equity partner\u2019s desired rate of return and  rules governing the tax expenditures used by the project. Once the tax  equity partner realizes its required rate of return, the allocation of  project proceeds \u201cflips\u201d so that the developer begins receiving the vast  majority of project revenues and tax liabilities.", "Leveraged partnership flip: The leveraged partnership flip is similar to  the all equity flip, but substitutes some or all of the project developer\u2019s  equity investment with borrowed funds, referred to as debt. Project  revenues and tax expenditures are still shared between the partners  in the same manner as in the all equity flip; however, the existence of  debt means that the project must make principal and interest  payments before any revenues can be shared between the partners.  Thus, if the project were to run into financial difficulties, the debt- holder would have a senior claim on project proceeds, so the tax  equity investor would receive lower-than-anticipated returns. Several  stakeholders told us that tax equity partners prefer arrangements in  which their returns are not subordinate to debt, so leveraged  structures are not commonly used. They also noted that when  leveraged structures are used, tax equity investors require higher  rates of return in order to compensate them for the higher risk.", "In contrast to the partnership structures, the single owner structure, which  we also modeled, is simpler in that there are no arrangements between  the partners that must be negotiated and monitored. The owner makes  the equity investment, typically accompanied by debt financing, and  receives all available cash proceeds and tax benefits (or liabilities), but,  as mentioned, this structure is not attractive to those developers without  income tax liabilities sufficient to make use of tax credits.", "The single owner and leveraged partnership flip structures involve debt- financing. SAM assumes that the project takes on as much debt as  possible because debt is typically the least-costly funding source for a  project. The maximum level of debt depends on two factors: the amount  of cash available for debt service, and the debt service coverage ratio.  The amount of cash available for debt service is a pretax measure of  earnings defined as total revenue minus total expenses minus the amount  set aside for equipment replacement reserves. The debt service coverage  ratio is the ratio of cash available for debt service and the amount used  for debt service, defined as the sum of principal and interest payments. If  the ratio has a value of one, that means all available cash is used for debt  service. For a given debt service coverage ratio, the maximum level of  debt increases with the amount of cash available for debt service. For a  given amount of cash available for debt service, the maximum level of  debt decreases with the debt service coverage ratio. The debt service  coverage ratio is selected by the user of SAM to represent constraints  imposed by the lender. One implication of this aspect of SAM is that, as  PPA prices increase, so will the amount of cash available for debt service  and thus the share of debt in the project financing. Thus, higher PPA  prices are associated with smaller equity investments.", "The SAM financial module has two possible solution methods. Both  solutions link project investments, returns on those investments, and the  PPA price. In one solution mode, the module solves for the lowest PPA  price that will provide the investor\u2019s return on investment goal. For  example, if an investment goal\u2014i.e., an after-tax internal rate of return  goal\u2014is 12 percent, the module will determine the lowest PPA price  meeting that goal. The second solution mode calculates the cash flows  that would result from the selection of a particular PPA price. For  example, if a PPA price of $0.07 per kilowatt-hour is desired, the module  will determine the financial flows that result from that PPA price, including  the rate of return an investor would earn with that price."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Use of SAM", "paragraphs": ["In this section, we discuss our use of SAM. Specifically, we discuss: (1)  the types of projects we modeled; (2) our investor rates of return targets;  (3) installation and finance costs; and (4) aspects of the partnership  structures related to equity shares and capital recovery by the project  developer. We believe that our use of SAM to examine the possible  effects of changes in the value of tax credits is an appropriate use of the  model, and that SAM is sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.  To make that determination, we met with NREL officials to learn about the  development and uses of the module, and we identified peer-reviewed  and other publications that used SAM to analyze various energy and  financial performance issues related to investments in renewable energy.  We also interviewed industry experts who had used the modules and  shared our preliminary results with officials from NREL and other industry  participants and analysts. Where applicable, we incorporated their  comments into our analysis.", "We modeled a hypothetical solar photovoltaic project and a hypothetical  wind project, and we used SAM to examine the role of tax credits on  investments in these projects. We located our hypothetical solar  photovoltaic project in Phoenix with a generating capacity of 100 MW,  and we located our hypothetical wind project in the state of Washington  with a generating capacity of approximately 150 MW. The SAM  performance module calculated that the solar photovoltaic project would  generate172,975,664 kilowatt-hours of first-year energy for a capacity  factor of 19.7 percent. Likewise, SAM calculated that the wind project  would generate 530,041,600 kilowatt-hours of first-year energy for an  implied capacity factor of 40.4 percent. We believe projects of these sizes  and locations represented reasonable examples of utility-scale renewable  energy projects.", "For each of our projects, we assumed that the costs to install and operate  the project would not change across the project finance structures we  examined; however, total project costs varied because financing costs  vary across the investment structures. For both types of projects, we  assumed a project life of 20 years, PPA terms of 20 years, and PPA price  escalation at the rate of 2.5 percent annually. After specifying project  costs, return on investment targets, and other parameters as inputs to the  module, which we describe in more detail below, we analyzed module  solutions for each project in two tax credit environments, and compared  the results between the two environments. First, we defined a more- generous tax credit environment\u2014which, in the case of the ITC, was at  the current level of 30 percent of the value of a qualified investment and,  in the case of the PTC, was at the level of the PTC before it is scheduled  to expire on December 31, 2014. In 2013, this value was $0.023 per  kilowatt hour, which was then set to escalate over a 10-year period. We  then defined a less-generous tax credit environment in which the ITC is  10 percent of the value of the investment\u2014a level to which the ITC is  scheduled to change in 2017\u2014and there is no PTC\u2014since the PTC is  scheduled to expire at the close of 2014. We modeled the solar project  using the ITC and the wind project using the PTC because, according to  stakeholders, utility-scale solar projects generally use the ITC and utility- scale wind projects generally use the PTC. We modeled both projects  with accelerated depreciation for renewable energy property.", "In the more generous tax credit environment, we used SAM to calculate  the PPA price that yields the investor\u2019s rate of return target. We labeled  this case as the base case. We analyzed the less generous tax credit  environment in two ways. First, we used SAM to calculate the PPA price  that provided the investor\u2019s target rate of return in the new environment.  This solution PPA price will be higher than the solution in the more  generous case because the contribution of the tax credit to total after-tax  returns is lower (in the solar photovoltaic project), or nonexistent (in the  wind project). If the investor is to receive the same return on investment,  the returns from energy revenues must increase to replace those lost with  the reduction or elimination of the tax credit. Since the amount of  electricity generated by the project does not change, the price at which  this electricity is sold is the only mechanism by which higher revenues  can be obtained. We labeled this solution as the higher PPA case. In the  second solution concept, we maintained the PPA at the level found in the  more generous tax credit environment, and we calculated the lower  returns that resulted from holding energy revenues at this level while the  returns from the tax credit were reduced or eliminated. We labeled this  solution as the lower returns case.", "For the leveraged partnership and single owner investment structures, the  higher PPA case leads to a smaller equity investment by the tax equity  investor and the single owner, respectively, because the share of debt  financing increases along with increases in the PPA price. In the all equity  partnership flip structure, the equity investment share of the tax equity  partner does not similarly adjust within the module; rather, it is a  parameter chosen by the user of SAM. Because the reduction or  elimination of the tax credits would likely reduce the value of these  projects to tax investors, and hence their willingness to invest in these  projects, we chose to reduce the tax investor\u2019s share in the investment  from 60 percent in the base case to 30 percent in the less generous  environment.", "We specified rate of return targets for the investors based on information  we collected in interviews with stakeholders, which included project  developers and owners; attorneys and experts who specialize in project  finance; industry trade associations; nongovernmental organizations;  banks that provide equity and debt financing; and investor-owned utilities,  municipally-owned utilities, and electric cooperatives. These stakeholders  provided their opinions about investment return targets, including  differences that might exist between photovoltaic solar projects and wind  projects, and considerations that relate to the different investment  structures we analyzed. We synthesized this information in providing  specifications for our hypothetical projects, and while we believe that they  represent contemporary features and conditions, target rates of return for  actual projects vary. Table 14, below, shows the specific rate of return  targets we selected for our analysis. Because the choice of target year is  influenced by the duration of available tax benefits, we selected different  target year values for the partnership flip structures for the wind project;  specifically, we selected a 10-year target when the PTC was available to  match the 10-year duration of the PTC. We intended for these projects,  although hypothetical, to represent utility-scale projects developed by  experienced developers with market-tested features. In particular, we did  not intend for the rate of return targets we chose to include a premium  that investors might look for as compensation for any extra risk that might  result from projects that contained particularly risky components\u2014such as  untested technology.", "Installation costs include the costs of acquiring and installing capital  equipment, such as panels and inverters in the solar photovoltaic project  and wind turbines in the wind project. Installation cost represents the  most important determinant of total project costs, and hence affects the  scale of the investment on which investor returns are calculated. We  relied on studies of recent trends in solar and wind installations conducted  by analysts at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We  discussed the issue of installed costs with several analysts and those  familiar with recent trends in renewable energy project costs. We selected  an installed cost per watt value of $2.00 for the solar photovoltaic project  and an installed cost per watt value of $1.70 for the wind project. We  believe that these values represent reasonable values for installed cost in  the environment in which projects are currently being developed.", "Total project costs vary across investment structures because of  differences in the sources of investment funds. In the single owner and  leveraged partnership flip cases, the projects are financed with significant  amounts of debt, and there are fees and other costs associated with  obtaining loans. Likewise, the partnership flip structures include costs to  arrange the partnership and to negotiate the rules under which the  partners share the proceeds from the project. Additionally, in the  partnership flip structures, we assumed that the project pays the  developer a development fee. Table 15 provides information on the  values we specified for key cost variables.", "As we mentioned above, in addition to tax credits, federal support is  available to renewable energy projects through the use of accelerated  depreciation for renewable energy property on certain equipment. We  allocated 95 percent of the project costs into this depreciation category,  and placed the remaining 5 percent into the 20-year straight line  category. In the case of the solar projects, we reduced the tax basis by  an amount equal to 50 percent of the dollar value of the ITC to reflect the  basis disallowance treatment associated with the tax provisions governing  the use of the ITC. We assumed that the project\u2019s taxable income is  subject to a state tax rate of 7 percent and a federal (corporate) tax rate  of 35 percent.", "In describing partnership flip structures, we mentioned the general rule  that the vast majority of cash proceeds and tax benefits early in the  project life are allocated to the tax investor, and that once the tax investor  meets its rate of return target, the allocation of the proceeds flip, and the  vast majority of them flow to the developer. One exception to this rule  concerns the possibility of capital recovery by the developer in the all  equity partnership flip. The SAM all equity partnership flip permits the  developer to recover some or all of its equity investment in the early years  of a project by receiving all of the cash proceeds for some period of time  or until it recovers its equity investment, at which point the bulk of cash  proceeds reverts to the tax investor until the time at which the investor\u2019s  rate of return target is met. The greater the share of cash that goes to the  developer through capital recovery means that less of that cash goes to  the tax investor. Thus, a more generous capital recovery selection in SAM  increases the developer\u2019s after-tax returns and reduces the tax investor\u2019s  after-tax returns. This in turn means that a higher solution level of the  PPA price is required to meet the investor\u2019s rate of return target if the  developer\u2019s capital recovery increases. Looked at another way, there can  be different combinations of developer capital recovery and PPA prices  that will meet the tax investor\u2019s rate of return target, but they will result in  different rates of return to the developer.", "Because of our analytical focus on the effects of changes in tax credits,  we wanted to hold both investor and developer returns constant when  looking at the change in the solution value of the PPA price. That is, we  wanted the solution PPA price in the higher PPA case to increase by no  more than was necessary to meet both partners\u2019 investment targets. To  do this in the case of the all equity partnership flip, we modified the SAM  financial module so that we could define an explicit after-tax rate of return  target for the developer and meet this target by modifying the capital  recovery feature in SAM. We specified the developer\u2019s target year to be  the end of the project life, and we specified a rate of return target of 10  percent.", "Analytically, things are somewhat different in the case of the leveraged  partnership flip, even though we wanted to hold the developer\u2019s returns  constant in the higher PPA case. Given the small equity investment by  the developer and the presence of a relatively large development fee both  occurring at the beginning of the project, we chose to express the  developer\u2019s returns in terms of the net present value of the total after tax  returns, a dollar denominated value rather than in rate of return terms.  To do this, we adjusted the size of the development fee paid to the  developer so that the developer\u2019s returns, defined in net present value  terms, did not increase with the higher solution PPA. We used a discount  rate of 10 percent to make this calculation; this is the value we selected  as the developer\u2019s rate of return target in both the all equity partnership  flip and single owner structures.", "Another aspect of the all equity partnership flip concerns the specification  of the ownership shares of the partners. In the current environment, tax  investors are generally the majority partners and, based on our interviews  with stakeholders, we specified that the tax investor would have a 60  percent ownership share in the more generous tax credit environment.  However, information from our interviews and studies by industry analysts  also suggests that tax investors would be less willing to make  investments at the same scale if the value of the tax benefits is reduced.  We specified that the tax investor would have a 30 percent ownership  share in the less generous cases we modeled (see table 16).", "As can be seen from the material presented in this section, SAM requires  the user to specify values for many factors that can influence the cost of  investments and the returns to those investments. We interviewed many  knowledgeable analysts and market participants to develop the values we  used for our analysis, and we believe them to be analytically  conservative. We recognize that the selection of different values for key  factors will lead to different analytical results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Results from SAM", "paragraphs": ["Using SAM, we estimated that reducing or eliminating the value of tax  credits increases the required revenues provided through PPAs by  approximately 20 to 25 percent in the case of the ITC and approximately  30 to 60 percent in the case of the PTC. The module results suggest that  the contribution of the tax credits to total after-tax returns are substantial,  and that if developers and investors are to continue to meet their  investment targets, projects that appear to have been financially viable in  an environment with more generous tax credits would not be viable with  less tax credit support without an increased contribution from energy  revenue through a higher PPA price or reduced return on investment  targets. For example, in the single owner case, the ITC provides  approximately half of total after-tax returns when the value of the ITC is  30 percent of a qualified investment and about 23 percent of total after- tax returns when the ITC is reduced to 10 percent. Likewise, for the wind  project, the net present value of the PTC is almost half of total after-tax  returns when the PTC is in place, and of course makes no contribution to  after-tax returns when the PTC is eliminated.", "While the increases in calculated solution PPA prices were somewhat  smaller in dollars per kilowatt hour for the wind project than for the solar  project, when they were expressed in percentage terms, the wind project  solution PPA price increases were much larger. The value of the PTC  started at $0.023 per kilowatt hour, and increased over time. For the wind  projects, the base case solution values were below $0.05 per kilowatt  hour in each of the investment structures, so the magnitude of the tax  credit was about half or more of the solution PPA price. In terms of the  lower returns cases, the projects with debt financing took on the same  level of debt as in the base case. This meant that there were large equity  investments, but reduction or elimination of the tax credits reduced or  eliminated those contributions to total after-tax returns. In the all equity  partnership flip structures, the tax equity investor met its rate of return  target, but the developer\u2019s returns were substantially lower\u201435 percent in  the solar project and over 70 percent in the wind project. In the leveraged  partnership flip structure, the project cash flows never flipped, which  meant that the tax investor was not able to meet its target rate of return  even by the end of the project.", "We do not characterize the PPA price or investment return changes  shown in these tables as predictions of what will happen to electricity  prices or to potential investments in and returns from utility-scale  renewable energy projects. Some investment structures may become  less favored, and other structures may become more favored in response  to a change in the level or form of federal support. Nonetheless, we think  that the results indicate that the reduction in federal support of renewable  energy projects would put upward pressure on the level of PPA prices  and downward pressure on the returns that could be reasonably expected  by developers. As such, reducing the ITC or eliminating the PTC could  result in a combination of the effects suggested in our modeling.  Specifically, to compensate for the decline in federal support, developers  might be willing to accept lower rates of return, and states might be willing  to require utilities and other retail service providers to pay higher  electricity prices. However, there may be limits to which these effects  could offset a reduction in federal supports. Placed in a broader context,  the willingness of utilities and their regulators to agree to significantly  higher prices will likely constrain the ability of developers to maintain their  returns on investment by negotiating PPAs with significantly higher prices.  Similarly, to the extent that project lenders and investors have alternative  investment opportunities, it seems unlikely that they would make  financing cost concessions on a scale that would offset the reduction in  federal support. Developers themselves are likely to have alternative  outlets, either in the energy sector or elsewhere, in which to direct  investments if expected returns from renewable energy projects are  reduced to unacceptably low levels. Collectively, the constraints faced by  project developers may lead to a reduction in the level of investment in  renewable energy projects if reductions in the level of federal support in  the magnitude examined here are observed.", "Tables 17, 18 and 19 present the module\u2019s results for the hypothetical  solar project under the three ownership structures.
