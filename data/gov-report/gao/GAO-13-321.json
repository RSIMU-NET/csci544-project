The Coast Guard has made progress by adding internal and external data sources that allow for better maritime domain awareness--the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime domain that could affect the United States. In addition, the COP has made information from these sources available to more COP users and decision makers throughout the Coast Guard. However, the Coast Guard has also experienced challenges in meeting the COP's goals and implementing systems to display and share COP information. For example, it experienced challenges when it deployed its Enterprise Geographic Information System (EGIS), a tool that did not meet user needs. The challenges Coast Guard personnel experienced with EGIS included system slowness and displays of inaccurate information. Our prior work found similar challenges with other Coast Guard COP-related systems not meeting intended objectives. For example, in February 2012, GAO reported that the intended information-sharing capabilities of the Coast Guard's WatchKeeper software, a major part of the $74 million Interagency Operations Center project, did not meet port partners' needs, in part, because the agency failed to determine these needs.", "The Coast Guard has not followed its own information technology development guidance when developing new technology. A recent example occurred in 2012 when the agency did not follow its System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) guidance during its initial development of Coast Guard One View (CG1V), its new planned COP viewer. The SDLC requires documents to be completed during specific phases of product development. The Coast Guard, however, did not follow this process during the early development of CG1V. Specifically, we found in February 2013, 9 months after CG1V had entered into the SDLC that the Coast Guard either had not created certain required documents or had created them outside of the sequence prescribed by the SDLC. For example, the SDLC-required tailoring plan is to provide a clear and concise listing of SDLC process requirements throughout the entire system lifecycle, and facilitates the documentation of calculated deviations from standard SDLC activities, products, roles, and responsibilities from the outset of the project. Though the SDLC clearly states that the tailoring plan is a key first step in the SDLC, for CG1V it was not written until after documents required in the second phase were completed. Coast Guard officials stated that this late completion of the tailoring plan occurred because the Coast Guard's Chief Information Officer had allowed the project to start in the second phase of the SDLC because they believed it was a proven concept. Without key phase one documents, the Coast Guard may have dedicated resources without knowing project costs. In October 2012, Coast Guard officials acknowledged the importance of following the SDLC process and stated their intent to complete the SDLC-required documents. Clarifying the application of the SDLC to new technology development would better position the Coast Guard to maximize the usefulness of the COP."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Coast Guard clarify the application of the SDLC for the development of future technology projects.

According to the Coast  Guard, these accomplishments required the agency to have maritime  domain awareness (MDA)\u2014the effective understanding of anything in the  maritime environment that could impact the security, safety, economy or  environment of the United States. In a 2009 testimony before the  Subcommittee on Coast Guard & Maritime Transportation of the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of  Representatives, Coast Guard Admiral Brian Salerno stated that  awareness is essential to everything the Coast Guard does. In his words,  \u201cWe cannot hold polluters accountable unless we can match them to their  spills; we cannot keep vessels from colliding if we don\u2019t know where they  are; we can\u2019t rescue survivors unless we find them; and we cannot  intercept those who would do us harm if they are able to blend in with the  millions of recreational boaters who lawfully enjoy our ports and coastal  waters.\u201d", "To enhance its situational awareness, the Coast Guard operates within a  complex information sharing network with its maritime partners. As the  lead agency in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for  maintaining and improving MDA efforts, the Coast Guard works with its  maritime partners to facilitate the sharing and dissemination of a wide  array of information and intelligence to secure the nation\u2019s maritime  transportation system against potential threats. The level of information  sharing is largely dependent on the information source and classification  level. For example, the Coast Guard works directly with the Navy as a  major part of its defense readiness mission. However, since the Navy\u2019s  command and control system operates at the classified level, the Coast  Guard must have the means to share information at the classified level as  well. Similarly, because many of its mission-related interagency activities  are with other federal, state, and local government agencies, and the  private sector, the Coast Guard must also be able to communicate and  share information at the unclassified level. As a result, the Coast Guard  operates in both the classified and unclassified environment.", "To facilitate this information sharing for mission effectiveness and  situational awareness with all of its partners, in 1998 the Coast Guard  began developing its Common Operational Picture (COP)\u2014a map-based  information system that can be shared among Coast Guard commands\u2014 that displays vessels, information about those vessels and the  environment surrounding them. According to the Coast Guard, the COP  became operational in 2003 and has continued to evolve as more  information has been added to it. More fully, the COP is \u201ccommon\u201d  because the same information is shared across computer networks and is  available for display in all Coast Guard command centers and on many  mobile assets. It is \u201coperational\u201d because the information displayed is  relevant to Coast Guard operations and is used to facilitate command and  control and decision making.  The COP is a \u201cpicture\u201d because the  information is presented on an interactive digital map. The COP can be a  standalone presentation or part of mission-oriented Geographic  Information System (GIS) displays that are linked to information sources.", "While the Department of Defense-managed classified COP provides  important information for Coast Guard maritime operations, over the last  10 years, the Coast Guard has been building its unclassified COP for its  personnel, other federal agencies, and non-federal partners.

We  also reviewed a Coast Guard-wide message regarding the Coast Guard  Enterprise Geographic Information System (EGIS), and memos and e- mails written from 2008 through 2013 by Coast Guard information  technology (IT) systems development leadership about the COP, EGIS,  and Coast Guard One View (CG1V), the Coast Guard\u2019s ongoing GIS  viewer development effort. Additionally, because the COP is dependent  upon underlying systems being developed and deployed by the Coast  Guard, we analyzed pertinent sections of prior GAO reports on the  Deepwater acquisition program to determine the original information  sharing expectations for the Deepwater Command, Control,  Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and  Reconnaissance (C4ISR) system and the system\u2019s actual capabilities.  Similarly, we reviewed our previously published report on Interagency  Operations Centers (IOC) to determine the planned information sharing  capabilities for the WatchKeeper software toolset, the capabilities of the  system as deployed, and the extent to which maritime security  stakeholders outside the Coast Guard were using the system.", "We obtained information on user experiences with the Coast Guard COP  and GIS systems by interviewing Coast Guard personnel at 6 of the 35  Coast Guard Sector command centers (Boston, Massachusetts;  Hampton Roads, Virginia; Key West and Miami, Florida; Puget Sound,  Washington; and San Francisco, California), five of the nine Coast Guard  district command centers (Boston, Massachusetts; Portsmouth, Virginia;  Miami, Florida; Alameda, California; and Seattle, Washington), and the  two Coast Guard area command centers (Portsmouth, Virginia and  Alameda, California). We also met with system users at Coast Guard air  stations in Elizabeth City, North Carolina; Miami, Florida; and  Sacramento, California; on board various Coast Guard Cutters including  Bear, Bernard C. Webber, Midgett, and Waesche; and at Maritime  Intelligence Fusion Centers Atlantic and Pacific. We also interviewed  Coast Guard headquarters personnel representing the offices responsible  for developing requirements for the COP and GIS, and for developing the  IT systems expected to fulfill those requirements. Each location was  selected to provide access to a broad range of COP users from different  shore-based units, vessels, and aircraft within a concentrated geographic  area. While information we obtained at these locations may not be  generalized across all Coast Guard units, because we selected these  locations based on the diversity of their geographic locations and the  various uses of the COP by personnel in these locations, the units we  visited provided us with an overview and users\u2019 perspectives on the  general progress and challenges of implementing the COP. To determine  the nature and prevalence of user identified challenges with COP-related  systems, we reviewed EGIS system test results and trouble tickets sent  by system users seeking assistance in troubleshooting EGIS problems, or  in determining the capabilities and usability of EGIS.", "To address the second objective we reviewed pertinent sections of the  Coast Guard\u2019s System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Practice Manual  to assess the Coast Guard approach for developing IT systems against  its own requirements. We then compared the SDLC manual to industry  standard guidance for IT development to ensure it met industry  standards. To determine the extent to which the SDLC requirements were  met, we reviewed a Coast Guard-wide message regarding EGIS, and  memos written from 2009 through 2012 from Coast Guard IT systems  development leadership related to the COP, EGIS, and CG1V. We also  met with representatives from the Coast Guard CIO\u2019s staff and current  and former representatives of the Office of C4 & Sensors Capabilities  under the Assistant Commandant for Capability to discuss the process  used, and the extent to which it followed Coast Guard guidance in the  development of COP systems.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2012 to April 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The Coast Guard\u2019s concept for the COP includes a complex  interplay of data, assets, technology, and multiple organizations at  multiple security levels helping to populate and share information within  the COP. As shown in figure 1, entities outside of the Coast Guard are  also integral parts of the COP.", "According to the Coast Guard, the COP comprises four elements: (1)  track data feeds, (2) information data sources, (3) command and control  systems, and (4) COP management procedures.", "Track data feeds. The primary information included in the Coast  Guard\u2019s COP is vessel and aircraft position information\u2014or tracks\u2014 and descriptive information about the vessels, their cargo, and crew.  Track information may be obtained from a variety of sources  depending on the type of track. For example, the COP includes  automatic identification system (AIS) tracks, as well as fishing  vessel tracks from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration\u2019s Vessel Monitoring System. The COP also  includes track information or position reports of Coast Guard and port  partner vessels. The Coast Guard receives aircraft location  information from Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Air and Marine  Operations Center. In addition to vessel-related information, the  COP also includes information and data that can be geographically  referenced, such as the boundary lines of Coast Guard units\u2019 areas of  responsibility or U.S. territorial waters, and weather information,  among other things. See figure 2 for an example of vessel tracks on a  COP display.", "Information data sources. The information data sources provide  supplementary information on the vessel tracks to help COP users  and operational commanders determine why a track might be  important. The COP includes data from multiple information sources  that originate from the Coast Guard as well as from other government  agencies and civilian sources. Internal sources include intelligence  inputs and Coast Guard databases such as the Marine Information for  Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) and the Ship Arrival  Notification System, among others. External information sources  include the Department of Defense, Joint Interagency Task Force  South, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  All of these information sources are fused with, or overlaid on, the  track information to provide more complete information to COP users  about the nature of the identified tracks.", "Command and control systems. These are the systems used to  collect, fuse, disseminate, and store information for the COP. Since  the COP became operational in 2003, the Coast Guard has provided  COP users with various systems that have allowed them to view,  manipulate and enhance their use of the COP. Among these systems  have been the Global Command and Control System (GCCS),  Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC), and Hawkeye.  See appendix I for additional information on the various systems and  applications that COP users identified as providing access to COP  information.", "In addition to the technology needed to view the COP, the Coast  Guard has also developed technology to further enhance the  information within the COP and its use to improve mission  effectiveness. This has occurred in part through its former Deepwater  Program C4ISR system improvements. This technology acquisition  was intended to create an interoperable network of sensors, computer  systems, and hardware to improve MDA. Specifically, C4ISR was  designed to allow the Coast Guard\u2019s new vessels and aircraft,  acquired under the Deepwater program, to both add information to the  COP using their own sensors as well as view information contained  within the COP, thereby allowing these assets to become both  producers and consumers of COP information. In July 2011, we  reported that the Coast Guard was developing C4ISR infrastructure  that it expected to collect, correlate, and present information into a  single COP to facilitate mission execution. Similarly, as we reported  in February 2012, the WatchKeeper software that was developed as  part of the DHS Interagency Operations Center program was intended  to increase the information available to the COP by having port  partners add information from their data bases while increasing the  port partners\u2019 access to Coast Guard information. Coast Guard  Sectors were expected to give their port partners access to the  software, which was to act as a two way conduit for information  sharing. At that time we reported that the Coast Guard had been  installing the software in all 35 of its Sector locations.", "COP management procedures. These procedures address the  development and the use of the COP. This would include, for  example, the Concept of Operations document, which identifies the  basic components, use, and exchange of information that are included  in the COP. It would also include the requirements document, which  identifies the essential capabilities and associated requirements  needed to make the COP function. It also includes other documents  such as standard operating procedures on how the Coast Guard uses  the COP, agreements with others using the Coast Guard COP on how  information is to be shared or exchanged, and the rules for how data  are correlated and also how vessels are flagged as threats or  friends."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Advances in Coast Guard COP Technology", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard relies on GIS, which is an integrated collection of  computer software and data used to view and manage information about  geographic places, analyze spatial relationships, and model spatial  processes, in order to share information related to the people, vessels,  and facilities in a mapped display.

As a  result, Coast Guard-wide GIS is an important capability for enabling  Coast Guard personnel to view and analyze COP information. The Coast  Guard\u2019s first agency-wide GIS vehicle was to add a GIS viewer to the  existing MISLE database. This later evolved into what the Coast Guard  refers to as Enterprise GIS, or EGIS. These GIS-based applications with  their incorporated viewers are not limited to viewing the COP, but can  also be used to receive, correlate, and analyze a variety of information  from multiple sources to provide situational awareness. For example,  CG1V is being developed to allow Coast Guard personnel to have a  single viewer to interface with COP information and other Coast Guard  GIS databases, as seen in figure 3.", "In 2004, the Coast Guard implemented the SDLC process for non-major  IT acquisitions\u2014those with less than $300 million dollars in life cycle  costs\u2014to help ensure IT projects are managed effectively and meet  user needs.

Some of the shortcomings with these technology  systems have included the inability to share information as intended.", "In July 2011, we reported that the Coast Guard had not met its goal of  building a single C4ISR system\u2014intended to enable the sharing of COP  and other data among its offshore vessels and aircraft. Specifically, we  noted that the Coast Guard repeatedly changed its strategy for achieving  the goal of its $2.5 billion C4ISR project, which was to build a single fully  interoperable command, control, intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance system across the Coast Guard\u2019s Deepwater vessels and  aircraft. We found that not all aircraft and vessels were operating the  same C4ISR system, or even at the same classification level and hence  could not directly exchange data with each other. For example, sharing  information gathered by an aircraft operating with a classified system was  difficult during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill incident. In addition, we  reported that the Coast Guard may shift away from a full data-sharing  capability, and instead, use a system where shore-based command  centers could be a conduit between assets while also entering data from  assets into the COP. This could increase the time it takes for COP  information gathered by a vessel operating with a classified system to be  shared with an aircraft operating with an unclassified system. Because  aircraft and vessels are important contributors to and users of COP  information, a limited capability to quickly and fully share COP data may  affect their mission effectiveness. We concluded that given these  uncertainties, the Coast Guard did not have a clear vision of the C4ISR  required to meet its missions.", "We also reported in July 2011 that the Coast Guard was managing the  C4ISR program without key acquisition documents. At that time, the  Coast Guard lacked the following key documents: an acquisition program  baseline that reflected the planned program, a credible life-cycle cost  estimate, and an operational requirements document for the entire C4ISR  acquisition project. According to Coast Guard information technology  officials, the abundance of software baselines could increase the overall  instability of the C4ISR system and complexity of the data sharing  between assets. We recommended, and the Coast Guard concurred, that  it should determine whether the system-of-systems concept for C4ISR is  still the planned vision for the program, and if not, ensure that the new  vision is comprehensively detailed in the project documentation. In  response to our recommendation, the Coast Guard reported in 2012 that  it was still supporting the system-of-systems approach and was  developing needed documentation. The agency also reported that it  planned to install a communication system on air and vessel assets to  provide for interoperability and direct communication.", "One mechanism expected to increase access to COP information was the  DHS Interagency Operations Center program, which was delegated to the  Coast Guard for development. This program began providing COP  information to Coast Guard agency partners in 2010. Using WatchKeeper  software, IOCs were originally designed to gather data from sensors and  port partner sources to provide situational awareness to Coast Guard  sector personnel and to Coast Guard partners in state and local law  enforcement and port operations, among others. WatchKeeper was  designed to provide Coast Guard personnel and port partners with access  to the same unclassified GIS data, thereby improving collaboration  between them. Making this information available to port partners has also  allowed the Coast Guard to leverage the capabilities of its partners in  responding to cases. For example, in responding to a distress call, if both  the Coast Guard unit and its local port partners know the location of all  possible response vessels, they can allocate resources and develop  search patterns that make the best use of each responding vessel.", "In February 2012, we reported that the Coast Guard had increased  access to its WatchKeeper software by allowing access to the system for  Coast Guard port partners; however, the Coast Guard had limited  success in improving information sharing between the Coast Guard and  local port partners. We found that the Coast Guard did not follow  established guidance during the development of WatchKeeper\u2014a major  component of the $74 million Interagency Operations Center acquisition  project\u2014by, in part, failing to determine the needs of its users, define  acquisition requirements, or determine cost and schedule information.  Prior to the initial deployment of WatchKeeper, the Coast Guard made  only limited efforts to determine port partner needs for the system. We  found that Coast Guard officials had some high level discussions,  primarily with other DHS partners. Port partner involvement in the  development of WatchKeeper requirements was primarily limited to  Customs and Border Protection because WatchKeeper grew out of a  system designed for screening commercial vessel arrivals\u2014a Customs  and Border Protection mission. However, according to the Interagency  Operations Process Report: Mapping Process to Requirements for  Interagency Operations Centers, the Coast Guard identified many port  partners as critical to IOCs, including other federal agencies (e.g., the  Federal Bureau of Investigation) and state and local agencies.", "We also determined that because few port partners\u2019 needs were met with  WatchKeeper, use of the system by port partners was limited.  Specifically, of the 233 port partners who had access to WatchKeeper for  any part of September 2011 (the most recent month for which data were  available at the time of our report), about 18 percent had ever logged onto  the system and about 3 percent had logged on more than five times.  Additionally, we reported that without implementing a documented  process to obtain and incorporate port partner feedback into the  development of future WatchKeeper requirements, the Coast Guard was  at risk of deploying a system that lacked needed capabilities, and that  would continue to limit the ability of port partners to share information and  coordinate in the maritime environment. We concluded, in part, that the  weak management of the $74 million IOC acquisition project increased  the program\u2019s exposure to risk. In particular, fundamental requirements- development and management practices had not been employed; costs  were unclear; and the project\u2019s schedule, which was to guide program  execution and promote accountability, had not been reliably derived.  Moreover, we reported that with stronger program management, the  Coast Guard could reduce the risk that it would have a system that did  not meet Coast Guard and port-partner user needs and expectations. As  a result, we recommended, and the Coast Guard concurred, that it should  collect data to determine the extent to which (1) sectors are providing port  partners with WatchKeeper access and (2) port partners are using  WatchKeeper; then develop, document, and implement a process to  obtain and incorporate port-partner input into the development of future  WatchKeeper requirements, and define, document, and prioritize  WatchKeeper requirements.

In general, the COP has added multiple  sources and types of vessel-tracking information that enhance COP  users\u2019 knowledge of the maritime domain. While vessel tracking  information had been available previously to Coast Guard field units  located in ports with a Vessel Tracking Service, adding it to the COP  provided a broader base of situational awareness for Coast Guard  operational commanders. For example, before AIS vessel-tracking  information was added to the COP, only Coast Guard units specifically  responsible for vessel-tracking, were able to easily track large commercial  vessels\u2019 positions, speeds, courses, and destinations.", "According to Coast Guard personnel, after AIS data were added to the  COP in 2003, any Coast Guard unit could access such information to  improve strategic and tactical decision making. In 2006, the ability to track  the location of Coast Guard assets, including small boats and cutters,  was also added to the COP. This capability\u2014also known as blue force  tracking\u2014allows COP users to locate Coast Guard vessels in real time  and establish which vessels are in the best position to respond to mission  needs. Similarly, blue force tracking allows the Coast Guard to  differentiate its own vessels from commercial or unfriendly vessels. Figure  5 shows examples of data sources added to the COP since 2003.", "Another enhancement to the information available in the COP was  provided through the updating of certain equipment on Coast Guard  assets to enable them to collect and transmit data. Specifically, the Coast  Guard made some data collection and sharing improvements, including  the installation of commercial satellite communications equipment and  AIS receivers, onboard its older cutters. This added capability made the  COP information more robust by allowing Coast Guard vessels at sea to  receive, through AIS receivers, position reports from large commercial  vessels and then transmit this information to land units where it would be  entered into the COP. This equipment upgrade on older Coast Guard  cutters added information into the COP that is generally not available  through other means.", "According to Coast Guard officials, in addition to adding information to the  COP, the Coast Guard has also made the information contained in the  COP available on more computers and on more systems, which, in turn,  has increased the number of users with access to the COP both within  and outside the agency. One of the key steps toward increasing the  number of users with COP access occurred in 2004 with the  implementation of C2PC, which made both the classified and unclassified  COP available to additional Coast Guard personnel.

Our site visits to area, district, and sector command  centers in six Coast Guard field locations, and discussions with  headquarters personnel identified numerous examples of user concerns  about EGIS. Specifically, the Coast Guard EGIS users we interviewed  stated that EGIS was slow, did not always display accurate and timely  information, or degraded the performance of their computer  workstations\u2014making EGIS\u2019s performance generally unsatisfactory for  them. For example, personnel from one district we visited reported losing  critical time when attempting to determine a boater\u2019s position on a map  display because of EGIS\u2019s slow performance. Similarly, personnel at  three of the five districts we visited described how EGIS sometimes  displayed inaccurate or delayed vessel location information, including, for  example, displaying a vessel track indicating a 25-foot Coast Guard boat  was located off the coast of Greenland\u2014a location where no such vessel  had ever been. Personnel we met with in two districts did not use EGIS at  all to display COP information because doing so caused other  applications to crash. The problems that we witnessed firsthand or that  were described to us by Coast Guard personnel were validated by data  from the Coast Guard\u2019s EGIS-related help desk tickets which summarize  problems with EGIS, among other things, for Coast Guard IT staff. For  example, our examination of the fiscal year 2011 help desk tickets  indicated that users reported several types of problems with EGIS  including problems related to performance, loss of capabilities, and data  error notification, among other issues. In one District, limitations users  encountered with EGIS caused that District to request permission from  Coast Guard headquarters to use an alternative system because EGIS\u2019s  poor performance affected the ability of district personnel to monitor blue  force tracking. However, personnel responsible for managing EGIS  development at Coast Guard headquarters told us that EGIS was never  intended to be able to display blue force tracking\u2014which is likely why  users were experiencing difficulty using it for this purpose. They also  recognized that the lack of user training on EGIS\u2019s capabilities likely  contributed to this misunderstanding about its capabilities.", "Coast Guard IT officials told us they experienced challenges largely  related to insufficient computational power on some Coast Guard work  stations, a lack of training for users and system installers, and inadequate  testing of EGIS software before installation. According to Coast Guard IT  officials, Coast Guard computers are replaced on a regular schedule, but  not all at once and EGIS\u2019s viewer places a high demand on the graphics  capabilities of computers. They added that this demand was beyond the  capability of the older Coast Guard computers used in some locations.  Moreover, Coast Guard IT management made EGIS available to all  potential users without performing the tests needed to determine if  capability challenges would ensue. When EGIS was installed on these  older computers performance suffered. In regard to training, Coast Guard  officials told us that they had developed on-line internal training for EGIS  and classroom training was also available from the software supplier.  Coast Guard IT officials said, however, that they did not inform users that  this training was available. This left the users with learning how to use  EGIS on the job. Similarly, the installers of EGIS software were not  trained properly and many cases of incomplete installation were later  discovered. These incomplete installations significantly degraded the  capabilities of EGIS. Finally, the Coast Guard did not test the demands of  EGIS on Coast Guard systems in real world conditions, according to  Coast Guard officials. Only later, after users commented on their  problems using EGIS, did the Coast Guard perform the tests that  demonstrated the limitations of the Coast Guard network in handling  EGIS. According to Coast Guard officials, some of these challenges may  have been avoided if they had followed the SDLC process for IT  development. Specifically, they said that if they had completed three  required planning documents\u2014an implementation plan, a training plan,  and a Test and Evaluation Master Plan, and conducted the associated  activities outlined by these types of planning documents\u2014the agency  could have avoided these management challenges that it experienced  after EGIS\u2019s deployment. If these problems had been averted, users  may have had greater satisfaction and the system may have been better  utilized for Coast Guard mission needs.", "Poor communication by, and among, Coast Guard IT officials led to  additional management challenges during efforts to implement a  simplified EGIS technology called EGIS Silverlight. According to Coast  Guard officials, the Coast Guard implemented EGIS Silverlight to give  users access to EGIS data without the analysis tools that had been tied to  technical challenges with the existing EGIS software. Coast Guard CIO  office personnel stated that EGIS Silverlight was available to users in  2010; however, none of the Coast Guard personnel we spoke with at the  field units we visited mentioned awareness of or use of this alternative  EGIS option when asked about what systems they used to access the  COP. According to Coast Guard CIO office personnel, it was the  responsibility of the sponsor\u2019s office to notify users about the availability  of EGIS Silverlight. However, personnel from the sponsor\u2019s office stated  that they were unaware that EGIS Silverlight had been deployed and thus  had not taken steps to notify field personnel of this new application that  could have helped to address EGIS performance problems. These Coast  Guard officials were unable to explain how this communication  breakdown had occurred."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has Not Adhered to its Information Technology Development Guidance for Most Recent COP Technology", "paragraphs": ["Although the SDLC process has been in place since 2004, the Coast  Guard has not adhered to this guidance for the development of more  recent COP-related technology\u2014Coast Guard One View, or CG1V.", "The Coast Guard reported that it began development of a new GIS  viewer\u2014CG1V\u2014in April 2010 to provide users with a single interface for  viewing GIS information, including the COP, and to align the Coast  Guard\u2019s viewer with DHS\u2019s new GIS viewer. However, the Coast Guard  diverged from the SDLC process at the outset when in April 2012 the  Coast Guard CIO placed CG1V into the second, rather than first, phase of  the SDLC through a designation letter\u2014the action that places an IT  acquisition into the Coast Guard\u2019s technology development process.  The designation letter states that CG1V shall enter the SDLC in its  second phase, planning and requirements, rather than its first phase,  conceptual planning\u2014without any explanation as to why the system was  being placed into the second rather than first phase. As a result, the  Coast Guard began developing requirements for CG1V before it had  defined how it planned to manage the development of CG1V or had  defined the deliverables for each phase of the project. \u201cLegacy Systems\u201d are systems that have already been developed or reached a stage of  maturity but have not completed the necessary products for the SDLC or were developed  prior to implementation of the SDLC.", "CG1V\u2019s designation into the planning and requirements phase did not,  from the outset, follow the process outlined in the SDLC guidance.", "Although officials stated in October 2012 that efforts were underway to  complete phase one documents for CG1V, as of February 2013, almost a  year after CG1V\u2019s April 2012 designation into the second phase of the  SDLC, the Coast Guard has not completed two of the five key documents  needed to exit the first phase. For example, the business case\u2014an  SDLC-required document that presents the problem to be solved, the  solution being proposed, and the expected value of the project\u2014has not  been completed by the Coast Guard. This document is also used by  management to determine if staff or other resources are to be devoted to  defining and evaluating alternative ways to respond to the identified need  or opportunity. In addition to not having the business case completed, the  acquisition strategy had also not been completed as of February 2013.  The acquisition strategy lays out the funding source for the project and  the anticipated costs of completing the planning and requirements phase.  It also includes a review of the business case to ensure the efficient  utilization of Coast Guard resources. As we have previously reported,  when managing the C4ISR program, the Coast Guard had inadequate or  incomplete acquisition documentation. Specifically, we reported in July  2011, that the Coast Guard\u2019s C4ISR project lacked the technical planning  documents necessary to both articulate the vision of a common C4ISR  baseline\u2014a key goal of the C4ISR project\u2014and to guide the  development of the C4ISR system in such a way that the system on each  asset remains true to the vision. With respect to our ongoing review of  CG1V, by not completing the business case and acquisition strategy, the  Coast Guard may have prematurely selected CG1V as a solution without  reviewing other viable alternatives to meets its vision, and may also have  dedicated resources to CG1V without knowing the project costs.", "In addition to not completing two key phase one documents, the Coast  Guard has also developed other SDLC documents for CG1V out of  sequence. Specifically, the SDLC manual states that the tailoring plan is  to be developed in conceptual planning before other documents, such as  the Functional Requirements Document, are created. The tailoring plan  is to provide a clear and concise listing of SDLC process requirements  throughout the entire system lifecycle, and facilitates the documentation  of calculated deviations from standard SDLC activities, products, roles,  and responsibilities from the outset of the project. Though the SDLC  manual clearly states that the tailoring plan is a key first step in the SDLC,  CG1V\u2019s tailoring plan was not approved until February 2013, almost a  year after CG1V was designated into the SDLC. Coast Guard officials  stated that they were completing some documents retroactively because  projects cannot exit any phase of the SDLC process without completing  the documents required in each of the preceding phases. For example, to  exit the conceptual planning phase and enter into the planning and  requirements phase, projects must complete all of the exit criteria\u2014which  includes several key documents\u2014from the conceptual planning phase.  Similarly, the Functional Requirements Document\u2014a phase two  document\u2014was also drafted out of sequence in March 2012, but in this  case it was drafted early\u2014a full month before CG1V was even  designated into the SDLC. By completing these documents out of  sequence, the Coast Guard did not follow the disciplined activities and  product outputs of the SDLC to ensure that appropriate information is  gathered and monitored to support investment decisions.", "The Enterprise Architecture Board provides guidance through reviews of Coast Guard  information technology investments. The Enterprise Architecture Board is required to  review all Coast Guard C4&IT acquisitions to make sure the project is aligned with its  enterprise architecture. enterprise architecture and whether an equivalent capability already  existed in the enterprise architecture. Although its review was  conducted later in the process than might be expected under the SDLC,  according to Coast Guard officials, the Enterprise Architecture Board  confirmed that CG1V was in alignment with the Coast Guard\u2019s enterprise  architecture. However, the Enterprise Architecture Board also placed  conditions on CG1V\u2019s development\u2014including a requirement that CG1V  program officials continue working to complete SDLC requirements for  this program. As figure 6 shows, most SDLC documents for phase one  have either been completed out of sequence or have not been completed  at all. If the Coast Guard does not adhere to the SDLC as prescribed, the  agency runs the risk of missing early opportunities to identify and address  problems if CG1V\u2019s development falls behind schedule, runs over its  budget, or does not meet user needs when it is deployed.", "Officials from the CIO\u2019s office stated the importance of the phase one  documentation to the integrity of the SDLC and stated that they intended  to have the required documents from phase one completed and  approved. They also stated that in following the SDLC for CG1V they  would be encouraging other Coast Guard program offices to follow the  SDLC for their projects. Moreover, a key official from the CIO\u2019s office  stated in January 2013 that while the SDLC has been around for almost 9  years, the process was slow to ramp up in the Coast Guard and there still  remains a lack of awareness around the process. For example, he said  that sometimes SDLC-required documents get drafted but the project  sponsors do not see them as important and thus do not review them in a  timely manner. He also noted that sometimes officials do not follow the  process because they are working to meet a deadline. He added,  however, that following the SDLC is important because it can help the  Coast Guard achieve more successful implementation of new systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has increased the amount of information included in the  COP and the number of users with access to COP information. However,  the Coast Guard has encountered and continues to encounter many  challenges in implementing its COP goals. These challenges are  exemplified by the difficulty the Coast Guard has had with implementing  C4ISR systems and COP tools such as WatchKeeper. We have  documented these challenges individually in several prior reports but  recognize here the broader impact of the challenges with these systems  on the Coast Guard\u2019s COP. For example, in 2011, we reported that the  Coast Guard\u2019s C4ISR project had not met its intended goals, and we see  now in 2013 that its benefit to the COP has been more limited than  originally planned. In 2012, we reported that the Coast Guard\u2019s effort to  implement WatchKeeper as a COP tool had made some progress, but the  lack of port partners utilizing WatchKeeper and its inability to add  information from local sensors jeopardized its purpose of improving  information sharing and enhancing MDA across federal, state, and local  port partners. These limitations have had another impact as well\u2014as they  have also affected the robustness and utility of information contained in  the COP. In this review we again found IT implementation challenges\u2014in  this case related to the Coast Guard\u2019s implementation of EGIS. These  challenges, which Coast Guard officials acknowledged, resulted in  numerous technical shortcomings and unsatisfied users. Coast Guard  officials stated that some of EGIS\u2019s implementation challenges could  have been avoided if they had followed the SDLC process when  developing EGIS.", "The Coast Guard is now developing a new COP-related technology,  CG1V, and early efforts\u2014such as not completing certain documentation  and completing other documentation out of sequence\u2014demonstrate that  the Coast Guard was again not adhering to its own guidance. Although  the Coast Guard has subsequently completed one of the documents  required in the conceptual design phase and IT officials have expressed  the intent to adhere to the SDLC process during the course of our review,  there appears to still be some lack of awareness surrounding the SDLC  process. Given the current budget environment and the resource- intensive nature of developing IT systems, the Coast Guard must be  especially prudent in expending resources that help it accomplish its  missions.
