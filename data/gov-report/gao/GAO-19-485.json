Election officials GAO interviewed and literature reviewed reported benefits and limitations associated with each source. According to officials, each source helps improve list accuracy, despite some limitations, and list maintenance efforts in general help reduce opportunities for election fraud. For example, officials said that NCOA data helped them maintain accurate lists by identifying registrants who moved outside the election jurisdiction; however, they also noted that NCOA data may not capture all address changes because people do not always notify the U.S. Postal Service when they move.", "GAO incorporated technical comments provided by federal agencies and state and local election officials as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), also known as the  \u201cmotor voter\u201d law, was intended to increase the number of eligible citizens  who register to vote in federal elections, protect the integrity of the  electoral process, and ensure that accurate and current voter registration  rolls are maintained. Among its provisions, the law expanded the number  of locations and opportunities for citizens to register to vote, including  when conducting certain transactions at a motor vehicle agency or at a  public assistance agency. The NVRA also outlined various requirements  for the processing of registration forms and maintenance of voter  registration lists for federal elections. List maintenance provisions require  that states conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to  remove the names of certain ineligible voters, but also contain safeguards  against improper removal.", "In managing the voter registration process and maintaining voter  registration lists, state and local election officials must balance two NVRA-related goals\u2014(1) minimizing the burden on eligible people of  registering to vote; and (2) ensuring that voter lists are accurate and  current (limited to those eligible to vote), which includes ensuring that  appropriately registered voters are not improperly removed from the voter  registration lists. State and local election officials use data from a number  of sources to maintain their voter registration lists and work toward these  goals. Accurate voter registration lists may improve election-day  efficiency and may also limit opportunities for potential election fraud.  Over the years, news and other reports have highlighted concerns that  voter registration list maintenance practices in certain states designed, in  part, to deter potential election fraud may have hindered the ability of  some eligible voters to cast their ballots.

What efforts has DOJ taken to ensure states and localities are  complying with NVRA requirements to offer registration opportunities  and administer voter registration list maintenance programs, and to  address potential instances of election fraud?  2.  How are selected data sources used at the state and local level to  help maintain voter registration lists, and what are perspectives on  how these data sources help ensure list accuracy and address  potential voter eligibility and fraud issues?", "To address DOJ efforts to ensure NVRA compliance, we reviewed and  analyzed case management data from the Civil Rights Division\u2019s  Interactive Case Management System (ICM) for matters initiated and  cases filed in federal court that involved NVRA provisions from fiscal  years 2001 through 2017. We reviewed ICM data from the Civil Rights  Division\u2019s Voting Section, which enforces the civil provisions of the NVRA,  among other voting laws, as well as the Appellate Section, which  represents the United States in civil rights cases in federal courts of  appeal. We also reviewed aggregate data on all Voting Section matters  and cases during this period.", "To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed available system  documentation, such as the ICM data dictionary, and interviewed officials  from the Civil Rights Division to discuss the mechanisms in place to  ensure data quality. We reviewed the data to assess the extent of any  missing variables or inconsistencies and worked with agency officials to  resolve any such inconsistencies and correct the data as appropriate. For  cases filed, we also reviewed and analyzed court documents to assess  the reliability of information recorded in ICM.

To identify data sources which officials receive and may use, we  first sent a structured questionnaire to state election directors for each of  the 49 states and the District of Columbia with voter registration  requirements, and summarized their responses to identify commonly  received data sources. We conducted pretests with 4 states to ensure  that the questionnaire items were clear and answerable. Then, from the list of commonly received sources, we selected sources that can be used  to address three of the five list maintenance categories outlined in the  NVRA: change in residence (moves), deaths, and felony convictions. We  also selected at least (1) one nationwide source that captures data from  all states; (2) one state source that only includes data specific to the  particular state that receives data from the source; and (3) one interstate  data exchange that involves sharing data between multiple states. We  selected sources from each of these categories in order to identify  potential issues that may arise when election officials match their voter  registration data with various other types of data sources.", "The six data sources we selected are: (1) U.S. Postal Service National  Change of Address (NCOA), (2) Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck  Program (Crosscheck), (3) returned mail, (4) the public version of the  Social Security Administration Death Master File (DMF), (5) state vital  records, and (6) U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices\u2019 records on federal felony  convictions. We searched literature from scholarly and peer reviewed  publications; government reports; dissertations; conference papers;  books; articles; association, think tank, and other nonprofit organizations;  and working papers published from 2001 through 2018 to identify  publications that were potentially relevant to how the six selected data  sources are used for voter registration list maintenance. From the  publications relevant to the six selected data sources, we collected  information regarding benefits or limitations associated with using these  data sources for voter registration list maintenance.", "Additionally, we visited and conducted interviews with state and local  jurisdiction election officials from five selected states (Florida, Michigan,  Nebraska, Oregon, and Virginia) to obtain information on policies and  procedures for using the selected data sources. We also obtained state  and local election officials\u2019 perspectives on the benefits and limitations  associated with using the selected data sources to address voter  registration list accuracy and potential voter eligibility and fraud issues.  We selected these five states by first identifying how many of the selected  data sources states use, and creating a list of states that use at least five  of the six selected sources. We then narrowed the list to five states by  considering variation in states\u2019 population size, when possible, and  geographic diversity in order to capture possible regional differences in  election administration practices. We corroborated the information we  gathered through these interviews by reviewing relevant state statutes  and other documentation. While the perspectives of officials we spoke  with cannot be generalized to other states and local election jurisdictions,  they provided a range of perspectives on the topics within the scope of  our review.

Specifically, Section officials said that they  conduct periodic reviews of the U S. Election Assistance Commission\u2019s  biennial Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS) to assess  compliance with different NVRA provisions. For example, officials noted  they may review EAVS data summarizing states\u2019 motor vehicle agency  driver license and voter registration transactions to help determine  whether states are following NVRA section 5. In addition to using EAVS  data, officials said they review publically available third party reports,  which often include state specific registration data and other qualitative  information about state processes. Section officials said this information  can help them identify states that are potentially not in compliance with  the NVRA. Officials also said that Section investigators have conducted  observations at motor vehicle agencies and social services agencies as  part of their efforts to assess and enforce NVRA compliance.", "Section officials noted that these efforts are not conducted on a regular  schedule; rather, they are conducted periodically, on an intermittent,  rolling basis. These officials said such efforts may lead them to request  additional information from states, conduct compliance investigations, and  initiate enforcement actions if necessary. For example:", "The DOJ Office of Inspector General reported that, in 2004, the Voting  Section reviewed census and voter registration data for all 50 states  to determine which states had more people registered to vote than the  voting-age population. The Inspector General further reported that,  based on the results of the research, the Section sent letters to 12  states requesting information on their efforts to remove ineligible  voters from their registration lists, and ultimately filed two cases as a  result of this enforcement initiative.", "In June 2017, the Voting Section sent letters to the 44 states subject  to the NVRA requesting information related to states\u2019 compliance with  the law\u2019s list maintenance provisions. Section officials stated that, as  of March 2019, two actions have resulted from this effort: (1) the  Section became a plaintiff-intervenor in a June 2018 case against  Kentucky for having an inadequate list maintenance program; and  (2) the Section entered into a February 2019 memorandum of  understanding with the state of Connecticut regarding its efforts to  identify registered voters who have died. Officials noted that the  effort begun in 2017 does not have any specific time frames, goals, or  objectives but that the Section is reviewing the data states provided  and focusing detailed reviews on states whose data suggest possible  non-compliance.", "Section officials said that in general, assessing compliance with NVRA  section 8 (list maintenance) is more challenging than for the other  sections, such as section 5 (voter registration opportunities at motor  vehicles agencies). For registration opportunity provisions, they can send  an investigator to the agency to observe whether the agency is offering  people the opportunity to register as part of their standard transactions.  However, officials noted there is no observation they can conduct to  determine if list maintenance is occurring as required. As such, officials  stated that DOJ is uniquely dependent on information and data from the  states and local jurisdictions to indicate whether list maintenance efforts  are taking place and what type. Officials further noted that they may have  reduced time to analyze data or otherwise pursue more general  enforcement efforts in time periods where the Section is overseeing a  high number of defensive cases (ones in which the U.S. government is  the defendant)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOJ\u2019s Public Integrity Section and U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices Initiated Matters and Filed Cases to Address Potential Election Fraud", "paragraphs": ["Federal, state, and local authorities share responsibility for addressing  allegations of election fraud.

Officials also  identified limitations with using these selected sources. In particular, three  of the six selected data sources consist of administrative records  collected for purposes other than voter registration, which can present  some challenges when election officials use these sources to maintain  their voter registration lists. For example, election officials noted that  such data sources may inaccurately indicate that registrants moved  unless election officials conduct additional work to verify the information.  In addition, these data sources may not include the records for some  registrants who are deceased and should be removed from the voter  registration lists. Appendix III includes a description of a range of data  sources states may use to maintain their voter registration lists.", "With regard to possible election fraud, state officials from all five selected  states we visited noted that list maintenance activities in general help to  identify or prevent election fraud because accurate and complete voter  registration lists make it more difficult for individuals to commit fraud.  Specifically, duplicate registrations\u2014more than one registration for the  same person across election jurisdictions\u2014and ineligible registrations,  such as those for deceased individuals, if present in voter registration  lists, may provide opportunities for a person to vote more than once or  vote using someone else\u2019s identity. Thus, registration lists that contain  one registration for each eligible registrant with accurate and current  identifying information help to prevent election fraud from occurring. The  majority of election officials we interviewed did not specify any one data  source used to identify election fraud; however, state officials from  Michigan and Oregon noted that the limited instances of election fraud in  their states, in their view, is in part the result of their strong voter  registration list maintenance efforts which have helped to reduce  opportunities for fraud.", "In using data sources as a tool for maintaining voter registration lists,  state and local election offices utilize data-matching procedures by which  attributes of one registration record are compared to attributes of another  record from another database or list to identify registrants who should be  removed from voter registration lists under the NVRA\u2019s removal  categories. States are required to have computerized statewide voter  registration lists, which allow election officials to conduct electronic data  matching of their voter registration list to other databases or lists.

False positive matches  pose risks that election officials may improperly remove registrants from voter  registration lists. Data matching can also result in improper indications of a non-match  when a match should be indicated (false negatives), posing risks that election officials  may fail to remove ineligible registrants from voter registration lists.

As previously discussed,  under the NVRA, data that indicate a registrant\u2019s change of address and  a potential move can be used to start the address confirmation notice  process, but cannot, on their own, result in the automatic removal of  registrants from voter registration lists."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Postal Service National Change of Address (NCOA)", "paragraphs": ["The NCOA database comprises change-of-address records with the  names and addresses of individuals, families, and businesses who filed a  change of address with the U.S. Postal Service. Election officials can  access the NCOA data by obtaining a license to directly receive the data  from the U.S. Postal Service or having their voter registration list  processed by a licensed third-party service provider.", "Election officials in the five states we visited compare selected records or  the entire voter registration list against the NCOA database at the state or  local level and at varying frequency to identify registrants who have  potentially moved and to start the address confirmation and registrant  removal process. For example Nebraska, Oregon, and Virginia state  election officials said that they compare their statewide voter registration  lists to NCOA on a bi-annual, monthly, and annual basis, respectively, to  identify registrants who have potentially moved. In contrast, Florida and  Michigan officials said they do not use NCOA data at the state level,  though state laws provide local election officials the option of comparing  their local jurisdiction\u2019s voter registration list to NCOA when they conduct  list maintenance activities related to changes in address. Although initial  data comparisons of NCOA with the voter registration lists can be  conducted at either the state or local level, in all of the states we visited  when the results of the NCOA data-matching indicated a potential move,  local election officials managed the results of the confirmation notices that  were sent to registrants to confirm their address. Local election officials  subsequently updated addresses on the voter registration lists with  responses they received from the confirmation notices, or flagged  registrants for potential removal if the registrants did not respond to the  confirmation notice or the notice was returned undeliverable.", "State election officials from Nebraska, Oregon, and Virginia, and local  officials from five of the jurisdictions we visited, reported that the primary  benefit to using NCOA data is that it helps them to maintain accurate  voter registration lists by (1) providing current and accurate addresses for  their registrants, and (2) identifying registrants who have potentially  moved and no longer reside in the voting jurisdiction. For example, local  officials in one jurisdiction reported that they mailed approximately 60  percent fewer confirmation notices in 2017 compared to 2010 due to  improvements in the accuracy of address information in their voter  registration lists after using NCOA data during this period. Local officials  in another jurisdiction reported they used the NCOA data as part of a one- time list maintenance effort, which generated over 100,000 confirmation  mailings and resulted in the removal of a number of ineligible voters who  no longer resided in the jurisdiction. Election officials also noted that using  NCOA data to update voter registration lists may result in administrative  efficiencies such as a more efficient election administration process and  cost savings. For example, state officials from Oregon, a vote-by-mail  state, said that NCOA data help them to maintain clean voter registration  lists by providing current and accurate addresses for their registrants,  which reduces mailing costs incurred from sending ballots to individuals  who have moved out of the state. Further, local officials from one  jurisdiction said that using NCOA data helped to reduce the number of  address errors in the poll books and, as a result, decrease the number of  registrants voting by provisional ballots on Election Day.", "A report we reviewed and election officials we interviewed cited a number  of limitations to using NCOA data for voter registration list maintenance  purposes. Specifically, in 2015 the U.S. Postal Service Office of the  Inspector General reported that the NCOA data do not capture all change  of address information because people do not always notify the U.S.  Postal Service when they move. As a result, election officials may not  be able to identify registrants who do not report changes of address to the  U.S. Postal Service. Another limitation election officials cited is that an  indication of a change in address in NCOA data does not necessarily  reflect a change in residence, which is what determines the eligibility of a  registrant to vote in a given election jurisdiction. According to U.S. Postal  Service officials, the main purpose of the NCOA database is to maintain  current and updated addresses for mail delivery and a change of address  form may reflect a change in mailing address rather than a permanent  change in residence.", "Nebraska, Oregon, and Virginia state officials and officials from three  local jurisdictions reported that they have difficulty determining whether a  registrant\u2019s change in address as indicated in the NCOA data is a  permanent change in residence or a change in mailing address due to a  temporary move or other mailing needs. For example, military personnel  may prefer to maintain their voter registration at their home of record.  Upon assignment to another duty location they may file a change of  address with postal authorities for mailing purposes, even if it is not a  change of residence for voting purposes. Officials from two local  jurisdictions reported similar issues for individuals who retain residency in  the jurisdiction while attending college outside the jurisdiction. Further,  registrants who had vacation homes outside the jurisdiction in the  summer or winter months could be identified as registrants who  potentially changed residences on a permanent basis using the NCOA  data, according to Nebraska election officials. As a result of the potential  difference between mailing and residential addresses, Virginia state  election officials and election officials from two local jurisdictions reported  that registrants may be inaccurately flagged for confirmation mailings.  They told us that registrants would not be automatically removed after  being flagged for confirmation mailings; however, they would be required  to respond to the mailing or vote in one of the next two federal elections,  as prescribed by the NVRA, to stay on the voter registration list.", "Officials also told us that they may have to take additional steps to use  NCOA data to identify registrants who potentially moved and to update  voter registration lists. For example, officials from one local jurisdiction  that matches its county voter registration list to NCOA data noted that it  can take a significant amount of time and resources to standardize their  voter registration data to the NCOA format and to calibrate their data  matching procedures to avoid false positive matches. Such false positive  matches would inaccurately indicate an address change. These local  officials said that they take steps to ensure that they do not get an  indication of a change in address based on the standardization of an  address (e.g. a \u201cStreet\u201d to \u201cST\u201d difference in address between the two  data sources). Oregon state election officials and officials from one local  jurisdiction further noted that they may have to do additional work to  determine the appropriate election jurisdiction to which the address in the  NCOA data should be assigned. Officials explained that some street  addresses or buildings, like apartment complexes, cross election  jurisdiction boundaries, which makes it difficult to determine within which  election jurisdiction an address or a specific unit of an apartment complex  falls. Oregon state officials said that local tax assessor data may help  election officials reconcile these jurisdictional boundary issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program (Crosscheck)", "paragraphs": ["Crosscheck is an interstate data sharing program that compares  participating states\u2019 voter registration lists against one another to identify  registrants who are registered in more than one state, which may indicate  a move, and to identify individuals who may have voted in more than one  state.

Oregon and  Florida state officials explained that they did not use the Crosscheck data  they received to conduct any voter registration list maintenance activities.  Michigan, Nebraska, and Virginia state officials said that they received  and processed Crosscheck data at the state level before sending a  subset of results to the local jurisdictions to conduct additional verification  and list maintenance activities.", "According to some state and local election officials we interviewed,  Crosscheck data can be beneficial as one of the data sources used to  identify registrants who may have moved out of state or whose moves are  not captured by other data sources.

Further, state election officials from Virginia and election  officials from one jurisdiction reported that the fact that neighboring states  participate in the Crosscheck program is particularly beneficial to them  because their residents are more likely to move to neighboring states and  the Crosscheck data may capture the change in residence if these  residents also registered to vote in the neighboring states.", "Nebraska state officials also noted that Crosscheck data complement the  NCOA change of address data. In particular, Crosscheck data can  provide information on registrants who did not record change of address  information under NCOA, who had not responded to a notice sent as a  result of NCOA data and had moved a second time, or whose moves  were not recent and may not be captured in the most recent change of  address information provided by NCOA. Nebraska state officials noted  that the Crosscheck data were particularly helpful in this manner the first  year that Nebraska participated in Crosscheck and whenever a new state  joined the program. In addition, election officials from Nebraska and state  officials from Michigan identified Crosscheck data on possible instances  of double voting as a source which could potentially help determine whether an individual might have voted in two or more states. For  example, officials from two local jurisdictions said that they identified a  few potential instances of double voting using Crosscheck data. They  referred these instances of potential double voting to their Secretary of  State.", "According to reports we reviewed and state officials we interviewed in all  five states we visited, Crosscheck data contain numerous matches when  a non-match should be indicated (false-positive matches) because the  program uses matching criteria that rely on data elements, such as  names and birth dates, that may be shared by more than one person.  Specifically, the Crosscheck program matches participating states\u2019 voter  registration information by comparing registrants\u2019 first name, last name,  and date of birth. However, according to reports we reviewed, the odds  are sufficiently high that two registrants could have the same name and  birth date in groups as large as statewide (or multistate) voter registration  lists. Nebraska state officials noted that when there were four  participating Crosscheck states in 2005, a match indicating a duplicate  registration was more likely to be a valid match (rather than a false  positive); however as the number of participating states increased, the  quality of the matched results has dropped substantially. Oregon state  officials told us that they submitted data to the Crosscheck program in  2012 and that many of the resulting 20,000 potential duplicate registration  matches were false-positive matches. Florida state officials also expressed concern about the reliability and quality of the matching  criteria, in addition to the number of false positive matches in the data  they received.", "In addition, a study on double voting found that Crosscheck data may not  provide enough information for election officials to determine whether a  match indicating potential duplicate registrations or double voting is  valid. As previously discussed, Crosscheck results for potential  duplicate registrations are based on a match of the first name, last name,  and date of birth. Crosscheck results provided to participating states may  also include additional information\u2014such as registrants\u2019 middle name,  suffixes, registration address, and the last four digits of a registrant\u2019s  Social Security number, if available\u2014which election officials can use to  help determine whether a match is a valid indication of a duplicate  registration. In particular, the last four digits of the Social Security  number can help distinguish between two distinct individuals who happen  to share the same first name, last name, and date of birth. Using  Crosscheck data returned to Iowa in 2012 and 2014, the study found that  two-thirds of potential duplicate registrations identified by Crosscheck  data did not include the last four digits of the Social Security number  associated with at least one of the registration records in the match.  Thus, the study concluded that more often than not, an election  administrator would not have enough information to distinguish which  matches are valid indications of duplicate registrations.", "Further, Nebraska state officials noted that the reliability of the data  provided by participating states can affect the reliability of Crosscheck  information on double voting. For example, Nebraska state officials  reported that one state incorrectly sent Crosscheck its 2014 voting history  data the year participating states were to provide their 2016 data to the  Crosscheck program. These officials noted that the incorrect voter history  data made it appear as though many people had double voted. Nebraska  officials said that once they identified this issue, they omitted any  matched results involving the state that had provided the 2014 data from  their review of registrants who potentially double voted.", "According to the Crosscheck 2014 Participation Guide, processing the  duplicate registrations and researching possible double votes require a  commitment of time from state and local officials. State election officials  from Michigan, Nebraska, Oregon, and Virginia and officials from two  local jurisdictions told us that they have spent a significant amount of time  and staff resources to review the Crosscheck data and determine which  matched records represent valid matches. State officials from the three  states that participated in Crosscheck for multiple years (Michigan,  Nebraska, and Virginia) said they implemented additional criteria to refine  the Crosscheck data they received in order to identify valid matches of  potentially duplicate registrations and send confirmation notices,  according to the NVRA requirements. For example, Michigan state  officials said that they further filter the Crosscheck results they receive to  determine valid potential matches of duplicate registrations. Specifically,  they filter Crosscheck results to include duplicate registrations where the  registrants\u2019 first names, middle initials, last names, dates of birth, and last  four digits of Social Security numbers are an exact match. In addition,  state election officials review the registration dates provided in the  Crosscheck results to confirm that the registrant\u2019s most recent voter  registration activity occurred outside of Michigan before providing a  refined list of valid potential matches to responsible local officials who  conduct the address confirmation process. In its June 2017 Annual List  Maintenance Report, Virginia state officials reported that they also review  whether the last four digits of the Social Security number on Crosscheck  results they receive match, to determine valid potential matches of  duplicate registrations.", "While election officials from two jurisdictions we visited identified  Crosscheck as a source which helped them identify potential instances of  election fraud, such as instances of double voting, Nebraska state  officials also noted the data were not generally reliable for these purposes  without additional investigation. According to one study we reviewed,  Crosscheck data on both double voting and duplicate registrations yield a  high number of false-positive matches. Additionally, in another report,  the New Hampshire Department of State found that of approximately  90,000 match records of duplicate registrations New Hampshire received  from Crosscheck in 2017, only a small portion of the records were  considered potential instances of double voting.", "Election officials can use the returned mail from targeted list maintenance  mailing efforts and returned \u201cundeliverable\u201d mail from other mailings to  registrants to send address confirmation notices to registrants who have  potentially moved outside the election jurisdiction. These confirmation  notices are subsequently used to update addresses on the voter  registration lists with results of the confirmation mailing or flag registrants  for potential removal. Specifically, targeted list maintenance mailing  efforts may include sending a notice to all or a group of registrants in  order to determine whether the registrant may have moved from the  address on record. For example, Florida law states that local election  officials can send notices to registrants who have not voted in the last 2  years and who have not made a written request that their registration be  updated during the two year period. Targeted list maintenance mailing  efforts may result in either a response from the registrants or returned  undeliverable mail. Returned undeliverable mail occurs when the U.S.  Postal Service cannot deliver mail to the address specified on the label,  indicating a potential change in the registrant\u2019s address and therefore  residence. In addition to targeted list maintenance mailings, election  offices may send other notices\u2014such as sample ballots, or information  about changes in polling locations\u2014which may also generate returned  undeliverable mail. See figure 13 for an example of other voter  registration notices (not part of a targeted list maintenance effort) that  may be returned to election officials as undeliverable and therefore  indicate a potential move.", "Election officials from all five states we visited use returned mail from  targeted list maintenance mailing efforts, or from other mailings to voters,  to update registrants\u2019 addresses or to send a notice to the registrants to  confirm their address.", "According to Nebraska state election officials, returned undeliverable mail  is a valuable tool for identifying registrants who may have moved. Local  election officials we spoke with also said that returned undeliverable mail  can provide them with a timely indication that a registrant has potentially  moved. Furthermore, election officials told us that because mailings can  be conducted on a periodic basis, processing returned mail at the time of  receipt can help election officials distribute the list maintenance workload  throughout the year. Specifically, election officials from four local  jurisdictions said that returned undeliverable mail from voter notices sent  to registrants periodically throughout the year is usually a more recent  indicator of registrants\u2019 changes in address compared to largescale list  maintenance activities such as an annual mailing based on NCOA data.  Further, officials from one local jurisdiction also noted that staying on top  of returned undeliverable mail throughout the year helps reduce the  workload during the state\u2019s annual NCOA confirmation mailing, which  would otherwise be too big to manage if the jurisdiction only processed  address changes once a year.", "According to reports we reviewed as well as officials we interviewed,  returned undeliverable mail may not be a reliable indicator that a person  has moved, which can result in an inflation of the number of registrants  who are flagged as inactive. For example, in 2015, the U.S. Postal  Service Office of the Inspector General reported that approximately 60  percent of returned undeliverable mail is a result of the mail not getting  delivered by postal service employees or insufficient address information  on the mail, as opposed to the registrant having moved without notifying  the U.S. Postal Service. Further, according to one report we reviewed, a  registrant may not have received the mailing, or the mailing may be  returned undeliverable for a number of reasons, including that the  registrant may be temporarily away from his/her permanent residence;  may not be listed on the mailbox of the residential address such as when  the registrant shares an address with roommates or family members; or  may live in a non-traditional residence such as homeless shelter or  government building that will not accept mail for residents.", "In addition, Virginia state officials noted that using returned undeliverable  mail can inflate the number of registrants who are flagged as inactive and  can also result in additional costs. Specifically, these state election  officials told us that they usually have a low response rate from  registrants for mailings, including targeted mailings for list maintenance  purposes or confirmation mailings. Registrants who are sent a  confirmation notice or do not respond to confirmation mailings are then  generally flagged as inactive. Nebraska state officials said that having  inactive registrants on the registration lists has resulted in costs to local  jurisdictions in the past because local officials were formerly required to  mail a ballot to all registered voters, including those that were on the  inactive list, when a special election was conducted by mail. Further,  local election officials in one state said that inflated numbers of inactive  registrants on voter registrations lists may result in fewer than needed  voting precincts, to the extent that election officials determine the number  of precincts based only on the number of active registrants on the lists."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data Sources Used to Identify Deceased Registrants", "paragraphs": ["The NVRA provides for states to remove deceased registrants from  registration lists by reason of death.

The  public DMF accounts for about 19 percent fewer death records than the  full death file. The Social Security Act limits the sharing of the full death  file to federal benefit-paying agencies, and other specifically enumerated  purposes.", "Generally, DMF records include the Social Security number, full name,  date of birth, and date of death of deceased individuals. Agencies or  other entities, including election administrators, having a legitimate  business purpose for the information can purchase the DMF from the  National Technical Information Service of the U.S. Department of  Commerce, which is authorized to distribute the DMF. Subscribers to the  DMF are required to purchase monthly or weekly updates to the DMF to  ensure that the records are up-to-date.", "Of the five states we visited, Florida, Michigan, Oregon, and Virginia  compare their statewide voter registration list against DMF data on a  regular basis, and Nebraska used the data once in 2014, to identify and  remove registrants who had died.

For example, Virginia state law provides that local election officials have  the authority to determine the qualification of an applicant for  registration. Further, the Virginia law requires election officials to send  a cancellation notice once a voter registration record is cancelled due to  death. As a result, Virginia state officials forward all valid matches of  potentially deceased registrants to the responsible local official who  reviews the match, marks the registrant as deceased in the voter  registration database, cancels the registration, and sends a cancellation  notice. In contrast, Michigan law allows either state or local officials to  cancel a voter registration upon receipt of reliable information that the  registrant is deceased. In addition, according to Michigan state election  officials we met with, there is no legal requirement for officials to send  notices of cancellation due to death. Michigan state election officials told us that they cancel voter registrations based on data-matching with  DMF data at the state level.", "State election officials from all five selected states and officials from one  local jurisdiction reported that they have found DMF data to be useful for  identifying registrants who have died. Further, state election officials from  four selected states stated that the DMF data are accurate and reliable.  For example, officials said that they have experienced very few instances  where they have had to reverse cancelled registrations because a  registrant was incorrectly identified as deceased based on DMF data.  Nebraska and Oregon state officials also noted that DMF data are  particularly useful for identifying registrants who died out of state. Officials  said that out-of-state death information would not be captured by other  data sources they use, such as state vital records data. In addition,  Michigan state officials noted that historically they would receive  notification of a person\u2019s death closer to the date of death when using  DMF data than when using death data from the state vital records  office.", "We previously reported that state-reported deaths, which the DMF does  not include, are expected to account for a larger proportion of all Social  Security Administration death records over time. As a result, we  reported that agencies that purchase the DMF, including election offices,  will likely continue to access fewer records over time as compared with  those government agencies that obtain the Social Security  Administration\u2019s full death file. We also reported that because the  deaths reported by states are generally more accurate than other death  information reported to the Social Security Administration by post offices,  financial institutions, and other government agencies, it is likely that  agencies using the DMF could encounter more errors than agencies  using the Social Security Administration\u2019s full death file. According to  Social Security Administration officials, Social Security death data are  accurate when used to administer the Social Security Administration  benefit programs, which includes removing deceased individuals from the  beneficiary rolls and informing surviving spouses and children of their  eligibility for benefits. Virginia state officials further noted that DMF death  information can be less timely in identifying an individual as deceased  when compared to state death records because state records are  collected during the death certification process while the Social Security  Administration relies on the transmission of information after the death  certification from other entities, such as other government agencies, to  identify an individual as deceased."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Vital Records", "paragraphs": ["Election officials can also use state vital records to identify and remove  registrants who are deceased from their voter registration lists.

Nebraska state officials also noted that state death records  can help prevent fraudulent registrations because state officials are able  to check new registrations against death records received from the state  health department.", "Nebraska state officials and officials from two local jurisdictions said that  one limitation of state death records is that they generally only include  information on deaths that have occurred in the state, and as a result  election officials lack death records for residents who died out of state.

Officials  explained that the lag in the death notification when using the state death  records was due to low participation rates in the state\u2019s Electronic Death  Registration System when the system was first implemented. Michigan  state election officials noted that state death records have improved and  are timelier as the participation rate in the state Electronic Death  Registration System has increased in recent years.

We also  selected state and local election offices in five states and conducted  interviews with election officials to obtain information on policies and  procedures for using selected data sources, and perspectives on their  benefits and limitations.

The  National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) specifies certain  categories under which election officials may remove registrants from  voter registration lists including:  1.  if a registrant has moved outside of a jurisdiction and either (a)  confirmed the move in writing or (b) failed to respond to an address  confirmation mailing and failed to vote in two consecutive federal  general elections subsequent to the mailing;  2.  death of the registrant;  3.  criminal conviction of the registrant, as provided for in state law; and  4.  mental incapacity of the registrant, as provided for in state law.", "We asked state election directors to identify the sources from which data  were received at either the state or local level at any point between  January 2017 and May 2018. We summarized responses from election  directors in 35 states and the District of Columbia to identify commonly  received data sources. Table 6 provides a summary of responses to the  structured questionnaire, with the data sources organized according to  the NVRA categories that may be used to remove registrants from voter  lists.", "From the list of commonly received sources above, we then selected six  data sources that can be used to address the following NVRA categories  for removing registrants\u2014move outside election jurisdiction, death, and,  disqualifying criminal conviction. These categories each account for more  than 1 percent of total removals from voter registration lists nationwide,  based on the most recent data reported to the U.S. Election Assistance  Commission. We did not select any data source that addresses the  \u201cdisqualifying mental incapacity\u201d NVRA removal category since it  accounted for less than 1 percent of total removals nationwide for this  time period. Specifically, we selected three sources that address moves,  two sources that address deceased registrants, and one source that  addresses disqualifying criminal convictions, to generally reflect recent  data reported on the distribution of registrant removals, by removal  category, from voter registration lists nationwide.", "We also selected (a) at least one nationwide source that captures data  from all states; (b) at least one source that only includes data specific to  the particular state or local jurisdiction that receives data from the source;  and (c) one interstate data exchange that involves the sharing of data  between multiple states. We selected sources from each of these  categories in order to identify potential issues that may arise when  election officials match their voter registration data with various other  types of data sources.
