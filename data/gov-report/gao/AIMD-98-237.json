The contractor was tasked with analyzing the software code using a software conversion tool, providing the tool\u2019s recommendations to VBA analysts, and making renovations, once approved by VBA analysts. However, the Project Manager informed us that only 35 percent of the renovations could be made using the tool. The remaining 65 percent must be made by the analysts because they involve benefit calculations or other issues that the tool cannot handle. These same analysts must also review and test all Year 2000 changes, including those made by the contractor, as well as continue to work on legislative mandates, special projects, and other changes before 2000. In commenting on a draft of this report, VA stated that VBA\u2019s compensation and pension online application is now 59 percent compliant, up from the 18 percent noted in our report. VBA\u2019s Year 2000 Project Manager told us that the progress was due to use of a software development tool and that additional resources had been assigned to this project, as we recommended.

For example, it did not complete renovation in April 1998, as originally planned, or in June 1998, as rescheduled. According to VBA\u2019s Year 2000 Project Manager, the contractor did not assign sufficient staff to the project and did not have the expertise to perform the work on time.

Further, we expressed concerns that VHA had not completed an inventory of its COTS products, facility-related systems and equipment, and biomedical devices.", "The medical facilities still have not completed their assessment of locally developed and/or modified VISTA applications. The most recent information shows that about 76 percent of these applications had been assessed as of May 31, 1998. Of the applications assessed, 16 percent are noncompliant. All medical facilities were scheduled to complete renovations by July 1998. According to the VHA Year 2000 Project Manager, the facilities did not meet this date. He also added that the project office is not aware of any modifications by the medical facilities to the VISTA applications involving mission-critical functions. Recognizing that the medical facilities are behind schedule, VHA\u2019s Year 2000 Project Manager has told us that the medical facilities have been informed that if they cannot assess or renovate their locally developed or modified VISTA software applications in time\u2014as yet unspecified\u2014they will have to replace them with unmodified national versions. This appears to be a viable solution since VHA has reportedly renovated 100 percent of its VISTA applications, and 93 percent of these have been validated.", "A second area of concern relates to the Year 2000 compliance status of VHA\u2019s COTS software. VHA has over 3,000 such products, supplied by nearly 1,000 vendors, for use in its offices and medical facilities nationwide. Its strategy for determining the Year 2000 compliance status of these products is to request the information from the manufacturers. VHA, however, has had difficulty in obtaining this information. Since November 1997, it has sent letters to 566 manufacturers requesting compliance information; as of June 1998, 260 responses had been received, leaving over 300 outstanding. The Year 2000 Project Manager informed us that they will continue to send follow-up letters to nonresponding manufacturers.", "The reliability of the information received from COTS vendors may also be an issue. For example, one large COTS software manufacturer that initially provided documentation stating that all its products were compliant, recently published \u201cmore detailed\u201d information stating that some of its products were, in fact, not fully compliant. VHA is now reviewing this additional information to determine what needs to be done at the headquarters and field levels to ensure Year 2000 compliance.", "A third area of risk involves the Year 2000 compliance status of VHA\u2019s facility-related systems and equipment, such as heating, ventilating, and air conditioning equipment. As with its Year 2000 strategy for COTS products, VHA relies on the manufacturers for compliance information on their products. It sent a letter to over 200 facility systems/equipment manufacturers requesting Year 2000 compliance information. In March 1998, VHA sent follow-up letters to 127 nonrespondents. To date, it has received responses from 93 of the over 200 manufacturers, and most of the 93 manufacturers have indicated that their systems are compliant. The slow response rate is a concern because of its potential impact on the ability of facilities to ensure continued delivery of essential services. For example, heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment are utilized by hospitals to ensure that contaminated air is confined to a specified area of the facility, such as an isolation room or patient ward. If computer systems used to maintain these systems were to fail, any resulting climate fluctuations could adversely affect patient safety.", "The facility-related systems area is difficult to gauge because many of these systems involve a combination of items made by different manufacturers. Year 2000 compliance must be determined for each element. Accordingly, the manufacturer must contact all of its suppliers to determine whether each of the applicable parts of the facility system is compliant. This process can take a long time to complete, and VHA is concerned that it may not have sufficient lead time to replace the product or have it made compliant. The VHA Year 2000 Project Manager informed us that VHA will continue to send follow-up letters to nonresponding manufacturers, as well as work with the Year 2000 Subcommittee on Facilities of the federal government\u2019s CIO Council Committee to increase manufacturer response.", "A fourth area of concern relates to the Year 2000 compliance status of VHA\u2019s biomedical device inventory. Because VHA relies on the manufacturers for compliance information on their products, it has sent a series of letters to the manufacturers requesting information on the compliance status of their devices. About 70 percent of the manufacturers on its list of suppliers have responded with information on their devices; but some high-profile manufacturers have yet to respond. Until the remaining manufacturers respond, VHA will not know the extent to which its current biomedical device inventory is Year 2000 compliant and the cost associated with making its devices compliant. Also, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sent letters to 16,000 biomedical equipment manufacturers. To date, about 10 percent of these manufacturers have responded. The detailed results of our review of VA\u2019s and FDA\u2019s Year 2000 biomedical device programs will be provided in a separate report.", "Lastly, although VHA medical facilities have prepared hospital contingency plans, as required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, our review showed that these plans do not specifically address Year 2000-related failures. Because VHA medical facilities, like other health care facilities in the public and private sectors, are highly dependent upon information technology to carry on their business, Year 2000-induced failures of one or more mission-critical systems can have a severe impact on their ability to deliver patient care. This risk of failure is not limited to the medical facilities\u2019 internal information systems, but includes information and data provided by their business partners\u2014other federal, state, and local agencies as well as local and international private entities\u2014and services provided by the public infrastructure, including power, water, transportation, and voice and data communications companies. VHA also relies on information provided by the manufacturers. VHA cannot, by itself, ensure that its systems-related software applications and/or products are Year 2000 compliant. Accordingly, it is critical that VHA develop business continuity and contingency plans to address the potential Year 2000 failures induced by its business partners and infrastructure service providers, especially those manufacturers who have not provided compliance information to VHA on their products.", "VHA\u2019s Year 2000 Project Manager has acknowledged the need for Year 2000 business continuity and contingency plans. He told us that the Year 2000 Project Office has informed VISNs and medical facilities that they need to address Year 2000-induced failures in their business continuity and contingency plans. Furthermore, VHA also plans to develop a contingency planning guidebook that will assist the medical facilities in preparing Year 2000 business continuity and contingency plans to address all VHA systems and products that may affect patient safety. However, he did not know when the guidebook will be finalized and distributed to the medical facilities for implementation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VBA has made progress in responding to the Year 2000 computer crisis. However, it faces risks in several areas. It has made limited progress in making two key mission-critical applications compliant. For example, computer analysts responsible for renovating the compensation and pension online application have been working on other information technology initiatives, including special projects. VBA also has to reassess some of the COTS products that the vendor previously stated were fully Year 2000 compliant. In addition to these risks, except for the Insurance Service, VBA has not developed business continuity and contingency plans for its program services to ensure that they would continue to operate if Year 2000 failures occur. Not adequately addressing these concerns could delay or interrupt benefits to veterans.", "VHA also has made progress on the Year 2000 problem. However, it also faces several remaining risks because it has not completed Year 2000 assessments of software applications developed or modified by its medical facilities. Furthermore, it still lacks a great deal of compliance information from manufacturers that provide it with COTS products, facility-related systems and equipment, and biomedical devices. These uncertainties are all the more worrisome in light of VHA\u2019s lack of Year 2000 business continuity and contingency plans.

VA was concerned that statements in the report could be taken out of context and unnecessarily alarm veterans. We believe, however, that the report accurately reflects VA\u2019s Year 2000 efforts and our resulting concerns. The report raises concerns surrounding the renovation of two key VBA mission-critical applications, COTS software products, and contingency planning, and the Year 2000 compliance status of VHA\u2019s locally developed software applications, COTS products, facility-related systems, and biomedical devices. Failure to address these concerns may delay or interrupt the issuance of benefits and the provision of medical care to veterans.", "In addition, VA stated that it was concerned that the report portrayed issues, such as COTS products, facility-related systems, and biomedical equipment, as unique to VA. VA stated that, like any other consumer of these products, it is dependent upon manufacturers\u2019 disclosure of their Year 2000 compliance, and some manufacturers are reluctant to supply compliance information on their products despite VA\u2019s attempts to obtain it. We have revised the report to reflect that these issues are not unique to VA.", "Further, VA stated that since some manufacturers indicated that compliance information will not be available until late 1998, it will not spend what it termed unnecessary time developing continuity of business plans based on unrealistic assumptions. VA also stated that the expectation of its having compliance plans in place today is unrealistic considering that we just issued our Business Continuity and Contingency Planning Guide exposure draft in March 1998. We disagree with VA on these issues. First, our February 1997 exposure draft of the Year 2000 Assessment Guide called for agencies to develop realistic contingency plans to ensure the continuity of their core business processes. Second, our May 1997 report reiterates the need for agencies, including VA, to develop contingency plans for their major mission-critical business processes. Since our May 1997 report, only VA\u2019s Insurance Service has developed such a plan. Third, because VA is dependent upon information from service providers and/or manufacturers who have yet to report on the compliance status of their services and/or products, it is critical that VA develop business continuity plans and contingency plans to address these services and/or products in the event that VA does not receive the information on the date promised. Further, if service providers and/or manufacturers provide assurance that their services and/or products are compliant, VA still needs to develop business continuity and contingency plans in the event that these services and/or products do not operate or do not function properly when processing data related to the Year 2000.", "Lastly, VA described actions it has taken and planned to implement our recommendations, as well as a number of technical suggestions to this report. These comments have been incorporated into the report as appropriate and are reprinted in appendix I.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we will not distribute it until 30 days from its date.

Discussed in \u201cAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\u201d section of report. 2. Our report now refers to \u201ccore business processes\u201d as used in our Business Continuity and Contingency Planning Guide. 3. As we stated in our report, the detailed results of our review of VA\u2019s and FDA\u2019s Year 2000 biomedical devices will be provided in a separate report. 4. We modified the report to reflect \u201climited progress\u201d as communicated during our briefing before the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs staff. 5. Our report now refers to \u201climited progress\u201d when discussing VBA\u2019s efforts in renovating two of its key mission-critical software applications\u2014compensation and pension online, and the Beneficiary Identification and Record Locator Sub-System. Regarding COTS products, we have clarified the report to indicate that this problem is not unique to VBA. We also replaced \u201cannounced\u201d with \u201ctold\u201d and added information to point out that a particular vendor is still assessing and testing its products for compliance. 6. We modified the report to delete the word \u201cconsiderable.\u201d Our statement that VHA has not completed its assessment and that it does not know the full extent of the Year 2000 problem at its medical facilities is accurate and consistent with the findings in the report. For example, because VHA is relying on the manufacturers of COTS products, facility-related systems, and biomedical devices to determine the compliance status of their products, it is critical that VHA obtain this information from the manufacturers. It should also consider contacting the manufacturers of COTS products and facility-related systems, who have yet to provide VHA with compliance information, by telephone and/or meet with them. Moreover, given the uncertainties surrounding the compliance status of its local software applications, COTS products, facility-related systems, and biomedical devices, VHA needs to develop business continuity and contingency plans to ensure that core business processes can be carried out in the event that its systems and products do not function properly on and after January 1, 2000. 7. Report revised to reflect agency comments. 8. The report now states that our concerns relate to renovation of two key mission-critical applications. 9. Report revised to say \u201capplication\u201d and reflect milestones for compensation and pension online application. 10. We have added information to clarify the role of the contractor in renovating VBA\u2019s compensation and pension online application. 11. Report changed to reflect agency comments. 12. We added language explaining that according to VBA\u2019s Year 2000 Project Manager, one of VBA\u2019s largest vendors told VBA that some of its products were not compliant and it was beginning to assess and test its product line for Year 2000 compliance. 13. As stated in VA\u2019s comments to our draft report, 73 (about half) of the 147 VISTA software applications require renovation to achieve compliance, as would about 10 percent of the VHA corporate systems applications. 14. We added information to explain VHA\u2019s plans to hire a contractor to conduct an independent verification and validation of VHA\u2019s compliance process for mission-critical systems, especially its corporate systems. 15. Added the percentage of noncompliant applications within the number of locally developed and/or modified VISTA applications assessed as of May 31, 1998. 16.
