Treatment comprises an assortment of formal organized services for people who have abused alcohol, other drugs, or both. Treatment services can include diagnostic assessment; detoxification; and medical, psychiatric, and psychological counseling. Prevention activities focus on individuals who may be at risk for alcohol or other drug problems. These activities include providing information and education that increase knowledge of drug abuse and alternative drug-free life styles, encouraging communities to implement responses to drug use, and drug testing. One federal program that provides both treatment and prevention services is Head Start, which offers prevention activities for young children and supporting community-based activities for parents and other family members. Another example is the Pregnant and Postpartum Women and Infants program. In part, it funds demonstration programs that coordinate and link health promotion and treatment services for substance-using pregnant women and their young children. The program also supports treatment services in residential settings that permit infants and children to live with their substance-using mothers. Other programs also provide services for specific populations, such as high-risk youth; elementary, secondary, and postsecondary students; and veterans.", "Some agencies fund programs whose primary objective is to provide substance abuse treatment and prevention activities. Other agencies\u2019 programs include these activities as one component of a nonsubstance abuse program. For example, the main objective of the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Special Supplemental Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program is to provide nutritious food and nutrition education to women and children who are considered to be at nutritional risk. As part of nutrition education, WIC counsels participants about the dangers of substance abuse. Program participants are also referred to substance abuse counseling, when appropriate.
