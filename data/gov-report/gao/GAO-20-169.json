However, many  facilities were built decades ago and were designed for an inpatient- driven health-care system. These facilities do not align with the agency\u2019s  current wellness approach, which emphasizes outpatient and specialized  care. Additionally, new or expanded facilities are needed to accommodate  veterans returning from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan, who  need different types of services than veterans of earlier conflicts. VHA is  constructing and leasing new facilities to respond to these needs, and it  equips and staffs them through a multi-year process called \u201cactivation.\u201d", "Generally speaking, activation refers to the process of bringing a new  facility into full operation, such as purchasing and installing furniture and  medical equipment as well as hiring staff. From fiscal years 2012 through  2018, VHA spent more than $4 billion on activation activities at 96 new  major medical facilities.", "Previously, we have found that VHA struggled with certain aspects of  activation, such as equipment purchases and cost estimation for the  overall activation process. In 2013, for example, we reported that some  medical equipment did not fit into previously constructed areas of the  medical center in Orlando, Florida, and the building needed to be altered  in order to accommodate the equipment. In addition, in 2017, we found  that VA had minimal supporting documentation for its $341 million  estimate for the cost to activate the medical center in Denver, Colorado,  and as a result we determined that the activation estimate was  unreliable.", "You asked us to review VHA\u2019s efforts to activate new medical facilities.  This report: (1) describes the tasks associated with activation, (2)  determines the extent to which VHA activated selected new medical  facilities within planned time frames, and (3) assesses the extent to which  VHA is able to compare actual activation costs against the estimated total  costs.", "To describe what tasks are associated with activation, we reviewed  relevant VHA documentation, such as VA\u2019s Activation Process Guide,  VA\u2019s Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2018\u20132024, and VHA\u2019s training  modules associated with activation processes. To examine specific activation efforts in greater detail, we obtained documentation and  interviewed officials from 8 of the 13 major medical facilities that reported  that they completed activation in fiscal years 2016 or 2017. We selected  one facility in each geographic region where major activations were  completed during this time period. In cases where a region contained  more than one such facility, we selected facilities that, when considered  with the other selected facilities, reflected a range of facility sizes and  total reported activation costs. For a list of the eight selected facilities and  their reported activation costs, please see appendix I. No medical centers  (i.e., inpatient hospitals) completed activation in 2016 or 2017. Therefore,  to provide context for that type of facility, we also interviewed officials  from a medical center that opened in 2016 about their activation  experiences. The information from all of these facilities is illustrative and  cannot be generalized to facilities agency-wide, but collectively, the  experiences of these facilities provide insight into the tasks associated  with activation. We also interviewed regional officials supporting the  selected sites, and VHA officials responsible for managing activation at  the national level.", "To determine the extent to which VHA activated selected facilities within  planned time frames, we focused on the activation period leading up to  the provision of medical services (i.e., when each service department,  such as dentistry or physical therapy, first treated patients). For each of  the eight selected facilities, we compared the month and year when the  first patient received each service against the month and year officials at  each facility planned to start providing that service.  In making these  calculations, we used the planned dates that were in place at the time of  building acceptance (i.e., the date on which staff gained access to a  facility after construction finished). To determine planned and actual  dates, we asked officials from each of the eight facilities to complete a  form with this information and to provide supporting documentation\u2014such  as plans, written communications, and service logs\u2014when available. We  also interviewed officials from each of the eight selected sites to  determine reasons for any differences between the planned and actual  dates of care for any of the services. To further assess the timeliness of  activation activities, we determined the proportion of medical services at  the selected sites that were provided within 6 months of opening day, as  VA\u2019s Activation Process Guide states that patients can generally expect  all services to be available within that time frame.", "To assess the extent to which VHA is able to compare actual activation  costs against estimated costs, we first evaluated VHA\u2019s process for  developing activation cost estimates. To do so, we reviewed VHA\u2019s cost  estimation tools to determine if they covered the full activation time frame,  and assessed the process that VHA uses to develop cost estimates  against the 12 steps in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide. The evaluation was performed by one analyst and the  conclusions were reviewed and verified by another analyst. To determine  the extent to which VHA compares actual costs against a baseline  estimate, we reviewed cost documentation (including any estimates and  actual costs) from each of the eight selected sites. We assessed the  reliability of the cost data by comparing the data to the supporting  documentary evidence that we received from VHA; interviewing  knowledgeable VHA officials; and reviewing the data for completeness. In  addition, we researched and reviewed relevant legislation pertaining to  the amounts that were authorized for a selection of these projects. The  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. Lastly, we  interviewed officials from the Activations Office, regional support staff,  and finance officials at the selected sites regarding cost estimates and the  extent to which actual costs are compared to those estimates.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2018 to January  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

To  help meet the health care needs of veterans, VHA is planning to complete  approximately 70 new major medical projects between 2020 and 2024.  Activation is one of the key steps that must occur before veterans can  access care at these facilities.", "According to VA\u2019s Activation Process Guide, activation typically involves  activities such as planning for, purchasing, and installing new furniture,  fixtures, and equipment (FF&E), ordering supplies, and hiring staff. For  new buildings, the Guide states that activation activities begin when the  building is being designed, continue through construction, and end when  the facility is fully operational.", "The expenses associated with activation can reflect either one-time  purchases or ongoing expenditures. One time purchases\u2014called non- recurring activation expenses\u2014involve the acquisition of assets such as  furniture or equipment, or payment to a contractor for services such as  equipment installation. Ongoing expenses, or expenses incurred more  than once\u2014called recurring activation expenses\u2014are for staff salaries  and consumable supplies, such as gowns and gloves. After a facility  opens and begins serving patients, facilities are permitted to treat  supplies and the salaries of new staff as activation costs until the site is  serving enough patients to receive funding through one of VA\u2019s regular  funding processes, known as the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation  (VERA). Figure 1 provides examples of recurring and non-recurring  activation expenses.", "The total cost of activation for major lease and major construction projects  can be substantial. The median activation funding that facilities reported  spending on major activations from fiscal year 2012 through 2018 was  approximately $16 million. The four newest hospitals (in Denver, Las  Vegas, Orlando, and New Orleans) spent a cumulative total of more than  $1.9 billion for activation during this time period.", "The types of facilities undergoing activation can vary in size, services  provided, and overall purpose within the VHA healthcare system, as  shown in figure 2. For example, a community-based outpatient clinic  (CBOC) is typically much smaller than a medical center but can provide  primary, specialty, subspecialty, mental health, or any combination of  delivery services that can be appropriately provided in an outpatient  setting. Large medical centers can provide outpatient services as well as  a broad range of inpatient services, including emergency services,  surgery, and acute psychiatric care. Smaller facilities may refer patients to  medical centers for complex treatment.", "National, regional, and local staffs play different roles in the activation  process:  National: VHA\u2019s Activations Office\u2014under the Office of Capital Asset  Management (OCAM)\u2014historically provided ad-hoc support to sites  activating a major lease or construction project, such as providing on-site  training related to the activation process and facilitating input from subject  matter experts within VHA. The office also determines the base amount  of activation funding that sites receive. Officials overseeing the office  stated that its role is being reassessed and that the type of support it  provides for activations may change in light of an internal reorganization  and consideration for VA\u2019s future growth plans.", "Regional: VHA\u2019s18 regional networks, known as Veterans Integrated  Service Networks (VISN), are responsible for the coordination and  oversight of all administrative and clinical activities at health care facilities  within their specified region. A VISN\u2019s role in activation varies depending  on the expertise available at the facility level, but VISNs can help facilities  arrange contracts for services (like laundry or hazardous waste removal);  review a facility\u2019s budget submissions to VHA; and facilitate discussions  with senior management or knowledge-sharing with other sites that have  recently completed activation. The VISNs are also responsible for  distributing activation funding from VHA.", "Local: In addition to providing medical services, medical centers function  as administrative hubs for services in the area. As a result, the medical  center director is ultimately responsible for activating facilities within the  center\u2019s administrative boundary. The medical centers can appoint staff to  manage the activities required for activation. These staff can include the  activations project manager, financial officers, and subject matter experts  like interior designers.

For example, a VHA official from one health-care center said  that the activations team showed the medical care providers a mock-up of  a treatment room and created cardboard models of furniture to help them  select items. The official told us that getting the medical care team\u2019s input  early in the planning process can avoid the need to make costly changes  in order to make the physical space fit the equipment or furniture  requested by the medical care providers.", "Conversely, the building may be designed to accommodate specific  equipment. For example:", "Officials from one facility shared the specifications of the radiology  equipment with the team designing the building in order to leave a  proper amount of space for the equipment.", "Similarly, an annex\u2019s activation staff worked with the resident engineer  to design an enclosed area separate from their main building for a  mobile MRI machine. This design ensured a new MRI machine could  be swapped out in the event of a breakdown without causing a  disruption to the facility\u2019s operations.", "Officials said that they also begin the purchasing process for equipment  and furniture prior to building acceptance. VHA officials stated they work  backwards from the construction endpoint to determine when to order  items. VHA officials told us they need to place orders for certain items\u2014 such as high-tech equipment or made-to-order furniture\u2014well in advance  of the facility\u2019s opening because the items are known to have long  delivery times. For example:", "Officials from one clinic reported they ordered their facility\u2019s imaging  equipment 22 months before they needed it.", "Similarly, an official from a different clinic said that furniture is often  not manufactured until it is ordered, so it can take several months to  arrive.

One facility had 13 services with delays that  ranged from 4 to 6.5 months. Officials said the delays were due to  difficulties recruiting the staff necessary for those services, which  included various types of surgery, radiology, and mental health,  among others. Similarly, difficulties recruiting a dentist at a second  facility delayed dental service 4 months beyond the expected delivery  time frame.", "Equipment at one facility did not fit into some of the rooms and the  space needed to be altered in order to accommodate it. Officials  said that all 12 services were delayed by approximately 1 month so  that the facility could open with all services available, though officials  noted that the full extent to which the equipment issues contributed to  these delays was unknown (i.e., there could have been other causes  that they could not recall.)", "Commissioning issues delayed women\u2019s healthcare services at one  annex by approximately 1 month. Officials said that the air circulation  rate\u2014which needed to be higher in rooms where certain procedures  are performed\u2014was inadequate. As a result, the air exchange had to  be improved before the facility could begin performing the planned  clinical procedures.", "Procurement issues led to delays in providing radiology services at  one facility. Officials told us that x-ray services were delayed by 3  months because the equipment was ordered through the centralized  purchasing process, which took longer than local officials had  anticipated.", "These delays primarily affected services that were originally planned to  be offered within 2 months of building acceptance. While selected  facilities planned to offer approximately 92 percent of services within 2  months of building acceptance, as shown in figure 4, 61 percent were  actually offered within that time frame.", "VHA does not provide a guideline for how much time facilities should  need after building acceptance to provide clinical services. Officials  explained that the appropriate amount of time will vary based upon the  scope of the project, including factors such as the number and kinds of  services offered and the level of effort associated with installing the  equipment (e.g., a replacement hospital will require more effort than a  small outpatient clinic). Thus, we did not determine if facilities were  allotting appropriate amounts of time to complete activation activities and  serve patients. However, VA\u2019s Activation Process Guide provides some  information regarding when full services should be available. The Guide  states that clinical services can be added for up to 6 months after opening  day (i.e., the first day that patients receive any services at the facility).  The Guide further states that facilities may expect to offer services  gradually\u2014versus all on opening day\u2014when services are new to an area.", "Of the 87 services offered by the facilities in our review, 86 were offered  within 6 months of opening day. The remaining service\u2014a clinic that  provides colonoscopy and other related procedures at one facility\u2014 opened on schedule approximately 11 months after opening day. This  facility was replacing another facility that had not previously offered this  service.

In addition, VHA officials said that until recently, the agency  lacked the accounting mechanisms necessary to facilitate comparisons of  a project\u2019s total activation costs against estimated costs; however, while  VHA now possesses these mechanisms, it has not documented the  process for how the new information should be used.", "The Activations Office and facility activation staff annually develop cost  estimates for the upcoming 3 fiscal years using (1) an activation cost  model (the model) and (2) a cost template (the template). According to  Activations Office officials, the model is managed by the Activations  Office and uses inputs such as a facility\u2019s square footage and project  schedule. Activations Office officials also said that the template is typically  completed by facility activation staff and includes inputs such as planned  clinical services as well as estimated staffing, equipment, and supply  costs. While the cost estimate is driven primarily by the model,  information in the template is also considered before annual activation  funds are distributed, according to Activations Office officials. Figure 5  shows the steps for determining and distributing annual activation funds.", "We determined that the model and template do not estimate costs for the  entire duration of a facility\u2019s activation. According to our review of  facilities\u2019 spending data, activation spending for a given facility can occur  over more than 3 fiscal years. All eight of the facilities in our review, for  example, spent activation funds over 4 or 5 fiscal years. Thus, the  estimate the Activations Office would have developed at the beginning of  these projects would not have reflected total activation costs. Moreover,  we did not see evidence that VHA medical facilities independently  develop total activation cost estimates that are appropriate to compare  against total actual costs. None of the eight selected facilities we  reviewed could provide total activation cost estimates appropriate for this  use, according to officials at each facility. Officials from five facilities  stated that they had not developed such estimates, an official from one  facility said that an estimate could not be located and probably had never  been done, and officials from two facilities said that such documentation  could not be located.", "VHA officials said that the existing cost estimation tools reflected the  budgeting process (i.e., the current fiscal year and two future years) and  that they had not previously been required to develop a cost estimate for  the entirety of activation. Officials noted that as the Activations Office\u2019s  role shifts to include more oversight, it will be important for the Office to  have total cost estimates for activation; however, as of September 2019,  VHA did not have any specific plans for how to collect estimates for a  project\u2019s entire activation cost.", "We also found that VHA\u2019s current process for developing activation cost  estimates does not fully align with best practices for developing cost  estimates as established in the GAO Cost Guide (see table 1 below).  VHA\u2019s process minimally met 10 and did not meet 2 of the steps\u2014each of  which reflects multiple best practices\u2014required to develop reliable cost  estimates. A reliable cost estimate is critical to the success of any  program, providing the basis for informed decision-making, realistic  budget formulation and program resourcing, and accountability for results.  VHA officials acknowledged that following these practices would be  valuable for the activations process, and explained that the agency did  not previously incorporate these practices because they had not  assessed the strength of their activation cost estimation process in this  manner.", "Lastly, the Activations Office does not compare existing estimates and  actual activation costs. While the Activations Office develops activation  cost estimates for the upcoming 3 fiscal years and has some capabilities  to track activation costs, to date it has not compared the planned costs to  actual expenses. According to Activations Office officials, they have  historically been unable to track how activation funding was spent at the  facility level, which impeded such comparisons. Starting in fiscal year  2020, officials from the Activations Office plan to use accounting codes  associated with each activation project, which will allow them to track  expenses at the facility level. An internal review conducted in mid-2019 by  the department overseeing the Activations Office concluded that the  agency needed to regularly assess the extent to which activations spent  funds as planned. As of October 2019, however, officials said the office  has not documented the process for how they will deploy their new  accounting oversight capabilities, including which personnel would be  responsible for conducting such comparisons, the frequency of  comparisons, and any follow-up steps that would be considered in the  event of significant differences.", "Without processes for estimating total costs and comparing them against  actual expenses, the Activations Office is limited in its ability to improve  resource planning, budgeting, and allocation\u2014critical elements that  support VA\u2019s stated management priority to enhance data-driven  decision-making. Further, guidance from the Office of Management and  Budget states that agencies should obtain information on actual project  costs and compare them against planned expenses so managers can  have a clear understanding of how resources are being used and whether  cost goals are being met.

Activations Office officials said that the  latter interpretation is accurate and that this transition to ongoing VERA  support should take place within approximately 2 years after opening  day. However, an official from the Activations Office said that a few  facilities have received funding from the Activations Office for more than 2  years after opening because there was no clear definition for when  activation funding should cease.", "The lack of clear definitions regarding what constitutes allowable  activation expenses and when activation funding should end limits VHA\u2019s  ability to consistently and accurately estimate and track activation costs.

However,  VHA does not have a clear understanding of total costs and whether  individual activation projects are spending funds effectively. Because  VHA does not have a process for developing an estimate for the entire  activation cost of a project, the agency lacks a critical baseline that can  inform future spending decisions. In addition, because VHA lacks a  process that describes how officials should compare actual expenses to  that estimate, the agency has no mechanism to regularly identify and  respond to unplanned differences in activation costs. Furthermore,  defining allowable activation expenses would better position VHA to  ensure total cost estimates are consistent from facility to facility. Lastly,  additional clarification on how to estimate activation costs and compare  them against actual expenses would help VHA to more effectively  manage the activations process. Without processes and clear definitions  associated with activation cost measurement, VHA does not have  reasonable assurance that it will be able to effectively manage the  resources associated with activation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to VA:", "The Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Administrative  Operations should develop and document a process for estimating  total activation costs for major medical facility projects.
