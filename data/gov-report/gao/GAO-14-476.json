To assess inconsistency, GAO selected a representative sample of 385 fiscal year 2012 awards and traced them back to agency source records."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although agencies generally reported required contract information, they did not properly report information on assistance awards (e.g., grants or loans), totaling approximately $619 billion in fiscal year 2012. Specifically, 33 of 37 agencies with a budget authority of at least $400 million reported at least one contract. The other four claimed exemptions from reporting, such as the use of non-appropriated funds, but gaps in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance make it unclear whether such exemptions are appropriate. Also, agencies reported required information for at least one assistance award for 1,390 of 2,183 programs listed in a federal catalog. Another 451 programs did not make an award subject to USASpending.gov reporting. However, agencies did not appropriately submit the required information for the remaining 342 programs, although many reported the information after GAO informed them of the omission. Officials with the Millennium Challenge Corporation said that they could not report because its recipients are foreign. However, OMB's guidance describes how to report foreign assistance and other agencies report such awards. OMB has taken steps to improve the completeness of assistance awards on the website, including issuing a memorandum in June 2013 directing agencies to ensure that data on USASpending.gov are consistent with agency financial records. If properly implemented, these procedures could better ensure that agencies report future assistance awards.", "Few awards on the website contained information that was fully consistent with agency records. GAO estimates with 95 percent confidence that between 2 percent and 7 percent of the awards contained information that was fully consistent with agencies' records for all 21 data elements examined. The element that identifies the name of the award recipient was the most consistent, while the elements that describe the award's place of performance were generally the most inconsistent. GAO could not determine whether the remaining data elements were significantly consistent or inconsistent, in large part because of incomplete or inadequate agency records. Four data elements in particular (e.g., program source information and the state of performance) had inadequacies that were significant. This means that for each of the four data elements, at least 10 percent of awards contained unverifiable information. While OMB placed responsibilities on agencies to ensure their reported information is accurate and substantiated by supporting documentation, this approach has had limited effect on the overall quality of the data on the website, reinforcing the need for a more comprehensive oversight process by OMB and more specific guidance from OMB on how agencies are to validate information reported to USASpending.gov. Until these weaknesses are addressed, any effort to use the data will be hampered by uncertainties about accuracy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve reliability of information on the USASpending.gov website, GAO is making recommendations to the Director of OMB to (1) clarify guidance on reporting award information and maintaining supporting records, and (2) develop and implement oversight processes to ensure that award data are consistent with agency records.

For example, a  permanent appropriation makes funds available on the basis of previously  enacted legislation, such as statutory authorization for self-financing  through offsetting collections.

Instead, many titles consisted of shorthand descriptions,  acronyms, or other language that did not convey intent for the funding.  For example, according to an official in the Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy group, personnel often use terminology that is only  understood by other agency officials, without considering whether it  can be understood by the general public.

According to these officials, GSA plans to add this  data in an upcoming service pack in 2014.", "Lack of clear guidance: Multiple agency officials attributed  nondescriptive award titles to a lack of guidance to define what  constitutes a fully descriptive award title. We identified this as an issue  in our March 2010 report, in which we recommended that OMB  provide clarifying guidance on this reporting requirement. As of April  2014, OMB officials stated that the office still concurs with this  recommendation. However, OMB has not yet provided clarifying  guidance. Unless each award has a descriptive title clearly identifying  the purpose of the award, the public may not be able to determine  why the award was made and taxpayer dollars spent.  Incomplete oversight of agency reporting processes: Agency  reporting processes for which there is incomplete oversight to identify  and correct mistakes contributed to several of the significantly  inconsistent data elements. For example, multiple agency officials  attributed inconsistent recipient congressional district information to a  system lookup that automatically generates this information based on  a zip code. They stated that inconsistencies were caused when the  zip code was incomplete or incorrect, or when the lookup table was  out-of-date.", "Further, for the recipient street address and zip code, inconsistencies  occurred, in part, because agencies did not update FPDS-NG with the  correct information. For a new contract, FPDS-NG relies on the  recipient\u2019s unique identifier to automatically populate the recipient\u2019s  address from SAM, but for a modification to an existing contract, the  system uses the address from the base award unless the agency  submits an updated address. Meanwhile, the system for entering  information on assistance awards does not have the capability to  automatically generate address information, so OMB directed  agencies to verify recipients\u2019 addresses against Dun and Bradstreet\u2019s  information, and enter a confidence code, provided by Dun and  Bradstreet, to confirm the information had been verified. However, we  estimate that agencies submitted a confidence code that meets  OMB\u2019s threshold for only about a thirdtransactional assistance awards, and the validation rules applied by  the website do not validate these elements except to ensure that they  are non-blank and, in the case of the zip code, contain five digits.", "Lastly, inconsistencies in the principal place of performance  information were caused, in part, by agency processes that resulted in  the wrong data being reported. For example, officials from the Federal  Highway Administration stated that the agency reported the county  instead of the city because the Federal Aid Highway Program  mandates the use of county names. In another example, the Chief of  the Payment Management Office at the Department of Agriculture  stated that its award tracking system is programmed to use the  business address if a specific principal place of performance address  is not provided. However, these practices are inconsistent with  FFATA\u2019s requirement that agencies report the city, state,  congressional district, and country of performance for each award.  Based on relevant guidance, if work occurs across multiple cities, the  agency should report the city in which the majority of the work took  place. Because there was no oversight to verify that the agencies  were following this guidance, each continued to report information that  was inconsistent with the guidance.", "Weaknesses in OMB\u2019s guidance on data validation likely contributed  to these problems remaining unaddressed. We identified this as an  issue in our March 2010 report, in which we stated that OMB\u2019s  guidance specified that agency data submissions are to be validated  by an appropriate official but did not identify how or by whom. In that  report, we recommended that OMB provide guidance to agencies to  clarify the requirement for validating agency award data. As of April  2014, OMB officials stated that the office still concurs with the  recommendation, and stated that it had initiated a validation process  in its June 2013 memorandum that directed agencies to use data from  their financial systems or other authoritative sources to validate  financial data reported on USASpending.gov.", "However, this validation process only focuses on the award amount  but does not address the remaining 20 data elements. Further, OMB  decided not to implement one oversight mechanism it had previously  considered using\u2014a dashboard displaying the quality of agency data  submissions on the website. In addition, the recently enacted Digital  Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 established  requirements for agency inspectors general and GAO to periodically  review agency spending data. However, because these requirements  do not come into effect until November 2016, it will be some time  before they affect the quality of agency spending data.

For example, our  representative sample contained four assistance awards identified in  USASpending.gov under CFDA program 64.012, Veterans  Prescription Service. However, records provided by the agency did  not identify the CFDA program number nor distinguish funding from a  number of other medical benefits programs.", "Program source agency and account codes: Treasury\u2019s Account  Symbol was selected to be used as the official program source for use  on the website and is made up of two related codes: agency code and  account code. OMB guidance requires agencies to ensure that award  documents contain the predominant Treasury Account Symbol.  However, records provided to us did not include definitive information  adequate to verify the information reported on USASpending.gov for  the data element agency code for 14 percent through 21 percent of  awards and 19 percent through 27 percent for the account code. For  example, officials from Department of Veterans Affairs Data Quality  Services stated that program source information could not be  provided because there was no documented link between the award  and the program source information stored in the financial system. For  another award, the Office of Personnel Management provided a  system screenshot that documented charge account information.

For  example, five contractual transactions for pharmaceuticals, conducted  by the Defense Logistics Agency, were with the same entity but  agency records did not specify the vendor location responsible for  distribution of these pharmaceuticals. In another example, the source  system for an award at the Farm Service Agency did not contain place  of performance information and therefore provided empty spaces to  the system which generates reports to USASpending.gov.", "Several factors contributed to agencies\u2019 lack of records to verify award  information:", "Lack of clear guidance: No guidance on how to substantiate  information reported to USASpending.gov contributed to a lack of  records to verify several data elements. In particular, agencies  generally use electronic systems to manage awards, but the CFDA  program number is not routinely included in the electronic records.  Instead, according to officials at several agencies, the CFDA program  number is reported at the time information is reported to the website  and officials do not document this decision in the system.", "Moreover, in one case, officials stated that the agency relies on an  automated process whereby the address of the recipient of a contract  is reported to USASpending.gov as the place of performance, which  may or may not be correct. As this is an automated process, the  agency does not document place of performance information in the  contract file. By not capturing this information in some authoritative  source, the information displayed on the website is not verifiable.", "Agency compliance with existing guidance: Multiple agency  officials attributed a lack of program source documentation to this  information being stored in a financial system and therefore not  always accessible.

For example, the Federal Highway  Administration issued 12 awards included in our sample, 3 of which  displayed subaward information on the website. A senior financial policy  analyst for the Office of Financial and Management Programs at the  Federal Highway Administration stated that the entering of subaward  information is the responsibility of a state\u2019s Department of Transportation  and not a part of the federal Department of Transportation process. She  added that there is not a process whereby the Department of  Transportation confirms the validity of subaward information entered in  FSRS. As such, officials could not provide agency records with subaward  information for any of the 12 awards included in our sample.

While OMB placed additional  responsibilities on agencies to ensure their reported information was  accurate, our testing of the 2012 awards shows that this approach has  had limited effect on the overall quality of the data. In addition, many of  the specific issues we first identified in 2010, such as unclear award titles  and inaccurate information on place of performance, continue to limit the  reliability of USASpending.gov data. If properly implemented, OMB\u2019s  2013 guidance on linking award financial information to information from  agency financial systems and reporting the results on a quarterly basis  could help address underreporting of awards. However, the ongoing  inaccuracies in reported non-financial award information reinforce the  need for a more comprehensive oversight process. Finally, gaps in  records used to validate the data on the website continue to exist.", "Until these issues are addressed, any effort to validate USASpending.gov  data will be hampered by uncertainties about the accuracy of the data.
