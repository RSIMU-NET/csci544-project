PACS include identification cards, card readers, and other technology that electronically confirm employees' and contractors' identities and validate their access to facilities (see figure). Steps taken include the following:", "OMB issued several memos to clarify agencies' responsibilities. For example, OMB issued a 2011 memo citing Department of Homeland Security (DHS) guidance that agencies must upgrade existing PACS to use identity credentials before using relevant funds for other activities. But, GAO found OMB's oversight efforts are hampered because it lacks baseline data on agencies' implementation of PACS. Without such data, OMB cannot meet its responsibility to ensure agencies adhere to PACS requirements or track progress in implementing federal PACS requirements and achieving the vision of secure, interoperable systems across agencies.", "GSA developed an Approved Products List that identifies products that meet federal requirements through a testing and evaluation program. Federal agencies are required to use the Approved Products List to procure PACS equipment.

The standard  specifies the technical requirements for physical access control systems  to issue secure and reliable identification credentials to federal employees  and contractors for gaining access to federal facilities and information  systems. In order to meet this standard, agencies have begun  implementing enhanced physical access control systems for controlling  employees\u2019 and contractors\u2019 access to buildings. These systems use  personal identity verification (PIV) cards that operate with networked  physical access control systems, so that agencies can make sure that the  employees and contractors who enter federal buildings are who they  claim to be and have the proper authority to enter. To implement this  vision and in response to HSPD-12, standards and guidance also call for  the interoperability of these systems across agencies.\u201d", "Several federal agencies have key government-wide responsibilities for  this effort. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible  for the program\u2019s overall direction and oversight. The General Services  Administration (GSA) is responsible for testing physical access control  systems to ensure they meet security and interoperability standards and  identifying such systems through its Approved Products List. OMB and  the Federal Acquisition Regulation require agencies to use the Approved  Products List when buying physical access control systems to achieve an  integrated approach to physical security. The Interagency Security  Committee (ISC), chaired by the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), plays a key role in ensuring the protection of nondefense buildings  and facilities and security for them in the United States. The Department  of Commerce\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  sets technical specifications that form the basis of standards, including for  example, the minimum requirements for a federal PIV system that meets  the control and security objectives of HSPD -12.", "Implementation of physical access control systems at federal agencies  represents a significant federal investment. For example, over the next 5  years, TSA plans to spend about $73 million to implement physical  access control systems with the bulk of these funds ($51 million) going  toward the acquisition of new systems from the Approved Products List.  TSA is one of hundreds of federal agencies. In addition, according to  GSA officials, GSA has spent millions of dollars to test these systems.  However, a congressional committee and some industry stakeholders  have raised questions about the implementation of this directive,  specifically about the extent to which agencies are using the Approved  Products List to purchase physical access control systems. Not only could  purchasing products not on the Approved Products List lead to wasteful  spending, but such purchases could result in security breaches if, for  example, elements of access credentials are counterfeited, cloned, or  copied, and physical access control systems fail to detect them.", "In support of congressional oversight of federal buildings\u2019 security, you  asked that we examine issues related to agencies\u2019 implementation of  federal physical access control system requirements.

Testing is  performed by either third-party accredited testing labs or GSA- managed testing labs. GSA tests a variety of products and services  including smart cards; physical access control systems; which include  card readers and infrastructure for example; and integrators which  provide or install access control services. According to GSA officials,  GSA has fully tested all physical access control system equipment  included on the Approved Products List and evaluated and approved  the suitability of vendors and system integrators. GSA shares  information about vendors, system integrators and Approved Products  List equipment with federal agencies.  2)  Guidance and support: GSA has taken several actions to improve  guidance and facilitate the implementation of physical access control  systems. First, GSA manages IDManagement.gov, which guides  federal agencies through the process of identifying Approved  Products List-compliant physical access control system equipment.  Second, GSA established the U.S. Access program to enable federal  civilian agencies to issue common HSPD-12 approved credentials to  their employees and contractors.

However, Bureau of Prisons officials  told us that the agency has not implemented physical access control  systems at its institutions (prisons). Bureau of Prisons officials told us  that physical security and screening procedures at prisons are more  stringent than those that occur with typical building-access procedures  as persons and belongings are scanned and searched. Physical  access control system equipment at these prisons may in fact be  problematic because, according to Bureau of Prisons officials, doors  should not automatically be opened based on a PIV card without  manual checks to ensure staff are not under duress or fraudulent  access is being attempted.

For example, some integrators told us that it was not  always clear for what Schedule they should seek approval to be on to  sell their services. Federal regulations and an OMB memo both  mention Schedule 70 as being the appropriate Schedule for  purchasing physical access control systems, but do not explicitly  exclude the use of Schedule 84.", "Complicating matters, some stakeholders told us some companies  are only approved for Schedule 84 because getting approved for both  Schedules was time-consuming and costly, and not worth the effort  given the lack of clarity regarding which Schedule is required.  According to OMB staff, guidance is clear that Schedule 70 should be  used to purchase physical access control equipment because this  equipment is considered to be information technology. OMB staff  explained that their memo on this subject was not intended to  introduce ambiguity on the issue of what Schedule is appropriate for  use, but to accommodate practices at the Department of Defense,  which performs some of its own product testing separate from GSA\u2019s  testing program. According to GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide  Policy (OGP), GSA is aware of the confusion among GSA\u2019s federal  customers regarding GSA Schedule use. To address this situation,  GSA convened a \u201creverse industry\u201d training event in September 2018,  at which industry representatives provided feedback to GSA on the  acquisition process and ways that it could be improved, including  issues pertaining to acquisitions related to physical access control  systems. According to federal officials, one point of emphasis by  industry was that purchasing physical access control equipment from  the Approved Products List was not sufficient for having a functioning  physical access control system; system integration was also  necessary. During this event, GSA officials took the position that both  Schedule 70 and Schedule 84 could be used to purchase physical  access control systems, but OMB staff maintain that Schedule 70 is  preferred. OMB staff explained that Schedule 84 does not have the  testing and evaluation requirements for PACS equipment on it that  Schedule 70 does.  According to OMB, this frustrates industry  vendors that follow the Schedule 70 approval process because these  vendors are spending time and money to get approved for Schedule  70, while others are still selling their equipment on Schedule 84 and  skirting this process because GSA allows the sale of physical access  control system equipment on both Schedules.  Schedule 84 has  historically been used for security hardware while Schedule 70 is used  for information technology.  Since physical access control systems are  essentially information technology systems today, OMB believes that  Schedule 70 should be used exclusively for physical access control  system equipment.", "Adapting legacy systems: According to officials at most of the five  selected agencies, most manufacturers, and all integrators we spoke  to, integrating new physical access control systems\u2019 equipment with  existing legacy systems can be challenging. Some stakeholders told  us that integrating new physical access control systems with old  equipment is often more difficult and more costly than starting from  scratch. As an illustration of this difficulty, TSA officials told us that  integrating new physical access control system equipment with legacy  systems has contributed to delays in the integration of TSA\u2019s newly  installed physical access control system equipment. Partly as a result,  only one TSA region is currently integrated into DHS\u2019 agency-wide  network.", "Security concerns about integrating physical access control  systems: Officials at two of the selected agencies and one system  integrator we spoke to told us that some agency officials are reluctant  to more fully integrate their physical access control systems. This  reluctance is due to concern about a perceived increase in security  risks resulting from more broadly networking physical access control  systems\u2019 equipment and access credentials like PIV cards. However,  other federal officials told us that this concern is unfounded. According  to these officials, integrating agencies\u2019 physical access control  systems will enhance security, increase government efficiency,  reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy by electronically  authenticating the validity of access credentials.", "Lack of trained agency officials: Stakeholders told us they believe  that some federal agency officials have limited knowledge of physical  access control system requirements. According to most physical  access control systems\u2019 manufacturers and integrators we spoke to,  federal agencies\u2019 contracting officers commonly lack sufficient  understanding of federal physical access control system  requirements. This insufficient understanding of physical access  control system requirements may lead contracting officers to award  contracts for the installation of physical access control systems to  under-qualified integrators, which can lead to systems being  improperly deployed or integrated. These experts said that this  situation could lead to security vulnerabilities at these agencies and  expensive future costs. OMB staff told us that it may be desirable to  raise agencies\u2019 awareness of federal physical access control system  requirements, and a DHS official told us that this issue could be  addressed by the training of program staff by GSA who support  contracting officers.", "OMB staff and officials from ISC and GSA indicated that they are aware  of some of the challenges described above, as well as the possibility that  some may be more broadly present across the federal government. Staff  said that OMB and GSA are working with ISC to develop a consolidated  guidance document concerning federal identification credentials.  However, OMB staff told us that this guidance is primarily intended to  consolidate and replace existing guidance documents, and does not  contain new information related to the challenges identified by the  selected agencies or other stakeholders we spoke to. Best practices that  we have previously identified indicate that an interagency mechanism,  such as an interagency group led by component or program-level staff,  can help federal agencies address policy and program challenges. The  guidance of such an interagency group could help agencies to address  the challenges that we identified and that are related to implementing  physical access control systems.", "ISC, with its unique role in addressing interagency security issues, is well- positioned to assess how the physical security community can help to  address the government-wide challenges with physical access control  system implementation. For example, ISC is well-positioned to determine  through its membership the extent to which the challenges we identified  are present across the federal government. In addition, ISC may be able  to harness recent interagency efforts, such as the interagency information  sharing and collaboration that produced ISC\u2019s guidance on planning and  managing security resources, to develop guidance addressing agencies\u2019  cost issues through the mechanisms that we have previously identified,  such as leveraging resources. Further, working with GSA, ISC could help  to resolve confusion about which Schedule is the appropriate contracting  vehicle, to the extent that this lack of clarity persists. ISC may also be  positioned to provide a venue for information sharing to allow agencies to  address training needs, such as those related to technical challenges,  associated with legacy equipment and establish compatible policies to  address this challenge. Finally, ISC\u2019s experience with interagency  communication and collaboration could also facilitate agencies\u2019 response  to concerns about the benefits of interoperable physical access control  systems, and could work to reach consensus on the matter. According to  a senior ISC official, the ISC has updated its countermeasures standard  to assist the physical security community to better understand the  references and policies associated with procuring and installing physical  access control systems. Additionally, an ISC official told GAO that the ISC  has approved commissioning a working group to assess what additional  guidance related to physical access control would be beneficial for to the  federal physical security community. However, without a government- wide review of the challenges we have identified, those challenges will be  difficult to overcome. If these issues are not addressed, the fully  interoperable, physical access control system network envisioned post  September 11, 2001, and the increased security and efficiency that it  would entail, will be difficult to attain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OMB and GSA have taken various actions to help federal agencies  implement GSA-approved physical access control systems.

We also  asked them to provide data, if available, on agencies\u2019 Approved Products  List usage. We interviewed seven physical access control system  manufacturers (AMAG, Gallagher Group, HID Global, Identiv, Lenel,  Software House, and XTec), five integrators (contractors that install the  equipment and connect it to agency networks with software) (Convergint  Technologies, Chenega Corporation, MC Dean, Parsons, and Systems  Engineering, Inc.), as well as other industry organizations\u2014GSA  Schedules Inc., the Secure Technology Alliance, and CertiPath\u2014 based  on multiple recommendations from previous interviews.", "To identify illustrative examples of the progress that individual agencies  have made in using the Approved Products List and implementing other  HSPD-12 requirements, as well as the challenges that they have faced in  doing so, we selected five executive branch agencies.

We interviewed officials from these agencies about the  Approved Products List and collected data on agencies\u2019 purchases of  GSA-approved physical access control system equipment using the  Approved Products List since 2013. Our criteria for agency selection  included agencies with facilities (1) held by non-defense executive branch  agencies; (2) located in the United States; (3) totaling 200 or more  buildings; and, (4) that are geographically dispersed (having buildings in  10 or more states). We also gave consideration to agencies with large  numbers of buildings (choosing four larger, one smaller) and selected at  least two agencies with homeland security responsibilities. We limited our  scope to non-defense agencies because we have ongoing work related to  these issues at the Department of Defense.
