However, agencies could strengthen their controls in key areas that have been consistently recognized as important for effective inventory management. These areas include recording and tracking firearms inventory data; maintaining, controlling, and accounting for firearms inventories; ensuring personal and supervisory accountability for firearms; and requiring investigations, and discipline when deemed appropriate, for individuals determined not to have followed firearms accountability procedures. Although agencies established policies and procedures to control firearms, audits conducted by the Departments of Justice and the Treasury found that agencies did not always follow established procedures, or implement procedures, for conducting periodic inventories, reporting and investigating missing firearms, and securing firearms inventories. Since these weaknesses were identified, we found that agencies have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, actions to strengthen their firearms controls. In addition, 15 of the 18 federal agencies GAO reviewed reported a total of 1,012 firearms as lost, stolen, or otherwise not in their possession between September 30, 1998 and July 2002, further indicating the need for stronger controls. Of these firearms, 188 were recovered, leaving 824 firearms still missing. While we could not determine the exact percentage of agency firearms that were reported lost, stolen, or missing, it appears that these firearms generally accounted for less than 1 percent of agencies' total firearms inventories. In independent reviews of selected missing firearms cases, the Departments of Justice and the Treasury identified instances of firearms recovered in connection with criminal activity or during the course of criminal investigations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In March 2001, the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General  (OIG) reported that over 500 firearms belonging to the U.S. Immigration  and Naturalization Service (INS) were lost, stolen, or missing.

Among other things, GAO\u2019s internal control  standards require agencies to establish physical controls to secure and  safeguard vulnerable assets such as cash, securities, inventories, and  equipment, which might be vulnerable to loss or unauthorized use. In  March 2002, GAO published a supplemental guide for inventory controls,  which summarized fundamental principles that have been successfully  implemented by seven private sector firms noted for outstanding inventory  management.", "GAO internal control standards provide that in establishing internal  controls, agencies should assess the risks associated with asset losses and  establish control activities to help ensure those risks are addressed. The  standards further require that agencies document and monitor control  activities to ensure they are appropriately implemented and are effective  in addressing risk inherent in agency operations.", "In addition to the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act and GAO  standards, two other organizations issued advisory criteria addressing  inventory controls. In June 1995, the Joint Financial Management  Improvement Program issued advisory criteria for implementing and  maintaining inventory systems. The criteria addressed management\u2019s  responsibility to provide guidelines for developing, documenting, and  implementing physical controls to safeguard and provide accountability  for inventory items.

Although these controls provide a framework to assist agencies  in controlling and safeguarding their firearms, agencies should tailor these  controls to meet their unique needs and circumstances, as well as their  risks for firearms losses. Accordingly, the appropriate mix of controls may  vary for each federal law enforcement agency.", "When agencies discover lost, stolen, or missing firearms, they should  reassess their firearms controls to determine why they were not effective  and if they should be modified. This is particularly important when  agencies find that existing controls have not been implemented or have  been implemented but have not prevented the loss of agency firearms, as  was the case with some agencies reviewed by the Departments of Justice  and Treasury OIGs. Internal controls that have been established to  safeguard firearms, but were not appropriate controls based on the  agencies\u2019 needs, or were not implemented or properly applied, provide  little assurance that firearms are safe from loss, theft, or misuse.", "In addition, agencies should document their firearms controls in policies  and procedures.

These efforts include updating and  including accurate descriptions of firearms in its firearms inventory  database, and appointing and training property custodial officers for the  NIH Police Branch. The Fish and Wildlife Service also agreed with the  recommendation, and said that as a result of an internal assessment, the  Service will (1) develop a Web-based firearm training guide addressing  various internal controls over firearms, (2) conduct unscheduled random  checks of firearms against property records, and (3) annually review  reports of any lost and/or stolen firearms to determine if policies and  procedures should be modified to prevent future losses.", "Although not saying whether it agreed with our recommendation, the U.S.  Postal Inspection Service said that it had reviewed the Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government and will assess these  standards along with the results of a firearms review conducted by the  Inspection Service Firearms Task Force.

We appreciate  that the Service provided the proposed update and look forward to  receiving the final updated policy.", "VA expressed concerned about our recommendation, saying that its lack  of firearms losses during the time period of our review was due to its  having appropriate internal controls over firearms. VA further said that its  police officers document the handling of firearms on a daily basis;  generally do not remove their firearms from department property; check  their assigned firearms out of and into the armory each day; conduct  monthly inventories of all firearms, ammunition, and magazines; have  unannounced inventories and spot checks; and conduct independent  annual inventories of firearms.", "Although VA did not report missing firearms during the time period of our  review, the potential exists that firearms could be lost or stolen at some  point in the future. Accordingly, we believe that VA and other agencies we  reviewed should periodically assess their firearms controls, particularly  when their organizations or operations have changed, or when firearms  are identified as missing. These assessments should be conducted to  determine whether established controls have been effective, are still  relevant, or should be modified. For example, VA recently reported that as  of March 2003, police officers at more than 100 of its field sites were  assigned firearms. Prior to 2000, officers at only 27 sites were armed. We  believe that this is a good example of when an organizational change  necessitates a reevaluation of an agency\u2019s firearms controls to reduce the  risk of potential firearms losses. We further believe that federal internal  control standards and other criteria included in our report provide a useful  framework from which to conduct these assessments, and identify  appropriate firearms controls when an agency\u2019s environment has changed,  or when existing controls have not been effective.", "In addition, six agencies requested that we change some of their original  responses to our survey regarding firearms controls, usually to identify  that they had a written policy and procedure addressing a specific control.
