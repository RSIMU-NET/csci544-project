DOD, the Department of State (State) and USAID use SPOT-ES as a repository of information on contracts and contractor personnel in contingency operations; USAID also uses GLAAS to record information about contracts. DOD uses the budget process to identify resources it projects it will need in the next budget year to modernize and operate its systems, but DOD has not updated its life-cycle cost estimate or fully defined and assessed its plans to determine all resources needed to sustain SPOT-ES. For example, DOD has not updated its life-cycle cost estimate since 2010, despite changes to costs due to schedule delays, because officials said the system has proven stable. Also, DOD has not defined some of its plans that involve cost elements that need to be included in the estimate because it accepted the system's previous program management estimates as reported. GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide states that cost estimates should be current and comprehensive.

While some contracting activities have recently exceeded that  threshold\u2014for example, our review of census data for the third quarter of  fiscal year 2014 found that 69 out of 102 contracting activities had  exceeded 85 percent\u2014officials said that they would continue to conduct  the census until all activities did so.", "DOD\u2019s process also cannot provide reasonable assurance that  contractors and contracting officers enter data into SPOT according to the  business rules for two primary reasons. First, the department does not  use its available mechanisms for tracking contractor performance to  promote contractor accountability for entering data correctly and within  prescribed time frames into SPOT. These mechanisms include the  Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), which  contracting officers can use to report on contractors\u2019 performance.  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics officials said that they thought using such mechanisms would be  helpful. Second, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics officials said that contracting officers  sometimes did not oversee contractors\u2019 data input or enter their own  required data.officers in its Operational Contract Support Action Plan for Fiscal Years  2014-2017, which calls for the military departments to issue policy  mandating that their contracting activities populate SPOT with required  data.", "DOD has taken steps that may address contracting  By not having timely and reliable contract and contractor personnel data,  DOD does not have complete visibility into the number of contractors  present in the contingency environment, and for whom the department  may have to develop plans for such services as force protection,  sustenance, and repatriation of injured or deceased contractor personnel.  For example, one official at a DOD combatant command stated that DOD  can more quickly repatriate injured or deceased contractors when their  information is up-to-date and accurate in SPOT. Not using the  mechanisms it already has in place to track contractor performance limits  DOD\u2019s assurance that contractors have abided by business rules to  provide timely and reliable data, and requires DOD officials to devote  additional resources to conducting the quarterly manual census."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SPOT-ES Does Not Receive Timely and Reliable Data from JAMMS Terminals about the Location of Contractor Personnel", "paragraphs": ["JAMMS is a major data source for SPOT-ES to track contractor personnel  in key deployment sites such as dining halls and military airfields;  however, SPOT-ES does not receive timely and reliable data from  JAMMS. DOD policy states that information solutions shall provide,  among other things, reliable, timely, and accurate information.  Moreover, DOD has noted that the purpose of SPOT is to provide the  combatant commander with accurate, real-time information on all  personnel within specified geographic combatant command operations  areas and to enable the department to keep track of all persons deployed  in contingency zones.", "We found examples in which deployed contractors provided three types  of unreliable data to JAMMS: not scanning at all, scanning incorrect  documents, or scanning documents into a terminal that reported back to  SPOT-ES as if it was in a different location. First, a review of data at one  deployed operational area from August 2013 through March 2014 found  that contractor scans in the week preceding the date the data were pulled  represented less than half of the contractors believed to be in the area.  Second, JAMMS terminals can scan incorrect documents because they  can accept bar-coded items that are not identification documents, such as  supermarket loyalty cards, and other identification documents, such as  letters of authorization, that do not contain photos. For example, in the  last two weeks of September 2014, there were almost 15,000 JAMMS  scans in Afghanistan that could not be linked to either a deployment in  SPOT or a Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System  record. Third, officials told us that they sometimes receive erroneous data from  JAMMS terminals about the locations of contractor personnel. For  example, officials at Central Command said that they have received  reports that contractor personnel were at sites that they never visited. We  also reviewed documentation about one site in Afghanistan that reported  that more than 20 percent of records represented individuals who either  never scanned their identification documents or whose most recent scan  was in a country other than Afghanistan.", "We also found that JAMMS data may not always be transmitted to SPOT  in a timely manner. Although DOD officials have indicated an intention to  develop a networking capability that would allow JAMMS data to be  transmitted to SPOT in real time, data are currently transmitted by  uploading compact discs from stand-alone JAMMS terminals to  networked computers. The JAMMS User Manual and the System of  Record Notice for SPOT-ES indicate that JAMMS uploads personnel  movement records to SPOT-ES daily. However, personnel at operating  locations vary in the frequency with which they upload JAMMS location  data into SPOT. For example, SPOT program office officials told us that  data usually are uploaded every several days. In contrast, officials at  Central Command said their data are uploaded about every week, but  that at one site, data for 20 percent of contractor personnel were not  uploaded for 30 days.", "Personnel at operating locations are not consistently ensuring that  JAMMS data are transmitted accurately or in a timely manner into SPOT- ES because they lack comprehensive guidance from DOD that describes  the purpose of JAMMS and its role in supporting plans for different types  of missions. The lack of guidance stems from lack of consensus about  requirements for visibility and accountability\u2014such as what constitutes  \u201cnear real-time\u201d movement tracking\u2014within DOD. Officials at the Joint  Staff and in combatant commands told us that in the absence of such  guidance, they do not know what resources or emphasis to allocate to  correcting problems that they encounter. For example, they could  minimize inaccurate scans by posting a monitor at each JAMMS terminal  to verify that everyone scans a valid identification document, but such an  action has resource implications that could conflict with other command  priorities. Without clear guidance about the purpose of JAMMS, such as  direction about what types of missions it is to support, the department is  not able to help Joint Staff and combatant command planners to  determine where to locate JAMMS terminals and what resources to  allocate to minimize inaccurate scans. For example, combatant  commanders would need more precise data if they expected to use  JAMMS to plan a short-notice operation such as a noncombatant  evacuation than they would to calculate how much to bill contractors for  their employees\u2019 use of on-base dining or medical facilities. Such  guidance could also assist program management officials as they develop  cost estimates and associated plans, as more frequent data uploads or  the potential networking capability described earlier would be more  applicable to some missions than others."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Completed Interoperability Certification Testing but Has Not Fully Registered or Approved SPOT-ES Data", "paragraphs": ["DOD has completed interoperability certification testing between SPOT- ES and its data sources, but has not fully registered or approved the  system\u2019s data to ensure data are visible and trusted."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Has Completed Interoperability Certification Testing for SPOT-ES", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s SPOT-ES program office completed interoperability certification  testing of SPOT-ES with the systems that provide it with data.

We  did not verify figures about the total value of contracts, total number of  contractor personnel, or other attributes of the data. The standard set of  questions we circulated to DOD and USAID asked detailed and technical  questions about the systems. For example, for system architecture we  asked about system interfaces and for DOD to identify the systems that  provide data to SPOT-ES. Similarly, we asked USAID to identify what  systems interface with GLAAS. We also asked about data quality controls  and limitations: for example, we asked DOD and USAID to provide their  perception regarding the data quality of their respective systems for  collecting and reporting contract and contractor personnel data. In the  case of USAID, we also asked for its perception regarding the data  reliability of DOD\u2019s SPOT. We collected responses from DOD and USAID  regarding their contract and contractor personnel data collection systems  and conducted follow-up on their responses when needed.", "To determine the extent to which agencies have developed guidance to  meet statutory data collection and reporting requirements related to  contract support for future contingency operations, we obtained and  reviewed documents, including relevant provisions in State\u2019s Foreign  Affairs Manual; USAID\u2019s Automated Directives System and Acquisition  and Assistance Policy Directives; and DOD Instruction 3020.41,  Operational Contract Support. We analyzed these provisions to determine  whether they addressed each of the eight specific data elements related  to contracts and contractor personnel that are in section 844 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. We also  interviewed officials to learn about how they related departmental or  agency guidance to statutory requirements. At DOD, these included:  officials at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics (Program Support); deputy director of the Joint  Staff for Logistics; and SPOT-ES program office. At State, we met with  officials from the Offices of Logistics Management and Acquisitions  Management in Arlington, Virginia; at USAID, we met with officials from  the Bureau of Management (Office of Management Policy, Budget and  Performance).", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 to February 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following individuals made  contributions to this report: Carole F.
