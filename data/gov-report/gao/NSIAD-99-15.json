Among other things, the plan highlighted the need to reduce poverty and resolve conflicts peacefully. While recognizing that food aid may be a necessary interim approach, the plan encouraged developing countries to become more self-reliant by increasing sustainable agricultural production and their ability to engage in international trade, and by developing or improving social welfare and public works programs to help address the needs of food-insecure people. The plan further noted that governments should work closely with others in their societies, such as nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and the private sector.", "Although the summit action plan is not binding, countries also agreed to (1) review and revise as appropriate national plans, programs, and strategies with a view to achieving food security; (2) establish or improve national mechanisms to set priorities and develop and implement the components of the summit action plan within designated time frames, based on both national and local needs, and provide the necessary resources; and (3) cooperate regionally and internationally in order to reach collective solutions to global issues of food insecurity. They also agreed to monitor implementation of the summit plan, including periodically reporting on their individual progress in meeting the plan\u2019s objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summit Called for Developing Countries to Implement Broad-Based Reforms", "paragraphs": ["The summit placed considerable emphasis on the need for broad-based political, economic, and social reforms to improve food security. For example, summit countries called for the pursuit of democracy, poverty eradication, land reform, gender equality, access to education and health care for all, and development of well-targeted welfare and nutrition safety nets. Other international conferences have suggested that major policy reforms were needed in connection with food security issues. For example, countries that attended the 1974 World Food Conference and the 1979 World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development said they would undertake major economic, social, and political reforms. According to some observers, the most important challenge of food security today is how to bring about major socio-institutional change in food-insecure countries, since previous efforts have met with limited success. According to other observers, there is a growing acceptance on the part of developing countries that policy reform must be addressed if food security is to be achieved. However, reports on progress toward implementing summit objectives that many countries provided to FAO in early 1998 did not contain much information on the extent to which countries have incorporated policy reforms into specific plans for implementing summit objectives.", "As defined by the summit and others, achieving improved world food security by 2015 is largely an economic development problem; however, the summit did not estimate the total resources needed by developing countries to achieve the level of development necessary to cut in half their undernutrition by 2015, much less assess their ability to finance the process themselves. Many developed countries that attended the summit agreed to try to strengthen their individual efforts toward fulfilling a long-standing U.N. target to provide official development assistance equivalent to 0.7 percent of the gross national product each year. However, the countries did not make a firm commitment to this goal, and the United States declined to endorse this target. Assistance from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD)Development Assistance Committee members has been declining in recent years\u2014from about $66.5 billion in 1991 to $52.7 billion in 1997 (measured in 1996 dollars). Total official development assistance from these countries in 1997 represented 0.22 percent of their combined gross national product, compared to 0.32 percent during 1990-94.", "Many developed countries believe that the private sector is a key to resolving the resources problem. Whether the private sector will choose to become more involved in low-income, food-deficit countries may depend on the extent to which developing countries embrace policy reform measures. Private sector resources provided to the developing world have grown dramatically during the 1990s, and by 1997 the private sector accounted for about 75 percent of net resource flows to the developing world, compared to about 34 percent in 1990. However, according to the OECD, due to a number of factors, most of the poorest countries in the developing world have not benefited much from the trend and will need to rely principally on official development assistance for some time to come. (See app. III for additional analysis on official and private sector resource flows to the developing countries.)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Summit Goal", "paragraphs": ["Among factors that may affect whether the summit\u2019s goal is realized are trade reforms, conflicts, agricultural production, and safety net programs and food aid."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Trade Reform", "paragraphs": ["Summit participants generally believed that developing countries should increasingly rely on trade liberalization to promote greater food security, and in support of this belief, the summit plan called for full implementation of the 1994 Uruguay Round Trade Agreements (URA). The participants also recognized that trade liberalization may result in some price volatility that could adversely affect the food security situation of poor countries. To help offset these possible adverse effects, the participants endorsed the full implementation of a Uruguay Round decision on measures to mitigate possible negative effects.", "The summit participants generally acknowledged that the URAs have the potential to strengthen global food security by encouraging more efficient food production and a more market-oriented agricultural trading system. Reforms that enable farmers in developing countries to grow and sell more food can help promote increased rural development and improve food security. Trade reforms that increase the competitiveness of developing countries in nonagricultural sectors can also lead to increased income and, in turn, a greater ability to pay for commercial food imports. However, trade reforms may also adversely affect food security, especially during the near-term transitional period, if such reforms result in an increase in the cost of food or a reduced amount of food available to poor and undernourished people. Reforms may also have adverse impacts if they are accompanied by low levels of grain stocks and increased price volatility in world grain markets.", "The summit plan acknowledged that world price and supply fluctuations were of special concern to vulnerable groups in developing countries. As part of the plan, food exporting countries said they would (1) act as reliable sources of supplies to their trading partners and give due consideration to the food security of importing countries, especially low-income, food-deficit countries; (2) reduce subsidies on food exports in conformity with the URA and in the context of an ongoing process of agricultural reform; and (3) administer all export-related trade policies and programs responsibly to avoid disruptions in world food agriculture and export markets.", "Also, to mitigate the possible adverse effects of trade reforms on food security situations, the summit plan called for full implementation of a Uruguay Round ministerial decision made in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 1994. Under this decision, signatory nations to the URA agreed to ensure that implementing the trade reforms would not adversely affect the availability of sufficient food aid to assist in meeting the food needs of developing countries, especially the poorest, net food-importing countries. To date, however, agreement has not been reached about the criteria that should be used in evaluating the food aid needs of the countries and whether trade reforms have adversely affected the ability of the countries to obtain adequate supplies of food.", "While trade liberalization by developing countries was especially encouraged by summit participants, some observers believe that developed countries have been slow in removing their trade barriers and that this may inhibit developing countries from achieving further trade liberalization. For example, according to reports by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the World Bank, member countries of the OECD continue to maintain barriers to free trade that are adversely affecting the means and willingness of developing nations to further liberalize their own markets and to support additional trade liberalization. According to the World Bank, without an open trading environment and access to developed country markets, developing countries cannot benefit fully from producing those goods for which they have a comparative advantage. Without improved demand for developing countries\u2019 agricultural products, for example, the agricultural growth needed to generate employment and reduce poverty in rural areas will not be achieved, the Bank report said. This is critical to food security. If developing countries are to adopt an open-economy agriculture and food policy, they must be assured of access to international markets over the long term, particularly those of the developed nations, according to the Bank. (For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see app. IV.)", "Officials of the Department of State and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), however, said that the problem of developed countries\u2019 trade barriers against developing countries is not as severe as portrayed by IFPRI and the World Bank. State acknowledged that there are still some significant barriers to trade but said most barriers are being progressively removed because of the Uruguay Round. In addition, it said, the United States has a number of preferential areas and regimes that favor developing countries and allow most agricultural imports. State said the European Union has similar arrangements. USDA officials generally agreed that it is important for developed countries to remove trade barriers but said it is equally important for developing countries to eliminate domestic policies and restrictions on trade that have adversely affected their own economic growth.", "The price volatility of world food commodities, particularly grains, and its relationship to the level of food reserves, is a key issue related to trade liberalization and a significant problem for food-insecure countries. Views differ over the level of global grain reserves needed to safeguard world food security, the future outlook for price volatility, and the desirability of holding grain reserves. The summit observed that maintaining grain reserves was one of several instruments that countries could use to strengthen food security; however, the summit did not identify a minimum level of global grain reserves needed to ensure food security nor did it recommend any action by countries individually or in concert. Instead, the summit participants agreed to monitor the availability and adequacy of their individual reserve stocks, and FAO agreed to continue its practice of monitoring and informing member nations of developments in world food prices and stocks.", "FAO, IFPRI, and the World Bank have observed that agricultural markets are likely to be more volatile as the levels of world grain reserves are reduced, an outcome expected as trade reforms are implemented. However, they and other observers have also noted that as a result of trade market reforms, agricultural producers may respond more quickly to rising prices in times of tightening markets, the private sector may hold more reserves than it did when governments were holding large reserves (though not in an amount that would fully replace government stocks), and the increased trade in grains among all nations will help offset a lower level of world grain reserves. Some observers believe that most countries, including food-insecure developing countries, are better off keeping only enough reserves to tide them over until they can obtain increased supplies from international markets, since it is costly to hold stocks for emergency purposes on a regular basis and other methods might be available for coping with volatile markets. Others support the view that ensuring world food security requires maintaining some minimum level of global grain reserves and that developed countries have a special responsibility to establish and hold reserves for this purpose. Some have also suggested examination of the feasibility of establishing an international grain reserve. The U.S. position is that governments should pursue at local and national levels, as appropriate, adequate, cost-effective food reserve policies and programs. The United States has opposed creation of international food reserves because of the difficulties that would arise in deciding how to finance, hold, and trigger the use of such reserves. (See app. IV for additional analysis on grain reserves.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions to Reduce Conflict", "paragraphs": ["The summit countries concluded that conflict and terrorism contribute significantly to food insecurity and declared a need to establish a durable, peaceful environment in which conflicts are prevented or resolved peacefully. According to FAO, many of the countries that had low food security 30 years ago and failed to make progress or even experienced further declines since then have suffered severe disruptions caused by war and political disturbances. Our analysis of data on civil war, interstate war, and genocide in 88 countries between 1960 and 1989 shows a relationship between the incidence of these disturbances and food insecurity at the national level. A sharp rise in international emergency food aid deliveries during the early 1990s has been largely attributed to an increasing number of armed conflicts in different parts of the world.", "Summit countries pledged that they would, in partnership with civil society and in cooperation with the international community, encourage and reinforce peace by developing conflict prevention mechanisms, by settling disputes through peaceful means, and by promoting tolerance and nonviolence. They also pledged to strengthen existing rules and mechanisms in international and regional organizations, in accordance with the U.N. Charter, for preventing and resolving conflicts that cause or exacerbate food insecurity and for settling disputes by peaceful means. The FAO Secretariat analyzed progress reports submitted to FAO by member countries in 1998 and cited several examples of country efforts to support peaceful resolution of domestic and international conflicts. However, the analysis did not provide any overall results on the extent to which countries had made progress in ending already existing violent conflicts and in peacefully resolving or preventing other conflicts. (See app. VI for our analysis on the relationship between conflict and food security.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing Agricultural Production", "paragraphs": ["One objective of the summit was to increase agricultural production and rural development in the developing world, especially in low-income, food-deficit countries. FAO estimates show that achieving the required production increases will require unusually high growth rates in the more food-insecure countries and, in turn, greater investments, especially in the worst-off countries.", "World Bank officials have said that the Bank is committed to emphasizing rural agricultural development in countries that receive its assistance. Its plan calls for country assistance strategies that treat agriculture comprehensively and include well-defined, coherent, rural strategy components. Despite public statements by the World Bank, there are still differences of opinion within the Bank and among its partners as to the priority that should be given to the rural sector. These opinions range from recognizing a positive role for agricultural growth in an overall development strategy, to benign neglect, to a strong urban bias.", "Achieving needed agricultural production increases will also require other major changes in the rural and agricultural sector and in society more generally. For example, according to the U.S. mission to FAO, the most critical factor affecting progress toward achieving the summit goal is the willingness of food-insecure countries to undertake the kind of economic policies that encourage rather than discourage domestic production in the agricultural sector and their willingness to open their borders to international trade in agricultural products. There must be an \u201cenabling environment,\u201d the mission said, that favors domestic investment and production in the agricultural sector. Moreover, the mission said, these policies are under the control of the food-insecure countries themselves and can have a far greater impact on domestic food security than international assistance.", "Another issue involving increased agricultural production concerns promotion of modern farming methods, such as chemicals to protect crops, fertilizers, and improved seeds. Agriculture production in developing countries can be substantially improved if such methods are adopted and properly implemented. However, some groups strongly oppose the introduction of such methods because of concerns about the environment. (See app. VII for additional information on this issue.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Safety Net Programs and Food Aid", "paragraphs": ["The summit\u2019s long-term focus is on creating conditions where people have the capability to produce or purchase the food they need, but summit participants noted that food aid\u2014both emergency and nonemergency\u2014could be used to help promote food security. The summit plan called upon governments of all countries to develop within their available resources well-targeted social welfare and nutrition safety nets to meet the needs of their food-insecure people and to implement cost-effective public works programs for the unemployed and underemployed in regions of food insecurity.", "With regard to emergency food aid, the summit plan stated the international community should maintain an adequate capacity to provide such assistance. Nevertheless, this goal has been difficult to implement and, since the summit, some emergency food aid needs have not been met. For example, according to the World Food Program, which distributes about 70 percent of global emergency food aid, approximately 6 percent of its declared emergency needs and 7 percent of its protracted relief operations needs were not satisfied in 1997. Also, donors direct their contributions to emergency appeals on a case-by-case basis, and some emergencies are underfunded or not funded at all. In addition, according to the World Food Program, lengthy delays between appeals and contributions, as well as donors\u2019 practice of attaching specific restrictions to contributions, make it difficult for the World Food Program to ensure a regular supply of food for its operations. In 1998, the program\u2019s emergency and protracted relief operations were underfunded by 18 percent of total needs. Other problems affecting the delivery of emergency food aid include government restrictions on countries to which the food aid can be sent and civil strife and war within such countries. Notable recent examples of countries that have not received sufficient assistance, according to the World Food Program, include North Korea and Sudan, where both situations involve complex political issues that go well beyond the food shortage condition itself.

Consequently, participants agreed that it would be necessary to (1) collect information on the nutritional status of all members of their communities (especially the poor, women, children, and members of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups) to enable monitoring of their situation; (2) establish a process for developing targets and verifiable indicators of food security where they do not exist; (3) encourage relevant U.N. agencies to initiate consultations on how to craft a food insecurity and vulnerability information and mapping system; and (4) draw on the results of the system, once established, to report to CFS on their implementation of the summit\u2019s plan.", "According to FAO and U.S. officials, improvement in data collection and analysis is necessary if countries are to have reasonably accurate data to design policies and programs to address the problem. However, not much progress has been made in this regard over the past 20 years, and serious challenges remain.", "A major shortcoming is that agreement has not yet been reached on the indicators to be used in establishing national food insecurity information systems. Following the 1996 summit, an international interagency working group was created to discuss how to create such a system. As of November 1998, the working group had not yet decided on or begun to debate which indicators of food insecurity should be used, and the working group is not scheduled to meet again before the mid-1999 CFS meeting. FAO Secretariat officials told us that a proposal will be ready for the 1999 CFS meeting. Thus far, only a few developed and not many more developing countries have participated.

In addition, the plan calls on governments, cooperating among themselves and with international institutions, to encourage relevant agencies to coordinate within the U.N. system to develop a food-insecurity monitoring system, and requested the U.N. Secretary General to ensure appropriate interagency coordination. Since the summit, the United Nations, FAO, the World Bank, and others have endorsed various actions designed to promote better coordination.", "In April 1997, the United States and others expressed concern to FAO about problems related to FAO efforts to help developing countries create strategies for improving their food security. Donor countries noted that nongovernmental groups had not been involved in the preparation of the strategies, even though the summit plan stressed the importance of their active participation. In June 1997, the European Union expressed concern about the uncoordinated nature of food aid, noting that responsibilities were scattered among a number of international organizations and other forums, each with different representatives and agendas. And in October 1997, the World Bank reported that many agricultural projects had failed due to inadequate coordination among the donors and multilateral financial institutions.

To this end, governments of the countries agreed to establish, through CFS, a timetable, procedures, and standardized reporting formats for monitoring progress on the national, subregional, and regional implementation of the plan. CFS was directed to monitor the implementation of the plan, using reports from national governments, the U.N. system of agencies, and other relevant international institutions, and to provide regular reports on the results to the FAO Council. As previously noted, as of November 1998, a monitoring and evaluation system had not yet been developed to provide reasonably accurate data on the number, location, and extent of undernourished peoples. In addition, a system had not been created to assess implementation of the various components of the summit\u2019s action plan (that is, 7 broad commitments, 27 major supporting objectives, and 181 supporting actions). Many of these involve multiple activities and complex variables that are not easily defined or measured. In addition, CFS has requested that the information provided allow for analysis of which actions are or are not successful in promoting summit goals.", "In April 1997, CFS decided that the first progress reports should cover activities through the end of 1997 and be submitted to the FAO Secretariat by January 31, 1998. Countries and relevant international agencies were to report on actions taken toward achieving the specific objectives under each of the seven statements of commitment. As of March 31, 1998, only 68 of 175 country reports had been received. The Secretariat analyzed the information in the 68 reports and summarized the results in a report to the CFS for its June 1998 session. The Secretariat reported it was unable to draw general substantive conclusions because (1) all countries, to varying degrees, were selective in providing the information they considered of most relevance for their reporting; (2) varied emphasis was given to reporting on past plans and programs, ongoing programs, and future plans to improve food security; and (3) the reports did not always focus on the issues involved. Furthermore, some countries chose to provide a report that was more descriptive than analytical, and some countries reported only on certain aspects of food security action, such as food stocks or reserve policies.", "CFS had not stipulated or suggested any common standards for measuring the baseline status and progress with respect to actions, objectives, or commitments prior to the preparation of the progress reports. In the absence of common standards, the Secretariat is likely to experience difficulty in analyzing relationships and drawing conclusions about the progress of more than 100 countries. In addition, CFS did not ask countries and agencies to report on planned targets and milestones for achieving actions, objectives, or commitments or on estimated costs to fulfill summit commitments and plans for financing such expenditures.", "The Secretariat provided the June 1998 CFS session with a proposal for improving the analytical format for future progress reports. CFS did not debate the essential points that should be covered in future reports and instead directed the Secretariat to prepare another proposal for later consideration. Given the complexity of the action plan and other difficulties, CFS also decided that countries will not prepare the next progress report until the year 2000 and will address only half of the plan\u2019s objectives. A progress report on the remaining objectives will be made in 2002. Thus, the second report will not be completed until 6 years after the summit. A third set of progress reports is to be prepared in 2004 and 2006.", "Under the summit plan, countries also agreed to encourage effective participation of relevant civil society actors in the monitoring process, including those at the CFS level. In April 1997, CFS decided to examine this issue in detail in 1998. However, the issue was not included in the provisional agenda for the June 1998 session. Detailed discussion of proposals by Canada and the United States on the issue was postponed until the next CFS session in 1999.

We agree with State on this matter, and have reemphasized the need for developing countries to initiate appropriate policy reforms as a prelude to addressing food security issues.", "State and USDA officials also commented that in their opinion, the World Bank and IFPRI overstated the effect of developed countries\u2019 trade barriers on the food insecurity of least-developed countries. We have modified the report to reflect State\u2019s and USDA\u2019s views on this matter more fully. USAID said that, although an unfortunate circumstance, it believes the level of effort by donor and developing countries will probably fall short of achieving the summit\u2019s goal of reducing chronic global hunger by one-half. While we cannot quantify the extent to which developing countries may fall short, we tend to agree with USAID\u2019s observation. USAID\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XII.", "FAO officials said the report\u2019s general tone of skepticism was justified based on the past record and reiterated that reducing by one-half the number of undernourished people by 2015 requires a change in priorities by countries along the lines spelled out in the summit action plan. They also said that work was underway to further investigate the extent to which the target is feasible at the national level in those countries facing political instability or with a high proportion of undernourished people. FAO officials said that our discussion in appendix IX of coordination issues concerning FAO\u2019s Special Program for Food Security and a Telefood promotion did not reflect FAO members\u2019 support for these initiatives. We provided additional information on the initiatives to reflect FAO\u2019s views (see app. IX). World Food Program officials said food aid for nonemergency and developmental purposes is more effective than is suggested by the discussion in our report. However, the officials did not identify any studies or analysis to support the Program\u2019s position that food constitutes an efficient use of assistance resources. The World Food Program said that it has acted on recommendations for improving its operations, and we modified the report to reflect the World Food Program\u2019s views. However, it is important to note that a recent USAID study on the use of food aid in contributing to sustainable development concluded that while food aid may be effective, it is less efficient than financial assistance, although the report pointed out that financial aid is often not available.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), clinical and anthropometric examinations are the most practical and sound means of determining the nutritional status of any particular group of individuals in most developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America because the countries lack vital statistics, accurate figures on agricultural production, and laboratories where biochemical tests can be performed. However, clinical examinations have often been given a low priority by developing countries, and studies of anthropometric measurements have been undertaken very infrequently.

FAO then estimates the minimum average per capita dietary requirements for the country\u2019s population, allowing for only light physical activity. Then, in combination with an estimate of inequality in the distribution of food among households in the country, it derives the percentage distribution of the population by per capita calorie consumption classes. On the basis of this distribution and a cutoff point for food inadequacy based on the estimate of the minimum average per capita dietary energy requirements, the proportion of undernourished is estimated. This is then multiplied by an estimate of the size of the population to obtain the absolute number of undernourished .", "According to FAO, a minimum level of energy requirements is one that allows for only light physical activity. Depending on the country, FAO says, the minimum level of energy requirements for the average person ranges from 1,720 to 1,960 calories per day. Depending on data availability, FAO\u2019s assessment of equitable food distribution for a country is based on survey data on household food energy intake, food expenditure, total income or expenditure, and/or the weighted average of estimates for neighboring countries.", "FAO\u2019s method has a number of weaknesses, and the validity of its estimates has not been established. For example, FAO\u2019s food supply figures are based on 3-year averages, and population estimates are for the midpoint of the reference period used. As a result, FAO\u2019s estimates of the prevalence of undernutrition do not reflect the short-term, seasonal variations in food production or availability in countries. In addition, FAO\u2019s method relies on total calories available from food supplies and ignores dietary deficiencies that can occur due to the lack of adequate amounts of protein and essential micronutrients (for example, vitamins essential in minute amounts for growth and well-being). FAO\u2019s method for measuring inequality in food distribution or access is ideally based on food consumption data from household surveys, but the number of developing countries for which such data are available is limited, and the surveys may not be national in scope or may have been done infrequently. FAO uses these data to estimate parameters for countries for which data are not available.", "FAO acknowledges that the quality and reliability of data relating to food production, trade, and population vary from country to country and that for many developing countries the data are either inaccurate or incomplete. According to one critic of FAO\u2019s method, FAO\u2019s estimates are unreliable indicators of the scope of the undernutrition problem and erroneously find chronic undernutrition to be most prevalent in Africa. The main reasons for the latter finding are systematic bias in methods used by African countries to estimate food production and, to a lesser extent, certain minor food items that are not completely covered in FAO\u2019s food balance sheets. The author concludes that anthropometric measurements, based as they are on measurements of individuals, would be a more promising method for future estimates of undernourishment than estimates based on FAO\u2019s aggregate approach.", "FAO\u2019s method does not provide information on the effects of chronic undernourishment (for example, the prevalence of growth retardation and specific nutritional deficiencies), does not specify where the chronically undernourished live within a country, and does not identify the principal causes of their undernutrition. According to FAO and other experts, such information is needed to develop effective policies and programs for reducing undernourishment. In addition, FAO does not provide estimates for developed countries and does not provide estimates of chronic undernutrition of less than 1 percent.", "Overall, according to FAO, its estimates of food availability and/or the prevalence of undernutrition for many countries are subject to errors of unknown magnitude and direction. Nonetheless, FAO believes that its estimates permit one to know generally in which countries undernutrition is most acute. According to FAO, the consensus of a group of experts that it consulted in March 1997 was that (1) despite the deficiencies of its method, FAO had no current substitute for assessing chronic undernutrition than its food balance sheets based on per capita food availability and distribution; (2) FAO\u2019s approach tends to underestimate consistently per capita food availability in African countries because of its inadequate coverage of noncereal crops; (3) attention needs to be given not just to indications of severe malnutrition but also to mild and moderate malnutrition; and (4) more subregional information is needed on malnutrition and on local levels of food stocks and trade, wages and market conditions, and household perceptions of medium-term food insecurity. It was also argued that about 67 percent of child deaths are associated with nonclinically malnourished children.", "In analyses for the World Food Summit, FAO estimated that about 840 million people in 93 developing countries were chronically undernourished during 1990-92. These countries represented about  98.5 percent of the population in all developing countries. According to the FAO estimates, a relatively small number of countries account for most of the chronically undernourished in the 93 countries (see table I.1). For example, during 1990-92, China and India were estimated to have about 189 million and 185 million chronically undernourished, respectively; collectively, they had nearly 45 percent of the total for all 93 countries. Five countries\u2014Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan\u2014accounted for between 20 million and 43 million chronically undernourished each. The next 13 countries represented between about 6 million and 17 million of the chronically undernourished. Altogether, the 20 countries accounted for about 679 million, or nearly 81 percent, of the undernourished in the 93 countries.", "Number of undernourished (millions)", "As table I.2 shows, great variation also characterizes the extent to which chronic undernutrition is a problem within countries. According to FAO figures, a majority of the countries were estimated to have chronically undernourished people at a rate ranging between 11 and 40 percent in 1990-92, and 19 had rates ranging between 41 and 73 percent.", "Total number of chronically undernourished (millions)", "Table I.3 provides estimates of the number of undernourished people in developing country regions of the world between 1969-71 and 1994-96.

However, the absolute number of undernourished was reduced by only 14.3 percent during the period\u2014from 959 million to about 822 million\u2014because the total population of the developing world increased by nearly 1.5 billion people during that time.

Under the Uruguay Round (UR) Agreement on Agriculture, countries generally agreed to eliminate import restrictions, including quotas. However, according to the World Bank, the elimination of agricultural import restrictions through tariffication resulted in tariff levels that in many cases were set much higher than previously existing tariff levels.

Corn prices rose continuously from $113 in May 1995 to a record $204 in May 1996, an increase of 81 percent. The world price increases were accompanied by high grain prices in many developing countries. In some cases, the latter prices exceeded the world price increases because of simultaneous depreciation of developing countries\u2019 currencies. According to the World Bank, the price increases were a result of a poor U.S. grain harvest in 1995, combined with unusually low world grain stockpiles.

Price instability caused by shifts in production between countries that may occur because of the URAs was expected to be slight. The group concurred that ongoing market liberalization initiatives, including those under the URAs, regional trading arrangements, and other unilateral initiatives, should as a whole contribute to stability in international markets by inducing greater adjustments to demand/supply shocks in domestic markets. However, changes under the URAs were not considered to be drastic enough for instability to decrease significantly, as many countries, especially some larger trading countries, still retained instruments and institutions (such as policies similar to variable levies and state trading) that had impeded price transmission in the past.", "The group agreed that a lack of transparency and consistency in government stock-holding and trade policies had been a source of instability in the past and that less involvement of governments in stock management and a more transparent trade policy should contribute to stability in the future. At the same time, there was considerable doubt whether private stocks would increase to the extent required to offset the shocks that previously were countered by the public sector stocks. The group concluded that increased funds in international commodity markets were expected to influence only within-year price volatility and were unlikely to affect annual price levels in the longer run. In addition, there were uncertainties regarding how fast China and countries of the former Soviet Union would be fully integrated into the world agricultural trading system.", "Overall, the experts agreed that compared to the situation in the past, future world commodity markets would likely retain lower levels of overall stocks but should be less prone to instability due to faster and more broad-based adjustments to production/demand shocks.

The group generally believed that price instability would be greater during the transitional period than after the system had fully adjusted.", "According to an FAO study prepared for the summit, global stocks are likely to remain relatively low compared with the previous decade, and the chance of price spikes occurring is probably greater than in the past.According to a World Bank study, grain stocks are not likely to return to the high levels of the 1980s, given the current focus on reducing government involvement in agriculture, and with smaller grain stocks, prices could be more volatile than in the past. According to IFPRI, policy changes in North America and Europe could result in a permanent lowering of grain stocks and thus increase future price fluctuations because of a lack of stocks to buffer price variations. IFPRI noted that the moderating or cushioning impact on world price instability that once was exercised by varying world grain stocks has been reduced by the substantial decline in grain stocks in recent years.

As the table shows, the proposed goal for 17 group 1 countries is to raise their DES to at least 2,300 and if possible 2,500 calories by 2010. The normative goal for 38 group 2 countries is to raise their DES to at least 2,500 calories and, if possible, to 2,700 calories by 2010. The normative goal for 38 group 3 countries is to maintain DES above 2,700 calories and to achieve a more equitable distribution of food supplies among their citizenry.", "Table VII.1: FAO Analysis of Daily Per Capita Calorie Levels, Grain Production Growth Rates, and Millions of Undernourished to 2010 for 93 Developing Countries (percent per year) (millions)", "Not available.", "According to FAO\u2019s analysis, if the normative goals were achieved, additional production would deliver 60 percent of the developing countries\u2019 additional needed food for consumption.

In addition, it requires numerous major changes in these countries, particularly in the rural and agricultural sector.", "According to FAO, aggregate production must increase rapidly in countries with too-low daily caloric levels and must also contribute to development and generate incomes for the poor. As table VII.1 shows, the group 1 countries would have to more than double their aggregate agricultural production growth rate during 1970-92, from 1.7 percent to 3.8 percent per year. FAO considered 3.2 percent the most likely production increase. For several group 1 countries, production increases of 4 to 6 percent annually are implied, according to FAO. For group 2 countries, the goal is to slow an expected decline in the agricultural production growth rate per year relative to the 3 percent rate during 1970-92. FAO estimated the most likely production increase for these countries at 2.3 percent but said the rate would need to be at least 2.5 percent to achieve the summit goal of halving the number of food insecure by 2010.", "FAO based its normative targets on fairly optimistic assumptions about expanding domestic production and access to imports, including food aid.In fact, FAO said, extraordinary measures would have to be taken to realize the normative goals. FAO offered the following rationale to justify the targets. Previously, some of the countries had already achieved average per capita daily caloric levels above the proposed minimum of  2,300 calories. For most of the countries, daily caloric levels were at the minimum or near the minimum recorded for them during the previous 30 years. There was a marked correlation between these low levels and the prevalence of unsettled political conditions, which suggested that progress could be made during a recovery period if more peaceful conditions prevailed. Finally, FAO said, the historical record showed that periods of 10-20 years of fairly fast growth in production and consumption had not been uncommon\u2014mostly during periods of recovery (usually from troughs associated with war, drought, or bad policies). Thus, if conditions were created for the onset of a period of recovery, policies and efforts to achieve the required high growth rates could bear fruit.", "According to one expert, most low-income developing countries and countries of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe have large, unexploited gaps in agricultural yields. He estimated that yields can be increased by 50-100 percent in most countries of South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and by 100-200 percent in most of sub-Saharan Africa. According to the expert, it is technically possible for the world population to meet growing food demands during the next few decades, but it is becoming increasingly difficult because of groups that are opposed to technology, whether it be developed from biotechnology or more conventional methods of agricultural science. The expert has expressed particular concern about the effect of these groups on the ability of small-scale farmers in developing countries to obtain access to the improved seeds, fertilizers, and crop protection chemicals that have allowed affluent nations plentiful and inexpensive foodstuffs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Additional Amount of Needed Investment Not Clear", "paragraphs": ["Under its scenario of the most likely increase in agricultural production in developing countries by 2010, FAO roughly estimated, in a presummit analysis, that gross investment in primary agricultural production in the developing countries would require an increase from $77 billion annually in the early 1990s to $86 billion annually during 1997-2010 (constant 1993 dollars). FAO estimated that another $6 billion of investment would be needed to halve the number of undernourished people in countries with low daily per capita caloric levels. While the $6 billion increase represented only a 7-percent rise, FAO noted that all of the additional investment would be required in the lagging countries. Thus, group 1 countries (table VII.1) would require a 30-percent annual increase in investment, and group 2 countries a 17-percent increase. However, according to FAO, the low-income, food-deficit countries will mostly continue to have very low domestic savings and access to international credit. As a result, both private and public sectors will have difficulty, at least in the short and medium term, in raising the investment funds needed to respond to new production opportunities, even when they have a comparative economic advantage, and there will be a continuing need for external assistance on grant or concessionary lending terms.", "FAO\u2019s presummit analysis did not address, for countries with low daily per capita caloric levels, added investment needs for (1) post-production agriculture and improved rural infrastructure (excluding irrigation), (2) public services to agriculture, and (3) social support in rural areas. Consequently, the analysis may understate the amount of additional investment required in those countries to attain the normative production goals. In addition, there is no indication that bilateral or multilateral donors will increase their assistance by the amounts indicated by the FAO study. In fact, ODA for primary agriculture steadily declined from a peak of $18.9 billion in 1986 (1990 constant prices) to $9.8 billion in 1994.

First, countries are not politically committed to the broad vision of rural development. Second, for many reasons, international interest in agricultural and rural matters has waned over the past decade. Third, the Bank has in the past been poorly committed to rural development, and its performance on rural development projects has been weak. For example, according to a Bank official, a 1993 review found that Bank expenditures on agriculture and rural development had declined from $6 billion to about $3 billion and that less than half of the Bank\u2019s projects in the area were successful. Following the review, the Bank conducted additional analyses and developed a vision statement for its future work in the area.

CFS has not considered directly assessing the quality of a country\u2019s overall action plan\u2014including strategy, programs, resources, targets, and milestones for achieving the summit commitments, objectives, and actions. Secretariat officials told us that they lack sufficient staff to evaluate action plans for all CFS members.", "The Secretariat prepared a report for the June 1998 CFS session that included a proposed standard format for reporting future progress in implementing the plan. The proposal was considerably more structured than that which CFS asked members to use for the provisional report provided in 1998. The proposal included suggestions regarding essential substantive points to be addressed in future reports. Prior to convening on June 2, CFS held a 1-day working group meeting on June 1 to examine the Secretariat\u2019s proposals and report on them to CFS. However, the working group did not debate and CFS did not reach any decisions on the essential points to be included in future progress reports . CFS directed the Secretariat to collaborate with member states and other concerned partners in the continuing preparation of a set of indicators for measuring progress in implementing the plan and said the work should be completed sufficiently in advance to be used by CFS in preparing for its session in the year 2000. CFS also directed the Secretariat to further develop an analytical framework for preparing future reports and assessing progress in implementing the summit action plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Participation of Civil Society", "paragraphs": ["The summit action plan directed that civil society be involved in CFS\u2019 monitoring and that governments, in partnership with civil society, report to CFS on national implementation of the plan. The plan\u2019s directive is consistent with a growing interest in involving civil society to help promote the objectives and work of international agencies during the past decade in response to various transformations within and across countries. For example, the globalization of the economy has reduced the ability of individual governments to control the direction of development. Structural adjustment reforms have led to a redefinition of the role of the state in many countries, reducing its function as a doer and provider and leaving it to the private sector and citizen initiatives to take on responsibilities for services it no longer provides. The demise of authoritarian regimes in many countries has created opportunities for groups and collective initiatives of many kinds to spring up and make their voices heard.", "Increasing the role of civil society in CFS is not easily accomplished since FAO was created as an intergovernmental forum and operates by consensus of all the members. Unless the members of CFS agree to allow for NGO participation, this cannot occur. According to several U.N. officials with whom we spoke, developing countries are generally opposed to greater involvement by NGOs in U.N. agencies, including FAO.", "According to FAO and other participants, if CFS member countries agree that civil society should have a greater role, a variety of practical questions must be addressed. For example, how can FAO deal effectively and equitably with the large number of civil society organizations that would like to be heard, the variety and number of conflicting views and interests that they express, the disparities in their legitimacy and representativeness, and the difficulties many NGOs in developing countries have in gaining access to information and policy forums? In addition, given limited resources, where should priorities lie in promoting policy dialogue, and how can links between national and global levels be promoted? Some NGOs believe that some of these issues could be addressed if NGOs were allowed to hold separate meetings for developing consensus positions and selecting a few NGOs to represent them in CFS meetings.", "At the April 1997 CFS session, several delegates suggested that ways be considered for strengthening or widening the participation of civil society organizations in the work and deliberations of CFS. CFS asked the Secretariat to take interim measures to broaden NGO participation at the 1998 session of CFS and agreed to examine the issue in greater detail at that time. In responding to the April 1997 CFS session, the Secretariat took several positive actions prior to June 1998. It increased the number of NGOs invited to the June 1998 CFS meeting, made documents available on the FAO website about 1 month prior to the meeting, and provided FAO countries with a copy of a proposal by a group of NGOs for enhanced civil society participation. The proposal identified a number of specific actions that could be taken to increase NGO opportunities for participation before and around CFS meetings. NGOs expressed particular disappointment about not being allowed to make prepared statements in CFS meetings until after government delegates have spoken and said if they were to make the effort of participation, they needed to be assured of a say in decision-making and to know that NGO positions could at least be reflected in CFS reports. environment for civil society organizations and building dialogue with governments and how civil society\u2019s views could be better taken into account given the intergovernmental nature of FAO. The seven NGOs provided their views in an information paper that was made available for the CFS June meeting. In addition, the Secretariat drafted its own paper on how the NGOs\u2019 role could be enhanced in CFS and invited the CFS Bureau to approve the paper for use at the June 1998 meeting.", "Notwithstanding the positive steps taken by the Secretariat and CFS\u2019 April 1997 decision, CFS did not seriously consider the issue in 1998. For example, the CFS Bureau, a small executive committee, did not approve the Secretariat\u2019s paper for use at the June 1998 CFS session, and the issue was not included in the provisional agenda for the meeting.", "At the opening of the session, Canada, with support from the United States, proposed that the provisional agenda be amended to include a discussion of the role of civil society. However, rather than permitting debate on the proposal, the CFS Chairman announced that he had decided to seek to satisfy NGOs\u2019 interests by holding informal discussions with them. Subsequently, the Chairman advised the NGOs that he and the CFS Bureau would meet with representatives of five NGOs. During the morning of the second day of the CFS meeting, the United States again proposed that civil society participation be added to the agenda and asked that it be addressed without further delay. The Chairman agreed to add the item to the agenda but postponed discussion until the end of the third day\u2019s meeting. During the abbreviated discussion, various ideas for broadening civil society participation were noted. However, some delegates, including China, stressed that CFS is an intergovernmental forum and that any measures taken to broaden participation would need to respect that principle.", "At the conclusion of the June session, CFS countries agreed to make the issue of increased civil society participation in its activities a main agenda item for the 1999 meeting. It asked the Secretariat to prepare and circulate a discussion paper at least 6 months prior to the next meeting to allow ample time for consultations between governments and national civil society organizations. The Secretariat was also asked to analyze the pros and cons of proposals, including their legal, procedural, and financial implications.", "According to a statement presented on behalf of NGOs that attended the June 1998 CFS session, the involvement of civil society organizations in preparing national reports on progress in implementing the summit\u2019s action plan was varied. In some cases, NGOs had written inputs; in other cases, NGOs gave their views orally in meetings with government officials; and in numerous other cases, civil society was not invited to participate in the drafting of the national report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["At the request of Senator Russell D. Feingold, Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, Senator John Ashcroft, and Congressman Tony P. Hall, we reviewed the outcome of the 1996 World Food Summit and key factors that could affect progress toward achieving the summit\u2019s goal. Our overall objective was to comment on key issues and challenges related to developing countries\u2019 achieving the summit\u2019s goal of reducing undernourishment by half by 2015. Our overall approach was to analyze and synthesize information from a wide variety of primary and secondary sources. To address the current status of global food security, the summit\u2019s approach to reducing food insecurity, and the summit\u2019s possible contribution to reducing hunger and undernutrition, we did the following: reviewed documents and studies by the FAO, the U.N. Children\u2019s Fund, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and the World Food Program; the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research; IFPRI; USDA, USAID, the Department of State, and the Department of Health and Human Services; and various academics, NGOs, and private sector entities concerned with past and possible future efforts to reduce poverty and undernutrition; discussed issues concerning the extent and causes of undernutrition with national and international experts in food security, including experts at FAO, the World Food Program, the World Bank, IFPRI, USDA, USAID, the Department of State, various NGOs, and universities and international food companies; observed presummit negotiations over the text to be included in the World Food Summit\u2019s policy declaration and plan of action, the World Food Summit, and subsequent FAO follow-up meetings to the summit (the latter include the April 1997 CFS meeting, the November 1997 FAO Conference meeting, and the June 1998 CFS meeting; attended various other conferences and seminars where food security and related issues were discussed; and developed a database on country-level estimates of undernutrition and various economic, political, and social variables possibly associated with food insecurity. private sector resource flows, and investors\u2019 ratings of the risk associated with investing in countries. We did not validate the reliability of these data.", "To address the current status of global food security, more specifically, we reviewed methodological issues associated with efforts to accurately identify and measure the extent of undernutrition; reviewed FAO, USDA, and World Health Organization estimates of the number of undernourished people or children in up to 93 developing countries that collectively account for about 98 percent of the population in the developing world; used FAO estimates of the number of undernourished people in 93 developing countries to calculate and describe (1) the distribution of the total number of undernourished people across countries and (2) the variation across countries in the proportion of population that is undernourished; and compared FAO and USDA estimates of the number of undernourished people in 58 low-income, food-deficit countries to show to what extent the estimates differ.", "To describe the summit\u2019s policy declaration and action plan for reducing food insecurity, we reviewed both and prepared a table summarizing the 7 major commitments, 27 supporting objectives, and 24 of the 181 supporting actions. The latter were selected to further illustrate the depth and specificity of the summit\u2019s plan.", "To provide perspective on the summit\u2019s goal of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015, we reviewed and compared FAO and USDA estimates on the number of undernourished people in developing countries. In addition, we analyzed a variety of key issues associated with the summit\u2019s proposed commitments, objectives, and actions for halving undernutrition by no later than 2015. These issues concern the ability and willingness of countries to reasonably measure the prevalence of undernourishment and the possible effects of trade liberalization, grain reserves, food aid, conflict, increased agricultural production, policy reforms, resources, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation of progress in reducing food insecurity. production growth rates relative to food insecurity levels and the aggregate number of undernourished people of the countries.", "To assess the impact of trade liberalization on food security, we reviewed various analyses of the subject, including two detailed estimates of the projected income impacts of the URAs on major regions of the world and several major trading countries. To provide perspective on trends and issues associated with grain reserves and food aid, we analyzed data on (1) world private and government grain reserves and the ratio of total grain reserves to world cereal consumption; (2) world and U.S. cereals shipments of food aid in terms of total quantities and the proportion provided as program, project, and emergency aid; and (3) total food aid deliveries to low-income, food-deficit countries and as a percent of total global food aid deliveries. We also analyzed country-level data on average per capita caloric levels and related this measure of food security to other country-level variables, including (1) the incidence of civil war, war, revolution and genocide during 1960-89; (2) the level of income; and (3) creditworthiness ratings of the risk associated with investing in these countries; related country-level data on the number of undernourished people to (1) income levels of developing countries, (2) total official and private resources provided to these countries, and (3) creditworthiness ratings of the risk associated with investing in the countries; and analyzed data on the role of official development assistance and private sector investment in developing countries during 1990-97.", "To comment on the issues of (1) improving coordination among governments, international agencies, and civil society and (2) monitoring and evaluating their progress in implementing the summit action plan, we considered information that became available to us in some of our previously discussed actions. For example, we relied heavily on the FAO Secretariat\u2019s assessment of individual developing and developed country progress reports that were provided to the Secretariat during early 1998.
