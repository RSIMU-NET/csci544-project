The mission of IRS, as well as LB&I, calls  for ensuring compliance and fairly applying the tax law when selecting  which tax returns merit an audit.

An effective internal control system can help federal agencies  achieve their missions and objectives and improve accountability. As set  forth in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, also  known as the Green Book, internal controls comprise the plans, methods,  and procedures used to meet an entity\u2019s mission, goals, and objectives,  which support performance-based management. The Green Book lists  17 internal control principles to help agency program managers achieve  desired results. The principles also provide reasonable assurance that  program objectives are being achieved through, among other things,  effective and efficient use of resources. Internal control is not one event,  but rather a series of actions and activities that occur throughout an  entity\u2019s operations and on an ongoing basis. Two examples of internal  control standards are establishing clearly defined objectives and a  commitment to documenting significant events.", "To better understand how LB&I selects tax returns for audit, you asked us  to review LB&I audit selection standards and internal controls.

To assess the reliability of the A-CIS data, we reviewed the data  dictionary and related documentation, interviewed IRS officials  knowledgeable about the data, and performed electronic tests.

According  to IRS, these LB&I taxpayers filed 352,264 corporate and partnership tax  returns in fiscal year 2015.", "LB&I\u2019s stated mission is to provide taxpayers \u201cquality service by helping  them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the  tax law with integrity and fairness to all.\u201d In supporting that mission,  LB&I audits tax returns to determine whether taxpayers correctly report  information such as income, expenses, and credits. During an audit, LB&I  staff review a taxpayer\u2019s books and records. The objective of audits, in  turn, is to promote the highest degree of voluntary taxpayer compliance.  In 2015, IRS reported that LB&I completed audits on more than 11  percent of large corporations\u2014those with assets in excess of $10 million.  By comparison, the rate was 0.9 percent for all other corporations and 0.8  percent for individual returns.", "LB&I has nine audit components focusing on five practice areas and four  geographical areas. Figure 1 shows LB&I\u2019s organizational structure for  audit activities. Each practice area has Planning and Special Programs  (PSP) staff, who are responsible for controlling, monitoring, and assigning  audit inventory to field groups.", "The term \u201cselection methods\u201d refers to all of the programs that LB&I uses  to identify and review tax returns to include in the pool of possible audits,  as well as the decisions made to audit tax returns by auditors and audit  managers in LB&I field offices. LB&I uses a variety of methods to select  returns for audit. Appendix 2 contains more detail on the selection  methods that LB&I officials provided to us, including the methods that we  focus on in this report.", "Figure 2 provides a conceptual overview, based on our analysis of LB&I  documentation and interviews with relevant officials, of how LB&I narrows  the pool of tax returns for audit consideration, including how LB&I uses its  audit selection methods. After a tax return is filed with IRS, selection  methods that involve computerized scoring models and filters identify tax  returns that are likely to have compliance issues. According to LB&I  officials, the higher the score, the greater the likelihood that a tax change  will result from an audit. Computerized selection methods also may  identify tax returns with specific compliance concerns, such as a  particular value or combination of values reported on certain tax return  lines. According to IRS documentation, LB&I picks returns with specific  issues for compliance initiative projects (CIP) or returns that are  mandated for audit, such as refund returns that are subject to Joint  Committee on Taxation review. IRS also has a program, in which LB&I  participates, to identify tax returns with known abusive tax schemes. LB&I  officials said that they give additional scrutiny to individual tax returns with  certain international tax issues. After returns are scored by computers or  pulled for special projects and mandatory work, LB&I conducts another  review called classification, in which LB&I staff identify whether the return  merits an audit as well as specific issues for audit consideration. This  portion of the process is focused on identifying potential audit issues on  returns that are already considered at risk for noncompliance.", "After the identified returns have been classified or otherwise reviewed for  specific tax issues, they are listed in a queue for audit managers to assign  to auditors, as shown in the bottom of the funnel in figure 2. Auditors in  the field assess whether the queued returns have large, unusual or  questionable (LUQ) features. According to LB&I officials, other factors  that guide which returns from the queue are selected include targets set  in LB&I\u2019s annual audit plan, which prioritizes tax return types and tax  issues as well as resources and auditor\u2019s skills and experience. Even if a  return is ultimately selected for audit, auditors or their managers may  decide upon closer examination not to proceed with the audit, a process  called surveying. In addition to the process shown in figure 2, LB&I may  initiate an audit based on taxpayers\u2019 requests to amend their own returns,  a special type of audit LB&I calls a claim. LB&I also may begin an audit  based on facts from an ongoing audit, called a related pick up.", "Once selected, LB&I audits fall into two categories, Coordinated Industry  Cases (CIC) or Industry Cases (IC). According to LB&I officials, the CIC  program puts large enterprises under continual audits. LB&I categorizes  tax returns as CIC based on factors that include assets, gross receipts,  and operating entities. CIC taxpayers are audited by a team of LB&I staff  while IC returns usually are audited by a single auditor. Generally, LB&I  officials said they use their most experienced and highest graded auditors  to review the tax return of LB&I taxpayers to address issues that are often  complex, involving multiple years and potentially ambiguous laws,  regulations, or related guidance in determining the correct tax treatment.  Auditors may be assisted by specialists to help review technical issues,  such as transactions that are international in scope and raise valuation  issues.", "LB&I is in the process of changing the way it addresses compliance  including how it identifies tax returns for audit and is moving toward  implementing issue-based projects it calls \u201ccampaigns.\u201d According to  LB&I, a campaign is a compliance project focused on a specific  compliance issue, such as partnerships underreporting income, rather  than on using characteristics of the whole tax return for audit  consideration. According to LB&I officials, campaigns could consist of an  audit, or a less burdensome treatment, such as letters asking taxpayers  to consider changing how they report the issue or additional guidance to  help taxpayers accurately report the issue on their returns. LB&I first  released its plan for adopting campaigns in late 2014 and announced the  initial 13 issues for campaigns in January 2017. According to its plan,  LB&I developed the campaign approach because of an increasingly  difficult tax environment in which its budget and resources are shrinking  and tax laws are growing more complex.", "While LB&I implements campaigns, officials said the existing selection  methods it uses will continue to operate until LB&I decides whether to  replace them. LB&I officials also said that existing selection methods may  be repurposed to operate within campaigns, as well. For example, they  said that a computer filtering effort previously conducted as a standalone  project could be used to identify tax returns for audit under a specific  campaign.

The documentation for all of  the reviewed selection methods showed which LB&I staff members have  been assigned responsibility for selecting returns for audit and have been  delegated authority by management to oversee the process, including  identifying and reviewing the potential returns and then selecting returns  for audit. For example, once the Global High Wealth (GHW) unit identifies  an individual taxpayer for possible audit, the related returns, such as  partnership and S corporation returns, are linked together, and a classifier  is responsible for assessing the compliance risk on the return. A manager  is tasked with overseeing this work before it is sent to the field for audit.", "LB&I documented its commitment to competence for staff members  involved with audit selection.

The LB&I Quality  Measurement System (LQMS) is used to routinely monitor the  examinations and adherence to technical audit standards. LB&I reviewers  analyze a sample of tax returns that were audited and rate the quality of  those audits. The technical standards include actions taken after a return  has been assigned to an auditor, including planning the audit steps,  implementing those steps to collect evidence, and developing audit  findings. However, these monitoring activities and standards do not  assess the quality of audit selection decisions or whether the decision  processes have deficiencies that need to be addressed.

Despite the overall downward  trend, audit starts increased between fiscal years 2012 and 2013.

Compared to the seven methods, these other methods do not require the  same level of professional judgment by LB&I staff when selecting returns  for audit. For example, the audits can arise from taxpayer claims (such  as when a taxpayer requests to be audited for a refund); mandatory work  (such as audits to be reviewed by the Joint Committee on Taxation); or  related pick-ups (when an auditor begins auditing another tax return  based on what is observed in a different audit).

These credits must be pre-approved through application to  the DOE. LB&I said that the treatment stream for this campaign will be  soft letters and issue-focused audits.  2.  Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program (OVDP) Declines- Withdrawals: OVDP allows U.S. taxpayers to voluntarily resolve past  non-compliance related to unreported offshore income and failure to  file foreign information returns, according to LB&I. In the campaign,  LB&I said it will address OVDP applicants who applied for pre- clearance into the program but were either denied access to OVDP or  withdrew from the program. LB&I said that IRS will address continued  noncompliance through a variety of treatment streams, including  audits.  3.  Domestic Production Activities Deduction, Multi-Channel Video  Program Distributors (MVPD) and TV Broadcasters: MVPDs and  TV broadcasters have claimed that \u201cgroups\u201d of channels or programs  are a qualified film eligible for the IRC Section 199 deduction for  income attributable to domestic production activities, according to  LB&I. They are asserting that they are the producers of a qualified film  when distributing channels and subscriptions packages that include  third-party produced content. Additionally, LB&I said that MVPD  taxpayers maintain that they provide online access to computer  software for the customers\u2019 direct use. LB&I said that it has developed  a strategy to identify taxpayers affected by these issues and will  develop training to aid auditors and that the campaign will include  potential published guidance and issue-based audits  4.  Micro-Captive Insurance: LB&I said that this campaign addresses  transactions in which a taxpayer attempts to reduce aggregate taxable  income by using a contract with a related company that the parties  treat as an insurance contract with a captive insurance company (i.e.,  an insurance company organized primarily to provide insurance  protection to its owners or persons related to its owners). LB&I said  that it has developed a training strategy for this campaign and the  treatment stream will be issue-based audits.  5.  Related Party Transactions: LB&I said that this campaign focuses  on transactions between commonly-controlled entities that provide a  means to transfer funds from a corporation to related pass through  entities or shareholders. LB&I said it is seeking to determine the level  of compliance in related party transactions and that the treatment  stream for this campaign is expected to be issue-based audits.  6.  Deferred Variable Annuity Reserves and Life Insurance Reserves  Industry Issue Resolution (IIR): The IRS and Chief Counsel will  develop guidance to address uncertainties about reserves for deferred  variable annuities and for life insurance and related tax issues,  according to LB&I. The campaign\u2019s objective is to collaborate with  industry stakeholders. Chief Counsel and the Department of the  Treasury are to develop published guidance that provides certainty to  taxpayers regarding these related issues.  7.  Basket Transactions: This campaign addresses structured financial  transactions in which a taxpayer attempts to defer and treat ordinary  income and short-term capital gain as long-term capital gain,  according to LB&I. LB&I said that it has developed a training strategy  for this campaign. The treatment streams will be issue-based audits,  soft letters, and outreach.  8.  Land Developers - Completed Contract Method (CCM): Large land  developers that construct in residential communities may be  improperly using CCM accounting, according to LB&I. In some cases,  developers are improperly deferring all gain until the entire  development is completed. LB&I will provide training for auditors  doing follow-up audits when warranted. The treatment stream also will  include development of a practice unit and issuance of soft letters.  9.  The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA)  Linkage Plan Strategy: As partnerships have become larger and  more complex, LB&I has revised processes to assess tax on  investors, according to LB&I. With recent legal changes, LB&I plans to  focus on developing new procedures and technology to work  collaboratively with auditors conducting TEFRA partnership audits to  identify, link, and assess tax to the investors that pose the most  significant compliance risk.  10. S Corporation Losses Claimed in Excess of Basis: S corporation  shareholders report income, losses and other items passed through  their corporation, according to LB&I. While the law limits losses and  deductions to their cost basis in the corporation, LB&I said that it has  found that shareholders claim losses and deductions in excess of their  basis. LB&I also said that it has developed technical content for this  campaign that will aid auditors. According to LB&I, the treatment  streams for this campaign will be issue-based audits, soft letters  encouraging voluntary self-correction, stakeholder outreach, and a  new form for shareholders to assist in properly computing their basis.  11. Repatriation: LB&I said that it is aware of different structures being  used by taxpayers for purposes of tax free repatriation of funds into  the United States. LB&I has determined that many of the taxpayers do  not properly report repatriations as taxable events on their filed  returns. LB&I said that it plans to improve issue selection filters for  conducting audits on identified, high-risk repatriation issues,  increasing taxpayer compliance.  12. Form 1120-F Non-Filer: Foreign companies doing business in the  U.S. are often required to file Form 1120-F, according to LB&I, data  suggest that many of these companies are not meeting their filing  obligations. In this campaign, LB&I said that it will use various external  data sources to identify these foreign companies and encourage them  to file their required returns. The treatment stream will involve soft  letter outreach, according to LB&I. If the companies do not take  appropriate action, LB&I will conduct audits to determine the correct  tax liability.  13. Inbound Distributor: According to LB&I, U.S. distributors of goods  from foreign-related parties have incurred losses or understated  profits in their U.S. tax return reporting; these amounts are not  commensurate with the functions performed and risks assumed. In  many cases, the U.S. taxpayer would be entitled to higher returns in  arms-length transactions. LB&I said that it has developed a training  strategy that will aid auditors as they examine this in issue-based  audits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["James R.
