GAO was asked to review the security of inbound international mail.", "In this report, GAO addresses, among other objectives, (1) how inbound international items are inspected as they arrive in the United States; and (2) what options exist to collect EAD and the costs and benefits of using it to target mail for inspection. GAO reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from CBP, USPS, the U.S. Department of State, and, based on 2015 inbound international volume, the three largest express consignment operators.

Express consignment operators are required to provide \u201celectronic advance data\u201d (EAD)\u2014such as the shipper's and recipient's name and address\u2014for all inbound express cargo. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses this information to target inspections. USPS is not required to provide this information to CBP. Nonetheless, as of March 2017, advance data are unavailable for roughly half of inbound international mail. Although USPS and CBP have two pilot programs under way to target mail for inspection based on EAD, they have not established specific and measureable goals and therefore lack the performance targets needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilots. Without these performance targets, USPS and CBP are unable to make well-informed decisions about the possible expansion of these pilots in the future. While USPS officials reported in November of 2016 that they planned to expand one of the pilots, CBP officials stated that the pilot was not ready for expansion because of USPS's inability to provide 100 percent of targeted mail to CBP for inspection. USPS stated that it is working to address challenges related to identifying targeted mail within sacks containing hundreds of individual pieces of mail (see figure).", "Options for collecting EAD include negotiating agreements with foreign postal operators and legally requiring EAD, but the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection are unclear. USPS and CBP officials stated that having EAD to target mail for inspection could result in saving time and resources and increase the percentage of inspections that identify threatening items. However, USPS has not calculated the cost of collecting EAD from countries with which it has data-sharing agreements, and neither USPS nor CBP has collected the necessary information to determine the extent to which the use of EAD would provide benefits relative to current methods of choosing mail for inspection. For example, CBP has collected data on the rate of seizures per inspection for current pilot programs, but it has not collected comparable data for other screening methods it uses to target mail for inspection. As such, USPS and CBP risk spending resources on efforts that may not increase the security of inbound international mail or that may not result in sufficient improvement to justify the costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CBP, in coordination with USPS: (1) establish measureable performance goals to assess pilot programs and (2) evaluate the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection compared with other targeting methods.

The Department of State (State Department) represents the  United States, along with USPS, at the UPU Congress and other UPU  meetings, including those at which policies and requirements related to  mail security are discussed. As the designated postal operator in the  United States, USPS accepts and delivers inbound international mail on  behalf of designated postal operators around the world. Inbound  international mail generally arrives in the United States via five  international service centers (ISC) located in New York City, New York;  Miami, Florida; Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California; and  Chicago, Illinois. Ground handlers employed by air carriers transport mail  to ISCs, where it is accepted by USPS. In general, USPS is required to  present all inbound international mail to CBP for inspection.", "Express consignment operators accept items from customers in foreign  countries and transport and deliver those items in the United States. For  cargo arriving by aircraft, express consignment operators are required to  provide EAD to CBP prior to the scheduled arrival of express cargo in the  Unites States.", "A number of federal agencies are responsible for screening mail and  express cargo upon arrival in the United States. Under the Department of  Homeland Security, CBP has, among other responsibilities, primary  responsibility for enforcing customs and agriculture laws and regulations  and for preventing terrorists and their weapons from entering at U.S. ports  of entry. As such, CBP operates 328 ports of entry at which it inspects  inbound cargo, including express cargo and mail, to enforce laws and  regulations while seeking to ensure the safe and efficient flow of goods  through U.S. ports of entry. CBP coordinates with other federal  agencies\u2014including TSA, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS),  and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2014to assess the compliance  of inbound items with applicable laws and regulations.

Screening and review to identify illegal and prohibited items may  occur either prior to or after the items\u2019 arrival in the United States.", "CBP\u2019s highest priority in screening inbound international items is to  prevent terrorists and their weapons\u2014including hazardous materials or  weapons that may threaten the safety of airline passengers and crew\u2014 from entering the United States. Generally, measures to identify these  types of threats occur prior to items arriving in the United States. For  example, in 2010, individuals located in Yemen with ties to al Qaida  attempted to ship explosive devices in express cargo on-board aircraft  destined for the United States. Those items were identified and  intercepted before reaching the United States. According to CBP, while  no additional attempted attacks of that nature have been reported since,  CBP has identified a substantial number of air cargo shipments that have  potential ties to terrorism and that therefore may represent a threat.", "CBP inspects mail and express cargo arriving in the United States and  seizes illegal goods, including those that may pose threats to health and  safety, ecology, and U.S. businesses.

Of those,  CBP seized about 70 percent from mail and 30 percent from express  cargo (see fig. 1). This does not necessarily indicate a higher rate of  seizures from mail compared to express cargo, as seizure rates may be  affected by differences in inbound volume among mail and express cargo, as well as differences in CBP inspection processes for each, as  discussed later in this report. Seized items are categorized in SEACATS  as either drugs or merchandise.", "Drugs: Illegal or inadmissible drugs accounted for about 47 percent of  total seizures from fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and, among those, the  top 10 categories are shown in figure 2.

Prior to that, seizures of fentanyl were  captured under other categories in SEACATS.", "Merchandise: Merchandise accounted for about 53 percent of total  seizures in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Common categories of goods  seized were Cuban cigars, cigarettes, fraudulent identification documents,  clothing, footwear, and other counterfeit goods (see fig. 4). CBP may  seize merchandise based on several different types of violations. For  example, according to SEACATS data, Cuban cigars may violate laws  against trading with targeted foreign countries and regimes, including  Cuba. CBP generally seizes clothing, footwear, watches, and other  counterfeit goods based on laws against trademark infringement (see  examples in fig. 5).", "According to USPIS and CBP officials, USPIS works with CBP to seize  fraudulent mail, such as illegal sweepstakes and lottery schemes.

In fiscal year 2016, CBP  reported about 170,000 such interceptions at ports of entry (including  mail, express cargo, and other cargo). However, these interceptions may  be undercounted in SEACATS.

According to the official, some of the countries that are most eager to  exchange EAD tend to be countries that have an interest in surveilling  their citizens. Conversely, the official stated that some countries are  concerned about collecting the personal information of citizens and are  reluctant to enter into agreements for sharing EAD.", "Pursue EAD requirements through the Universal Postal Union: During the  2016 UPU Congress, member countries agreed to changes\u2014including  future requirements for barcodes on small packets\u2014that have laid the  groundwork for EAD requirements in the future. The United States  drives this effort as joint chair with India on a UPU committee focused on  issues related to security, customs, transportation, and standards.  Additionally, USPS officials told us they are participating\u2014along with 52  other postal operators\u2014in a UPU program designed to increase  transmission of EAD for e-commerce shipments. According to a State  Department official, changes to UPU requirements could result in more  universal adoption of EAD collection than current efforts to establish data- sharing agreements. The official also stated that while adoption of  universal EAD requirements may occur incrementally over many years,  the data-sharing standards and tools that are currently being developed  through this UPU process could provide countries with capacity-building  resources that would not be available to them outside of a UPU-driven  process (in a bilateral negotiation, for example). However, State  Department and USPS officials stated that universal adoption of EAD  requirements through the UPU will likely take many years because many  foreign postal operators lack the infrastructure and capacity to collect  EAD and it is unclear how willing some countries are to build that  capacity.", "Legally Require Collection of EAD: On February 14, 2017, versions of the  Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act of 2017 (STOP Act)  were introduced in both the House of Representatives and the U.S.  Senate. The STOP Act bills, if passed, would require that all inbound  international mail\u2014those items USPS receives from foreign postal  operators\u2014be accompanied by EAD, which would be provided to CBP for  analysis. The bills would also authorize the collection of an additional  customs fee as well as establish penalties for non-compliance.  According to a State Department official, the requirements in the two  pending bills could cause some countries to provide EAD to USPS.  However, according to USPS and State Department officials, many  countries do not currently have the ability to carry out the provisions in the  bills. As a result, the officials stated that the requirement would likely  result in a temporary disruption to the flow of inbound international mail  and commerce and potentially result in a long-term halt to the flow of mail  from some countries. Additionally, the officials stated that the proposed  requirement could have implications related to USPS participation in the  UPU and, thus, the exchange of mail between the United States and UPU  member countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USPS and CBP Have Not Evaluated Relative Costs and Benefits of Increased Use of Electronic Advance Data", "paragraphs": ["According to USPS and CBP officials, increasing the use of EAD to target  mail for inspection may have benefits, such as reducing the volume of  inspected mail and increasing the percentage of inspections that result in  identification of a threatening or illegal item.

However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD  are not yet known and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data  necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of  inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening.", "Regarding the costs of collecting EAD, USPS has not calculated the  current costs of collecting EAD from countries with which USPS has data- sharing agreements, but USPS officials stated that USPS does not incur  significant additional costs for each new designated postal operator or  type of mail for which USPS begins collecting EAD. While some of the  costs of obtaining EAD may be borne by designated postal operators in  other countries, rather than directly by USPS, costs to USPS to use EAD  to target mail for inspection may include:", "Equipment and personnel required to identify targeted mail (such as  equipment required to sort through hundreds of pieces of mail to  identify a single piece of mail): For example, USPS estimated that the  cost for software upgrades needed for Pilots 1 and 2 (currently the  only efforts USPS and CBP have underway to use EAD to target mail  for inspection) to identify individual pieces of mail within larger sacks  was about $150,000. This technology is currently being tested\u2014so  any further costs are unknown\u2014but USPS officials stated that it will  be included as a part of these pilots if they are expanded to other  ISCs.", "Software upgrades required to exchange data with foreign postal  operators and with CBP: USPS officials stated, as noted above, that  developing the technological capability to receive and utilize EAD from  foreign posts related to Pilots 1 and 2 cost about $1.8 million.", "An analysis of the costs associated with planned efforts is particularly  critical given USPS\u2019s financial challenges. As we recently found, USPS  reported a net loss of $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2016\u2014its 10th consecutive  year of net losses. We have reported that USPS urgently needs to  restructure to align its costs with revenues. In light of this situation, any  expenditure of financial resources to make any additional infrastructure  and information technology upgrades necessary to implement the use of  EAD for targeting merit careful consideration.", "Beyond costs, USPS and CBP have not performed an analysis of the  benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection, including the  effectiveness of targeted inspection based on EAD relative to other  methods of selecting mail for inspection. Thus, the extent to which  targeting based on EAD might result in an increased ability to identify  threats or other benefits over current methods is unknown. For example,  CBP has collected data on the percent of inspections resulting in a  seizure for mail inspected as a result of targeting in Pilots 1 and 2.  However, CBP does not collect comparable data for seizures resulting  from inspections conducted based on current methods of choosing mail  for inspection.", "Although CBP has been using EAD to target express cargo for inspection  since approximately 2004, it has not evaluated whether this method  results in benefits relative to other methods of choosing express cargo, or  cargo more generally, for inspection. We recently reported that CBP  generally lacks targets for its trade enforcement activities, which include  targeting inbound items for inspection. We found that this may impede  CBP\u2019s ability to assess the effectiveness of those activities, and  recommended that CBP develop such targets.", "Moreover, USPS and CBP experience challenges related to inspecting  mail that may limit their ability to effectively use EAD to target mail for  screening, and, thus, to experience EAD\u2019s possible benefits. For  example, in discussing the implementation of Pilots 1 and 2, USPS and  CBP officials described several challenges:", "High inbound international mail volumes may make individual  scanning time consuming and possibly impractical. According to CBP  data, there were about 571-million inbound international air-cargo  packages in fiscal year 2016, of which express cargo would account  for only a portion. Comparatively, USPS alone accepted about 621  million pieces of inbound international mail in fiscal year 2016.  According to representatives we spoke to from express consignment  operators, they are able to individually scan each item upon arrival,  providing an opportunity to identify and set aside express cargo  targeted for CBP inspection based on EAD. Conversely, individually  scanning hundreds of millions of pieces of mail may limit USPS\u2019 ability  to process mail in a timely manner or could require additional  personnel and resources.", "USPS depends on foreign postal operators, which, according to  USPS and State Department officials, may not share the same  security priorities as USPS and CBP, to make EAD available. In  March 2017, including countries with which USPS has agreed to  share EAD, USPS received EAD for roughly half of inbound mail.  Further, lack of control over data collection may result in lower quality  and/or reliability of EAD, as compared to that collected by express  consignment operators. As such, while CBP has access to EAD for  express cargo as a result of the Trade Act of 2002, obtaining EAD for  mail may present substantial challenges, as discussed earlier. If the  amount of available EAD remains limited for inbound mail, this may  limit the effectiveness of CBP\u2019s targeting efforts or could limit CBP\u2019s  ability to reduce the volume of mail it inspects.", "Our prior work has found that, in designing preventive measures\u2014such  as the screening of inbound mail to identify potential threats\u2014it is helpful  to conduct a thorough assessment of vulnerabilities as well as cost- benefit analyses of alternative strategies. In the absence of information  on the relative costs of various methods of selecting mail for inspection\u2014 including the use of EAD to target mail\u2014as well as their effectiveness at  identifying potential threats in inbound mail, USPS and CBP are unable to  fully understand whether obtaining additional EAD for targeting purposes  will provide security or resource benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Protecting the U.S. citizens, economy, and ecology from threats in items  shipped to the United States as mail and express cargo requires  balancing risks to health and safety with maintaining the flow of  international shipping.

Express  consignment operators, USPS, and CBP coordinate to conduct screening  of inbound international items after their arrival in the United States and  USPS and CBP have implemented pilot programs making limited use of  EAD to target mail for inspection.

Specific details related to the screening process and foreign postal  operators that CBP and USPS considered sensitive are not included in  this report. Express consignment operators are defined, in general, as  those entities moving cargo by special express commercial service under  closely integrated administrative control with reliable, timely, door-to-door  delivery. Under the Trade Act of 2002, as amended, and implementing  regulations, all cargo, including express cargo but not including inbound  international mail, is subject to requirements for electronic advance data  (EAD).", "Despite important differences\u2014including the level of control of shipments  at the point of acceptance\u2014the door-to-door delivery provided by express  consignment operators is more comparable to services provided by  USPS than other cargo services. As such, we have reviewed efforts to  screen inbound international mail and express cargo only, and have not  included other types of cargo. For the purpose of this report, the term  inbound international items will refer to those items handled by USPS and  express consignment operators, but does not include non-express cargo  shipped to the United States. For the purposes of this report, EAD refers  to electronic data collected and shared among postal operators (such as  USPS); cargo carriers (such as those transporting express cargo); and  customs agencies (such as CBP) in advance of the scheduled arrival of  cargo (including mail and express cargo) in the United States for the  purpose of identifying inbound international items that may pose a threat  to the United States.

Specifically, we reviewed information on fiscal year, item  description, and statute cited as the basis for the seizure. To determine  the reliability of SEACATS data for the purposes of this report, we  reviewed related documentation; conducted electronic and manual data  testing to identify missing data, outliers, and obvious errors; and  interviewed appropriate CBP officials about related internal controls and  procedures and the limitations of the data. While we found this data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of providing contextual information  about the types and quantity of threats identified by CBP in inbound  international items, we have reported these data after taking into account  some limitations, which may affect the reliability of the statistics we report:", "About 20,000 of the 308,000 total seizures (about 6.5 percent) cited  more than 1 item description or federal statute as the basis of the  seizure because shipments containing more than 1 type of item are  reported as a single incident. For example, a package containing both  cocaine and marijuana would be counted as a single seizure, but  would have two separate item descriptions (cocaine and marijuana).  The statistics we report account only for the first item description  listed. We have not reported seizures by cited federal statute because  the first statute cited might not accurately represent the basis of the  seizure. For example, the first statute cited in SEACATS may be laws  granting CBP the authority to seize prohibited items; while this may be  part of the basis for the seizure, it does not illustrate the type of threat  that was identified. As a result, the frequencies we report represent  the minimum number of seizures in each category.", "Nine of the 308,000 total seizures were cited as both drug and  merchandise seizures because the associated items contained  both drugs and other goods, such as drug paraphernalia. As such,  these incidents are counted twice\u2014as both drugs and  merchandise.", "For about 118,000 of the seizures (about 38 percent), SEACATS data  did not include a country of origin because, according to CBP, this  field is not mandatory.
