Also, a Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) Fund was established by law to pay for the cleanup costs of the GDP sites, so that DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM) must coordinate and make trade-offs in its use of resources among the three GDPs. However, EM has managed the cleanup of the three GDPs as three individual sites. In addition, EM is not following relevant leading practices GAO reviewed for managing the cleanup as a program (having a program management plan; a reliable integrated master schedule; and a reliable, integrated, comprehensive life-cycle cost estimate. By managing the three GDPs as an integrated program and following these program management leading practices, EM would have more reasonable assurance that it is taking every opportunity to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its management activities.", "EM has reported spending a total of about $15.5 billion on GDP cleanup as of fiscal year 2018. However, EM's cost estimates for completing cleanup at the three sites are not reliable. GAO assessed EM's cost estimates for the GDPs individually by comparing them with best practices for developing high-quality, reliable cost estimates. EM's cost estimates for completing cleanup of the GDPs do not fully or substantially meet all of the characteristics of a reliable cost estimate Until EM ensures that its site-specific cost estimates fully incorporate best practices for cost estimation, EM, DOE, regulators, and Congress will not have the information needed to understand the level of resources required to achieve cleanup of the three GDPs.", "Under EM's current cost estimates, remaining GDP cleanup costs exceed the balance of the D&D Fund by at least $25 billion and EM faces challenges that could affect cleanup progress and the sufficiency of the fund. For example, DOE's reporting to Congress on the sufficiency of the D&D Fund is based on old financial data, incomplete information, and unclear scope. These limitations reduce the quality of the information Congress receives for making decisions about the sufficiency of the fund and allocating resources to the fund. For example, DOE reported to Congress on the status of the D&D fund and GDP cleanup in May 2019. The report was based on financial data as of September 2016 and on cost estimates prepared in 2013 for one GDP and in 2014 for the other two. Given that DOE estimates the fund will be exhausted in 2020, there is urgency for DOE to communicate current information on the fund on a timely basis to Congress. By regularly reporting on the status of the D&D Fund and cleanup efforts at the three GDPs with current information that contains details on challenges in reaching agreement with regulators and a clear scope of work, DOE will be able to provide better information for congressional decision-making on the sufficiency of the fund."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations, including that DOE (1) manage the cleanup of the three GDPs as an integrated program and follow program management leading practices, (2) ensure cost estimates fully incorporate cost estimating best practices, and (3) report regularly on the status of the D&D Fund and cleanup efforts at the three GDPs.

We visited all three GDP sites to observe the cleanup work and  interviewed EM officials responsible for the cleanup, representatives of  the DOE contractor responsible for D&D activities, state regulators  working with EM on environmental compliance activities (from Kentucky,  Ohio, and Tennessee), members of GDP site-specific advisory boards,  and representatives of community reuse organizations. Following these  interviews, we conducted a content analysis of all responses to our  interview questions to determine any key challenges EM faces in  completing cleanup of the GDPs.", "To examine the extent to which EM has managed the cleanup of the  GDPs compared with program management leading practices and the  status of the cleanup effort, we reviewed documents, including site- specific GDP cleanup plans and GDP cleanup progress briefings, as well  as reports issued by the National Academies, us, and DOE. We  interviewed EM officials and contractor representatives on their past,  present, and future plans for cleanup. We also interviewed EPA and state  regulatory agency representatives at each of the GDPs regarding their  role in the cleanup and interactions with EM. We assessed the  information from our document reviews and all interviews (content  analysis from interview responses) and aligned the assessed information  with relevant program management leading practices. We identified the  three program management leading practices by reviewing our prior work  and the Project Management Institute\u2019s (PMI) The Standard for Program  Management\u2014Fourth Edition. The three leading practices were having  (1) a program management plan, (2) an integrated master schedule, and  (3) a reliable, integrated, comprehensive life-cycle cost estimate. We  compared EM\u2019s management of the GDPs with these leading practices.  To examine the status of cleanup at the GDPs, we reviewed EM\u2019s  documentation of the cleanup work completed and the work remaining at  each GDP.", "To examine what EM has spent on cleanup at the three GDP sites, and  the extent to which EM\u2019s cost estimates for completing GDP cleanup are  reliable, we reviewed historical funding and cleanup expenditure data for  all three sites for fiscal years 1994 through 2018 and analyzed EM  documentation supporting cost estimates for each of the three GDPs. We  reviewed financial statement audit reports issued on the D&D Fund for  fiscal years 2005 to 2012. We also met with relevant headquarters and  field financial management, budget, and planning staff. In addition, we  assessed the reliability of the historical funding and expenditure data  provided by EM by obtaining, from EM officials familiar with DOE\u2019s  financial management system, responses to a series of data reliability  questions on data entry access, quality control procedures, and the  accuracy and completeness of the data. Based on these responses, we  found the data to be sufficiently reliable for purposes of our reporting  objective. To examine the reliability of EM\u2019s cost estimates for completing  cleanup at the three GDPs, we reviewed EM\u2019s cost estimate  documentation, interviewed EM site officials, and compared GDP cost  estimates against characteristics of reliable cost estimates contained in  our Cost Estimating Guide. We reviewed agency documents that  established the basis and assumptions for site contractors\u2019 contributions  to the cost estimates; the contractors\u2019 work breakdown structures; and  presentations on the contractors\u2019 cost estimating models.

The GDPs are located near Oak Ridge,  Tennessee; Paducah, Kentucky; and Portsmouth, Ohio (see fig. 1). The  GDPs were rendered obsolete due to the emergence of newer, more  efficient technologies and the globalization of the uranium enrichment market. All three GDPs eventually ceased uranium enrichment activities,  with Paducah being the last to stop enriching by 2013.", "The GDP sites are similar in many ways. For example, the primary  structures at each GDP are large buildings for uranium enrichment  processing using the same gaseous diffusion technology. In addition, at  each of the sites, these large buildings all housed similar equipment, such  as compressors, converters, and other equipment necessary for enriching  uranium. EM measures these buildings in acres rather than square feet  (see fig. 2). For example, the five uranium enrichment processing  buildings that once stood at Oak Ridge measured a total of 114 acres.  Each GDP site also consists of hundreds of other similar buildings and  facilities used to fabricate, service, repair, and clean machinery as well as  additional infrastructure, such as electrical switchyards and cooling  towers.", "Rescission of the USEC Fund   The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created the  United States Enrichment Corporation  (USEC) as a government corporation  authorized to, among other things, acquire,  market, and enrich uranium. The 1992 Act  also established a revolving fund in the U.S.  Treasury\u2014the USEC Fund\u2014for carrying out  USEC\u2019s purposes. In 1996, Congress enacted  the USEC Privatization Act authorizing  establishment of a private, for-profit  corporation. The act provided that \u201cexpenses  of privatization\u201d were to be paid from certain  accounts, including the USEC Fund. One  week before privatization, Congress enacted  the \u201cMcConnell Act,\u201d which reserved  approximately $373 million from certain  accounts, including the USEC Fund, for the  disposition of depleted uranium stored at  government-owned enrichment plants  operated by USEC. USEC was privatized on  July 28, 1998. After privatization, the USEC  Fund balance of $1.2 billion was retained on  the books of the Treasury. Since then, the  balance of the USEC Fund has grown to an  estimated $1.695 billion as of fiscal year 2020.  In 2015, we found that the entire balance of  the USEC Fund is available for permanent  rescission since the two statutorily authorized  uses for the USEC Fund have been fulfilled:  (1) environmental clean-up expenses  pursuant to the \u201cMcConnell Act,\u201d and (2)  expenses of privatization. In the fiscal year  2017 federal budget, the Administration  proposed using the balances of the USEC  Fund to carry out purposes authorized to be  funded by the Uranium Enrichment  Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund.  This is not one of the authorized purposes of  the USEC Fund. We have previously found  that DOE\u2019s effort to utilize USEC Fund monies  instead of general fund appropriations to  support efforts other than the authorized  purpose of the USEC Fund would diminish  transparency in budgeting. In May 2019, we  highlighted this issue in our annual report on  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication.  As of September 2019, Congress had not  passed legislation to permanently rescind the  balance of the USEC Fund, as we suggested  in April 2015. Rescission may increase the  transparency of federal agencies' budget  presentations and help Congress have a clear  understanding of how new funding requests  relate to funding decisions for existing projects  with continuing resource needs. nuclear power reactors and enrichment continued until 1985. The Oak  Ridge GDP permanently closed in 1987.", "Portsmouth. The Portsmouth GDP, a 3,778-acre site located north of  Portsmouth, Ohio, operated from 1954 until 2001. The GDP enriched  uranium for both commercial reactor fuel and military applications.  The Portsmouth GDP includes three uranium enrichment processing  buildings, as well as over 300 other buildings and facilities.  Management of both Portsmouth and Paducah has changed over  time. Specifically, the Energy Policy Act, as amended, established the  United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) as a government  corporation to, among other things, provide uranium enrichment  services and take over operations of the GDPs in Portsmouth and  Paducah beginning in 1993 (see sidebar). By 1998, USEC was  privatized under the USEC Privatization Act and became a subsidiary  of the newly created USEC, Inc. USEC produced low-enriched  uranium for commercial power plants until 2001, when it ceased  operations at the Portsmouth GDP. Later that year, the plant was  placed on cold standby\u2014a dormant condition that would allow  operations to be resumed within 18 to 24 months if needed\u2014and  USEC, under contract with DOE, maintained the site. In 2011,  USEC returned the Portsmouth GDP to DOE and EM\u2019s contractor  initiated deactivation activities of the uranium enrichment processing  buildings.", "Paducah. The Paducah GDP, located on 3,556 acres of land west of  Paducah, Kentucky, initially produced enriched uranium for nuclear  weapons from 1952 until 1993. From 1993 through 2013, USEC  leased and operated the facilities to produce enriched uranium for the  commercial nuclear power sector. Similar to the Portsmouth GDP site,  management of the Paducah site has changed over time.

When the  GDPs were in operation, workers used volatile organic compounds in  large quantities to clean and degrease equipment, which resulted in  the release of such compounds, specifically trichloroethylene, into the  environment. These compounds contaminated soil, surface water,  and groundwater when they were spilled, burned in pits, discharged in  holding ponds, or placed in trenches for disposal.", "Removal of large uranium deposits.

Natural uranium contains  0.7 percent of the uranium-235 isotope, and  tails contain less uranium-235 than natural  uranium (i.e., less than 0.7 percent of  uranium-235). Tails have historically been  considered waste because the enrichment  process required to extract the remaining  useful quantities of uranium-235 is significant  and can be costly. In addition, tails may be  dangerous to human health and the  environment and can form extremely  corrosive and potentially lethal compounds  when in contact with water. Therefore, the  Department of Energy (DOE) has opted to  convert its inventory of tails into a more stable  chemical form, such as uranium oxide, that  would allow for long-term storage and  minimize environmental impacts and costs.

While neither EM nor DOE explicitly refers to the management of  the GDP cleanup as a program, DOE\u2019s stated intent is consistent with  PMI\u2019s definition of a program\u2014\u201drelated projects, subsidiary programs, and  program activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits not  available from managing them individually.\u201d", "However, we compared EM\u2019s management of the cleanup of the three  GDPs to the three relevant PMI program management leading practices  that we examined\u2014those addressing planning, scheduling, and cost  estimating\u2014and found that EM is not managing the cleanup of the GDPs  consistent with these practices:", "Planning\u2014Having a program management plan. We found that EM  does not have a GDP-wide program management plan. According to  PMI, a program management plan formally expresses an  organization\u2019s concept, vision, mission, and expected benefits  produced by the program; it also defines program-specific goals and  objectives. In a 1996 report, the National Academies recommended  that DOE develop a GDP-wide program management plan for cleanup  of the three GDPs that would help coordinate decisions across the  three GDPs. Representatives from the National Academies told us  in December 2018 that they continue to believe this recommendation  is valid. Furthermore, EPA and state regulators have criticized EM for  not having a long-term vision for GDP cleanup.", "According to EM officials, EM developed site-level plans for each of  the three GDPs over time as the GDPs ceased operating and became  available for cleanup at different times\u2014Oak Ridge ceased operating  in 1987, Portsmouth in 2011, and Paducah in 2013. However, in  reviewing what EM officials refer to as GDP program management  plans, we found that the documents were created for different  purposes and do not contain comparable information. For example,", "The Oak Ridge plan was created in 2017 as an update of a fiscal  year 2014 through 2024 site-level plan for the three EM cleanup  sites located at Oak Ridge reservation\u2014the GDP, the Oak Ridge  National Laboratory, and the Y-12 National Security Complex.  This document presents a high-level picture of cleanup activities.  EM officials told us that the Oak Ridge plan is intended to be high- level because cleanup of the Oak Ridge GDP is further along than  cleanup of the Portsmouth and Paducah GDPs and because the  Oak Ridge plan covers all three cleanup efforts at the Oak Ridge  Reservation. EM officials also noted that other specific planning  materials on the Oak Ridge GDP could be found in other  documentation, but such documentation was not in the plan or in a  usable form.", "The document EM provided as the Portsmouth plan contains a  series of PowerPoint presentations for a March 2018 symposium  on waste management.

However, the  slides contain contradictory information on when the Paducah  GDP began deactivation\u2014one slide indicates that deactivation  began in 2014, but another shows deactivation will begin in 2035.", "EM officials at the Paducah GDP provided the 2015 site  management plan for the Paducah GDP, which was signed by  DOE and the contractor. This plan includes actions taken to date,  site prioritization information (i.e., risk prioritization criteria), and  key planning assumptions. The Paducah plan is the most  comprehensive and detailed.", "The individual GDP plans differ in their level of detail; do not present  comparable information, such as milestones that each GDP is to  meet; and do not reference past, ongoing, or planned work at the  other GDPs. As a result, they are not useful as plans for decision- making on the three GDPs in an integrated manner. Further, EM does  not have a document that contains a concept, vision, mission, and  expected benefits from GDP cleanup or that defines program-specific  goals and objectives. By developing a GDP-wide program  management plan, EM would have a comprehensive and consistent  roadmap to achieve GDP cleanup and would be in a better position to  leverage resources among the three GDPs.", "Scheduling\u2014Having a reliable, integrated master schedule. We  found that EM does not have an integrated master schedule for  cleanup of the GDPs. According to PMI\u2019s Program Management  Standard, a program master schedule is the top-level program  planning document that defines the individual component schedules  and dependencies among program components (individual  components and program-level activities) required to achieve the  program goals. It should include those component milestones that  represent an output to the program or share interdependency with  other components. The program master schedule should also include  activities that are unique to the program including, but not limited to,  activities related to stakeholder engagement, program-level risk  mitigation, and program-level reviews. The program master schedule  determines the timing of individual components, enables the program  manager to determine when benefits will be delivered by the program,  and identifies external dependencies of the program.", "EM officials told us that the agency\u2019s corporate database\u2014the  Integrated Planning, Accountability, and Budgeting System (IPABS)\u2014 contains the integrated master schedule for all of EM\u2019s cleanup work,  including the GDPs. The purpose of IPABS is to provide information  on (1) changes to the life-cycle scope, cost, and schedule and (2)  performance data such as earned value, performance metrics, and  cleanup milestones. While IPABS provides a top-line planned  completion date as well as other information, including cleanup  milestones negotiated with regulators and performance metrics, it  does not provide all of the information needed to build up to that  date, including sequences clearly showing how related portions of  work depend on one another. Without information such as sequences,  it will not be possible for EM to identify the consequences of changes  or possible managerial action to respond to them. An integrated  master schedule makes it possible to help coordinate cleanup across  the GDPs by establishing each GDP site\u2019s schedule and identifying  how related portions of work, such as funding profiles and workforce  and equipment requirements that tie the sites together, depend on  one another. For example, EM officials stated that certain demolition  equipment, such as high-reach excavators, are in limited supply and  may be shared among the three GDPs. By creating an integrated  master schedule, EM would be in a better position to coordinate  individual project activities across the three GDPs and thus help  achieve program goals.", "Cost Estimating\u2014Having a reliable, integrated, comprehensive  life-cycle cost estimate. We found that EM does not have a reliable,  integrated, comprehensive life-cycle cost estimate for cleanup of the  GDPs consistent with PMI\u2019s Program Management Standard, which  calls for estimating a program\u2019s full life-cycle costs. According to PMI,  calculating full life-cycle costs and including transition and  sustainment costs results in total cost of ownership. Total cost of  ownership is considered to be relative to the expected benefit of one  program against another to derive a funding decision. There are  numerous estimating techniques to derive program cost estimates.  Program cost estimates should also identify any critical assumptions  upon which the estimates are made, as these assumptions may prove  unfounded in the course of program delivery and require  reconsideration of the program business case or revision of the  program management plan. Finally, program cost estimation can  support or guide cost estimation at the component level. Any  prevailing program level cost estimation guidance intended for use at  the component level should be documented and communicated to  component managers.", "Instead, EM has, over time, developed separate cost estimates for  each of the three GDPs that do not reference historic costs at the  other GDPs. EM officials stated that IPABS contains the life-cycle cost  estimate for EM\u2019s cleanup work, including the GDPs. However, IPABS  only provides a top-line cost estimate. It does not provide details on  what information is included in developing that estimate, such as any  critical assumptions upon which the estimates are made. Moreover, in  February 2019 we reported that certain IPABS data, including  expenditure data, were not reliable. By developing an integrated,  comprehensive life-cycle cost estimate, EM management, Congress,  and stakeholders would have information on total cleanup costs,  including underlying costs, enabling more informed decision-making  on funding and resource allocations from the shared D&D Fund  across the three GDPs.", "EM officials acknowledged that cleanup work at the GDPs is managed  independently by the three sites and not as an integrated program.  However, the officials noted that the GDP cleanup work is managed as  part of EM\u2019s overall work to clean up radioactive and other hazardous  waste that remains at 16 different sites across the nation, which they  explained was all managed as one program. Further, according to EM  officials, since the cleanup work is part of EM\u2019s overall cleanup program it  is able to make decisions at a high-level to support overall funding  priorities, reduce the greatest risks, and effectively use taxpayer dollars.  However, in February 2019, we reported on EM\u2019s cleanup program and  found that EM\u2019s cleanup policy\u2014which governs its cleanup work\u2014does  not follow any of the relevant program management leading practices  related to a program\u2019s management of scope, cost, schedule  performance, and independent review of performance.", "The benefits of managing the work at the GDPs as a program have long  been recognized. In 1996, the National Academies in its report to  Congress recognized GDP cleanup as having the characteristics of a  program noting that the repetitive and common design of the GDPs would  allow for economies of scale in performing D&D. The report  recommended that DOE develop a GDP-wide program management plan  that integrates the D&D of the facilities and environmental remediation  activities, as previously mentioned. According to the National Academies  report, coordinating efforts across the GDPs at the complex level would  help to ensure that D&D is integrated at the three sites and that  resources, including disbursements from the shared D&D Fund, would be  used effectively. Moreover, the report noted that delays would lead to  substantial expenditures for surveillance and maintenance; deterioration  of the facilities would exacerbate these costs; risks to individuals would  increase; and the costs for safeguards and security for the sites would  continue. In December 2018, representatives from the National  Academies told us that they continue to believe that managing the GDPs  as an integrated program would benefit cleanup efforts.", "By taking steps to manage the three GDPs as an integrated program and  following relevant program management leading practices (developing a  program management plan; an integrated master schedule; and a  reliable, integrated, comprehensive life-cycle cost estimate), EM would  have more reasonable assurance that it is taking every opportunity to  increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its management activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EM Estimates That Cleanup of All Three GDPs Will Not Be Completed Until 2070 at the Latest", "paragraphs": ["EM estimates that cleanup of the Oak Ridge GDP is nearing completion,  that Portsmouth will be completed by 2041, and that Paducah will be  completed between 2065 and 2070.

At Oak Ridge, the work remaining includes cleaning up  surface and groundwater contamination, remediating soils on  approximately 800 acres, and conducting D&D on more than 130  remaining facilities. DOE reported in its 2019 triennial report that it  intends to complete cleanup of the Oak Ridge GDP by fiscal year  2022. However, according to EM documentation and officials, EPA  officials, and state regulators, EM is unlikely to complete the cleanup  by this date. In information provided to us in 2018 and in  documentation supporting its cost estimate, EM cited fiscal year 2024  as the completion date for the Oak Ridge cleanup. In addition, in  March 2019, EM officials said that all facilities at the Oak Ridge GDP  will be demolished by fiscal year 2020 and remediation activities will  be completed by fiscal year 2024, stating that the fiscal year 2022  date in the 2019 triennial report is based on outdated data. EPA and  Tennessee regulators also told us they do not believe that EM\u2019s  current estimated completion date is realistic for the Oak Ridge GDP  cleanup based on their understanding of the scope of remaining work,  particularly cleanup of groundwater contamination. They said it is  more realistic that cleanup of the Oak Ridge GDP will not be  completed until the late 2020s and EPA believes cleanup completion  could go out as far out as the 2040s, due to the lack of an agreed  approach to address contaminated groundwater. The completion date  for the Oak Ridge GDP has slipped in the past. Oak Ridge was  previously scheduled to be completed in fiscal year 2009 and then in  fiscal year 2012.", "Portsmouth. At Portsmouth, EM must complete D&D for three  uranium enrichment processing buildings. Specifically, the first of  three processing buildings is undergoing the final stages of  deactivation, and the contractor is scheduled to begin demolition in  fiscal year 2020. EM has started deactivation procedures at the  second of the processing buildings, where EM is scheduled to start  demolition in fiscal year 2024. At the third processing building,  deactivation has yet to begin, and EM estimates the building will be  ready for demolition in fiscal year 2031. In addition, EM must conduct  D&D on hundreds of other support buildings and facilities. EM also  plans to continue to remediate groundwater plumes at Portsmouth  and to complete construction of an onsite waste disposal facility,  which is scheduled to be operational by fiscal year 2020. According to  the 2019 triennial report, cleanup of the Portsmouth GDP will be  completed in 2041 based on scope and funding projections.

At Paducah, EM is focusing its near-term cleanup efforts on  D&D of the C-400 building\u2014a building that was used to clean  machinery parts and test equipment and has been identified as the  primary source of groundwater contamination at the site. After the  demolition of this building, EM plans to dig up the slabs underneath  the building to remove contaminants that EM believes are the source  of the contamination, according to EM officials. According to EPA, EM  is also focusing its near-term cleanup efforts on other activities, such  as stabilization and deactivation of uranium enrichment and support  buildings across the GDP, infrastructure optimization activities  (including railroad upgrades for safe waste transport and downsizing  the electrical power grid network), and new facility construction.  According to an EM document and officials, deactivation of the  processing buildings began in 2014, after USEC returned the site to  DOE. In addition to the process buildings, EM will also need to  conduct D&D on hundreds of other buildings and facilities. In addition,  according to EM officials, EM has yet to decide on whether the waste  produced from the GDP cleanup will be shipped offsite or if it will  construct an onsite waste facility.

USEC then sold the natural  uranium and retained the proceeds. The  cleanup services provided by USEC included  removing chemical and hazardous material  from the GDP. DOE has in the past referred to  this practice as \u201cbarter.\u201d  We found in our September 2011 report that  DOE mischaracterized certain transactions  with USEC as barters. From December 2009  through March 2011 DOE\u2019s uranium  transactions with USEC were sales authorized  by the USEC Privatization Act, but they did  not comply with federal fiscal law. The USEC  Privatization Act requires that before a  uranium sale, DOE must determine: the  materials are surplus to national security  needs; the department is receiving fair market  value; and the sales will not adversely affect  the domestic uranium mining, conversion, and  enrichment industries. We found that DOE  met these requirements. Nevertheless, by not  depositing the value of the net proceeds from  the sales of uranium into the Treasury, we  found that DOE violated the miscellaneous  receipts statute. This statute requires an  official or agent of the government receiving  money from any source on the government's  behalf to deposit the money into the Treasury.  By not depositing an amount equal to the  value of the uranium into the Treasury, DOE  inappropriately circumvented the power of the  purse granted to Congress under the  Constitution.  DOE disagreed that its actions did not comply  with federal fiscal law. We suggested that  Congress consider authorizing DOE to,  among other things, retain the proceeds of  future uranium transactions. Pursuant to  direction from Congress, in March 2018, DOE  suspended this practice through fiscal year  2019.

EM headquarters and site officials  explained that they do not track detailed expenditure information of GDP  cleanup activities in STARS because they are not required to do so.", "EM has previously provided a detailed breakdown of expenditures. For  example, in our July 2004 report, in addition to expenditures on D&D, EM  provided expenditures for the following categories: remedial actions,  surveillance and maintenance, uranium and thorium reimbursements,  waste management, and other activities. In addition, DOE\u2019s 2007 triennial  report has an appendix on GDP future costs that provided a similar  breakout. However, EM officials could not provide current expenditure  information similar to these prior reports. EM site officials told us that EM  tracks more detailed expenditure data on certain categories by project,  including demolition activities, and that these data were available in  various project management systems maintained across the three sites.

EPA officials also told us that EM needs to better balance  D&D and remediation efforts by conducting more remediation  activities. EM officials stated that at the Oak Ridge GDP, EM balances  D&D with remediation activities, but they did not provide  documentation about these efforts. The Tennessee regulatory officials  added that EM has been reluctant to commit to milestones that  regulators identify as a priority. In addition, EPA officials and the  Kentucky state regulatory official said that EM reprioritizes the  cleanup effort every few years. The Kentucky regulator added that this  has led to delays in approving the site management plan. These  issues have led to disputes, and strained relations at the Paducah  GDP. Specifically, per the terms of their Federal Facility Agreement,  EM, EPA, and the Kentucky regulator must annually agree to a site  management plan that establishes enforceable milestones. However,  the parties have not agreed to such a plan since 2015, and in its draft  2018 plan, EM changed its priorities from the 2015 plan by moving a  number of enforceable milestones to non-enforceable planning  dates. As of February 2019, these and other technical disputes  between EM and EPA and state regulatory officials had delayed  demolition of the C-400 building\u2014the primary source of groundwater  contamination at the Paducah site\u2014by a year and led to cost  increases. In commenting on a draft of this report, both DOE and EPA  officials stated that disputes associated with the C-400 building  demolition were resolved in a memorandum of agreement signed in  August 2019.", "Differences in preferred cleanup remedies at Oak Ridge. The Oak  Ridge Federal Facility Agreement requires EM to reach agreement  with the regulators on cleanup remedies. According to EM, EPA, and  Tennessee regulatory officials we interviewed, EM and the regulators  differ in their choice of preferred cleanup remedies at the Oak Ridge  GDP, an issue subject to dispute under the Federal Facility  Agreement. At Oak Ridge, EM officials we interviewed said that their  cost estimate for all of the groundwater cleanup assumes that  regulators will agree to a waiver for active cleanup across the site,  relying on a cleanup remedy called monitored natural attenuation\u2014 allowing natural processes to decrease or \u201cattenuate\u201d concentrations  of contaminants in the groundwater and monitoring that progress over  time. EM officials acknowledged that they have not reached  agreement with regulators on groundwater cleanup remedies. The  officials noted that their proposed approach is based on their analysis  of what remedies are cost effective, technically practicable, technically  feasible, fully protective, and likely to be agreed upon by the state. EM  officials also noted that their cost estimates are developed following  federal standards that require EM to assume the lowest cost remedy if  no remedy is more likely than another. However, DOE\u2019s preferred  cleanup remedy may not be accepted by regulators. EPA and  Tennessee regulators told us that while they may agree to a waiver  for specific areas at Oak Ridge, they would not agree to a \u201cblanket\u201d  waiver covering the entire site. They added that they would prefer  that EM more actively address contamination, for example, by  installing a pump-and-treat system at Oak Ridge. Without the  blanket waiver included in their cost estimate, EM officials said that  cleanup would likely be delayed by several years, and costs would  likely increase by as much as hundreds of millions of dollars. EM  officials later said that they are not seeking a blanket waiver and do  not believe a blanket waiver will be required for all groundwater  remediation requirements, but rather that focused waivers may be  necessary for certain areas that cannot be restored by available  technology. Notably, in reviewing EM\u2019s most recent cost estimate, we  found that the estimate continues to assume a waiver for the entire  site.", "Concerns about EM\u2019s cost estimation assumptions. EPA and the  Kentucky and Tennessee state regulatory officials we interviewed told  us that EM generally shares information under the terms of the  Federal Facility Agreement. However, the officials said they were  concerned that the assumptions behind EM\u2019s cost estimates for GDP  cleanup are not transparent and that EM has not worked with them to  develop the estimates. EPA officials told us that EM does not  adequately or transparently include EPA on technical scope and  cleanup schedule considerations that underlie EM\u2019s cost estimates.  Tennessee regulatory officials added that EM\u2019s cost estimates do not  reflect the state\u2019s assumptions about the technical scope and  schedules for the remedies for soil and groundwater remediation. In  commenting on a draft of this report, DOE officials stated that  estimates for the Oak Ridge GDP reflect the technical scope and  schedules to accomplish the end state remedies that the Tennessee  regulator has agreed to for soil remediation. The officials added that  they are working with the regulator on the remedy for groundwater  remediation. Similarly, at the Paducah GDP, the Kentucky state  regulatory official expressed concern that EM\u2019s cost estimates were  unrealistic\u2014especially EM\u2019s assumption that Paducah would receive  over $1 billion in funding (in escalated dollars) for most years starting  in 2036 and ending in 2050. Total enacted appropriations for Paducah  in fiscal year 2019 were about $274 million; EM\u2019s assumption would  constitute a significant increase in Paducah\u2019s funding. Without these  increased funding levels, Paducah\u2019s cleanup would likely extend  beyond the 2065 to 2070 time frame, and EM\u2019s estimates for  completion and cleanup costs would likely increase. EM site officials  at Oak Ridge disagreed that they have not been transparent with EPA  and Tennessee state regulators, emphasizing that they have complied  with all Federal Facility Agreement requirements regarding regulator  participation in the budget process.", "At Paducah, the challenges between EM, EPA, and the Kentucky  regulator are not new. In April 2004, we reported that EM, EPA, and the  Kentucky regulator had difficulty agreeing on an overall cleanup approach  as well as on the details of specific projects. Further, we found that over  time, these disagreements had undermined trust and damaged the  parties\u2019 working relationship. We recommended that EM involve EPA and  the Kentucky regulator early in the development of the annual site  management plan and specific projects\u2014before submitting formal  cleanup proposals for regulatory approval\u2014so that the parties can identify  and resolve their concerns and reach consensus on cleanup decisions in  a more timely manner. EM stated it believed at the time that it had been  successful in fostering constructive relationships with its regulators and  through its intent to involve regulators early in the decision-making  process. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOE officials stated that  every year DOE conducts scoping meetings with EPA and the Kentucky  regulator to establish the strategy, planning schedules, and milestones for  the annual site management plan prior to it being transmitted to the  regulators in November.", "According to a September 2012 Memorandum on Environmental  Collaboration and Conflict Resolution issued by OMB and the Council on  Environmental Quality, departments and agencies should \u201cincrease the  appropriate and effective use of third-party assisted environmental  collaboration as well as environmental conflict resolution to resolve  problems and conflicts that arise in the context of environmental, public  lands, or natural resource issues, including matters related to energy,  transportation, and water and land management.\u201d", "Pursuant to the memorandum\u2019s annual reporting requirement, DOE\u2019s  draft annual report from March 2018 presents information on the  department\u2019s use of third parties and other collaborative problem-solving  approaches in fiscal year 2017. In that report, DOE cites the benefits of  integrating third-party facilitation into DOE site and program office  projects, including expanded and clearer communication that leads to  smoother relationships with the regulators and the public. EM officials told  us that they, in conjunction with the regulators, have used outside  facilitators to help scope site management plans, work plans, and other  project documents over the past few years. They said that they have  engaged the services of a facilitator at Paducah on two significant efforts,  and in both cases the facilitator added value and was effective. In  addition, Tennessee state regulatory officials told us that they have used  a mediator with EM at the Oak Ridge GDP site in the past, and they  believe the process had a positive result. However, EM is currently not  engaging the services of a facilitator at the three GDP sites to help the  parties address differences in setting priorities, agreeing on remedies,  and ensuring the cost estimates reflect regulator assumptions. By  working with an independent, third-party facilitator to help resolve  disagreements over cleanup priorities, cleanup remedies, and cost  estimation assumptions, EM would be in a better position to achieve  stakeholder concurrence on these issues and avoid future cleanup  delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations in EM\u2019s Reporting to Congress Present Challenges to Congress\u2019s Ability to Take Actions to Address the Sufficiency of the D&D Fund", "paragraphs": ["EM\u2019s reporting to Congress on the sufficiency of the D&D Fund is based  on old data, incomplete information, and unclear scope, presenting  challenges to Congress\u2019s ability to be fully informed in taking actions to  address the sufficiency of the fund. The Energy Policy Act, as amended,  required the Secretary of Energy to report within 3 years of enactment,  and at least once every 3 years thereafter, on the progress of the GDP  cleanup effort. DOE has continued to prepare triennial reports on the  status of the D&D Fund and GDP cleanup for Congress. However, DOE\u2019s  2019 triennial report is based on outdated information, provides limited  information on the challenges EM faces in reaching agreement with EPA  and state regulators, and is not clear on the scope of work. These  limitations reduce the quality of the information Congress receives for  making decisions about allocating resources to the D&D Fund at the  same time that Congress will have to address a continued need for  resources for GDP cleanup given the fund is estimated to be exhausted  by 2020.", "The 2019 triennial report is based on outdated information. The  latest triennial report, issued in May 2019, is based on financial  information as of September 2016 and on cost estimates prepared in  2013 (Oak Ridge) and 2014 (Portsmouth and Paducah). In addition,  the report does not contain information on an updated cost estimate  for the Paducah site. Specifically, for Paducah, the report cites a cost  estimate\u2014prepared in 2014\u2014of $15 billion to $16 billion and a  completion date of 2047. However, EM prepared a revised cost  estimate in 2018 that estimated costs to be $34 billion and estimated  completion dates ranging from 2065 to 2070. EM had initially included  information from this 2018 estimate in a draft of the 2019 triennial  report, but ultimately did not include this information or note it in any  way in the final report provided to Congress. EM headquarters  officials told us that they did not include the updated 2018 Paducah  cost estimate in the final 2019 report because they had already  completed an extensive field and headquarters review process of the  2019 triennial report and did not want to repeat that process.", "The 2019 triennial report does not discuss the challenges EM  faces in reaching agreement with EPA and state regulators. The  2019 triennial report has a section on challenges and uncertainties for  each GDP. For the Oak Ridge and Paducah GDPs, this section does  not discuss the challenges EM faces in reaching agreement with  regulators on cleanup remediation decisions. For example, the Oak  Ridge challenges and uncertainties section of the 2019 triennial report  mentions that some groundwater treatment may be required, but the  report does not disclose EM\u2019s assumption in its cost estimate that it  will receive a waiver allowing it to avoid active groundwater  remediation activities or that this is an area of disagreement with the  regulators. Similarly, the report\u2019s discussion of challenges and  uncertainties at Paducah mentions that several CERCLA decisions  regarding groundwater need to be made, but does not discuss  disagreements with the regulators over priorities or the implications of  those decisions on cost or schedule.", "Information in triennial reports is not always clear on scope of  work. Some information in the triennial reports has not always been  clear. For example, when reporting its cost estimates in its three most  recent triennial reports (2010, 2016, and 2019), DOE reports only  future costs for Oak Ridge; whereas for Portsmouth and Paducah it  reports either total costs (past plus future estimated costs), or future  costs, or does not clearly indicate if the cost estimate represents total  or future costs. These differences make it difficult to make  comparisons among the three GDPs. In addition, in six triennial  reports, DOE reported similar estimated future costs for completing  the Oak Ridge GDP cleanup\u2014$1.2 billion in the 1998 report; $1.3  billion in 2001; $1.6 billion in 2007; $2.1 billion in 2010; $1.4 billion in  2016; and $950 million in 2019. Estimated costs to complete cleanup  would likely be reduced over time as work scope is completed, unless  the scope of work is increasing, costs for materials are increasing, or  prior estimates were incorrect; however, DOE has not clearly  explained the factors contributing to these similar future cost  estimates in any of its reports since 2007 (2007, 2010, 2016, 2019).", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should externally communicate the necessary quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.

Although DOE has stated its intent to manage cleanup of  the GDPs in an integrated manner, EM is not managing the cleanup as  an integrated program, even though cleanup of the GDPs meets the  definition of a program as defined by PMI and Congress established a  single, shared D&D Fund to pay for the cleanup. By taking steps to  manage the three GDPs as an integrated program and following relevant  program management leading practices we examined (developing a  program management plan, an integrated master schedule, and a  reliable, integrated, comprehensive life-cycle cost estimate), EM would  have more reasonable assurance that it is taking every opportunity to  increase the efficiency and effectiveness of its management activities.", "Further, EM has limited expenditure data and its cost estimates for  completing cleanup are not reliable. Detailed expenditure data are  important for developing reliable cost estimates. However, according to  EM officials, EM does not track detailed expenditure data consistently  across the three GDPs. As a result, EM\u2019s ability to develop accurate and  informed cost estimates for future work at the three GDP sites is limited.  By tracking consistent and detailed expenditure information on cleanup  activities across the three GDPs, EM management will be better able to  develop reliable cost estimates to plan for future work.

During our interviews,  we discussed topics including funding for the GDP cleanup, cleanup  progress to date, and any challenges facing the cleanup effort. We  selected these interviewees because we determined, based on input from  EM officials, that they would be the most knowledgeable about GDP  cleanup status, funding, and challenges. Following these interviews, we  conducted a content analysis of all responses to our interview questions  to determine any key challenges that EM faces in completing cleanup of  the GDPs. We then grouped, coded, and verified the content in our  analysis and performed second-rater review. Through our content  analysis, we found that stakeholders primarily cited three key challenges  related to EM\u2019s program management; relations between EM, EPA, and  state regulators; and transitioning the local communities to cleanup  completion.", "To examine the extent to which EM has managed the cleanup of the  GDPs compared with relevant leading practices for program  management, and the status of the cleanup effort, we reviewed  documents, including site-specific GDP cleanup plans and GDP cleanup  progress briefings, as well as reports issued by the National Academies,  us, and DOE.

We assessed  the information from these reviews and all interviews (content analysis  from interview responses) and identified the relevant program  management leading practices that aligned with the assessed  information. We identified the three program management leading  practices by reviewing our prior work and the Project Management  Institute\u2019s (PMI) The Standard for Program Management\u2014Fourth  Edition. The three leading practices were having (1) a program  management plan, (2) an integrated master schedule, and (3) a reliable,  integrated, comprehensive life-cycle cost estimate.

As discussed  above, we conducted a content analysis of their responses to our  interviews and found that stakeholders primarily cited three key  challenges, including EM\u2019s poor program management. Under poor  program management, stakeholders cited three sub-challenges: (1)  frequent changes in EM\u2019s cleanup priorities and staff turnover, which  most closely aligns with the program planning leading practice; (2) lack of  integrated schedules across the GDPs, which most closely aligns with the  scheduling leading practice; and (3) lack of transparency in EM\u2019s cost  estimation processes, which most closely aligns with the program cost  estimating leading practice. As a result, we assessed the three leading  practices that aligned with those issues: (1) program management plan,  (2) integrated master schedule, and (3) integrated comprehensive life- cycle cost estimate. To examine the status of cleanup at the GDPs, we  reviewed EM\u2019s documentation of the work completed and the work  remaining at each GDP.", "To examine what EM has spent on cleanup at the three GDP sites, and  the extent to which EM\u2019s cost estimates for completing GDP cleanup are  reliable, we reviewed historical funding and cleanup expenditure data for  all three sites for the period from fiscal year 1994 through 2018 and  analyzed EM documentation supporting its cost estimates for each of the  three GDPs. The data the sites provided include expenditures from the  D&D Fund as well as from other funding sources including: the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Uranium Facilities Maintenance and  Remediation funds, Environmental Management Waste Management  Facility funds, and Technetium-99 cleanup funds. We reviewed financial  statement audit reports issued on the D&D Fund for fiscal years 2005 to  2012 and met with relevant headquarters and field staff in financial  management, budget, and planning. In addition, we assessed the  reliability of the historical funding and expenditure data provided by EM.  Specifically, we obtained from EM officials familiar with DOE\u2019s financial  management system responses to a series of data reliability questions  such as data entry access, quality control procedures, and the accuracy  and completeness of the data. During our review of the GDP expenditure  data, we identified a number of inconsistencies between the data  received from EM site officials and the data reported in DOE\u2019s 2019  triennial report to Congress. EM officials were able to provide satisfactory  responses and documentation to address the identified inconsistencies.  We therefore found the data to be reliable for our purposes.", "To examine the reliability of EM\u2019s cost estimates for completing cleanup  at the three GDPs, we reviewed EM\u2019s cost estimate documentation,  interviewed EM site officials, and compared GDP cost estimates against  characteristics of reliable cost estimates contained in our Cost Estimating  Guide. Our review included documents that established the basis and  assumptions for site contractors\u2019 contributions to the cost estimate,  documents that established the contractors\u2019 work breakdown structures,  and presentations on contractors\u2019 cost estimating models. We interviewed  EM site officials and contractor staff responsible for producing the cost  estimates to understand the methods, assumptions, information, and data  EM used to produce the estimates. Our cost estimation specialists  assessed this information against the best practices for cost estimating  found in our Cost Estimating Guide that we developed to establish a  consistent methodology that can be used across the federal government  to develop, manage, and evaluate capital program cost estimates. We  shared our draft assessment for each GDP cost estimate with EM officials  and then revised those assessments based on EM\u2019s written comments  and additional documentation they provided as appropriate. At EM\u2019s  request, we met with Oak Ridge officials a second time to discuss our  assessment of the Oak Ridge GDP cost estimate and reviewed additional  documents provided by officials, and we reflected that additional  information into our assessment of the Oak Ridge cost estimate.", "To examine the extent to which the D&D Fund is sufficient to cover EM\u2019s  estimated cleanup costs of the GDPs and challenges, if any, that could  affect the sufficiency of the D&D Fund, we reviewed information on the  balance of the D&D Fund and compared it to EM cost estimate  information, past reports that describe the balance of the fund, and our  prior report on the fund. Despite our findings that the three cost  estimates were unreliable, we were able to report on the cost estimates  provided in DOE\u2019s 2019 Triennial Report by presenting an \u201cat least\u201d cost  estimate.
