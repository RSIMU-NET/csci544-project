While the Smithsonian follows key security practices, communication of security information and funding constraints pose challenges. The Smithsonian has made significant strides in improving its real property portfolio management. However, the Smithsonian omitted privately funded projects from its capital plan, making it challenging to assess the total funding and scope of projects. GAO's September 2007 report recommended that the Smithsonian increase awareness of security issues and include privately funded projects in its capital plan. The Smithsonian concurred. To address GAO's 2005 recommendation that the Smithsonian develop a funding plan for facilities projects, the Board of Regents created an ad-hoc committee that reviewed nine options and chose to request increased federal funding. Some of the Smithsonian's evaluations of the nine funding options were limited in that they did not always provide complete analysis, fully explain assumptions, benchmark with other organizations, or consider combining options to increase revenue. GAO's September 2007 report recommended that the Smithsonian more comprehensively analyze funding options and report to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget on a funding strategy. The Smithsonian concurred. The Board of Regents recently established a prioritized list of funding options. Preliminary results of GAO's ongoing work on broader governance issues indicate that the Board of Regents has made some changes to strengthen governance, such as more clearly defining the Regents' oversight responsibilities and improving access between the board and key members of senior management. The board is also studying whether changes to its size and composition would strengthen governance. GAO's preliminary work suggests that the Board appears to have taken some positive steps toward governance reform, but that success will depend in part on how Regents embrace their new responsibilities and on their level of engagement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today on our work on  the Smithsonian Institution (Smithsonian).

Since its beginning, the Smithsonian has evolved into the  world\u2019s largest museum complex and research organization; two of its  museums on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., are the most visited in  the world. The act establishing the Smithsonian in 1846 provided, among  other things, that the business of the Smithsonian be conducted by a  Board of Regents.", "In recent years, the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA),  the Smithsonian, and we have reported on the deterioration of the  Smithsonian\u2019s facilities and the threat posed by this deterioration to the  Smithsonian\u2019s collections.

Moreover, we reported that structural deterioration and failing systems in  Smithsonian museums and other facilities presented serious long-term  risks to the Smithsonian\u2019s collections.

In April 2005, we reported that the Smithsonian\u2019s current funding would  not be sufficient to cover its estimated $2.3 billion in facilities projects  through 2013 and recommended that the Smithsonian Board of Regents  develop and implement a funding plan to address the Smithsonian\u2019s  facilities projects.

In the past year, following a report from the  Smithsonian\u2019s Inspector General to the Board of Regents on the  Smithsonian\u2019s former Secretary\u2019s compensation package and expenses,  the former Secretary resigned. In response to concerns about the  Smithsonian\u2019s governance raised by the former Secretary\u2019s compensation  and expenses, as well as other issues, two studies were conducted, one by  the Board of Regents\u2019 Governance Committee and the other by an  Independent Review Committee (IRC) created at the request of the Board  of Regents. Among the findings of these studies were that the roles and  responsibilities of Regents were not clearly defined; under the former  Secretary of the Smithsonian, key senior officials such as the General  Counsel, Inspector General, and Chief Financial Officer were isolated from  the board; and the Regents did not routinely receive or request  information necessary to support vigorous deliberation, well-reasoned  decision making, and adequate oversight.

To that end, the act  establishing the Smithsonian provided for the administration of the trust,  independent of the government itself, by a Board of Regents and a  Secretary, who were given broad discretion in the use of the trust funds.  The Board of Regents currently consists of nine private citizens as well as  members of all three branches of the federal government, including the  Chief Justice of the United States, the Vice President, and six  congressional members, three from the Senate, and three from the House  of Representatives.", "Over the last 160 years, the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities inventory has  expanded to include 19 museums and galleries, 9 research centers, a zoo,  and other facilities\u2014most located in or near Washington, D.C.

In fiscal year  2006, the Smithsonian\u2019s operating revenues were about $947 million, of  which about 65 percent came from federal appropriations. The facilities  capital appropriation, which was about $98.5 million in fiscal year 2006,  provides funds for construction and revitalization projects. The salaries  and expenses appropriation, which was about $516.6 million in fiscal year  2006, includes funding for the program activities of each museum and  research center; rents; utilities; and facilities\u2019 operations, maintenance,  and security costs. The remaining operating revenues come from the  Smithsonian\u2019s private trust funds. These are of two types:    Restricted trust funds\u2014which made up 29 percent of the Smithsonian\u2019s  operating revenue in fiscal year 2006\u2014include such items as gifts from  individuals and corporations that specify the purpose of the funds.", "Restricted funds have been provided for some facilities\u2019 construction  projects and enhancements related to revitalization projects.", "Unrestricted trust funds\u2014which made up 6 percent of the  Smithsonian\u2019s operating revenue in fiscal year 2006\u2014include income  from investment earnings and net proceeds from business activities,  and can be used to support any Smithsonian activity. The Smithsonian  typically has used unrestricted trust funds for fundraising, some salary  costs, and central administration costs. Although the Smithsonian can  use unrestricted trust funds for any purpose consistent with the  Smithson Trust and therefore could use them for facilities revitalization  and maintenance, it has not done so. Smithsonian officials stated that  the unrestricted trust fund budget is small and that if these salary and  central administration costs were not paid for with unrestricted trust  funds, they would have to use federal funds or eliminate positions or  programs to cover these expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Some Improvements, Deteriorating Facilities Threaten Collections, and Security and Real Property Portfolio Management Efforts Have Strengths and Limitations", "paragraphs": ["With regard to real property management, the Smithsonian has made a  number of facilities improvements since our 2005 report, but the  continued deterioration of many facilities has caused access restrictions  and threatened the collections, and the Smithsonian\u2019s cost estimate for  facilities projects has increased.

According to Smithsonian officials, the increase in this cost  estimate was due to several factors. For example, Smithsonian officials  said that major increases had occurred in projects for the National  Zoological Park and the National Museum of American History because  the two facilities had recently developed master plans that identified  additional requirements. In addition, according to Smithsonian officials,  estimates for antiterrorism projects had increased due to adjustments for  higher costs for security-related projects at the National Air and Space  Museum, and the increase in the cost estimate also reflects the effect of  delaying corrective work in terms of additional damage and escalation in  construction costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Security Efforts Include Following Key Security Practices but Face Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Smithsonian follows key security practices to protect its assets, but it  faces two key challenges, one related to ensuring that museum and facility  directors are aware of important security information and the other  related to funding constraints.

In September 2005, an ad-hoc Committee on Facilities Revitalization  established by the Board of Regents reviewed nine funding options that  had been prepared by Smithsonian management for addressing this  estimated funding need. The nine options are briefly described in Table 1.", "After reviewing materials on these nine options prepared by Smithsonian  management, the ad-hoc committee decided to request an additional $100  million annually in federal funds for facilities over its current  appropriation for 10 years, starting in 2008, for a total of an additional $1  billion. To implement this recommendation, in September 2006, several  members of the Board of Regents and the Secretary of the Smithsonian  met with the President to discuss the issue of increased federal funding for  the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities. According to two members of the Board of  Regents, this option was selected because the board believed that the  revitalization, construction, and maintenance of Smithsonian facilities are  federal responsibilities. According to Smithsonian officials, it is the  position of the Smithsonian, based on an historical understanding, that the  maintenance and revitalization of facilities are a federal responsibility.  Smithsonian officials pointed out that as early as the 1850s, the federal  government has provided appropriations to the Smithsonian for the care  and presentation of objects belonging to the United States. The President\u2019s  fiscal year 2008 budget proposal included an increase of about $44 million  over the Smithsonian\u2019s fiscal year 2007 appropriation, far short of what the  Smithsonian requested, and it is not clear how much of this proposed  increase would be used to support facilities.", "Our analysis of the Smithsonian\u2019s evaluations of the eight other funding  options, including the potential benefits and drawbacks of each, showed  that the evaluations were limited in that they did not always include a  complete analysis, fully explain specific assumptions, or benchmark with  other organizations\u2014items crucial to determining each option\u2019s potential  viability. For example, the Smithsonian\u2019s analysis of a general admission  fee option included an adjustment of annual net gains to account for  losses in revenue at restaurants and stores. However, the Smithsonian\u2019s  materials did not discuss whether other museums had experienced such  losses after establishing admission fees. We spoke with six other museums  and a zoological park that stated that instituting or increasing admission  fees did not decrease the amount of money visitors spent in restaurants  and stores. In addition, although several of the nine options were  dismissed because independently the options would not generate the  amount of revenue required to address the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities  projects, the evaluation did not consider the potential of combining  options to generate more revenue.", "In our September 2007 report, we concluded that if the Smithsonian does  not develop a viable strategy to address its growing cost estimate for  facilities projects, its facilities and collections face increased risk, and the  ability of the Smithsonian to meet its mission will likely decline. We  therefore concluded that the Board of Regents\u2019 stewardship role obligates  it to consider providing more private funds to meet the funding  requirements of its overall mission. We recommended that the  Smithsonian Board of Regents perform a more comprehensive analysis of  alternative funding strategies beyond principally using federal funds to  support facilities and submit a report to Congress and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) describing a funding strategy for current  and future facilities needs.

These activities included several meetings and  conversations, including some with Smithsonian management, and the  consideration of some new papers on funding options. The papers  contained information on some previously identified options as well as on  some new options. A Smithsonian official acknowledged, however, that  these papers did not provide comprehensive analysis and that many were  not significantly different from the previous materials. According to a  Smithsonian official, the Smithsonian determined that it did not wish to  spend resources further analyzing all options but instead will analyze  those the board has decided to pursue. According to a Smithsonian  official, at this November 19 meeting of the Board of Regents, the Regents  concurred with a prioritized list of funding options that was presented by  the committee.

Previously, the roles and responsibilities of  Regents and regent committees were not clearly and explicitly stated.  The Governance Committee found that without a formal job  description, the role of a regent was subject to individual  interpretation, and it determined that adopting a clear statement of  regent duties and responsibilities would reaffirm that the board is the  Smithsonian\u2019s ultimate governing authority. Accordingly, the board has  taken several actions to clarify these responsibilities, including 1)  adopting specific written responsibilities and expectations for all  Regents, including that all Regents should participate in committees; 2)  clarifying the duties of the Chancellor (who by tradition is the Chief  Justice) and creating a new board Chair position to play a leadership  role in guiding the board in the exercise of its oversight functions; and  3) appointing new leadership for all committees. These changes are  now being put into practice and it is therefore too soon to evaluate  whether they will be effective in improving governance at the  Smithsonian.", "Access of key management to the board and information  available have been improved. Several of the recent governance  problems reported at the Smithsonian have been attributed to the  isolation of certain members of senior management from the board and  the office of the former Secretary\u2019s tight control of information  available to the board. The board has taken a number of steps to  address these issues, including 1) amending its bylaws to require the  attendance of the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer, or their  designees, at all meetings of the board and relevant board committees,  2) strengthening the relationship between the Inspector General\u2019s  office and the board, and 3) establishing an independent Office of the  Regents that is responsible for, among other things, setting the agenda  for the board in concert with the Secretary and through consultation  with Smithsonian museum directors and others. While we have not  independently validated these changes to assess whether they will be  effective in improving oversight, both senior management and the  Board of Regents\u2019 staff told us that communication between the  Regents and senior management has improved. For example, the  General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer both told us that they are  now directly reporting to the Regents and are available at board  meetings to discuss details and answer questions about information  they bring to the Regents.", "Management policies have been strengthened. The Governance  Committee found that previous policies regarding expense  reimbursement (including travel) and conflict-of-interest policies were  not well-defined, which contributed to the lack of oversight of certain  practices of the former Secretary as well as the failure to actively  manage apparent conflicts of interest at the Smithsonian. The board  has clarified management policies on travel and expense  reimbursement, and created new ones, such as prohibiting senior  executives from serving on the boards of for-profit companies. We have  not independently validated these changes to assess whether they will  be effective in improving oversight, and it is not yet clear how these  policies will improve the governance of the institution in practice.", "A compensation range to guide the search for a new secretary  has been established. In response to concerns about the  compensation of the former Secretary (which included, among other  things, a housing allowance that some Regents were unaware of), the  board contracted for a study to identify a compensation range to guide  the search for a new secretary, with the goals of making the secretary\u2019s  compensation transparent and balancing the Smithsonian\u2019s public trust  status with the need to attract the best leader. According to a Board of  Regents\u2019 staff member, the study included benchmarking with about 30  comparable organizations.

Nonetheless, based on our review of common non-profit governance  practices, and according to governance experts and others we consulted,  there is no \u201cright\u201d number of board members. A board that is small will  have fewer members to serve on committees, whereas having too many  board members can lead to increased difficulty in making decisions and  can stifle the effectiveness of the board. Determining the appropriate size  for a board entails balancing the need for a board that is of a manageable  size with such things as ensuring the board has the expertise necessary to  achieve its mission and achieving an appropriate diversity of values and  perspectives among board members.", "Beyond the size and structure of the board, several governance experts we  interviewed stressed that having board members who actively participate  and are engaged is central to good governance, and some nonprofit  organizations we met with stated that they focused on changing the  governance culture at their organization. For example, representatives  from one nonprofit organization we spoke with\u2014which recently had  similar issues related to executive compensation and expenses\u2014stated  that they have focused on creating a culture of accountability and  transparency in the board\u2019s activities. They told us that they did not  change the size or structure of the board, but rather clarified roles and  responsibilities, improved communication throughout the various  divisions of the organization, and took other actions aimed at improving  the accountability and transparency of the board.", "In order to address other governance recommendations, the Board of  Regents has planned another longer term study, due in May 2008, aimed at  establishing a stronger link between the board and the Smithsonian\u2019s 30  advisory boards. These boards include the Smithsonian National Board as  well as advisory boards that focus on individual museums or research  centers. According to the Governance Committee, the advisory boards  provide a key link between the Regents and the public and a direct  connection to the museums. Based on preliminary findings of our ongoing  work, the Regents generally have had limited interaction with the advisory  boards, although the advisory boards serve important functions in the  operations of the individual museums and other facilities across the  Smithsonian. Preliminary results from our ongoing work indicate that  several museum directors are concerned about the Regents\u2019 level of  interaction with advisory boards and most museum directors see  additional value from having a more direct relationship between the Board  of Regents and the various museums, research facilities, and other  institutions within the Smithsonian.", "Governance experts and others we spoke with said that, in general, the  board appears to have taken some positive steps toward governance  reform.  However, according to the literature we reviewed and governance  experts we interviewed, success will depend in part on how Regents  embrace their new responsibilities and on their level of engagement, as  good governance results from a board that consists of active and deeply  engaged members.", "In our ongoing work, we will continue to assess the Board of Regents\u2019  governance changes and how the board is addressing long-term  governance challenges facing the Smithsonian. We expect to report on  these issues in 2008.", "Madam Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.

Our testimony regarding the Smithsonian\u2019s real property  management is based on our past report on the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities,  including their condition, security, management, and funding, and  information provided by Smithsonian officials on steps taken to develop a  funding plan for facilities projects. Our testimony regarding preliminary  results of our ongoing work on the Smithsonian\u2019s governance changes is  based on our review of Smithsonian and other documents, and interviews  with Smithsonian Regents and officials and others.  Specifically, we  reviewed laws relating to the Smithsonian, the Independent Review  Committee report, and the Smithsonian\u2019s Governance Committee Report,  and spoke to Smithsonian Regents and officials on their progress towards  implementing governance recommendations.  We also interviewed all  Smithsonian museum directors. We conducted a literature search to help  identify governance experts and organizations that had recently  undergone governance reforms. We identified and interviewed ten  specialists on nonprofit or museum governance, including academics and  representatives of associations dedicated to nonprofit governance. This  included four governance or museum experts who had advised or  consulted with the Smithsonian during its governance review, as well as  six that we identified through a literature search or were referred to us by  other experts in the field.", "We also reviewed literature on nonprofit governance to identify common  nonprofit governance practices, including literature from organizations  such as the American Association of Museums, BoardSource, Council on  Foundations, and Independent Sector. In addition, we met with several  organizations that had characteristics similar to those of the Smithsonian  and that had recently undergone governance reforms. We focused on  organizations that had had similar governance problems, conducted a  governance review, and changed their practice or structure; organizations  that had a structure that consisted of a central or national governing body  with multiple programming units; and organizations with similar missions  and stewardship challenges. As of December 5, 2007, we had met with  officials from American University, American National Red Cross, Getty  Trust, National Trust for Historic Preservation, and United Way of  America.", "In ongoing work, we are continuing to evaluate the Smithsonian Board of  Regents\u2019 governance reforms. Our objectives for this ongoing work  include assessing (1) how governance changes being made by the Board of  Regents address recent governance problems and how changes will be  implemented and evaluated, and (2) how the Board of Regents is  addressing other long-term governance challenges facing the Smithsonian,  such as funding, strategic planning, facilities, collections and museum  management, and what, if any, additional oversight activities would be  beneficial to the board in achieving its mission. We are also continuing to  interview recognized experts in nonprofit governance selected through the  process described above to obtain their independent views on the  Smithsonian\u2019s governance problems and whether recent governance  changes will address those problems; and we are conducting interviews  and reviewing documents from organizations selected through the process  described above that have recently changed their governance structure  and practice.
