The 2- to 4-week volunteer assignments are designed, among  other things, to improve farm and agribusiness operations and agricultural  systems, field crop cultivation, fruit and vegetable growing, livestock  operations, marketing, and the strengthening of cooperatives and other  farmer organizations (see fig. 1).", "USAID promotes a secondary goal not specifically noted in the  authorizing legislation: to increase the American public\u2019s understanding of  international development issues and programs and international  understanding of the United States and U.S. development programs. The  volunteer nature of the program\u2019s activities provides the opportunity for  people-to-people cultural and technical exchange.

However, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union,  USAID initiated F2F program activities in the newly independent  countries, including conducting a substantial number of volunteer  assignments in Russia. The additional funding for these countries  significantly increased the size of the F2F program. In the 2008 Farm Bill,  Congress required that a minimum of $10 million be used to carry out the  F2F program for each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Over the  fiscal years 2009 through 2013 period, USAID obligated an average of  $11.5 million annually to the F2F program, and the program disbursed a  total of $57.7 million for that program cycle. In the 2014 Farm Bill,  Congress increased the minimum annual F2F funding requirement to $15  million.", "During the fiscal years 2009 through 2013 F2F program cycle,  implementing partners under eight cooperative agreements and one  contract made 2,984 volunteer assignments, most to 28 core countries  (see fig. 2).

To address our objectives, we reviewed program  documents and information from the previous and current program cycles  covering fiscal years 2009 through 2013 and 2014 through 2018,  respectively.", "To determine how USAID administers the F2F program, we analyzed  USAID and implementing partner documents such as requests for  applications, cooperative agreements, and country program descriptions.  We also reviewed USAID\u2019s F2F program manual. In addition, we  reviewed USAID data on the number of volunteer assignments. Our  analysis of these data found some inconsistencies, but we found the data  sufficiently reliable to generally enumerate the number of volunteer  assignments by country. We divided those countries into four roughly  even groups. We met with officials from USAID\u2019s Bureau of Food Security  F2F program in Washington, D.C., to understand their role in  administering the program. We also met with the headquarters officials for  implementing partners of the current program cycle, either in Washington,  D.C., or via teleconference.", "GAO, Internal Control Standards: Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool,  GAO-01-1008G (Washington, D.C.: August 2001). addition, we conducted fieldwork in Ghana and Uganda, meeting with  USAID mission officials, implementing partner field staff, F2F volunteers,  and beneficiary host organizations. In selecting countries for fieldwork, we  considered various factors, including the number of volunteers assigned,  the implementing partner\u2019s experience with the program and whether  Associate Award activities occurred in either the previous or current cycle.", "To determine the extent to which USAID uses monitoring and evaluation  to manage the program, we reviewed documents such as the  implementing partner\u2019s semiannual and annual reports, USAID\u2019s 2012  midterm evaluation of the program, and USAID\u2019s list of performance  indicators and their definitions. We also reviewed GAO\u2019s Internal Control  Management and Evaluation Tool. In addition, we met with officials from  USAID\u2019s Bureau of Food Security F2F program in Washington, D.C., and  with an implementing partner while conducting fieldwork to understand  how the program\u2019s monitoring and evaluation process has changed and  the indicators on which the implementing partners currently report.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2014 to April 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: USAID Missions Independently Administer Related Programs through Farmer-to-Farmer Partners", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) missions can  leverage the Farmer-to-Farmer (F2F) program by making separate  awards to F2F partners to implement agricultural programs. According to  USAID guidance, a mission can make one or more of these awards,  known as Associate Awards, to the recipient of an already existing Leader  with Associate Award Cooperative Agreement (LWA) without going  through an additional competitive proposal process. Therefore, missions,  in consultation with implementing partners and the F2F office, can design  and propose programs to implement under the Associate Award  mechanism. Mission staff independently administer the Associate Award  program and are responsible for financial oversight, monitoring and  evaluation, and all other reporting requirements. Nevertheless, according  to USAD officials, Associate Award programs are required to report the  number of volunteers used in their programs to the F2F office to ensure  that volunteers are incorporated into Associate Award programming.", "According to USAID guidance, F2F Associate Awards must be in  alignment with the original program\u2019s purpose and goals. Associate  Awards may provide for (1) additional volunteer services in a F2F country  or another country, (2) complementary support for F2F projects (i.e.,  grants, training, equipment and facilities, or other inputs) that can improve  F2F program outreach and impact, or (3) volunteer services and  complementary support for agricultural projects addressing a specific F2F  development objective. Although F2F limits its activities to the provision of  volunteer technical assistance, Associate Award programs use other  funding sources and may implement other types of development activities  in addition to volunteer assistance. LWAs and Associate Awards are  considered separate obligating mechanisms; thus, funds from one award  cannot be transferred to another.", "According to USAID officials, the Associate Award process is relatively  fast and streamlined because it does not require any further competition.  Mission officials noted that Associate Awards are an attractive option  when considering funding mechanisms available for agriculture-related  programs. During the fiscal years 2009 through 2013 cycle, USAID  awarded 15 Associate Awards to three implementing partners, totaling  $125 million. For example, a $32 million Associate Award was granted to  an agriculture-related program in Ghana. In the current cycle, USAID has  awarded 2 Associate Awards, 1 in Burma for $27 million and another in  Ethiopia for approximately $3 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the U.S. Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Val\u00e9rie L.
