Replacing much of its 1980s-based technology with modern system applications and supporting technical infrastructure, this modernization is intended to enable the FBI to take an integrated, agencywide approach to performing its critical missions, such as federal crime investigation and terrorism prevention. At the request of the Congress, GAO has conducted a series of reviews of the FBI's modernization management. GAO was requested to testify on the bureau's progress to date in several areas of IT management. In addition, GAO discusses the importance of these areas for maximizing the prospects for success of the bureau's ongoing and future IT system investments, including the FBI's flagship Sentinel program; this program replaces the bureau's failed Virtual Case File project and aims to acquire and deploy a modern investigative case management system. In this testimony, GAO relied extensively on its previous work on the FBI's management of its IT processes, human capital, and tools, and it obtained updates on these efforts through reviews of documentation and interviews with responsible FBI officials, including the Chief Information Officer (CIO)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 18 months, the FBI has made important progress in establishing IT management controls and capabilities that GAO's research and experience show are key to exploiting technology to enable transformation. These include centralizing IT responsibility and authority under the CIO and establishing and beginning to implement management capabilities in the areas of enterprise architecture, IT investment management, systems development and acquisition life cycle management, and IT human capital. The FBI has developed an initial version of its enterprise architecture and is managing its architecture activities in accordance with many key practices, but it has yet to adopt others (such as ensuring that the program office has staff with appropriate architecture expertise). The FBI is in the process of defining and implementing investment management policies and procedures. For example, it is performing assessments of existing systems to determine if any can be better used, replaced, outsourced, or retired, but these assessments have yet to be completed. The bureau has issued an agencywide standard life cycle management directive, but it has yet to fully implement this directive on all projects. Also, certain key practices, such as acquisition management, require further development. The FBI has taken various steps to bolster its IT workforce, but it has yet to create an integrated plan based on a comprehensive analysis of existing and needed knowledge, skills, and abilities. According to the CIO, he intends to hire a contractor to perform this and develop an implementation plan. The CIO also intends to establish a management structure to carry out the plan. The challenge now for the FBI is to build on these foundational capabilities and implement them effectively on the program and project investments it has under way and planned, none of which is more important than the Sentinel program. The success of this program will depend on how well the FBI defines and implements its new IT management approaches and capabilities, particularly those associated with acquiring a system made up of commercial components, which Sentinel is to be. In this regard, it will be crucial for the FBI, among other things, to understand and control Sentinel requirements in the context of (1) its enterprise architecture, (2) the capabilities and interoperability of commercially available products, and the (3) bureau's human capital and financial resource constraints. It will also be important for the FBI to prepare users for the impact of the new system on how they do their jobs. To the extent that the FBI does not take these steps, it will introduce program risks that could lead to problems similar to those that contributed to the failure of the Virtual Case File project."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Subcommittee\u2019s  hearing on the efforts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  to transform itself in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001.

As the focal point for IT management within an agency, the  CIO is positioned to oversee the establishment and implementation  of agencywide capabilities in IT management.", "In the FBI, responsibility for managing IT was historically  decentralized and diffused. For example, we testified in March 2004  that the FBI had not provided its CIO with bureauwide IT  management authority and responsibility, vesting these instead in  the bureau\u2019s divisions. This is part of the reason that the FBI\u2019s IT  environment at the time consisted of nonintegrated applications  residing on different servers, each of which had its own unique  databases, unable to share information with other applications or  with other government agencies. To address this, we discussed with  the Director in 2003 the importance of centralizing IT management  responsibility and authority under the CIO, and we subsequently  recommended that the CIO be provided with the responsibility and  authority for managing IT bureauwide, including budget  management control and oversight of IT programs and initiatives.", "The FBI has since taken steps to strengthen the scope and influence  of the CIO Office.

Our  experience with federal agencies has shown that attempting to  modernize systems without having an enterprise architecture often  results in systems that are duplicative, not well integrated,  unnecessarily costly to maintain, and limited in terms of optimizing  mission performance.", "To assist agencies in effectively developing, maintaining, and  implementing an enterprise architecture, we published a framework  for architecture management, grounded in federal guidance and  recognized best practices. In 2002 and again in 2003, we reported  that the FBI did not have either an architecture to guide and  constrain its IT investments or the means in place to develop and  implement one. We further reported that the development of an  architecture was not being given the priority that it deserved.  Accordingly, we recommended that the Director make it an  institutional priority, and provided a series of recommendations for  building an architecture management foundation, developing and  completing the architecture, and using it to inform IT investment  decision making.", "In the last 12 months, the bureau has made important progress in  developing its architecture. Last week we issued a congressionally  mandated report on the state of the FBI\u2019s enterprise architecture  efforts. In summary, we found that the FBI is now managing its  enterprise architecture program in accordance with many best  practices, but it has yet to adopt others. Examples of best practices  that the bureau has implemented include the following:   \u25cf  the bureau has established a program office that is responsible  for the development of the architecture;   it has issued a written and approved policy governing  architecture development; and   it has ongoing efforts to complete a target architecture.", "We ascribed this important progress, in part, to the demonstrated  commitment of the FBI\u2019s top management to the enterprise  architecture program. Nonetheless, we recognized that much  remains to be accomplished before the FBI\u2019s enterprise architecture  program will be mature. For example, we reported that the  architecture program office did not yet have appropriate human  resources with architecture expertise and that the bureau was not  following a defined methodology for developing its architecture,  both of which are foundational items. Also, the bureau\u2019s current and  target architectures were not yet complete. (For instance, the  program office had not completed mapping FBI data structures,  classifications, and exchanges to the business processes that use the  data, nor has it finished defining how the various IT applications  currently interrelate.) Further, the bureau had not yet begun to  develop its investment plans for transitioning from the current to  the target architectural states.", "We also reported that the FBI had not employed effective contract  management controls in developing its enterprise architecture,  which is risky because the bureau is relying heavily on contractor  support in this effort.

In 2002, the bureau first  focused on developing an approach that addressed solely IT  investments and in 2003 expanded the approach\u2019s scope to include  all capital investments. In 2004, under the leadership of the current  CIO, the bureau redirected its investment selection, control, and  evaluation activities back to include IT investments only. In  September 2004, we reported that this redirected approach included  one set of processes for new investments that are planned and  under way and another set for the operation and maintenance of  existing systems. At that time, the process for investments in new  systems was still being defined, while a process for allocating  operations and maintenance resources across existing systems had  been developed. We also reported that the bureau was to pilot test  its developed process on different types of investments (systems,  applications, databases, and networks) with the goal of  subsequently implementing the process enterprisewide. In our view,  it was important that the implemented process be in accordance  with key IT investment decision-making best practices (such as our  ITIM framework). Accordingly, we made recommendations aimed at  expediting implementation of ITIM-compliant policies and  procedures.", "Since then, the FBI has taken a number of steps to strengthen its  capability to manage IT investments. For example, in November  2004, the FBI established an investment review board, composed of  senior executives, that meets about every 2 weeks to review  proposed and ongoing investments in new systems. The CIO stated  that the board recently completed its first evaluation of the bureau\u2019s  89 ongoing IT investments to, among other things, establish cost,  schedule, and performance baselines and to begin the process of  having the CIO and other senior executive review the projects at  critical development milestones. The CIO also reported that the  bureau has reviewed over 37 new proposals and is using the results  in preparing its fiscal year 2007 IT budget request.

Using cost and other criteria,  these assessments are designed to determine which systems can be  better used, replaced, outsourced, or retired. According to the CIO,  the program recently completed a pilot assessment of projects in  one FBI division, and it is currently preparing to perform similar  assessments in the other divisions, which are scheduled to be  completed by April 2006.", "Notwithstanding these efforts, until the FBI fully implements  processes for selecting, controlling, and evaluating all its IT  investments, it will not be able to ensure that it is applying its  resources to the best mix of investments to meet the goals of  modernizing IT and transforming itself."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau Has Moved to Standardize System Development and Acquisition Life Cycle Processes that Were Inconsistent across FBI Components", "paragraphs": ["Having rigorous and disciplined IT system development and  acquisition life cycle processes is an important component of IT  management.

Five process areas associated with systems acquisition  (which collectively are composed of 30 key practice areas) are  configuration management, project management, quality assurance,  requirements development and management, and risk management.  In combination with other process areas, these five provide a  foundation for managing software-intensive systems in a manner  that minimizes risks and increases the chances of systems delivering  required system capabilities and benefits on time and within budget.", "In September 2004, we reported that the life cycle management  policies and procedures then in place at the FBI for these five areas  varied widely by division. On the one hand, for example, the  policies and procedures for the six divisions that we examined  generally addressed all the practices associated with the project  management process area (see table 2); this process area involves  management of project office activities so that projects are timely,  efficient, and effective.", "On the other hand, for example, the policies and procedures for  these six divisions generally did not address the key practices  associated with requirements development and management  process area (see table 3); this process area involves establishing  and maintaining agreement on system requirements. We would note  that according to the CIO, it was a lack of bureau rigor and  discipline in this area that in part caused the Virtual Case File  project to be terminated.", "Examples of requirements development and management practices  that most divisions did not adequately address are (1) appraising  changes to requirements for their impact on the project or the IT  environment, which is important because it allows management and  the project team to determine whether the benefits of changes to the  requirements would be worth the likely cost and effect of making  the changes, and (2) developing and baselining requirements and  maintaining them under change control, which is important to  ensuring that requirements are completely and correctly defined and  that uncontrolled changes, commonly referred to as \u201crequirements  creep,\u201d are avoided.", "In our September 2005 report, we addressed another key process  area associated with system acquisition life cycle management\u2014 contract management. Federal acquisition regulations and relevant  IT acquisition management guidance recognize the importance of  effectively managing contractor activities. According to the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR), for example, agencies are to use  performance-based contracting to the maximum extent practicable  when acquiring most services. Under the FAR, performance-based  contracting includes, among other things, defining the work to be  performed in measurable, results-oriented terms and specifying  performance standards (quality and timeliness). The FAR and  associated regulations also require government oversight of  contracts to ensure that the contractor performs the requirements of  the contract, and the government receives the service as intended.  Although the regulations do not prescribe specific methods for this  oversight, other acquisition management guidance describes a  number of practices associated with this activity.", "However, the FBI\u2019s approach to managing its enterprise architecture  contract did not include most of the performance-based contracting  features described in the FAR. For example, the contract\u2019s  statement of work did not specify the products in results-oriented,  measurable terms. In addition, the bureau did not have plans for  assuring the quality of the contractor\u2019s work; instead, according to  bureau officials, they worked with the contractor to determine  whether each deliverable was acceptable.", "In addition, in overseeing its contractor, the FBI has not employed  the kind of effective practices specified in relevant guidance. For  example, the bureau does not have a written policy to govern its  tracking and oversight activities, has not designated responsibility  or established a group for performing contract tracking and  oversight activities, and has not developed an approved contractor  monitoring plan.", "To address weaknesses in the FBI\u2019s systems development and  acquisition life cycle processes, we have recommended that the FBI  establish effective policies and procedures for such systems  acquisition and development areas as configuration management,  project management, quality assurance, requirements development  and management, risk management, and contract tracking and  oversight.", "Recognizing the need to strengthen and standardize its IT  requirements and development management capabilities, the FBI  has issued a bureauwide standard life cycle management directive  with the aim of achieving consistent processes in the systems  acquisition and development areas mentioned above. A second goal  is to integrate these processes with other key IT disciplines,  including those discussed in this testimony as well as others, such  as information security management. CIO officials told us that they  recently began implementing parts of the life cycle management  directive across all projects. According to the CIO, the directive is to  be fully defined and implemented by the end of 2006.", "The FBI acknowledges that the directive needs to be enhanced and  extended to adequately address all relevant process areas. For  example, FBI officials stated that they are still working to define  effective contract management controls, such as procedures for the  use of performance-based contracting methods and the  establishment of tracking and oversight structures, policies, and  processes.

Strategic  human capital planning enables organizations to remain aware of  and be prepared for current and future needs as an organization,  ensuring that they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed  to pursue their missions. We have also issued a set of key practices  for effective strategic human capital planning.

Such an analysis should  include an assessment of core competencies and essential  knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as linking current human  capital strengths and weaknesses to permit gaps to be identified  between current capabilities and those needed to perform the  established IT functions. The plan should then describe actions  needed to fill the identified gaps (that is, the planned combination of  hiring, training, contractor support, and so on), along with time  frames, resources, performance measures, and accountability  structures. According to the CIO, he is in the process of hiring a  contractor with human capital expertise to help identify gaps  between existing skills and abilities and those that will be needed to  successful modernize the bureau\u2019s IT. The CIO intends to have this  effort completed, including the development of an implementation  plan to address any gaps, by the end of calendar year 2005. As part  of this effort, the CIO stated that he is planning to implement a  formal management structure within the Deputy CIO\u2019s office to  monitor and evaluate human capital initiatives to ensure that results  are achieved on schedule.", "Notwithstanding the initiatives under way and planned, the FBI\u2019s IT  human capital situation remains a work in progress, and this is a  significant challenge. As we have previously reported, when  organizations implement a strategic approach to human capital  management, how this is done, when it is done, and the basis on  which it is done can make all the difference. With successful  implementation, the bureau can better position itself to ensure that  it has the right people, in the right place, at the right time to  effectively modernize IT and transform the organization."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Success of New IT Investments, Like Sentinel, Will Depend on How Well the FBI Implements its New IT Management Approaches", "paragraphs": ["The success of the FBI in using IT to support its transformation  efforts and in achieving its mission goals and outcomes will depend  on how well it actually implements and institutionalizes the IT  management structures, processes, and controls that have been or  are currently being put in place. When the bureau\u2019s IT investments  have been successfully delivered, and operational assets and tools  are available to analysts and field agents to help them do their jobs  better, only then can the mission value of technology be fully  realized.", "The FBI has identified several ongoing new or enhanced system  projects that in our view will need to employ these kinds of IT  management capabilities in order for each to be successfully  defined, designed, developed or acquired, and deployed. For  example, the FBI reports that it currently has 18 IT investments that  support its \u201cinvestigative, intelligence, and analytical\u201d line of  business, which is a major component of how the bureau  accomplishes its mission. According to the bureau, each of these 18  investments is benefiting from the bureau\u2019s newly established IT  management approach and capabilities.", "Included in these 18 investments is Sentinel, the FBI\u2019s program to  deliver an automated case management and information sharing  capability; this is the successor to the Virtual Case File, the failed  component of the Trilogy program. According to the FBI, Sentinel is  to leverage commercially available technologies to consolidate and  replace the bureau\u2019s existing case management capabilities with an  integrated, paperless file management and workflow system, and to  enhance information access and promote information sharing with  both the law enforcement and intelligence communities. Thus far,  the bureau reports it has developed detailed system requirements, a  concept of operations, an acquisition strategy and schedule, and a  notional development and deployment strategy involving four  increments delivered over 4 years. In August 2005, the FBI issued a  request for vendor proposals to more than 40 eligible companies  under a National Institutes of Health governmentwide contracting  vehicle. According to the CIO, the request also was provided to over  500 eligible subcontractors. Vendor proposals are due later this  month; the goal is to issue a contract in November 2005.", "As an FBI flagship program, Sentinel can serve as a barometer of  how well the FBI defines and implements its new IT management  approaches and capabilities, particularly with regard to a system  that is to rely extensively on commercially available components  (software and hardware). As we discuss above (and have previously  reported), there are a number of IT system management practices  related to architecture, investment, acquisition/development, and  human capital that are critical to delivering promised system  capabilities and benefits, on time and within budget. Moreover,  these include management practices that are critical to any system,  whether custom-developed or built from commercial components,  as well as certain practices unique to systems based on commercial  components.", "Although each of these practices is relevant to Sentinel, there are  several that we believe to be especially germane given the FBI\u2019s  experience on the Virtual Case File, particularly with regard to  requirements management and the bureau\u2019s reported efforts and  plans going forward. Specifically, it is critical for the FBI to examine  and control its requirements in the context of what capabilities are  to be addressed through enterprise-provided services (e.g., records  management and security) and what capabilities are to be provided  through Sentinel. At the same time, it is essential that the bureau  examine its requirements in the context of which capabilities can be  provided by commercially available products and which cannot, and  for those that cannot, how such requirements will be satisfied, if at  all. As we and others have reported, this examination involves  continuous but controlled analyses of trade-offs among stated  system requirements, commercial product availability, and  enterprise architecture constraints; it also involves such practical  constraints as human capital and financial resources.", "Another area that is critical with respect to Sentinel is ensuring that  decisions about the use of commercial components are based on an  approach that includes deliberate and thorough research, analysis,  and evaluation of components\u2019 dependencies. In this regard, it will  be important for the FBI to ensure that it understands the behavioral  interaction and compatibility of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)  components in order to select components that can be integrated in  a predictable and standard way. We have found based on our  research and past work that doing so requires an effective  methodology to gain and apply such knowledge; without such a  methodology, building a COTS-based system can quickly lapse into  trial and error, which is fraught with risks. For example, a trial and  error approach can lead to expensive, ad hoc modifications,  customized solutions, or unnecessary increases in the number and  complexity of interfaces\u2014all of which increases costs, delays  delivery, and postpones realization of expected benefits. An  effective approach would include (1) performing gap analysis  between requirements and component capabilities, as mentioned  above, (2) allocating requirements among the various products for a  given system design option, (3) defining the interactions that need to  occur among the components, (4) documenting decisions, and  (5) using iterative prototyping to assess the interactions among the  components.", "Another very important area particularly relevant to Sentinel is  ensuring that the project\u2019s plans explicitly provide the necessary  time and resources for (1) integrating the commercial components  with the FBI\u2019s existing systems and (2) preparing users for the  impact that the business processes embedded in the COTS products  will have on how the users will be expected to do their jobs,  including potentially new roles and responsibilities. Available  research suggests that insufficient attention to this organization  change management issue has been a major cause of COTS solution  implementations failing to live up their expectations.", "Other management practices relevant to commercial component- based systems will be important on Sentinel, including  (1) discouraging the modification of COTS products; (2) managing  the systems configuration in a way that provides for evaluation,  acquisition, and implementation of new, often frequent, releases of  COTS products; and (3) ensuring that contractors are experienced  in implementing COTS-based system solutions.", "In light of the importance of these and other areas, we have just  initiated a review of Sentinel at the request of the Chairman and  Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee; as part of this  review, we plan to address many of these keys to project success.", "In closing, the FBI has made important progress, particularly in the  last 12 months under the new CIO\u2019s leadership, in establishing  certain IT management and control capabilities that our research  and evaluations show are key to exploiting technology to enable  transformation. But although the bureau has come a long way from  where it was just 18 months ago, establishing these capabilities is  not enough. For the FBI to effectively use technology to transform  itself and accomplish its goals, it will need to ensure that its  capabilities are appropriately enhanced and extended and, most  important, effectively implemented on all IT programs and projects.  Nowhere will this be more crucial than on the Sentinel program.  Because of the FBI\u2019s stated approach to building Sentinel, it will be  particularly important for the bureau to ensure that it follows the  kind of acquisition management practices that our work has shown  to be critical for commercial component-based systems to be  successful. If it does not, the FBI increases the likelihood that  Sentinel will encounter the same cost, schedule, and performance  shortfalls as its predecessor, the Virtual Case File.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our statement.
