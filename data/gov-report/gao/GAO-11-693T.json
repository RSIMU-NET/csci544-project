Some of these initiatives include the following: (1) Temporary adjustment of standard bond-setting formula. Importers generally provide a general bond to secure the payment of all types of duties, but CBP determined in 2004 that the amount of this bond inadequately protected AD/CV duty revenue. CBP took steps to address this by revising its standard bond-setting formula and tested it on one product (shrimp) to increase protection for AD/CV duty revenue when the final amount of duties owed exceeds the amount paid at the time of importation. The enhanced bonding requirement was subject to domestic and World Trade Organization litigation, and CBP decided to terminate the requirement in 2009. (2) Temporary suspension of new shipper bonding privilege. Importers purchasing from \"new shippers\"--shippers who have not previously exported products subject to AD/CV duties--are allowed to provide a bond in lieu of cash payment to cover the initial AD/CV duties assessed, which is known as the new shipper bonding privilege. Congress partially addressed the risk that CBP would not be able to collect initial AD/CV duties from such importers by suspending the new shipper bonding privilege for 3 years and requiring cash deposits for initial AD/CV duties, but the privilege was reinstated in July 2009. The Department of the Treasury stated, however, that the added risk associated with the bond compared with the cash deposit is low. Additional options exist for improving the collection of AD/CV duties. First, the retrospective nature of the U.S. system could be revised. Under the existing U.S. system, importers pay the estimated amount of AD/CV duties when products enter the United States, but the final amount of duties owed is not determined until later, a process that can take more than 3 years on average. This creates a risk that the importer may disappear, cease business operations, or declare bankruptcy before the government can collect the full amount owed. Other major U.S. trading partners have AD/CV duty systems that, while different from one another, treat as final the AD/CV duties assessed at the time a product enters the country. Second, Congress could revise the level of exports required for exporters applying for new shipper status. Under U.S. law, new shippers to the United States can petition for their own separate AD/CV duty rate. According to Commerce, a shipper can be assigned an individual duty rate based on as little as one shipment, intentionally set at a high price, resulting in a low or 0 percent duty rate. This creates additional risk by putting the government in the position of having to collect additional duties in the future rather than at the time of importation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the subcommittee to  present our findings on the enforcement of antidumping and  countervailing duties.

Since our 2008  report was issued, we have followed up with the U.S. government agencies  involved in responding to our recommendations to improve AD/CV duty  collection. We conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The United States and many of its trading partners have established laws to  remedy the unfair trade practices of other countries and foreign companies  that cause injury to domestic industries. U.S. law authorizes the imposition  of AD/CV duties to remedy these unfair trade practices, namely dumping  (i.e., sales at less than normal value) and foreign government subsidies. The  U.S. AD/CV duty system is retrospective, in that importers pay estimated  AD/CV duties at the time of importation, but the final amount of duties is not  determined until later. By contrast, other major U.S. trading partners have  AD/CV duty systems that, although different from one another, are  fundamentally prospective in that AD/CV duties assessed at the time a  product enters the country are essentially treated as final.", "Two key U.S. agencies are involved in assessing and collecting AD/CV  duties owed. The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is responsible for  calculating the appropriate AD/CV duty rate, which it issues in an AD/CV  duty order. Commerce typically determines two types of AD/CV duty rates  in the course of an initial AD/CV duty investigation on a product: a rate  applicable to a product associated with several specific manufacturers and  exporters, as well as an \u201call others\u201d rate for all other manufacturers and  exporters of the product who were not individually investigated. After the  initial AD/CV duty investigation, Commerce can often conduct two  subsequent types of review: administrative and new shipper.", "Administrative review: One year after the initial rate is established,  Commerce can also conduct a review to determine the actual, rather  than estimated, level of dumping or subsidization. At the conclusion of  the administrative review, the final duty rate, also known as the  liquidation rate, is established for the product.", "New shipper review: After an initial rate is established, a new shipper  (i.e., a shipper who has not previously exported the product to the  United States during the initial period of investigation and is not  affiliated with any exporter who exported the subject merchandise) who  is subject to the \u201call others\u201d rate can request that Commerce conduct a  review to establish the shipper\u2019s own individual AD/CV duty rate.", "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the Department of  Homeland Security, is responsible for collecting the AD/CV duties. The  initial AD/CV duty order issued by Commerce instructs CBP to collect  cash deposits at the time of importation on the products subject to the  order. Once Commerce establishes a final duty rate, it communicates the  rate to CBP through liquidation instructions, and CBP instructs staff at  each port of entry to assess final duties on all relevant products  (technically called liquidating). This may result in providing importers\u2014 who are responsible for paying all duties, taxes, and fees on products  brought into the United States\u2014with a refund or sending an additional bill.", "CBP is also responsible for setting the formula for establishing the bond  amounts that importers must pay. To ensure payment of unforeseen  obligations to the government, all importers are required to post a  security, usually a general obligation bond, when they import products  into the United States. This bond is an insurance policy protecting the  U.S. government against revenue loss if an importer defaults on its  financial obligations. In general, the importer is required to obtain a bond  equal to 10 percent of the amount the importer was assessed in duties,  taxes, and fees over the preceding year (or $50,000, whichever is greater).  In addition, importers purchasing from the new shipper can pay estimated  AD/CV duties by providing a bond in lieu of paying cash to cover the  duties\u2014an option known as the new shipper bonding privilege.", "We previously reported that over $613 million in AD/CV duties from fiscal  years 2001 through 2007 went uncollected, with the uncollected duties  highly concentrated among a few industries, products, countries of origin,  and importers. Recent CBP data indicate that uncollected duties from  fiscal year 2001 to 2010 have grown to over $1 billion and are still highly  concentrated. For example, according to CBP, five products from China  account for 84 percent of uncollected duties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Past Initiatives to Improve AD/CV Duty Collection Have Made Little Progress", "paragraphs": ["CBP, Congress, and Commerce have undertaken several initiatives to  address the problem of uncollected AD/CV duties.

In February 2005, CBP applied this revision to imports of  shrimp from six countries as a test case, which covered a potential  increase in the final AD duty rate of up to 85 percent from the initial rate.  However, shrimp importers reported that the costs were substantial  because they had to pay up front higher premiums and larger collateral  requirements to obtain the bonds for the initial duties. These increased  up-front costs can deter malfeasance by illegitimate importers by  increasing the cost of importing merchandise subject to AD/CV duties, but  may also impose costs on legitimate importers that pose little risk of  failing to pay retrospective AD/CV duties.

If CBP fails to complete the  liquidation process within 6 months, an entry is \u201cdeemed liquidated\u201d at the  rate asserted by the importer at the time of entry.

In addition, we found that Commerce\u2019s liquidation instructions  were sometimes unclear, thereby causing CBP to take extra time to obtain  clarification. In December 2007, after we made Commerce officials aware  of the untimely liquidation instructions, Commerce announced a plan for  tracking timeliness, including a quarterly reporting requirement.

In 2008, we  found that the average time elapsed between entry of goods and liquidation  was more than 3 years.

On the basis of our  analysis of more than 6 years of CBP data covering over 900,000 entries  subject to AD duties, we found that duty rates went up 16 percent of the  time, went down 24 percent of the time, and remained the same 60 percent  of the time. When duty rates increased, the median increase was less than  4 percentage points. However, because of some large increases, the  average rate increase was 62 percentage points, with some increases  greater than 150 to 200 percentage points. The majority of uncollected  duty bills over $500,000 are attributed to rate increases greater than 150  percentage points.", "In our 2008 report, we noted that the advantages and disadvantages of  prospective and retrospective AD/CV duty systems differ and depend on  specific design features.", "In prospective AD/CV duty systems, the amount of AD/CV duties paid  by the importer at the time of importation is essentially treated as  final.

Separately, in May 2011, CBP\u2019s Commissioner of International  Trade stated in a Senate hearing that CBP is developing internal guidance  to require that importers at risk of evasion take out onetime bonds that  cover at least the full value of the shipment (single-transaction bonds).
