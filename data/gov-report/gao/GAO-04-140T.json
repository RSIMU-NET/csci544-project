In October 1997, the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection emphasized the increasing vulnerability of control systems to cyber attacks. The House Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations, and the Census asked GAO to testify on potential cyber vulnerabilities. GAO's testimony focused on (1) significant cybersecurity risks associated with control systems; (2) potential and reported cyber attacks against these systems; (3) key challenges to securing control systems; and (4) steps that can be taken to strengthen the security of control systems, including current federal and private-sector initiatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In addition to general cyber threats, which have been steadily increasing, several factors have contributed to the escalation of the risks of cyber attacks against control systems.

The  benefits have been enormous. Vast amounts of information are now  literally at our fingertips, facilitating research on virtually every topic  imaginable; financial and other business transactions can be executed  almost instantaneously, often 24 hours a day; and electronic mail, Internet  Web sites, and computer bulletin boards allow us to communicate quickly  and easily with a virtually unlimited number of individuals and groups.", "However, this widespread interconnectivity poses significant risks to the  government\u2019s and our nation\u2019s computer systems and, more important, to  the critical operations and infrastructures they support. For example,  telecommunications, power distribution, water supply, public health  services, national defense (including the military\u2019s warfighting capability),  law enforcement, government services, and emergency services all depend  on the security of their computer operations. The speed and accessibility  that create the enormous benefits of the computer age, if not properly  controlled, may allow individuals and organizations to inexpensively  eavesdrop on or interfere with these operations from remote locations for  mischievous or malicious purposes, including fraud or sabotage. Table 1  summarizes the key threats to our nation\u2019s infrastructures, as observed by  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).", "Government officials remain concerned about attacks from individuals  and groups with malicious intent, such as crime, terrorism, foreign  intelligence gathering, and acts of war. According to the FBI, terrorists,  transnational criminals, and intelligence services are quickly becoming  aware of and using information exploitation tools such as computer  viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and eavesdropping sniffers  that can destroy, intercept, degrade the integrity of, or deny access to  data. In addition, the disgruntled organization insider is a significant  threat, since these individuals often have knowledge that allows them to  gain unrestricted access and inflict damage or steal assets without  possessing a great deal of knowledge about computer intrusions. As  greater amounts of money and more sensitive economic and commercial  information are exchanged electronically, and as the nation\u2019s defense and  intelligence communities increasingly rely on standardized information  technology (IT), the likelihood increases that information attacks will  threaten vital national interests.", "As the number of individuals with computer skills has increased, more  intrusion or \u201chacking\u201d tools have become readily available and relatively  easy to use. A hacker can literally download tools from the Internet and  \u201cpoint and click\u201d to start an attack. Experts agree that there has been a  steady advance in the sophistication and effectiveness of attack  technology. Intruders quickly develop attacks to exploit vulnerabilities  discovered in products, use these attacks to compromise computers, and  share them with other attackers. In addition, they can combine these  attacks with other forms of technology to develop programs that  automatically scan the network for vulnerable systems, attack them,  compromise them, and use them to spread the attack even further.", "Between 1995 and the first half of 2003, the CERT\uf8e8 Coordination Center(CERT/CC) reported 11,155 security vulnerabilities that resulted from  software flaws. Figure 1 illustrates the dramatic growth in security  vulnerabilities over these years. The growing number of known  vulnerabilities increases the number of potential attacks created by the  hacker community. Attacks can be launched against specific targets or  widely distributed through viruses and worms.", "Along with these increasing threats, the number of computer security  incidents reported to the CERT/CC has also risen dramatically\u2014from  9,859 in 1999 to 82,094 in 2002 and 76,404 for just the first half of 2003. And  these are only the reported attacks. The Director of CERT Centers stated  that he estimates that as much as 80 percent of actual security incidents  goes unreported, in most cases because (1) the organization was unable to  recognize that its systems had been penetrated or there were no  indications of penetration or attack or (2) the organization was reluctant  to report. Figure 2 shows the number of incidents that were reported to  the CERT/CC from 1995 through the first half of 2003.", "According to the National Security Agency, foreign governments already  have or are developing computer attack capabilities, and potential  adversaries are developing a body of knowledge about U.S. systems and  about methods to attack these systems. The National Infrastructure  Protection Center (NIPC) reported in January 2002 that a computer  belonging to an individual with indirect links to Osama bin Laden  contained computer programs that suggested that the individual was  interested in structural engineering as it related to dams and other water- retaining structures. The NIPC report also stated that U.S. law  enforcement and intelligence agencies had received indications that Al  Qaeda members had sought information about control systems from  multiple Web sites, specifically on water supply and wastewater  management practices in the United States and abroad.", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, warnings of the potential  for terrorist cyber attacks against our critical infrastructures have also  increased. For example, in his February 2002 statement for the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence, the director of central intelligence  discussed the possibility of cyber warfare attack by terrorists. He stated  that the September 11 attacks demonstrated the nation\u2019s dependence on  critical infrastructure systems that rely on electronic and computer  networks. Further, he noted that attacks of this nature would become an  increasingly viable option for terrorists as they and other foreign  adversaries become more familiar with these targets and the technologies  required to attack them.", "What are control systems?  Control systems are computer-based systems that are used by many  infrastructures and industries to monitor and control sensitive processes  and physical functions. Typically, control systems collect sensor  measurements and operational data from the field, process and display  this information, and relay control commands to local or remote  equipment. In the electric power industry they can manage and control the  transmission and delivery of electric power, for example, by opening and  closing circuit breakers and setting thresholds for preventive shutdowns.  Employing integrated control systems, the oil and gas industry can control  the refining operations on a plant site as well as remotely monitor the  pressure and flow of gas pipelines and control the flow and pathways of  gas transmission. In water utilities, they can remotely monitor well levels  and control the wells\u2019 pumps; monitor flows, tank levels, or pressure in  storage tanks; monitor water quality characteristics, such as pH, turbidity,  and chlorine residual; and control the addition of chemicals. Control  system functions vary from simple to complex; they can be used to simply  monitor processes\u2014for example, the environmental conditions in a small  office building\u2014or manage most activities in a municipal water system or  even a nuclear power plant.", "In certain industries such as chemical and power generation, safety  systems are typically implemented to mitigate a disastrous event if control  and other systems fail. In addition, to guard against both physical attack  and system failure, organizations may establish back-up control centers  that include uninterruptible power supplies and backup generators.", "There are two primary types of control systems. Distributed Control  Systems (DCS) typically are used within a single processing or generating  plant or over a small geographic area. Supervisory Control and Data  Acquisition (SCADA) systems typically are used for large, geographically  dispersed distribution operations. A utility company may use a DCS to  generate power and a SCADA system to distribute it.", "Figure 3 illustrates the typical components of a control system.", "A control system typically consists of a \u201cmaster\u201d or central supervisory  control and monitoring station consisting of one or more human-machine  interfaces where an operator can view status information about the  remote sites and issue commands directly to the system. Typically, this  station is located at a main site along with application servers and an  engineering workstation that is used to configure and troubleshoot the  other control system components. The supervisory control and monitoring  station is typically connected to local controller stations through a hard- wired network or to remote controller stations through a communications  network\u2014which could be the Internet, a public switched telephone  network, or a cable or wireless (e.g. radio, microwave, or Wi-Fi) network.  Each controller station has a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU), a  Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), DCS controller, or other controller  that communicates with the supervisory control and monitoring station.  The controller stations also include sensors and control equipment that  connect directly with the working components of the infrastructure\u2014for  example, pipelines, water towers, and power lines. The sensor takes  readings from the infrastructure equipment\u2014such as water or pressure  levels, electrical voltage or current\u2014and sends a message to the  controller. The controller may be programmed to determine a course of  action and send a message to the control equipment instructing it what to  do\u2014for example, to turn off a valve or dispense a chemical. If the  controller is not programmed to determine a course of action, the  controller communicates with the supervisory control and monitoring  station before sending a command back to the control equipment. The  control system also can be programmed to issue alarms back to the  operator when certain conditions are detected. Handheld devices, such as  personal digital assistants, can be used to locally monitor controller  stations. Experts report that technologies in controller stations are  becoming more intelligent and automated and communicate with the  supervisory central monitoring and control station less frequently,  requiring less human intervention."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Control Systems Are at Increasing Risk", "paragraphs": ["Historically, security concerns about control systems were related  primarily to protecting against physical attack and misuse of refining and  processing sites or distribution and holding facilities.

Moreover, in 2002, the National Research Council identified \u201cthe  potential for attack on control systems\u201d as requiring \u201curgent attention.\u201d In  February 2003, the President clearly demonstrated concern about \u201cthe  threat of organized cyber attacks capable of causing debilitating disruption  to our Nation\u2019s critical infrastructures, economy, or national security,\u201d  noting that \u201cdisruption of these systems can have significant consequences  for public health and safety\u201d and emphasizing that the protection of  control systems has become \u201ca national priority.\u201d", "Several factors have contributed to the escalation of risk to control  systems, including (1) the adoption of standardized technologies with  known vulnerabilities, (2) the connectivity of control systems to other  networks, (3) constraints on the implementation of existing security  technologies and practices, (4) insecure remote connections, and (5) the  widespread availability of technical information about control systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Control Systems Are Adopting Standardized Technologies with Known Vulnerabilities", "paragraphs": ["Historically, proprietary hardware, software, and network protocols made  it difficult to understand how control systems operated\u2014and therefore  how to hack into them.

These widely used standardized  technologies have commonly known vulnerabilities, and sophisticated and  effective exploitation tools are widely available and relatively easy to use.  As a consequence, both the number of people with the knowledge to wage  attacks and the number of systems subject to attack have increased. Also,  common communication protocols and the emerging use of Extensible  Markup Language (commonly referred to as XML) can make it easier for a  hacker to interpret the content of communications among the components  of a control system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Control Systems Are Connected to Other Networks", "paragraphs": ["Enterprises often integrate their control systems with their enterprise  networks. This increased connectivity has significant advantages,  including providing decision makers with access to real-time information  and allowing engineers to monitor and control the process control system  from different points on the enterprise network. In addition, the enterprise  networks are often connected to the networks of strategic partners and to  the Internet. Furthermore, control systems are increasingly using wide  area networks and the Internet to transmit data to their remote or local  stations and individual devices. This convergence of control networks  with public and enterprise networks potentially exposes the control  systems to additional security vulnerabilities.

Because controller  stations are generally designed to do specific tasks, they use low-cost,  resource-constrained microprocessors. In fact, some devices in the  electrical industry still use the Intel 8088 processor, introduced in 1978.  Consequently, it is difficult to install existing security technologies without  seriously degrading the performance of the control system.", "Further, complex passwords and other strong password practices are not  always used to prevent unauthorized access to control systems, in part  because this could hinder a rapid response to safety procedures during an  emergency. As a result, according to experts, weak passwords that are  easy to guess, shared, and infrequently changed are reportedly common in  control systems, including the use of default passwords or even no  password at all.", "In addition, although modern control systems are based on standard  operating systems, they are typically customized to support control system  applications.

Such cyber threats could come from numerous sources,  ranging from hostile governments and terrorist groups to disgruntled  employees and other malicious intruders. Based on interviews and  discussions with representatives throughout the electric power industry,  the Information Assurance Task Force of the National Security  Telecommunications Advisory Committee concluded that an organization  with sufficient resources, such as a foreign intelligence service or a well- supported terrorist group, could conduct a structured attack on the  electric power grid electronically, with a high degree of anonymity and  without having to set foot in the target nation.", "In July 2002, NIPC reported that the potential for compound cyber and  physical attacks, referred to as \u201cswarming attacks,\u201d is an emerging threat  to the U.S. critical infrastructure.

If  such remote systems are physically breached, the attackers could  establish a cyber connection to the control network.", "Department of Energy and industry researchers have speculated on how  the following potential attack scenario could affect control systems in the  electricity sector. Using war dialers to find modem phone lines that  connect to the programmable circuit breakers of the electric power  control system, hackers could crack passwords that control access to the  circuit breakers and could change the control settings to cause local  power outages and even damage equipment. A hacker could lower settings  from, for example, 500 amperes to 200 on some circuit breakers; normal  power usage would activate, or \u201ctrip,\u201d the circuit breakers, taking those  lines out of service and diverting power to neighboring lines. If, at the  same time, the hacker raised the settings on these neighboring lines to 900  amperes, circuit breakers would fail to trip at these high settings and the  diverted power would overload the lines and cause significant damage to  transformers and other critical equipment. The damaged equipment would  require major repairs that could result in lengthy outages.", "Additionally, control system researchers at the Department of Energy\u2019s  national laboratories have developed systems that demonstrate the  feasibility of a cyber attack on a control system at an electric power  substation, where high-voltage electricity is transformed for local use.
