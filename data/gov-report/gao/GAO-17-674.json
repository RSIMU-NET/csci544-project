Of the 78 approved requests, agencies followed through and converted 69 political appointees to career positions. During the period, agencies completed 7 conversions without obtaining OPM approval; OPM completed post-appointment reviews for 4 of these 7 conversions, denying all 4. For each of the 4 denied cases, the agencies undertook various remedies, such as readvertising positions, in response to OPM's concerns. OPM did not complete a review for the 3 other conversions because the appointees were no longer in the career positions to which they were converted.", "Agencies appeared to have used appropriate authorities and followed proper procedures for each of the 78 OPM approved requests. GAO's review of OPM's case files and additional documentation from agencies supported OPM's conclusion that each of these conversions appeared to be free of political influence and complied with merit system principles. However, for 55 of the 78 requests, OPM's case files did not provide enough information for GAO to initially support OPM's approvals of the requests. GAO could only decide after obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation directly from involved agencies.", "OPM's procedures for reviewing political conversion requests do not specify which agency documents it should save into case files.

As we have previously noted, political appointees can bring valuable skills  and experience to the federal workforce. The merit-based conversion of  political appointees to career positions can be useful in achieving a highly  qualified workforce. However, these conversions should conform to merit  system principles and must adhere to the statutes and regulations  governing the appointment contemplated. Sometimes, circumstances  surrounding conversions can raise questions as to whether the individuals  selected experienced favoritism or enjoyed an unfair advantage in the  selection process. Any appearance of this could compromise the merit  system\u2019s integrity.", "You asked us to provide information on conversions of political  appointees to career positions, and to examine the implementation and  effectiveness of the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) policy for  reviewing these conversions, which took effect in January 2010.

For the purposes of our review, we included  conversions OPM reviewed and agencies intended to complete from  January 1, 2010, through March 17, 2016. This time period begins with  the implementation of OPM\u2019s January 2010 policy requiring its prior  approval of all conversions of current or recent appointees to competitive  or nonpolitical excepted service positions. March 17, 2016, marks the day  before the Transitions Act was enacted and OPM began reporting to  Congress requests by agencies to appoint political appointees or former  political appointees to covered civil service positions.", "In selecting the executive branch departments and agencies for this  review, we looked at all agencies that OPM reported as having requested  its approval of proposed appointments of political appointees to career  positions during the time period referenced above.", "To address our first objective, we obtained data from OPM on its reviews  of agency requests to convert political appointees to career positions. In  addition, we obtained from agencies the number of approved cases  where they proceeded to hire political appointees. According to OPM  data, 30 departments and agencies requested OPM\u2019s approval for at  least one conversion during the period. We then asked each of these 30  departments and agencies to corroborate (1) the number of requests to  convert employees from political to career positions each agency made to  OPM, and (2) the number of these conversions the agencies completed  during the period of our review. To assess the reliability of the data that  OPM and the agencies provided, we examined the data for obvious errors  and inconsistencies. We also queried OPM and the agencies to  understand the data systems they respectively used to collect, store, and  report such data, as well as the quality of data entered into their  system(s). We found the conversion data from both OPM and agencies to  be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. See  appendix I for data on political conversion requests reviewed by OPM,  and conversions completed by the 30 departments and agencies from  January 1, 2010, through March 17, 2016.", "To address our second objective, we assessed OPM\u2019s reviews of all  conversion requests in our scope that OPM approved. Specifically, we  examined OPM\u2019s review checklists, OPM case files documenting steps  agencies took to convert political appointees, and additional  documentation provided by individual agencies. Our review was designed  to determine (1) whether appropriate authorities and proper procedures  were followed in making and reviewing conversions; and (2) for requests  approved by OPM, whether we could support OPM\u2019s decision that agency selections were free of political influence and conformed to merit system  principles. One GAO analyst applied professional judgment after  reviewing submitted checklists and documentation, appropriate laws and  regulations, and the circumstances for each conversion request. To  ensure the reliability of our reviews, a second GAO analyst then reviewed  and validated the first analyst\u2019s evaluation of each conversion request.  The second analyst either independently evaluated the conversion  request, or traced findings from the first analyst\u2019s review back to  supporting audit documents. We identified conversion review cases with  significant differences between our and OPM\u2019s reviews of the cases by  comparing differences we identified to selected merit system principles  and prohibited personnel practices. We then collected additional  information from OPM on such cases and determined whether agencies  involved in the cases violated merit system principles and proper  procedures, or engaged in prohibited personnel practices.", "To address our third objective, we identified the number of conversion  requests in our scope that OPM denied, and why they denied them. We  reviewed conversion requests referred to OSC for investigation, and  described the outcome of its reviews of the cases. We also summarized  cases where OPM directed agencies to implement corrective actions after  reviewing conversion requests.", "To address our fourth objective, we reviewed revisions OPM made to its  pre-appointment review policies and procedures following enactment of  the Transitions Act. We also reviewed data elements the Transitions Act  requires OPM to include in its reports to Congress on agency personnel  requests to appoint current or former political appointees to covered civil  service positions.

These positions involve determining policy or require a close,  confidential relationship with the agency head or other key officials of  the agency. Schedule C appointees serve at the pleasure of the  department or agency head.", "Noncareer Senior Executive Service (SES): Appointments are to  positions with responsibility for formulating, advocating, and directing  administration policies.

Competitive  examination includes recruitment through a published or \u201call sources\u201d  announcement. It also includes the rating and ranking of eligible  candidates using OPM-created or approved qualification standards  and agency-developed, job-related assessment tools to identify the  most qualified applicants. Generally, the initial competitive service  appointment is career conditional. Appointees must complete a 1-year  probationary period and a total of 3 years of continuous creditable  service to become a career employee.", "Career (SES): Appointments are into SES under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3393 to  top-level policy, executive, supervisory, and managerial positions  above GS-15. Appointments into career SES positions require a  further review and certification of the executive/managerial  qualifications of the proposed selectee by an OPM-administered SES  Qualifications Review Board.", "Career excepted service (Non-Schedule C): Some appointments  are to positions excepted from the competitive examination  requirements in Title 5 of the U.S. Code by OPM. Other appointments  are to positions or in agencies not subject to competitive examination  requirements in Title 5. Agencies have the authority to establish their  own hiring procedures to fill excepted service vacancies. Such  procedures must comply with statutory requirements such as merit  system principles and veterans\u2019 preferences, when applicable.", "Federal agencies must use appropriate authorities and follow proper  procedures in converting political appointees to career positions. The  majority of authorities and procedures governing appointments to career  positions are outlined in Title 5 of the U.S. Code. Merit systems principles  are one of the fundamental statutory rules applying to civil service  appointments. These principles require that agencies follow a selection  process that is fair, open, and based on skills, knowledge, and ability.  Another key statute under Title 5 prohibits certain personnel practices  (known as prohibited personnel practices). These practices include  granting any individual a preference or advantage in the application  process. This could include defining the manner of competition or  requirements for a position to improve the prospects of any particular  applicant, or failing to fulfill veterans\u2019 preference requirements. In  addition to these and other statutory requirements, agencies must follow  OPM\u2019s regulations in Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. These  regulations outline required procedures for making appointments to  career positions, such as providing public notice of all vacancies in the  career SES. For career-excepted service (non-Schedule C) positions,  agencies are not required to follow OPM\u2019s hiring regulations for the  competitive service; however, they must apply veterans\u2019 preference and  follow merit system principles and OPM\u2019s regulations on excepted service  hiring when making most of these appointments.", "OPM has oversight authority to ensure that federal agencies are following  the merit system principles when hiring. It also has authority to order  agencies to take corrective actions regarding any agency hiring when it  determines the action was contrary to any law, rule, regulation, or  standard established by OPM; in turn, agencies are required to comply  with such orders. As one aspect of carrying out these duties, OPM has  traditionally required that agencies seek its pre-appointment approval for  the appointment of certain noncareer appointees (Schedule C and  noncareer SES) into certain career positions (competitive service and  career SES) during a presidential election period. However, in a  November 5, 2009, memorandum to heads of executive departments and  agencies, OPM expanded the requirements for pre-appointment approval;  beginning January 1, 2010, OPM conducted pre-appointment reviews of  political conversions on a continuing basis, rather than just during the  year leading up to a presidential election. OPM also required agencies to  seek its approval before appointing a current or recent political appointee  to a competitive or nonpolitical excepted service position at any level  under the provisions of Title 5 of the U.S. Code. According to this  memorandum, OPM will (1) review these proposed appointments to  ensure they comply with merit system principles and applicable civil  service laws, and (2) continue to conduct merit staffing reviews for all  proposed career SES selections involving a political appointee before the  SES selections are presented to OPM\u2019s Qualifications Review Board for  certification of executive qualifications.", "To implement its policy of requiring agencies to seek its approval before  completing political conversions, OPM established standard operating  procedures for reviewing political conversions requests by agencies. For  each conversion request review, OPM\u2019s lead coordinator on political  conversions is expected to ensure that the agency submitting the  conversion request has submitted all required documentation, saves the  documents onto an OPM shared drive and sends each case to the  relevant lead office. An OPM evaluator assigned by the lead office is  expected to ensure that all requested information is received, and  requests missing or additional information from the agency. Next, the  evaluator reviews the agency\u2019s documentation and completes a review  checklist to determine whether the agency\u2019s request complies with merit  system principles and appropriate laws, rules, and regulations, and if it is  free of political influence. After completing each review, the evaluator and  his or her supervisors recommend the approval or denial of the  conversion request. The lead office reviewing the request transmits a  draft decision letter, the checklist, and supporting documentation to  OPM\u2019s Merit Systems Accountability and Compliance (MSAC) Division.  OPM\u2019s lead coordinator on political conversions reviews the case for  consistency in findings, recommendations, required actions, and referrals  to OSC. Then, the MSAC Associate Director and Deputy Associate  Director review the recommendation from the lead office. The Associate  Director makes the final decision whether to approve or deny the  conversion request.

At the time of our September 2016 review, we could not determine  a way to reliably identify political conversions within the scope of OPM\u2019s  review using queries of EHRI data alone, given the complexity involved in  defining political conversions in scope of OPM\u2019s review.

To  comply with the Transitions Act\u2019s new reporting requirements, OPM  reshaped its pre-appointment review coverage. Specifically, in an August  2016 memorandum to agencies, OPM provided information on covered  political positions and expanded the scope of its conversion reviews to  include current or former political appointees in positions listed in the  Executive Schedule. OPM must report these reviews under the  Transitions Act.", "OPM\u2019s August 2016 memorandum also lists revised procedures. For  example, OPM revised its pre-appointment checklists to include requests  for the rate of basic pay of the current or former political appointee, and  the proposed rate of basic pay of the proposed civil service position. As  part of its revised procedures, OPM also requires agencies to provide  information on whether the agency appointed the individual to the  covered position and, if so, the date the appointment took place. The  additional information that OPM is requesting from agencies provides  OPM with the data it needs to comply with the reporting requirement.", "OPM does not require agencies to seek pre-appointment approval to  convert political appointees to career positions when using certain  noncompetitive and direct-hire authorities. However, as we pointed out  to OPM officials, under the Transitions Act, appointments under these  authorities are within the scope of OPM\u2019s reporting obligation. OPM  agreed and told us that, going forward, they will notify agencies that they  must request OPM\u2019s approval to convert political appointees using such  authorities. OPM officials said they would also include data on these  conversions in subsequent political conversion reports to Congress. By  reviewing proposed political conversions made under these  noncompetitive and direct-hire authorities, and including them in its  reports, OPM will be able to enhance its oversight of political conversions  and provide a more complete representation of political appointee  conversion activity to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The merit-based conversion of political appointees to career positions can  be useful in achieving a highly qualified workforce. We found that OPM\u2019s  reviews of proposed political conversions are helping to ensure that  agencies are using appropriate authorities and following proper  procedures in making these conversions. In a number of cases, OPM  directed agencies to take corrective actions and denied conversion  requests where it could not conclude that agencies adhered to merit  system principles or that the conversions were free of political influence.  In addition, OPM is taking steps to better identify instances where  agencies may complete political conversions without prior OPM approval.  It has enhanced its monitoring processes and plans to increase the  frequency of its checks of data collected through its EHRI database.", "However, OPM\u2019s review process and supporting documentation must  also be transparent, and include and maintain the appropriate  documentation to support its review decisions. For the majority of OPM\u2019s  approved cases, there was not sufficient information in OPM\u2019s case files  for us to initially support its determination that proposed conversions  appeared free of political influence and conformed to merit system  principles. We were, however, able to support OPM\u2019s decisions with  additional documentation obtained directly from involved agencies. As  OPM drafts a records schedule for maintaining files from conversion  requests, it can specify documents that must be saved from both agency  submissions and agencies\u2019 automated systems to ensure such  documentation is available for subsequent review. Additionally, to provide  greater assurance that its staff reviewed all documentation required by  OPM checklists to support a conversion request, OPM can incorporate a  process requiring its staff to verify they have reviewed such  documentation before recommending approval or denial of agencies\u2019  conversion requests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to OPM:  The Associate Director of Merit System Accountability and Compliance  should ensure that OPM\u2019s finalized records schedule on retaining  conversion case files specifically lists all documentation that must be  saved in its case files. (Recommendation 1)", "The Associate Director of Merit System Accountability and Compliance  should establish a policy requiring that its staff verify they have reviewed  all documentation required by OPM checklists before recommending  approval or denial of a conversion request. OPM may incorporate such a  verification requirement as part of checklists completed by its staff when  reviewing conversion requests. (Recommendation 2)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OPM for its review and comment. In  its written comments, reproduced in appendix IV, OPM partially concurred  with both of our recommendations.", "With respect to our first recommendation, OPM stated that it agrees that  finalized guidance on retaining conversion case files should specifically  list information that must be documented in OPM\u2019s case files. However,  OPM stated that it does not agree with the implication that its current  guidance lacks information about the material that must be maintained in  case files. OPM noted that its political conversion standard operating  procedures provide a description for the file organization and lists the  contents to be stored in each case file, including a file for contents for the  pre-appointment checklists. It also noted that while its guidance does not  list each individual document to file, OPM maintains the documents  submitted by the requesting agency and additional information obtained  during the review process to support OPM\u2019s decision. OPM stated that in  situations involving extensive file transactions, it allows agencies the  flexibility to grant its evaluators access to automated hiring systems to  conduct pre- or post-appointment reviews. It also stated it exercises  discretion and provides exceptions to maintaining voluminous or large  sized files reviewed in automated hiring systems, when it is burdensome  or impractical to store them in OPM\u2019s files. Finally, OPM stated that its  evaluators review checklists, which are filed in the case file, and capture  the review and analysis of that documentation.", "We acknowledge OPM\u2019s standard operating procedures include  information about documents that must be maintained in case files. These  procedures\u2014which OPM provided after submitting comments on a draft  of this report\u2014include a description of the file organization and broad  categories of information to be stored in each case file, such as contents  for pre-appointment checklists submitted by agencies and additional  documents reviewed. OPM\u2019s procedures also describe roles and  responsibilities for staff involved in political conversion reviews. For  example, OPM\u2019s lead coordinator for political conversions and an  evaluator assigned to the case are expected to ensure that OPM has  received all documentation from the agency submitting the conversion  request. An evaluator also reviews the agency\u2019s documentation and  completes a review checklist to determine whether the request complies  with merit system principles and appropriate laws, rules, and regulations,  and if it is free of political influence. However, the procedures do not list  the specific documents obtained from agency submissions and  automated hiring systems OPM should save in its case files. For  example, the procedures do not list specific agency documents described  in review checklists used by evaluators to review conversion requests,  such as job opportunity announcements used to solicit applications or  documentation used to adjudicate veterans\u2019 preference.  As noted above,  as OPM drafts the records schedule on retaining conversion case files for  maintaining files from conversion requests, it can specify information that  must be saved from agencies\u2019 automated systems to ensure such  documentation is available for subsequent review. Thus, we believe our  recommendation remains valid. We have clarified our recommendation to  specify that OPM should ensure that the finalized records schedule it is  drafting specifically lists all documentation it must save in its files.", "With respect to our second recommendation, OPM agreed to add a box  to the checklist for evaluators to indicate they have reviewed all required  documentation, and for their reviewers to add their concurrence. OPM did  not agree with what they believed was an implication that it lacks a policy  or process to ensure a thorough review of required information to conduct  a pre- or post-appointment review of current or recent political appointees  to covered civil service positions. According to OPM, the process involves  experienced evaluators and multiple levels of management review prior to  issuing a final decision of approval or denial. OPM also stated that the  thoroughness of its review process is also evident by the fact that GAO  agreed with all of its decisions for cases reviewed.", "We acknowledge that OPM has a process to review conversion requests.  As discussed above and illustrated in figure 1, OPM\u2019s process involves  both evaluators and multiple levels of management review prior to making  final decisions on conversion requests. Additionally, as noted above, we  determined that OPM evaluators and management sufficiently reviewed  all 78 OPM-approved agency requests included in the scope of our  review. Specifically, for each of the 78 cases, our review of OPM\u2019s case  files and additional documentation from individual agencies supported  OPM\u2019s conclusion that each of these conversions appeared to be free of  political influence. We also determined that these conversions complied  with merit system principles, applicable civil service law, and regulations.  However, OPM\u2019s procedures do not require its staff to verify they have  reviewed all documentation OPM requires from agencies to make an  informed recommendation. While evaluators may have reviewed all  required documentation, reviewers of OPM case files often cannot  confirm such reviews took place without verification. Thus, we believe our  recommendation remains valid.", "OPM also provided technical comments, which we incorporated in our  report, as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from its  issue date.

Specifically, this report examines (1) conversion requests submitted by  agencies and reviewed by OPM, (2) whether agencies used appropriate  authorities and proper procedures in conversions approved by OPM, (3)  conversion requests denied by OPM and referred to the Office of Special  Counsel (OSC), and (4) the extent to which OPM has complied with  governmentwide reporting requirements stipulated by the Edward \u201cTed\u201d  Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act  of 2015 (Transitions Act). For the purposes of our review, we included  conversions OPM reviewed and agencies intended to complete from  January 1, 2010, through March 17, 2016. This period begins with the  implementation of OPM\u2019s January 2010 policy requiring its prior approval  of all conversions of current or recent appointees to competitive or  nonpolitical excepted service positions. The period continues through  March 17, 2016. This is the day before the Transitions Act was enacted  and OPM began reporting requests by agencies to appoint political  appointees or former political appointees to covered civil service  positions. In selecting the executive branch departments and agencies for  this review, we looked at all agencies that OPM reported as having  requested its approval of proposed appointments of political appointees to  career positions during the time period referenced above.", "For the purpose of this review, we defined political appointees as those  appointed to positions in one of six categories: Schedule C; noncareer  Senior Executive Service (SES); limited-term SES; limited-emergency  SES; presidential appointees (including executive level and noncareer  ambassadors); and noncareer legislative branch. We excluded from our  review conversions of limited-term SES and limited-emergency SES  appointees who were career employees prior to being appointed to the  noncareer positions listed above. We identified three categories of career  positions appointments: career-conditional/career (competitive service);  career (SES); and career excepted service (non-Schedule C). Definitions  of these political and career positions can be found in the background  section of this report. They are identical to those covered in our  September 2016 report. The types of current or former political  appointees whose career conversion was subject to OPM\u2019s pre- appointment review under OPM\u2019s November 2009 guidance was not as  extensive as the categories of political appointees used in this report.  However, this variance in scope did not result in a difference between  what agencies gave OPM to review and what those agencies  subsequently provided us. For example, although not specifically under  OPM\u2019s 2010 pre-appointment review guidance, conversion actions  involving one current and three former presidential appointees subject to  Senate confirmation were submitted to OPM for review and were  approved. Additionally, a conversion action involving a current noncareer  legislative branch appointee was also reviewed and approved by OPM.  However, OPM\u2019s guidance does not specify it would subject conversions  involving legislative branch employees to its pre-appointment review.", "To address our first objective, we obtained data from OPM on its reviews  of agency requests to convert political appointees to career positions. In  addition, we obtained from agencies the number of approved cases  where they proceeded to hire political appointees. According to OPM  data, 30 executive branch departments and agencies requested OPM\u2019s  approval for at least one conversion during the period; the departments  and agencies are listed in appendix I. We then asked each of these 30 departments and agencies to corroborate (1) the number of requests to  convert employees from political to career positions each agency made to  OPM, and (2) the number of these conversions the agencies completed  during the period of our review. Additionally, we reviewed relevant OPM  documents and interviewed OPM officials charged with administering  OPM\u2019s political conversion review procedures. This allowed us to better  understand the steps OPM has taken to enhance its processes for  identifying conversions completed by agencies, including those  conversions agencies may have completed before obtaining OPM\u2019s  approval.", "To assess the reliability of OPM and agency conversion data, we  examined them for obvious errors and inconsistencies. We also sent  questionnaires to OPM and all 30 departments and agencies identified by  OPM as submitting conversion requests during the review period. We  asked them to submit information on the data systems they respectively  used to collect, store, and update conversions data, and the quality of  data entered into their system(s). We determined that political conversion  data provided by OPM and agencies for the time period of our review are  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "To address our second objective, we assessed OPM\u2019s reviews of all  conversion requests in our scope that OPM approved. Specifically, we  examined OPM\u2019s review checklists, individual OPM case files  documenting steps agencies took to convert political appointees, and  additional documentation provided by individual agencies. This was  designed to (1) ensure that appropriate authorities and proper procedures  were followed in making and reviewing conversions; and (2) determine,  for requests approved by OPM, whether we could support OPM\u2019s  decision that conversions appeared to be free of political influence and  complied with merit system principles, applicable civil service law, and  regulations. One GAO analyst applied professional judgment after  reviewing submitted checklists and documentation, appropriate laws and  regulations, and the circumstances for each conversion request. A  second analyst then reviewed and validated the first analyst\u2019s evaluation  of each conversion request. The second GAO analyst either  independently evaluated the conversion request, or traced findings from  the first analyst\u2019s review back to supporting audit documents. We  identified conversion review cases with significant differences between  our and OPM\u2019s reviews of the cases by comparing differences we  identified to selected merit system principles and prohibited personnel  practices. We then collected additional information from OPM on such  cases and determined whether agencies involved in the cases violated  merit system principles and proper procedures, or engaged in prohibited  personnel practices.", "To address our third objective, we identified the number of conversion  requests in our scope that OPM denied, and why they denied them. We  reviewed conversion requests referred to OSC for investigation, and  described the outcome of OSC\u2019s reviews of the cases. We also  summarized cases where OPM directed agencies to implement corrective  actions after reviewing conversion requests.", "To address our fourth objective, we reviewed revisions OPM made to its  pre-appointment review policies and procedures following enactment of  the Transitions Act. We also reviewed the data elements the Transitions  Act requires OPM to include in its reports to Congress on agency  personnel requests to appoint current or former political appointees to  covered civil service positions. We then compared these data elements  with information from reports on conversion requests OPM had submitted  to Congress.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 to August 2017  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
