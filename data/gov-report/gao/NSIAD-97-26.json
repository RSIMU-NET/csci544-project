EC, the electronic exchange of the information needed to do business, embraces many technologies, including electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail (E-mail), computer bulletin boards, and electronic funds transfer. EDI is the computer-to-computer exchange of routine business documents using standardized data formats. To meet the President\u2019s October 1993 goal, a governmentwide program to develop and implement an EDI-based architecture for federal acquisition was initiated.", "Title IX of FASA, enacted on October 13, 1994, provided the statutory framework for the governmentwide EC/EDI initiative. FASA mandated the development and implementation of a governmentwide FACNET architecture to expand small business access to the government marketplace and simplify and speed the solicitation and award of competitive procurements. FASA requires that FACNET provide (1) widespread public notice of both contracting opportunities and awards; (2) a means for vendors to electronically review, request information on, and respond to solicitations and similar information; and (3) recordkeeping on each procurement action. The act also requires that, if practicable, FACNET provide other capabilities, such as issuing orders under existing contracts and making payments.", "FASA does not specify a particular governmentwide EC/EDI systems architecture or design but does require FACNET to use commercial hardware and software, provide universal user access, and employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats.

However, FASA\u2019s prescribed process for determining what constitutes eligible contracts precludes such a determination until October 12, 1997, at the earliest. Therefore, the information needed to measure progress toward meeting these FASA criteria for FACNET success will not be available before that date.", "Although the information needed to measure progress toward FASA\u2019s criteria is not available, federal agencies have reported executing relatively few procurement actions through FACNET. For example, federal agencies reported 113,000 FACNET procurement actions for 1995. Available information indicates that (1) only about 25 percent of these actions were valued at $2,501 to $100,000 and (2) such actions may have represented less than 2 percent of all 1995 federal procurement actions in that dollar range. The remaining 75 percent of the 113,000 actions were almost all for $2,500 or less, and available information indicates that such actions may have represented less than 1 percent of all 1995 federal procurement actions in that dollar range.", "According to OFPP, the number of FACNET awards can be expected to remain relatively small unless FACNET proves to be a better, cheaper, faster purchasing technique than traditional small purchase methods.", "DOD made the vast majority of the 113,000 FACNET procurement actions, while civilian agencies made few. For example, DOD reported 97 percent of the FACNET procurement actions reported by federal agencies for 1995.

OFPP indicated that (1) each agency was asked to develop its own implementation plan to integrate EC into its internal processes and (2) since EC technologies are evolving, OFPP allowed the agencies a high degree of discretion in how they applied EC. According to DOD, its approach from the outset has been to utilize any and all technologies that were appropriate for a given business transaction.

DOD has operated and continued to develop the infrastructure with the stated purpose of enabling all federal agencies to implement both FACNET requirements and the goals of the governmentwide EC/EDI program. The following simplified description illustrates a business transaction moving through the current FACNET infrastructure. A buyer at a procuring activity electronically prepares and transmits Requests for Quotations or other solicitation data from the activity\u2019s automated procurement system through the infrastructure, which performs several functions. These include translating the data into standardized EDI formats and relaying the information to privately owned, participating Value-Added Networks (VAN). VANs distribute the information\u2014in a mutually agreed-upon format\u2014to vendors that subscribe to their services. Vendors, in turn, transmit their quotations through the network back to the agencies. After the buyer selects the winning vendor, a purchase order is transmitted to the vendor. Then, a broadcast notice announcing the winning vendor is transmitted to the VANs for distribution to vendors.", "A key goal of FACNET is to present a \u201csingle face to industry.\u201d Among the critical elements of the single face concept are that vendors, by registering once in a governmentwide Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, have access to and can respond to government solicitations and similar information through any single point of entry, using a single set of standards. Ideally, this would give a vendor easy access to information on numerous proposed contracts and awards including, for example, federal contracting opportunities up to $100,000 that previously would have been either listed in the Commerce Business Daily or manually posted at the procuring activity. And, the vendor could respond to government buyers in any agency using a single electronic system, as opposed to dealing with numerous different agency or procuring activity-unique systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Problems Reported Throughout FACNET Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["There was a broad consensus that FACNET has had operational problems.

ECA-PMO officials and users stated that these problems were significant.", "Most of the 99 contracting offices responding to a recent Army-wide survey of the effectiveness of FACNET reported problems with the FACNET infrastructure. Feedback from Air Force and Navy operational contracting activities reported to the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition & Technology) in July and August 1996 also stated that FACNET often had not worked well. Similarly, at least 14 of the 18 agencies we contacted cited the lack of a sound FACNET infrastructure and the lack of effective engineering and operational management as great or very great obstacles to efficient and effective implementation of FACNET. (See table III.2, in app. III, for details.)", "Buyers and vendors have been reluctant to do business through FACNET, in part, because of operational problems. For example, in April 1996, a senior contracting official at the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command stated that FACNET did not function well enough to support the Command\u2019s requirements in a meaningful way. He noted that outgoing FACNET solicitations had been lost or received by vendors as late as 2 weeks after transmittal and responses vendors had sent out soon enough to be on time were received at the Command several days after the closing date. He added that (1) vendors were frustrated about spending time and money to become FACNET-capable and then discovering that their quotes did not make it through the system and (2) vendors often faxed their quotes to Training and Doctrine Command buyers, in addition to transmitting them through FACNET, to ensure receipt. Another Army contracting activity reported that its buyers routinely mail out copies of FACNET award notices because vendors complained that they were not receiving them through FACNET.", "In July 1996, an official with the San Antonio Electronic Commerce Resource Center who works with small businesses and government offices in introducing EC into their business practices told us that FACNET has had its share of growing pains. In particular, he noted that lost and duplicate transactions and a general instability of FACNET have caused many vendors to question the wisdom of participating on FACNET.", "For vendors, problems in transmitting and managing transactions through FACNET can result in lost business opportunities and additional transmission fees paid to VANs. For the government, such problems cause delays in getting needed supplies and services, reduce productivity, and lead to bid protests. In June 1996, for example, our office considered a protest concerning a FACNET acquisition in which three quotes submitted through FACNET were lost.", "DOD has recently made major design changes to enhance the FACNET infrastructure. Officials responsible for the redesign stated that the new infrastructure should reduce the operational problems that have been identified, including an inability to track transactions through FACNET, and lost and late transactions. The DOD Inspector General recently reported that the proposed redesign, referred to as the Electronic Commerce Processing Nodes, should reduce the recurring problems related to lost and late transactions, the inability to track transactions, and the lack of acknowledgment for transactions.

Vendor registration in, and agency use of, the CCR database is mandated in the governmentwide Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) implementing FASA\u2019s requirements for FACNET. The database, however, has been experiencing significant problems, is far behind schedule, and is still not performing its intended role of operating as the single federal contractor registration system.", "DOD reported in October 1996 that only about 4,000 of an estimated 300,000 government contractors had validated registrations in the database. Currently, agencies must award contracts to unregistered vendors because the CCR database does not have enough registered vendors to supply the full range of products and services needed.

For example, purchase cards (government-issued commercial credit cards); the Internet; online catalogs, including the GSA\u2019s automated supply schedule contracts; and other commercial alternatives have been introduced into government contracting and their use is growing rapidly. Use of the purchase cards for contract payment, combined with electronic ordering from online contracts, and/or new, more flexible procedures for the use of federal supply schedule contracts provides agencies with readily available alternatives to meeting their procurement needs that were not available just a few years ago, when FASA was being written. Moreover, technology developments are expected to continue to offer opportunities to improve federal purchasing methods.", "These developments have led some agencies and many federal officials involved with FACNET implementation to question whether\u2014especially for small competitive acquisitions, such as those under $25,000\u2014the use of the current FACNET infrastructure makes good business sense. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) officials said that NASA intended to concentrate its EC efforts on Internet-based acquisition services and not FACNET. Some Air Force and Army contracting activities have also suggested using the Internet instead of FACNET. Officials of 15 federal agencies are working together to pursue Internet-based initiatives.", "The DOD Inspector General reported that DOD officials responsible for FACNET had (1) acknowledged that the evolution of new technologies was creating alternatives to DOD\u2019s original concept of FACNET as the single mechanism for EC/EDI procurements and (2) indicated that alternatives were being analyzed that would still maintain the single face to industry goal. In a July 1996 memorandum, the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force stated that while the DOD procurement community has recognized that the current network for FACNET needs changing, there is no current solution. In November 1996, DOD expressed the belief that in conducting competitive procurements, the requirements to be FACNET-compliant, particularly the single face to industry goal, are critical. For other than competitive transactions (which includes noncompetitive awards and orders under existing contracts), DOD added, it may not be necessary to meet FACNET requirements.", "ECA-PMO officials observed that with agencies now viewing direct buying (through ordering from online catalogs or other existing contracts) as more efficient, the current FACNET infrastructure is becoming \u201cless relevant.\u201d OFPP and the ECA-PMO officials said they are moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to FACNET implementation in favor of allowing agencies the flexibility to employ the best technology for a particular acquisition.

For example, some FACNET vendors said that inconsistent and, in some cases, directly opposite practices were used at different procuring activities. They pointed out that some buyers accept fax queries for more information and send faxes to clarify FACNET solicitations, while other procuring activities no longer permit use of faxes and will ignore any incoming fax messages;there seems to be no consistent policy covering procurements exempted from use of FACNET; and the number of days a solicitation remains open is highly variable.", "Vendor commitment to FACNET is influenced by the lack of consistency in procurement procedures and policies like these.", "Some vendors complain that they are unable to get the information they need on agencies\u2019 and procuring activities\u2019 current and future FACNET business opportunities. Vendors point out that they need such information to determine whether FACNET will generate sufficient revenues to justify the investments needed to participate in FACNET. Last year we testified that, depending on the volume of transactions and types of services, businesses could incur costs ranging from about $70 to several thousand dollars monthly for VAN services alone. The use of VANs is a key component of the current FACNET infrastructure.", "Agency officials also stated that FACNET can be expensive for vendors to implement. According to one agency official, vendors are unwilling to make the investment in time and money to participate, because of the problems the government is experiencing with FACNET. More than 40 percent of the contracting activities in the Army\u2019s 1996 FACNET survey said that there were insufficient numbers of vendors participating in FACNET. EC program managers at other agencies told us that FACNET solicitations often had to be canceled because of little or no vendor response. According to officials of several agencies, few vendors, particularly small businesses, are EDI-capable and the current FACNET implementation approach offers few incentives for these businesses to participate.", "The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy acknowledged that VAN costs create major problems for small businesses. He added that a small business has to sell a lot to the government to make the investment worthwhile, which could have the effect of concentrating work among a class of EDI-capable vendors that specialize in doing government business over FACNET.", "DOD acknowledged that there is a cost to small businesses associated with VANs\u2019 processing FACNET transactions but stated that the cost of doing business manually often meant the small business had to use an agent to review physical bulletin boards\u2014at potentially 1,400 separate DOD sites\u2014the only places where contracting opportunities under $25,000 were posted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expected Benefits Not Yet Being Realized", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, the National Performance Review stated that exchanging acquisition information with vendors electronically could result in governmentwide savings of up to $500 million per year, due to increased competition and reduced federal paperwork.

More generally, however, government buyers have found that using FACNET to award contracts of $25,000 or less takes longer and requires more resources than traditional methods. They attribute this, in part, to the frequent need to communicate by telephone and fax with vendors to verify the receipt of a quote, answer questions, or investigate a vendor\u2019s capabilities and those of its products. Further, they noted that their efforts have been hampered by a lack of guidance on how to evaluate vendors\u2019 responses, particularly when a substantial number of quotes are received and how to determine the timeliness of vendors\u2019 quotes.", "The results of a U.S. Army Missile Command comparison of 179 FACNET actions and the same number and types of non-FACNET (and non-EDI) actions were that the use of FACNET prolonged the procurement process for purchases of $2,501 to $25,000 from an average of 3 days to more than 7 days and required extra resources and effort. The Command official responsible for the comparison concluded that for this price range, the cost in time and effort far overshadows any small savings FACNET produces. The Department of the Interior performed a similar test at five buying locations and got comparable results.", "The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy told us that the problems reported by frontline procurement staff trying to implement FACNET prompted his office to recommend several policy changes last year.", "The FAR Council adopted many of these recommended changes, as part of the proposed FAR Part 13 restructuring rule. The proposed rule would give agencies greater flexibility in using FACNET, as OFPP recommended, including the authority to describe requirements using multiple brand names for purchases under $25,000 and conduct more expedited evaluation of vendors\u2019 quotes or offers. Additionally, the proposed rule states that agencies need not respond to inquiries (1) by telephone or fax, unless they are unable to receive inquiries through FACNET or (2) through any medium (including FACNET) if doing so would interfere with their ability to conduct the procurement in an efficient manner. The Administrator said these changes were intended to address procurement offices\u2019 complaints that FACNET had increased both the resources needed to evaluate quotes and procurement leadtimes, compared with traditional solicitation methods. He said the changes were also intended to enhance FACNET\u2019s viability and increase agencies\u2019 use of it.", "Key agency officials responsible for FACNET implementation at the 18 agencies we contacted cited indirect benefits\u2014such as lessons learned that will likely benefit the government in the future\u2014as the most significant benefits being realized from FACNET.

As previously noted, FASA requires that FACNET provide (1) widespread public notice of contracting opportunities and (2) a means for private sector users to electronically access and review executive agency solicitations and respond to them.", "Federal officials said the concept, using EDI technology to focus primarily on relatively low dollar value competitive contract awards to small businesses, may not be the best solution for the procurements targeted. These officials noted that the concept was developed and pilot tested by the executive branch and formed the basis for the FASA approach. The concept emphasizes the use of EDI, a technology that has been used primarily to support a high volume of routine \u201cone-to-one,\u201dcomputer-to-computer business transactions between organizations that have established a close working relationship. Examples of such transactions include delivery orders under existing contracts and invoices exchanged between a company and its regular suppliers. Commercial companies and some federal agencies have found that EDI technology can be very effective when used in this way.", "Three federal agencies that are using EDI successfully for one-to-one transactions\u2014the Defense Logistics Agency, GSA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2014reported transmitting a total of about 840,000 delivery orders and 517,000 invoices in 1995. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy stated that a lot of progress has been made in federal agency use of EDI technology for acquisition\u2014but outside of FACNET\u2014as shown by these three agencies\u2019 efforts on one-to-one transactions. According to DOD, (1) the organizations currently processing these one-to-one transactions are primarily utilizing proprietary solutions, or noncompliant standards, and do not present a single face to industry at this time and (2) maintaining and sustaining such actions are outside DOD\u2019s Information Infrastructure\u2014\u201ca FACNET compliant system.\u201d", "Because the technical and business requirements for such one-to-many transactions differ significantly from one-to-one transactions, agencies using FACNET have not been able to benefit fully from the lessons learned and from long-term familiarity with electronic delivery orders and invoices on the part of commercial companies and the Defense Logistics Agency, GSA, and the Department of Veteran Affairs. Moreover, the use of FACNET for one-to-many transactions is essentially a government-unique business application of EDI, involving different business and technical considerations than one-to-one delivery orders and invoices. Several OFPP, ECA-PMO, GSA, and other agency officials said that focusing FACNET\u2019s implementation on competitive procurements has contributed significantly to FACNET\u2019s problems and the skepticism that surrounds the existing infrastructure.

OFPP, ECA-PMO, and DOD officials responsible for FACNET and the CCR database told us that the following obstacles to governmentwide EC must be resolved: (1) unanswered questions on who should have access to the CCR data and how such data should be used by both the government and industry, (2) the absence of policy and procedures for implementing such a governmentwide database, and (3) database security problems.", "DOD officials responsible for the FACNET infrastructure, contracting officials, VANs, and vendors stated that many operational problems stem from the lack of clear requirements for the acquisition function and operational procedures that are needed to direct the development and use of the FACNET infrastructure and manage FACNET data. For instance, requirements for archiving data, accessing data, recording critical acquisition information, and auditing FACNET transactions have not been established, and both buyers and vendors have frequently cited the need for an electronic date/time stamp, as well as clear requirements and procedures to record receipt of vendors\u2019 quotes by the government.", "With respect to VANs, FACNET implementation has been hindered by uncertainties regarding the government\u2019s certification process, lack of clear data management policies and procedures, and unresolved questions about VANs\u2019 financial and technical responsibilities. VAN representatives and DOD officials responsible for VAN certification and oversight told us that VANs have been operating without a clear understanding of the objectives and requirements of the system. DOD is taking actions to address some of these issues. Specifically, DOD recently issued a revised VAN Licensing Agreement; and some testing and procedural changes reflected in this revised agreement may improve the VAN certification process.", "In addition, GSA and OFPP officials stated that the lessons learned in creating a governmentwide EC program, new technology developments, and broader policies affecting EC, such as the requirement to make all payments to vendors electronically by 1999, have made it necessary to take a fresh look at the government\u2019s approach to EC in contracting and how best to implement and manage it. OFPP officials said the government intends to make more than 95 percent of its purchases under $100,000 through EC by the year 2000 in coordination with making electronic payments to vendors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In the short time since passage of FASA, alternative electronic purchasing methods have become readily available to the government and its vendors. This factor, concerns about FASA\u2019s requirements, and the problems associated with the existing FACNET implementation raise important questions concerning whether and to what extent use of the current FACNET infrastructure makes good business sense.", "A related issue is how to integrate FACNET and other EC technologies and purchasing methods into a coherent EC strategy and implementation approach for effectively carrying out agencies\u2019 acquisition functions and achieving a single face to industry.

The strategy and approach should incorporate consideration of the need to achieve the single-face-to-industry goal.", "We also recommend, if executive branch officials conclude that statutory requirements for FACNET\u2014such as focusing it on providing widespread public notice of contracting opportunities and exchanging information with multiple vendors\u2014are impediments to the implementation of the governmentwide EC strategy, that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget seek legislative relief."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on the draft of this report, NASA, GSA, OFPP and DOD generally agreed with our findings and recommendations, but DOD indicated that\u2014since the completion of our audit work in September 1996\u2014it was no longer experiencing operational problems with FACNET and the CCR system.", "NASA stated that it agreed that a mandated FACNET approach, based solely on EDI, does not make the best business sense for federal EC. NASA stated that it was encouraged by our recommendation that NASA join with other agencies in developing a coherent strategy and implementation approach that takes advantage of available EC technologies.", "GSA stated that our findings are correct in targeting leadership improvements. GSA stated that there have been leadership challenges in the implementation of FACNET as well as technical and procedural problems with the use of EDI for public requests for quotation. GSA specifically noted that (1) civilian agencies, in many cases, have not provided adequate resources, training, and vendor outreach required to successfully implement FACNET or EC in general and (2) the ECA-PMO has been hindered by a lack of funding and staffing.", "OFPP stated that our report was very helpful in focusing its governmentwide EC efforts. To help focus on solutions, OFPP stated that a committee of the President\u2019s Management Council has been established to assist agency heads to manage the transition from paper to electronics, focus resources, increase management efficiency, accelerate implementation, and connect resources to results. OFPP said it is continuing to pursue the development of FACNET for use, where appropriate, to streamline acquisition processes. OFPP said it is also concerned that FACNET and all procurement policies offer real improvements in serving the user and meeting the important missions entrusted to government in a cost-effective way.", "Both GSA and OFPP stated that they are working together and with other agencies, which includes participation by the President\u2019s Management Council, to address the leadership and policy direction concerns raised and to develop a new EC management framework. OFPP also stated that it has taken steps to develop and implement that framework to better integrate EC throughout government. In addition, GSA said this new management structure will be put into place over the next several months, will bring a better focus and problem resolution to the program, will be cross-functional, and will be able to better review EC programs and provide more long-range planning.", "DOD described recent enhancements it has made to FACNET\u2019s infrastructure and the CCR system and stated that it was no longer experiencing operational problems. These enhancements included implementing (1) the Electronic Commerce Processing Nodes on November 1, 1996, to improve the FACNET infrastructure\u2019s throughput and accuracy and (2) a World Wide Web site and dial-up modem capability on October 1, 1996, which allows vendors to register for free in the CCR database. DOD added that it is in the process of developing a strategic plan to increase the CCR population in 1997.", "In addition, DOD described other enhancements. For example, it stated that it has recently completed an EC Strategic Plan that encompasses all functional areas within the Department (procurement, finance, logistics, transportation, personnel, medical, etc.) and includes all forms of EC (EDI, fax, bar coding, etc.). According to DOD, this approach will provide a single face to industry and allow the maximum exchange of data between functional areas. DOD also said it is finalizing an EC directive that establishes roles and responsibilities throughout the Department pertaining to the implementation of EC in all functional areas.", "DOD stated that it will continue (1) to execute its FACNET implementation plan and (2) increase the volume of transactions through the infrastructure over the next three fiscal years. Finally, DOD stated that it is ready to work with the OFPP, GSA, and NASA Administrators and the heads of other major federal procuring agencies to assist them in their development of independent strategies and the overall federal EC strategy for federal procurement.", "The comments from NASA, GSA, OFPP and DOD are reprinted in their entirety in appendixes IV through VII, respectively.

The DCI specifically asked for agency data and information related to (1) current FACNET operations, (2) current and potential FACNET procurement transactions, (3) benefits from using FACNET, (4) obstacles to governmentwide implementation of FACNET, (5) potential use of FACNET for simplified acquisitions, and (6) changes needed in the FACNET development and implementation strategies. When necessary we conducted follow-up interviews with respondents to clarify DCI responses and obtain additional information.", "In addition, to assess federal agencies\u2019 use of FACNET, we asked the agencies to verify their FACNET transaction data (e.g., number of solicitations, responses received, purchase and delivery orders, and amount of awards) for the periods January through December 1995 and January through March 1996, which was the latest complete data reported by the ECA-PMO. We also obtained supplemental FACNET transaction data from the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, and Labor; the Defense Logistics Agency; GSA; and NASA.
