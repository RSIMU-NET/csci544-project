This report examines (1) factors that influence clinicians' decisions to use particular implants when multiple, similar items are available; (2) selected VAMCs' compliance with pertinent VHA requirements for documenting open- market purchases; and (3) VA's and VHA's oversight of VAMC compliance with implant purchasing requirements.

Also, clinicians in certain specialties said they typically used one of the implants available on VA-negotiated national committed-use contracts, which generally establish a fixed price for several models of nine types of surgical implants that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) commits to using nationally. VHA recognizes the need for expanding items covered under these contracts to fully leverage its purchasing power but, as of October 2013, had not identified additional implants to include on such contracts or established timelines for doing so. GAO also found that the availability of implants on VA-negotiated federal supply schedule (FSS) contracts rarely influenced clinicians' decisions on which implant to use. Clinicians were often not aware of the availability of surgical implants on FSS contracts, which are negotiated by one of VA's contracting offices, but for which VHA clinicians have little or no input. Clinicians told GAO that in some cases they may avoid implants on FSS contracts due to their concerns about the quality of these items.", "In regard to compliance with VHA's requirements for justifying open-market purchases of surgical implants, which VHA adopted to promote adherence to relevant federal regulations, GAO found the following:", "None of the four VAMCs fully complied with requirements for obtaining waivers for open-market purchases of surgical implants because they were focusing on other priorities or lacked awareness of the requirements, among other factors.", "None of the four VAMCs fully complied with additional requirements for documenting open-market purchases that are part of a new process VHA implemented in fiscal year 2013 for surgical implant purchases over $3,000. VAMC and regional office officials attributed noncompliance mainly to insufficient VHA guidance and VA staff's inexperience in completing these requirements.", "Three of the four VAMCs did not comply with a VHA requirement pertaining to agreements with vendors that provided surgical implants to them on consignment. These agreements, which clinicians likely established to ensure timely access to implants, do not comply with a VHA requirement that consignment agreements must be authorized by a VHA contracting officer.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and VHA have begun conducting oversight of surgical implant purchases over $3,000 to assess compliance with VHA's new requirements. However, VHA officials told GAO that VA and VHA have not ensured that corrective action has been taken to address identified noncompliance because of poor communication between VA and VHA and insufficient staffing to follow up on identified issues. Furthermore, VHA assesses each VAMC's performance on metrics established for surgical implant purchasing, but it does not have a policy governing how any identified deficiencies should be addressed nor the corrective actions to be taken by VAMCs and VHA's regional networks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA identify implants and establish a timeline to expand the volume that can be purchased from VA-negotiated contracts and improve compliance with and oversight of purchasing requirements.

Federal law grants the  Secretary of VA the authority to procure prosthetics and related  necessary services in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be  proper, without regard to any other provision of law. VHA has exercised  this authority to limit competition when purchasing prosthetics\u2014including  surgical implants\u2014 when doing so is necessary to meet veterans\u2019 clinical  needs. Specifically, surgeons and other clinicians at VA medical centers  (VAMC) determine veterans\u2019 needs for surgical implants. While VA has  negotiated competitive contracts for a variety of surgical implants, VAMCs  or VHA\u2019s regional network contracting offices (NCO) can purchase a  specific surgical implant requested by a clinician from the open market  with appropriate clinical justification, rather than purchasing a similar item  through a competitive contract. VHA\u2019s spending on surgical implants  increased about 28 percent over the last four years and was about   $563 million in fiscal year 2012.", "At a recent congressional hearing, concerns were raised about the extent  to which VAMCs and NCOs purchase surgical implants from the open  market without appropriate justification, rather than purchasing such items  from competitive contracts\u2014potentially at a lower cost. Concerns were  also raised about VHA\u2019s oversight of VAMCs\u2019 and NCOs\u2019 purchases of  surgical implants, which may have allowed insufficiently documented  purchases of these items to go unnoticed. You asked us to review VHA\u2019s  purchasing of surgical implants, including requirements for documenting  purchases from the open market and oversight of compliance with these  requirements.

To learn more about VA\u2019s and VHA\u2019s surgical  implant purchasing processes for surgical implant purchases from the  open market, we also interviewed procurement and prosthetics officials at  VA and VHA. To determine compliance with pertinent requirements,  applicable to surgical implant purchases from the open market at each of  the four VAMCs we visited, we reviewed documentation related to  selected purchases that occurred in the first 6 months of fiscal year 2013.

Our findings on compliance are not  generalizable beyond the purchases we reviewed. To ensure that the  data we used to select purchases for review were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes, we conducted a detailed data reliability assessment of the  data that we used, which included checks for missing values and  interviews with a VHA official knowledgeable about the data. We  restricted these assessments, however, to the specific variables that were  pertinent to our analyses.

For example, one  clinician stated that his knowledge of different types of surgical  implants, including the different features of various implants, is the  result of 30 years of training and experience.", "Review of relevant literature: Several clinicians stated that they  regularly reviewed relevant literature to help identify the surgical  implants with the greatest clinical efficacy. One clinician told us that  he recently switched to a different type of skin graft because a review  of the literature suggested that this item was more effective than the  one that he had been using.", "Interaction with vendors: Several clinicians told us that they work  closely with vendor representatives who supply surgical implants (for  example, when implanting a pacemaker, a vendor representative may  be involved in testing and programming the device). Further, some  clinicians with whom we spoke said that their past experience working  with a particular vendor, including whether they believe that the  vendor representative is knowledgeable and reliable, helps drive their  decision of which implant to use.

In developing national committed-use  contracts, VHA solicits input from a group of VHA clinicians to determine  which items to place on national committed-use contracts and to review  them for clinical efficacy. Several different models of each type of  implant are available on national committed-use contracts\u2014for example,  the contracts for pacemakers include models from three different  vendors\u2014thereby providing clinicians with a choice of which implant to  use.", "In 2011, VHA established a program executive office, including six program  management offices.

The program management offices also  coordinate with VA\u2019s contracting offices, which are responsible for establishing national  committed-use contracts for standardized items. a plan or timeline for establishing new contracts. Without the  establishment of national committed-use contracts for a greater number  of surgical implants, VHA is not fully leveraging its purchasing power as  one of the nation\u2019s largest health care systems.", "While availability of implants via national committed-use contracts  positively influenced their use by clinicians we interviewed, the availability  of implants via FSS contracts rarely did so for a number of reasons.  Clinicians at the four VAMCs we visited were often not aware of what  surgical implants were available on an FSS contract, even though these  contracts are preferred to open market purchases under the VAAR. For  example, some of these clinicians mistakenly believed that a biological  implant they were using was on an FSS contract, when in fact it was not.  Clinicians at the four VAMCs we visited also lacked awareness of how to  obtain information on which implants were available on an FSS contract.  In addition, network prosthetics purchasing officials told us that it is  difficult for both clinicians and prosthetics purchasing agents to use VHA\u2019s  national database of FSS contracts to determine what specific items are  available on an FSS contract. For example, the officials stated that very  specific terms must be entered in the database\u2019s search field in order to  obtain a useful list of items available on FSS contracts. Some clinicians  stated that it would be helpful to have a user-friendly list of surgical  implants available on FSS contracts, including the implant\u2019s attributes\u2014 such as its shelf life and approved clinical indication\u2014for each surgical  specialty. Clinicians at the four VAMCs we visited noted that such a list  would allow them to consider FSS contract availability in making their  decisions on which implant to use. We found that one VAMC we visited  had begun developing a list of skin grafts available on FSS contracts,  which included their attributes\u2014such as whether the grafts had to be  stored in a freezer\u2014to help raise awareness of items available on FSS  contract.", "Some clinicians at the four VAMCs we visited also stated that if there is  not sufficient data to support the clinical efficacy of an implant on an FSS  contract, they would not feel comfortable using it. For example, at one  VAMC, a clinician noted that a specific vendor who had an implant on an  FSS contract questioned why the implant was not being purchased. The  clinician asked for clinical efficacy data, which\u2014according to the  clinician\u2014was never provided, and therefore the clinician decided not to  use the item. Senior VHA prosthetics and contracting officials stated that  clinicians are not involved in determining which surgical implants should  be available on FSS contracts, and therefore the items available on FSS  contracts may not always be those that clinicians prefer to use based on  their expertise and experience. Additionally, these officials expressed  concern that an evaluation of the clinical efficacy of an item is not  conducted in awarding FSS contracts. These officials further stated that  VHA prefers to develop national committed-use contracts, for which a  clinical efficacy evaluation is conducted.

The other three VAMCs did not  comply with the requirement, meaning that they did not obtain waivers  for any of the purchases we reviewed. Two of these three VAMCs  had a relatively high percentage of open-market purchases of non- biological implants in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2013 based  on VHA data (33 percent and 35 percent, respectively) and one had a  low percentage of such purchases (2 percent). Officials at two of the  VAMCs told us that these waivers were not routinely obtained  because they were focusing on other priorities instead, such as  implementing VHA\u2019s new process for surgical implant purchases over  $3,000. At the third VAMC, a prosthetics official told us that clinicians  did not always fill out a waiver when asked to do so.

We found multiple instances where the  documentation indicated that the determination was based on \u201cprior  experience purchasing similar items\u201d but did not cite any prior pricing  information. Not citing any prior pricing information leaves open  questions about the thoroughness of the analysis conducted to  determine price reasonableness. We also identified cases where the  contracting officer or prosthetics purchasing agent documented the  price as \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d when it fell within a broad range of  prices. For example, a contracting officer determined that about  $6,000 for a bone graft purchased from the open market was fair and  reasonable because the sales prices for \u201csimilar\u201d items was typically  between $3,000 and $20,000. VAMC and NCO officials we interviewed stated it is difficult to determine price reasonableness for  surgical implants, in part, because they need to be knowledgeable of  the exact characteristics of the item in question in order to effectively  evaluate price reasonableness. They also said they believed that as  contracting officers gain more experience in purchasing surgical  implants, they will learn to more effectively complete this  documentation. Furthermore, an NCO official stated that specific  guidance from VHA on how to effectively complete the fair and  reasonable price determination for surgical implants would be helpful.  Ineffective market research and determination of price  reasonableness may result in VHA overpaying for surgical implants.", "JOFOC: During our review of selected open-market surgical implant  purchases over $3,000, we found two issues with respect to those  purchases made on a sole-source basis for which a JOFOC was  required under VHA\u2019s new purchasing process. First, the JOFOC was  not on file for between 5 and 29 percent of the applicable purchases  we reviewed at the four VAMCs we visited. Second, at three of the  VAMCs we visited, we found that the officials responsible for  completing the JOFOC selected the \u201cunusual and compelling  urgency\u201d justification for each of the purchases we reviewed, even  though some officials told us that they did not have a full  understanding of which justifications applied.

Furthermore, officials at this VAMC stated  that a VHA draft directive on surgical implant purchasing  discourages the use of VA\u2019s acquisition authority under 38 U.S.C.  \u00a7 8123 to justify sole-source awards of surgical implants on the  open market. Because they were discouraged from using this  justification on the JOFOC, they tended to rely on the \u201cunusual  and compelling urgency\u201d justification instead.", "Moreover, while VHA requires each JOFOC to include sufficient facts and  rationale to support why a specific justification was cited, only one of the  four VAMCs fully provided this information for any of the purchases we  reviewed. At two VAMCs, no rationale was provided for the justification  selected. Furthermore, the JOFOCs at these two VAMCs were frequently  missing required information, such as the contracting officer\u2019s signature,  or were not completed until several months after the purchase. At the  fourth VAMC, each JOFOC for the purchases we reviewed typically  included a generic paragraph stating that the purchase was justified  based on the determination of the clinician who requested the implant,  regardless of which justification was cited. VAMC and NCO officials told  us that clinicians\u2019 surgical implant purchase requests often do not contain  sufficient information to support why the clinician was requesting the  particular item. Because the JOFOCs we reviewed were often  incomplete, VHA lacks assurance that support existed for the sole-source  awards pursuant to VHA\u2019s policies at these four VAMCs.", "As we discuss later, VA and VHA both identified more widespread areas  of noncompliance (in the areas we describe above)\u2014beyond the 4  VAMCs we visited\u2014through oversight efforts they conducted at  numerous VAMCs and NCOs nationwide. For example, VA\u2019s oversight  identified extensive noncompliance, including inadequate fair and  reasonable price determinations and missing or improperly completed  JOFOCs.", "VHA officials stated that they were familiar with the challenges that  VAMCs and NCOs were experiencing with complying with the  requirements of VHA\u2019s new process for surgical implant purchases over  $3,000 and acknowledged that some of these challenges stem from a  lack of sufficient guidance for implementing this new process. To address  these challenges, VHA officials stated that VHA has developed additional  guidance to facilitate the purchase of these items. This guidance includes  (1) revised JOFOC templates to help ensure that the correct purchasing  justification is cited and that an appropriate rationale is provided for using  each justification and (2) additional guidance on completing the fair and  reasonable price determination, which, as of November 2013, had not yet  been issued. Moreover, VHA contracting officials stated that VHA plans to  provide training on the documentation of purchases over $3,000;  however, as of November 2013, this training had not yet been approved.  In addition, VHA is developing a directive and associated standard  operating procedure that outline the processes VAMCs and NCOs are  expected to follow when completing contracting packages for surgical  implant purchases over $3,000, including a JOFOC in the event of a sole- source purchase. As of November 2013, VHA was still in the process of  providing its draft directive and standard operating procedure to  stakeholders for review, and there are no established timelines for  finalizing this directive and standard operating procedure, according to  VHA officials. VHA officials stated that there had been disagreement  between VHA prosthetics and contracting officials concerning the details  of the directive and standard operating procedure\u2013for example, which  specific requirements would be the responsibility of VAMC prosthetics  purchasing staff and which would be the responsibility of NCO contracting  officers. According to VHA officials, these disagreements delayed the  completion of these documents and disseminating them to VAMCs and  NCOs.", "VHA officials also told us that they are considering ways to streamline the  documentation requirements for purchases over $3,000 in response to  concerns from VAMCs and NCOs about the resources required to  complete a contracting package for each purchase and potential delays in  making purchases for surgical implants, which could result in the  postponement of needed medical procedures. For example, VHA officials  stated that they are considering providing VAMC prosthetics purchasing  staff with ordering officer delegations, which would allow them to  purchase surgical implants from national committed-use contracts,  without having to work with a contracting officer to complete a contracting  package for such a purchase. They told us that this would free up  contracting officers\u2019 time to work on documenting open market purchases  and help ensure that these purchases are appropriately documented.  However, VHA officials told us that they were still in the process of  evaluating the feasibility of delegating ordering authority to prosthetics  purchasing staff, including addressing technical challenges with the  prosthetics purchasing system, which they said currently prevent VHA  from effectively implementing this change.

Under a  consignment agreement, the vendor maintains vendor-owned items at the  VAMC, and the VAMC purchases only the items actually used. VAMC  and network officials told us that clinicians likely made these unauthorized  agreements with vendors to ensure that they had timely access to the  surgical implants that they preferred to use. However, they could not tell  us when these agreements had been established, who had authorized  them, and what the terms of the agreements were. These officials told us  that the unauthorized agreements with vendors have resulted in  unauthorized commitments, vendors not being paid in a timely manner,  and surgical implants not being tracked in the VAMCs\u2019 inventories.  Furthermore, because these unauthorized agreements covered surgical  implants from the open market, and the purchase prices were not  negotiated, the VAMCs may have overpaid for these items.", "To address these unauthorized consignment agreements, officials at  each of these VAMCs or the corresponding networks stated that they  were in the process of establishing authorized consignment agreements  which include an agreed-upon price and quantity for each surgical  implant. Having authorized consignment agreements in place may be  useful in instances where the requirement for a surgical implant is  immediate and it is not possible to predetermine which of several types or  models are required. Establishing such agreements involves determining  the types of surgical implants that clinicians need to have available on a  consignment basis and obtaining a contracting officer\u2019s authorization for  the VAMC to enter a consignment agreement with the vendors. At the  time of our review, VHA was developing a standard operating procedure  to assist VAMCs and NCOs in developing authorized consignment  agreements, however, as of November 2013 they were unsure as to  when it would be finalized and rolled out to the VAMCs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA and VHA Did Not Ensure that Corrective Actions Were Taken when Noncompliance with Surgical Implant Purchasing Requirements Was Identified", "paragraphs": ["As a result of their oversight efforts, VA and VHA found noncompliance  with surgical implant purchasing requirements, but did not ensure that  NCOs or VAMCs took corrective action.
