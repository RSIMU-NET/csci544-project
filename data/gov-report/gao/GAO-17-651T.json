These challenges contribute to GAO's continuing inclusion of DOE's and NNSA's management of major contracts and projects on the list of agencies and program areas that are at high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or are in need of transformation. GAO also recently added the U.S. government's environmental liabilities to this list.", "This statement is based on 13 GAO reports issued from May 2015 through May 2017 and discusses (1) challenges related to the affordability of NNSA's nuclear modernization plans, (2) the status of DOE's efforts to improve its management of contracts and projects, (3) challenges in addressing DOE's environmental liabilities, and (4) challenges facing NNSA's nonproliferation programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) faces challenges related to the affordability of its nuclear modernization programs. GAO found in April 2017 that these challenges were caused by a misalignment between NNSA's modernization plans and the estimated budgetary resources needed to carry out those plans. First, GAO found that NNSA's estimates of funding needed for its modernization plans sometimes exceeded the budgetary projections included in the President's planned near-term and long-term modernization budgets. Second, GAO found that the costs of some major modernization programs\u2014such as for nuclear weapon refurbishments\u2014may also increase and further strain future modernization budgets that currently do not anticipate these potential increases. GAO recommended in April 2017 that NNSA include an assessment of the affordability of its modernization programs in future versions of its annual plan on stockpile stewardship; NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with that recommendation.", "DOE has taken several important steps that demonstrate its commitment to improving contract and project management, but challenges persist. In recent reports, GAO has noted progress as DOE has developed and implemented corrective actions to identify and address root causes of persistent project management challenges and progress in its monitoring of the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective actions. However, DOE's recent efforts do not address several areas of contract and project management where the department continues to struggle. GAO has made several recommendations related to these issues, many of which DOE has not yet implemented.", "DOE also faces challenges with addressing its environmental liabilities\u2014the total cost of its cleanup responsibilities. In February 2017, GAO found that DOE was responsible for over 80 percent ($372 billion) of the U.S. government's estimated $450 billion environmental liability. However, this estimate does not reflect all of DOE's cleanup responsibilities. For example, in January 2017, GAO found that the cost estimate for DOE's proposal for separate defense and commercial nuclear waste repositories excluded the costs and time frames for key activities, and therefore full costs are likely to be billions of dollars more than DOE's reported environmental liabilities. To effectively address cleanup, GAO and other organizations have reported that DOE needs to take a nation-wide, risk-informed approach, which could reduce long-term costs as well as environmental risks more quickly. Since 1994, GAO has made at least 28 recommendations to address the federal government's environmental liabilities and 4 suggestions to Congress to consider changes to the laws governing cleanup activities. Of these, 13 recommendations remain unimplemented.", "Finally, NNSA faces challenges in implementing its nonproliferation programs. For example, in June 2016, GAO found that NNSA's Nuclear Smuggling Detection and Deterrence program had developed a program plan, but NNSA could not measure progress because not all of the program's goals were measurable, and performance measures were not aligned with the goals. As a result, NNSA may not be able to determine when the program has fully achieved its mission. GAO has made several recommendations related to NNSA's nonproliferation programs, some of which NNSA has yet to implement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement.

NNSA is  responsible for managing the nation\u2019s nuclear security missions: ensuring  a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent; achieving designated  reductions in the nuclear weapons stockpile; and supporting the nation\u2019s  nuclear nonproliferation efforts. To implement NNSA\u2019s weapons  modernization plans, the agency\u2019s February 2016 budget justification for  the Weapons Activities appropriations account included about $49.4  billion for fiscal years 2017 through 2021, of which about $9.2 billion was  for fiscal year 2017. In addition, DOE, through its Office of Environmental  Management (EM), is responsible for decontaminating and  decommissioning nuclear facilities and sites that are contaminated from  decades of nuclear weapons production and nuclear energy research.  Since its inception in 1989, EM has spent over $164 billion on cleanup  efforts, including to retrieve, treat, and dispose of nuclear waste.", "Since the end of the Cold War, key portions of the nuclear security  enterprise\u2019s weapons production infrastructure have aged and become  outdated, prompting congressional and executive branch decision makers  to call on DOE to develop plans to modernize this infrastructure. The  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) 2010 Nuclear Posture Review identified  long-term modernization goals and requirements, including sustaining a  safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal through increasing  investments to rebuild and modernize the nation\u2019s nuclear infrastructure,  some of which dates back to the 1940s. In fiscal year 2011, the  administration pledged over $88 billion to NNSA over 10 years for  operations and modernization, including the refurbishment of weapons in  the current stockpile and the construction of facilities to support these  refurbishments. In January 2017, the President directed the Secretary of  Defense to initiate a new Nuclear Posture Review to ensure that the  United States nuclear deterrent is modern, robust, flexible, resilient,  ready, and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and  reassure our allies.", "To support its modernization and cleanup missions, DOE relies primarily  on contractors to carry out its programs. DOE is the largest civilian  contracting agency in the federal government and spends approximately  90 percent of its $32 billion in funding (in fiscal year 2017) on contracts  and large capital asset projects. We designated DOE\u2019s contract  management\u2014which has included both contract administration and  project management\u2014as a high-risk area in 1990 because DOE\u2019s record  of inadequate management and oversight of contractors had left it  vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.", "Reports we have issued over the past several years have highlighted  various challenges that NNSA and EM continue to face in carrying out  their mission-related responsibilities, including challenges in contract and  project management that relate to NNSA\u2019s modernization activities and  EM\u2019s cleanup efforts. In our 2017 high-risk update, we reported that  NNSA and EM continued to demonstrate a strong commitment and top  leadership support to improve contract and project management\u2014a key  criterion for removing agencies and program areas from our High-Risk  List. However, we also found that DOE still needs to make more  progress on the other four criteria for removal: organizational capacity,  corrective action planning, monitoring effectiveness, and demonstrating  progress. Our high-risk update also noted that NNSA and EM continued  to struggle to stay within cost and schedule estimates for some of their  major projects.", "As NNSA works to modernize the nuclear security enterprise, EM must  address the legacy of 70 years of nuclear weapons production and  energy research by DOE and its predecessor agencies. These activities  generated large amounts of radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, excess  plutonium and uranium, and contaminated soil and groundwater. They  also resulted in thousands of contaminated facilities, including land,  buildings, and other structures and their systems and equipment. Various  federal laws, agreements with states, and court decisions require the  federal government to clean up environmental hazards at federal sites  and facilities\u2014such as nuclear weapons production facilities. DOE\u2019s  approaches to addressing its environmental liabilities and cleaning up the  contamination from past activities are often influenced by numerous site- specific factors, stakeholder agreements, and legal provisions. For years,  we and others have reported on shortcomings in DOE\u2019s approach to  addressing its environmental responsibilities, including incomplete data  on the extent of cleanup needed, and in 2017 we added federal  environmental liabilities to our High-Risk List\u2014over 80 percent of these  liabilities are DOE\u2019s responsibility. In our 2017 high-risk update, we  reported that because of incomplete information and often inconsistent  approaches to making cleanup decisions, DOE does not always approach  environmental cleanup using a risk-informed approach to reduce health  and safety risks in a cost effective manner.", "My testimony today discusses (1) challenges related to the affordability of  NNSA\u2019s nuclear modernization programs, (2) the status of DOE\u2019s efforts  to improve its management of contracts and projects, (3) challenges in  addressing DOE\u2019s environmental liabilities, and (4) challenges facing  NNSA\u2019s nonproliferation programs.

In this report, we identified two areas of misalignment  between NNSA\u2019s modernization plans and the estimated budgetary  resources needed to carry out those plans, which could result in  challenges to NNSA in affording its planned portfolio of modernization  programs. First, we found that NNSA\u2019s estimates of funding needed for its  modernization plans sometimes exceeded the budgetary projections  included in the President\u2019s planned near- and long-term modernization  budgets. In the near-term (fiscal years 2018 through 2021), we found that  NNSA may have to defer certain modernization work beyond that time  period in order to execute its program within the planned budget, which  could increase modernization costs and schedule risks. This is a pattern  we have previously identified as a \u201cbow wave\u201d\u2014an increase in future  years\u2019 estimated budget needs that occurs when agencies are  undertaking more programs than their resources can support. In the long- term (fiscal years 2022 through 2026), we found that NNSA\u2019s  modernization program budget estimates sometimes exceeded the  projected budgetary resources planned for inclusion in the President\u2019s  budget, raising additional questions about whether NNSA will be able to  afford the scope of its modernization program. Second, the costs of some  major modernization programs\u2014such as for nuclear weapon  refurbishments\u2014may also increase and further strain future  modernization budgets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Misalignment between Estimates and Plans May Result in Increased Cost and Schedule Risks and Raises Affordability Concerns", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in April 2017, NNSA estimates of funding needed for its  modernization plans sometimes exceeded the budgetary projections  included in the President\u2019s planned near- and long-term modernization  budgets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Near-term Misalignment between Modernization Plans and Estimated Budgetary Resources", "paragraphs": ["We found that NNSA may have to defer certain modernization work  planned for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 beyond its current 5-year  planning period, called the Future-Years Nuclear Security Program  (FYNSP). As we reported in April 2017, this is caused by a misalignment  between NNSA\u2019s budget estimates for certain nuclear modernization  programs and the President\u2019s budgets for that period. We concluded that  this deferral could exacerbate a significant bow wave of modernization  funding needs that NNSA projects for the out-years beyond the FYNSP  and could potentially increase modernization costs and schedule risks. As  we have previously reported, such bow waves occur when agencies defer  costs of their programs to the future, beyond their programming periods,  and they often occur when agencies are undertaking more programs than  their resources can support. As NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget  materials show, its modernization budget estimates for fiscal years 2022  through 2026\u2014the first 5 years beyond the FYNSP\u2014may require  significant funding increases. For example, in fiscal year 2022, NNSA\u2019s  estimates of its modernization budget needs are projected to rise about 7  percent compared with the budget estimates for fiscal year 2021, the last  year of the FYNSP, as shown in figure 1.", "The analysis in our April 2017 report showed that NNSA has shifted this  modernization bow wave to the period beyond the FYNSP time frame in  each of the past four versions of the annual Stockpile Stewardship and  Management Plan. For example, in the Fiscal Year 2014 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan, NNSA\u2019s budget estimates for its  modernization programs increased from a total of about $9.3 billion in  fiscal year 2018, the last year of the FYNSP, to about $10.5 billion in  fiscal year 2019, the first year after the FYNSP\u2014an increase of about 13  percent. Similar patterns showing a jump in funding needs immediately  after the last year of the FYNSP are repeated in the funding profiles  contained in the fiscal year 2015, 2016, and 2017 plans. As we have  previously reported, deferring more work to future years can increase cost  and schedule risks and can put programs in the position of potentially  facing a backlog of deferred work that grows beyond what can be  accommodated in future years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-term Misalignment between Modernization Plans and Estimated Budgetary Resources", "paragraphs": ["The Fiscal Year 2017 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan  shows that NNSA\u2019s overall modernization budget estimates for fiscal  years 2022 through 2026\u2014the out-years beyond the FYNSP\u2014may  exceed the projected funding levels in the President\u2019s budgets for that  time period, raising further questions about the affordability of NNSA\u2019s  nuclear modernization plans. According to NNSA\u2019s data, the agency\u2019s  estimated budget needed to support modernization totals about $58.4  billion for fiscal years 2022 through 2026, and the out-year funding  projections contained in the President\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget for the  same period total about $55.5 billion. The President\u2019s out-year funding  projections, therefore, are approximately $2.9 billion, or about 5.2  percent, less than NNSA estimates it will need over the same time period.", "Despite this potential shortfall, NNSA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2017 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan concludes that the modernization  program is generally affordable in the years beyond the FYNSP for two  reasons. First, the President\u2019s out-year funding projections are sufficient  to support NNSA\u2019s low-range cost estimates for its modernization  programs for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. Based on NNSA data, the  low-range cost estimates for fiscal years 2022 through 2026 total  approximately $54.4 billion and the President\u2019s out-year funding  projections total about $55.5 billion. Figure 2 illustrates data from the  2017 plan showing NNSA\u2019s nominal budget estimates, including high-  and low-range cost estimates for its modernization program, along with  the out-year funding projections from the President\u2019s fiscal year 2017  budget, for fiscal years 2022 to 2026. Second, NNSA concludes that its  modernization programs are generally affordable beyond the FYNSP  because the agency\u2019s estimated modernization budget needs will begin to  decrease in fiscal year 2027.", "In our April 2017 report, we noted that NNSA\u2019s conclusion\u2014that its  modernization program is affordable because the President\u2019s out-year  funding projections fall within NNSA\u2019s modernization cost ranges\u2014is  overly optimistic. This is because NNSA\u2019s conclusion is predicated on  optimistic assumptions regarding the cost of the modernization program  beyond the FYNSP, particularly for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. For  the program to be affordable, NNSA\u2019s modernization programs would  need to be collectively executed at the low end of their estimated cost  ranges. The plan does not discuss any options NNSA would pursue to  support or modify its modernization program if costs exceeded its low- range cost estimates. In addition, the Fiscal Year 2017 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan states that the nominal cost of  NNSA\u2019s modernization program is expected to decrease by  approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2027. In that year, according to the  2017 plan, it is anticipated that NNSA\u2019s estimated budgets for its  modernization program will begin to fall in line with projections of future  presidential budgets. However, as we noted in our April 2017 report, the  decrease that NNSA anticipates in its modernization funding needs  beginning in fiscal year 2027 may not be achievable if the projected  mismatch between NNSA\u2019s estimates of its modernization budget needs  and the projections of the President\u2019s modernization budget for fiscal  years 2022 through 2026 is not resolved. This mismatch creates  concerns that NNSA will not be able to afford planned modernization  costs during fiscal years 2022 through 2026 and will be forced to defer  them to fiscal year 2027 and beyond, continuing the bow wave patterns  discussed above."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Rising Costs of Some Modernization Programs May Further Strain NNSA\u2019s Modernization Budgets", "paragraphs": ["Our April 2017 report identified misalignment between NNSA\u2019s estimate  of its budget needs and NNSA\u2019s internal cost range estimates for several  of its major modernization programs.

However, for some years, NNSA\u2019s low-range cost  estimates exceeded the budget estimates for some of the programs,  suggesting the potential for a funding shortfall for those programs in those  years. Specifically, we found that the low-range cost estimates for the  W88 Alteration 370 program and all LEPs discussed in our April 2017  report exceeded their budget estimates for some fiscal years within the  10-year time period from fiscal year 2017 to 2026.

DOE did not follow all best practices in  analyzing and selecting an alternative for the new ventilation system  at WIPP, which DOE estimated will cost between $270 million and  $398 million to build and will be completed by the end of March 2021.  For example, DOE did not select the preferred alternative based on  assessing the difference between the life-cycle costs and benefits of  each alternative, as called for by best practices and now required by  DOE\u2019s revised project management order. We recommended that  DOE require projects, including the WIPP ventilation system, to  implement recommendations from independent analysis of  alternatives reviews or document the reasons for not doing so.

However, meaningful cost analyses across  programs, contractors, and sites are not possible because NNSA\u2019s  contractors use different methods of accounting for and tracking costs.  NNSA developed a plan to improve and integrate its cost reporting  structures; however, we found in our January 2017 report that this plan  did not provide a useful road map for guiding NNSA\u2019s effort.

The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 establishes  requirements aimed at improving federal agencies\u2019 controls and  procedures for assessing and mitigating fraud risks through the use of  data analytics. In our March 2017 report, however, we found that because  DOE does not require its contractors to maintain sufficiently detailed  transaction-level cost data that are reconcilable with amounts charged to  DOE, it is not well positioned to employ data analytics as a fraud  detection tool. The data were not suitable either because they were not  for a complete universe of transactions that was reconcilable with  amounts billed to DOE or because they were not sufficiently detailed to  determine the nature of costs charged to DOE. We concluded that,  without requiring contractors to maintain such data, DOE will not be well  positioned to meet the requirements of the Fraud Reduction and Data  Analytics Act of 2015 and manage its risk of fraud and other improper  payments. We recommended that DOE require contractors to maintain  sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data that are reconcilable with  amounts charged to the government. DOE did not concur with our  recommendation. Specifically, DOE stated that the recommendation  establishes agency-specific requirements for DOE contractors that are  more prescriptive than current federal requirements and that its M&O  contractors, not DOE, are responsible for performing data analytics and  determining what data are needed to do so. We are concerned that  DOE\u2019s response demonstrates that it does not fully appreciate its  responsibility for overseeing contractor costs. We continue to believe that  the use of data-analytic techniques by DOE employees could help  mitigate some of the challenges that limit the effectiveness of DOE\u2019s  approach for overseeing M&O contractor costs. However, effectively  applying data-analytics is dependent upon the availability of complete and  sufficiently detailed contractor data.

This approach helps federal  agencies get what they need, at the right time, and at a reasonable price.  However, in 2016 we found that DOE had not established a department- wide program management policy and that DOE had not established a  career development program for program managers. Specifically,  In an August 2016 report examining NNSA\u2019s plans to build the CMRR,  we found that the agency had not clarified whether the project would  satisfy the mission needs of other NNSA and DOE programs. NNSA  might have been better able to clarify this project\u2019s mission needs if  DOE and NNSA had been operating under a DOE-wide program  management policy incorporating leading practices. DOE and NNSA  officials said they recognize the importance of establishing a program  management policy, but at the time DOE had not done so. We  recommended that DOE establish a program management policy that  addresses internal control standards and leading practices. DOE  provided no comments on our recommendation. After we issued our  report, the President signed the 2016 Program Management  Improvement Accountability Act, which requires the development of  standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project  management across the federal government. We will continue to  monitor and report on the Act\u2019s implementation as part of our biennial  high risk updates, and we will also include an assessment of the  effectiveness of the standards, policies, and guidelines that are to be  developed.", "In a November 2016 report, we found that DOE and NNSA had not  established training programs, such as a career development  program, for program managers. Program managers are  responsible for interacting with project managers to provide support  and guidance on individual projects, but they also must take a broad  view of program objectives and organizational culture. In contrast,  DOE had established a training program for project managers, which  DOE said was open to program managers. In the absence of a  current DOE or NNSA training program for program managers, most  of the NNSA program managers we interviewed did not have training  related to program management. As a result, we concluded that  NNSA may have difficulty developing and maintaining a cadre of  professional, effective, and capable program managers.

Specifically, DOE has taken action on certain major projects, but has not  consistently applied these reforms, and in particular, DOE has not applied  such reforms to its largest legacy cleanup project at its Hanford Site in  Washington state. As we found in a May 2015 report, DOE continues to  allow construction of certain Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant  (WTP) facilities at DOE\u2019s Hanford Site before designs are 90 percent  complete. This contrasts with DOE\u2019s revised project management order  that now requires a facility\u2019s design to be at least 90 percent complete  before establishing cost and schedule baselines and cost and schedule  estimates that meet industry best practices. The WTP is DOE\u2019s largest  project, and it has faced numerous technical and management challenges  that have added decades to its schedule and billions of dollars to its cost.  We recommended in May 2015 that DOE (1) consider whether to limit  construction on the WTP until risk mitigation strategies are developed to  address known technical challenges, and (2) determine the extent to  which the quality problems exist, in accordance with its quality assurance  policy, for the facilities\u2019 systems that have not been reviewed to determine  if additional vulnerabilities exist. However, as of September 2016, DOE  has not yet implemented our recommendations. Notably, after we issued  our report, DOE announced in December 2016 that the cost estimate for  one portion of the WTP\u2014the part needed to treat a fraction of the low- activity waste\u2014had increased to nearly $17 billion. This cost estimate  does not include the costs for a majority of the WTP\u2019s waste treatment  scope, including high-level waste treatment.

In July 2016, we examined DOE\u2019s  effort to evaluate the environment for raising concerns without fear of  reprisal. We found, among other things, that DOE used flawed and  inconsistent methodologies to evaluate the environment for raising safety  and other concerns and therefore could not reliably judge its openness or  ensure that appropriate action was taken in response to evaluation  results. We noted that several factors may limit the use and effectiveness  of mechanisms for contractor employees to raise concerns and seek  whistleblower protections. We also found that DOE infrequently used its  enforcement authority to hold contractors accountable for unlawful  retaliation against whistleblowers, issuing just two violation notices in the  past 20 years. Additionally, in 2013, DOE determined that it did not have  the authority to enforce a key aspect of policies that prohibit retaliation for  nuclear safety-related issues\u2014despite having taken such enforcement  actions in the past.

Specifically, we found that the federal  government\u2019s environmental liability has been growing for the past 20  years\u2014and is likely to continue to increase\u2014and that DOE is responsible  for over 80 percent ($372 billion) of the nearly $450 billion reported  environmental liability. Notably, this estimate does not reflect all of the  future cleanup responsibilities that DOE may face. In addition, DOE has  not consistently taken a risk-informed approach to decision-making for  environmental cleanup, and DOE may therefore be missing opportunities  to reduce costs while also reducing environmental risks more quickly. Our  recent work in this area has also identified opportunities where DOE may  be able to save tens of billions of dollars.", "DOE\u2019s total reported environmental liability has generally increased over  time. Since 1989, EM has spent over $164 billion to retrieve, treat, and  dispose of nuclear and hazardous waste and to date has completed  cleanup at 91 of 107 sites across the country (the 91 sites were generally  viewed by DOE as the smallest and least contaminated sites to address).  Despite billions spent on environmental cleanup, DOE\u2019s environmental  liability has roughly doubled from a low of $176 billion in fiscal year 1997  to the fiscal year 2016 estimate of $372 billion. In the last 6 years alone,  EM has spent $35 billion, primarily to treat and dispose of nuclear and  hazardous waste and construct capital asset projects to treat the waste  (see figure 3 for EM\u2019s annual spending and growing environmental  liability). According to documents related to DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2016  financial statements, 50 percent of DOE\u2019s environmental liability resides  at two cleanup sites: the Hanford Site in Washington State and the  Savannah River Site in South Carolina.", "In its fiscal year 2016 financial statement, DOE attributed recent  environmental liability increases to (1) inflation adjustments for the current  year; (2) improved and updated estimates for the same scope of work,  including changes resulting from deferral or acceleration of work; (3)  revisions in technical approach or scope for cleanup activities; and (4)  regulatory and legal changes. Notably, in recent annual financial reports,  DOE has cited other significant causes for increases in its liability. Other  causes have included the lack of a disposal path for high-level radioactive  waste\u2014because of the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository  program \u2014and delays and scope changes for major construction projects  at the Hanford and Savannah River sites.", "We also reported in February 2017 that DOE\u2019s estimated liability does not  include billions in expected costs. According to federal accounting  standards, environmental liability estimates should include costs that are  probable and reasonably estimable, meaning that costs that cannot yet  be reasonably estimated should not be included in total environmental  liability. Examples of costs that DOE cannot yet estimate include the  following:", "DOE has not yet developed a cleanup plan or cost estimate for the  Nevada National Security Site and, as a result, the cost of future  cleanup of this site was not included in DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2015  reported environmental liability. The nearly 1,400-square-mile site has  been used for hundreds of nuclear weapons tests since 1951. These  activities have resulted in more than 45 million cubic feet of  radioactive waste at the site. According to DOE\u2019s financial statement,  since DOE is not yet required to establish a plan to clean up the site,  the costs for this work are excluded from DOE\u2019s annually reported  environmental liability.", "DOE\u2019s reported environmental liability includes an estimate for the  cost of a permanent nuclear waste repository, but these estimates are  highly uncertain and likely to increase. In March 2015, in response to  the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository program, DOE  proposed separate repositories for defense high-level and commercial  waste. In January 2017, we reported that the cost estimate for DOE\u2019s  new approach excluded the costs and time frames for key activities.  As a result, the full cost of these activities is likely billions of dollars  more than what is reflected in DOE\u2019s environmental liability. In our  annual report on Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication in the  federal government that we issued in May 2017, we reported that  DOE may be able to save billions of dollars by reassessing the  rationale for its March 2015 proposal. In April 2017, the House of  Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce disseminated  a discussion draft of legislation that could result in renewed efforts to  open the Yucca Mountain repository.", "In addition, DOE may have insufficient controls in place to accurately  account for its environmental liabilities. In January 2017, the DOE  Inspector General reported a significant deficiency in internal controls  related to the reconciliation of environmental liabilities.", "Moreover, DOE does not consistently take a risk-informed decision- making approach to its environmental cleanup mission to more efficiently  use resources. As our and other organizations\u2019 reports issued over the  last 2 decades have found, DOE\u2019s environmental cleanup decisions have  not been risk-based, and there have been inconsistencies in the  regulatory approaches followed at different sites. We and others have  pointed out that DOE needs to take a nation-wide, risk-based approach to  cleaning up these sites, which could reduce costs while also reducing  environmental risks more quickly.", "In 2006, the National Research Council reported that the nation\u2019s  approach to cleaning up nuclear waste\u2014primarily carried out by  DOE\u2014was complex, inconsistent, and not systematically risk- based. For example, the National Research Council noted that the  current regulatory structure for low-activity waste is based primarily on  the waste\u2019s origins rather than on its actual radiological risks. The  National Research Council concluded that by working with regulators,  public authorities, and local citizens to implement risk-informed  practices, waste cleanup efforts can be done more cost-effectively.  The report also suggested that statutory changes were likely needed.", "In 2015, a review organized by the Consortium for Risk Evaluation  with Stakeholder Participation reported that DOE was not optimally  using available resources to reduce risk. According to the report,  factors such as inconsistent regulatory approaches and certain  requirements in federal facility agreements caused disproportionate  resources to be directed at lower-priority risks. The report called for a  more systematic effort to assess and rank risks within and among  sites, including through headquarters guidance to sites, and to  allocate federal taxpayer monies to remedy the highest priority risks  through the most efficient means.", "In May 2017, we reported on DOE\u2019s efforts to treat a significant  portion of the tank waste at the Hanford Site. We found that DOE  chose different approaches to treat the less radioactive portion of its  tank waste\u2014which DOE refers to as \u201clow-activity waste\u201d (LAW)\u2014at  the Hanford and Savannah River Sites. At the Savannah River Site,  DOE has grouted about 4 million gallons of LAW since 2007. DOE  plans to treat a portion of the Hanford Site\u2019s LAW with vitrification, but  it has not has not yet treated any of Hanford\u2019s LAW and faces  significant unresolved technical challenges in doing so. In addition,  we found that the best available information indicates that DOE\u2019s  estimated costs to grout LAW at the Savannah River Site are  substantially lower than its estimated costs to vitrify LAW at Hanford,  and DOE may be able to save tens of billions of dollars by  reconsidering its waste treatment approach for a portion of the LAW at  Hanford. Moreover, according to the 21 experts that attended our  meeting convened by the National Academies of Sciences,  Engineering, and Medicine, both vitrification and grout could  effectively treat Hanford\u2019s LAW. Experts at our meeting also stated  that developing updated information on the effectiveness of treating a  portion of Hanford\u2019s waste, called supplemental LAW, with other  methods, such as grout, may enable DOE to consider waste  treatment approaches that would accelerate DOE\u2019s tank waste  treatment mission, thereby potentially reducing certain risks and  lifecycle treatment costs. We recommended that DOE (1) develop  updated information on the performance of treating supplemental  LAW with alternate methods, such as grout, before it selects an  approach for treating supplemental LAW; and (2) have an  independent entity develop updated information on the lifecycle costs  of treating Hanford\u2019s supplemental LAW with alternate methods. DOE  agreed with both recommendations.", "Since 1994, we have made at least 28 recommendations related to  addressing the federal government\u2019s environmental liability and 4  recommendations to Congress to consider changes to the laws governing  cleanup activities. Of these, 13 recommendations remain unimplemented.  If implemented, these steps would improve the completeness and  reliability of the estimated costs of DOE\u2019s future cleanup responsibilities  and lead to more risk-based management of the cleanup work.

NNSA\u2019s request stated that its  MOX fuel approach for disposing of 34 tons of weapons-grade  plutonium will be significantly more expensive than anticipated and  will require approximately $800 million to $1 billion annually for  decades. Instead, NNSA proposed to focus on a new alternative to  dilute the surplus plutonium and dispose of the material in a geologic  repository. We have ongoing work examining the MOX facility and the  extent to which WIPP has sufficient capacity to dispose of this  quantity of plutonium. Specifically, we are assessing the extent to  which DOE\u2019s revised $17.2 billion cost estimate for completing  construction of the MOX facility, and the $56 billion revised life-cycle  estimate for completing the Plutonium Disposition Program using the  MOX approach, met cost-estimating best practices. In addition, we  are examining the status of NNSA\u2019s development of a life-cycle cost  estimate for completing the Plutonium Disposition Program using the  dilute and dispose approach.

Under this program,  NSDD may not be able to determine when it has fully accomplished  its mission and risks continuing to deploy equipment past the point of  diminishing returns. NSDD also faces challenges in performing its  work that are outside of its control, such as the changing conditions in  partner countries from conflict or political upheaval. We recommended  that NSDD develop a more detailed program plan that articulates  when and how it will achieve its goals, including completing key  activities such as the deployment of radiation detection equipment to  partner countries and having these countries fully fund the  sustainment and maintenance of this equipment. NNSA agreed with  this recommendation.", "In February 2017, we found that NNSA was unable to demonstrate  the full results of its research and development technology for  preventing nuclear proliferation. Specifically, we reported that DNN\u2019s  Research and Development program does not consistently track and  document projects that result in technologies being transitioned or  deployed. Furthermore, we found that DNN\u2019s Research and  Development project performance is difficult to interpret because the  program\u2019s performance measures do not define criteria or provide  context justifying how the program determined that it met its targets.  This, in turn, could hinder users\u2019 ability to determine the program\u2019s  progress. NNSA officials said that final project reports do not  document their assessment of performance against baseline targets  and that there is no common template for final project reports. We  noted that documenting assessments that compare final project  performance results against baseline targets for scope of work and  completion date could enhance NNSA\u2019s ability to manage its  programs in accordance with these standards. More consistently  tracking and documenting the transitioned and deployed technologies  that result from DNN\u2019s projects could also facilitate knowledge sharing  within DNN, and would provide a means by which to present valuable  information to Congress and other decision makers about the  programs\u2019 results and overall value.
