Its mission is to support the export of U.S.  goods and services overseas, through the provision of loans, loan  guarantees, and insurance, thereby supporting U.S. jobs. Ex-Im is  generally prohibited by law from financing any credit sale of defense  articles and services for any country. However, in an exception to this  rule, Ex-Im was granted authority to facilitate the financing of U.S. exports  of defense articles and services, provided that it determines that these  items are nonlethal and primarily meant for civilian end use. Such items  are known as dual-use exports.", "Ex-Im\u2019s Engineering and Environment Division, with assistance from the  General Counsel, Congressional and External Affairs Division, and the  Policy and Planning Division, is responsible for implementing the dual-use  authority. According to Ex-Im\u2019s Military Policy, its definitions of \u201cdefense  articles\u201d and \u201cdefense services\u201d are based on who the end user is, and  then by the nature of the item and the use to which it will be put. In  addition, if the item is designed primarily for military use, it is presumed to  be a defense article. For example, according to Ex-Im, furniture sold to a  military organization for military use (e.g., for offices or homes occupied  by military personnel) is deemed a defense article. However, according to  Ex-Im, helicopters sold to a private firm or civilian police force are not  defense articles. According to Ex-Im policy, an export is eligible for  financing as a dual-use item if convincing evidence exists that the export  is nonlethal in nature and will be used mainly for civilian activities. The  determination of eligibility for dual-use financing may require applicants  for Ex-Im financing to provide additional information beyond the contract  and transaction data the bank normally requires for a loan or guarantee.  For example, before approving the three fiscal year 2012 dual-use export  transactions, Ex-Im obtained written certification from each borrower that  the items to be exported were nonlethal and would be primarily for civilian  use. Ex-Im may also seek to corroborate the information submitted by  applicants by contacting other U.S. government agencies, such as the  Department of State.", "Eutelsat, primarily for telecommunications  (television and internet service). Ex-Im is  treating this item as dual-use because a  small portion of the satellite is being used  by the Qatari military for communications  purposes and is not being financed by Ex- Im.", "3.  150 pieces of new and used construction equipment from U.S.  manufacturers exported by Hoffman International, Inc., for the  government of Cameroon.", "Three satellites for the government of  Mexico: one fixed service satellite and  two mobile service satellites. Fixed  service satellites provide service to a  geographically fixed end user, such as a  television station, and mobile service  satellites provide service to mobile end  users, such as personnel in vehicles. The  satellites are for civilian communications  and for humanitarian and drug interdiction  operations by the Mexican military.", "These three transactions accounted for $1.03 billion in Ex-Im financing, or  just under 3 percent of Ex-Im\u2019s financing for fiscal year 2012 of $35.8  billion. The Mexico satellite transaction is the bank\u2019s single largest dual- use financing transaction to date, with a loan guarantee of $922 million.  Prior to approving the fiscal year 2012 transactions, Ex-Im vetted the  Eutelsat and Cameroon transactions with the Department of State, and  vetted the Mexico transaction with the U.S. embassy military attach\u00e9 in  Mexico. government of Cameroon\u2019s military  engineering corps for civilian infrastructure  development and a small number of  military construction projects.", "Ex-Im generally requires buyers of dual-use exports to submit an annual  \u201cend-use certification and report,\u201d which describes the civilian and military  use of the exported item(s) and includes a certification by the buyer that  the item(s) are being used primarily for civilian purposes. In addition,  credit and guarantee agreements for dual-use transactions may include  provisions for annual, semiannual, or periodic \u201cprogress reports\u201d and  \u201ctechnical operating reports\u201d to monitor the status and usage of the items.  Such information helps inform bank officials and provides them greater  assurance about the exports\u2019 end use. These reports are to be submitted  to Ex-Im until the loan or guarantee is repaid. According to Ex-Im officials,  the credit agreements for the three fiscal year 2012 dual-use transactions  were negotiated on a case-by-case basis to incorporate the specific  circumstances related to the buyer and the item(s) being exported. The  agreements with the governments of Mexico and Cameroon require an  annual end-use certification and report. The agreements for the two  satellite transactions require the buyer (Eutelsat and the government of  Mexico) to submit to Ex-Im (1) periodic progress reports covering the  satellite(s)\u2019 construction, launch, and in-orbit testing, and (2) technical  operating reports that include information concerning the operation and  maintenance of the satellite(s) and related telemetry, tracking and  command stations, and transponder capacity and use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ex-Im Revised and Implemented Guidance to Address Weaknesses in Monitoring the End Use of Dual-Use Items", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im addressed weaknesses in monitoring the end use of dual-use  items by revising and implementing its guidance for monitoring these  items, consistent with our August 2014 recommendation.

The revised memorandum adds to the  responsibilities of Ex-Im staff for monitoring the end use of exported dual- use items after the bank\u2019s board of directors has authorized an export  transaction.

The engineer is to communicate with the bank\u2019s Asset  Management Division\u2013-Ex-Im\u2019s primary contact with the buyer after  the bank approves the transaction\u2013-to ensure that a process is  established to notify the buyer in advance of any reporting due to be  submitted to the bank. The memorandum specifies that if a dual-use  report or related document becomes overdue, the assigned engineer,  in conjunction with the asset management officer, will notify the buyer  and alert the bank\u2019s Office of the General Counsel within 30 days of  the date when the report or related information was due so that  appropriate action can be taken to expedite the submission of the  required information.", "Document monitoring activities.

Should  the engineer determine or become concerned that the dual-use  transaction is or may be out of compliance with these requirements,  the engineer should notify the Vice President of the Engineering and  Environment Division, who oversees the monitoring of dual-use  transactions, and other Ex-Im officials; these determinations and any  such referrals and related correspondence should be documented in  the electronic files."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ex-Im Has Implemented the Revised Guidance", "paragraphs": ["We found that the engineers responsible for monitoring the three fiscal  year 2012 dual-use transactions financed by Ex-Im had taken the actions  called for in the revised dual-use policy memorandum."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ex-Im Has Notified Buyers of Documentation Deadlines", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with its revised guidance, Ex-Im has established an  internal e-mail reminder system that automatically alerts the appropriate  Ex-Im officials to notify the buyer that the annual end-use certification and  report is coming due.

As a  result, Ex-Im received the 2014 end-use certification and report from each  of these governments in a timely manner. Ex-Im also received on time  any applicable progress and technical operating reports for the fiscal year  2012 dual-use transactions. For a summary of the reports required in the  financing agreements, their due dates, and when they were received, see  figure 1.", "While Ex-Im\u2019s financing agreement with the government of Mexico calls  for separate progress and technical operating reports for each satellite,  Ex-Im officials decided to allow the government of Mexico to combine the  progress reports for the two Mexican satellites that are not yet operational  with the technical operating report for the one satellite already in use. The  Vice President for Engineering and Environment approved this decision,  and the engineer responsible for monitoring the transaction documented  it. The combined report adheres to the timing specified in the Mexico  financing agreement for the progress reports and exceeds the timing  specified for technical operating reports. Submitting one combined report  means that the technical operating report is submitted more frequently  than required\u2013-twice a year instead of annually, according to Ex-Im  officials.

The engineer monitoring the Cameroon transaction  conducted a detailed analysis of equipment usage data within the  2014 calendar year in Cameroon\u2019s end-use certification and report  and determined that the use of the equipment was overwhelmingly  civilian in nature and thus met the bank\u2019s dual-use requirement of  being used primarily for civilian purposes. After meeting with military  officials during a trip to Cameroon in early June 2015 and inspecting  their operations, visiting current projects and assessing current and  future needs, the engineer confirmed his determination that the use of  the equipment was overwhelmingly civilian in nature.", "Mexico. The engineer monitoring the Mexico transaction determined  that, while all three satellites are not yet fully operational, the  government of Mexico continues to project a ground terminal  allocation of 40 percent military and 60 percent civilian as the basis for  its dual-use compliance. The Mexican government submitted an  annual end-use certification and report for 2014 listing the civilian and  military entities to which a total of 115,424 terminals would be  allocated and the number of terminals allocated to each entity; 46,324  (40 percent) were allocated to military entities. This information is  identical to that submitted by the Mexican government for 2013. Ex-Im  officials stated that any end-use monitoring the bank might conduct  would likely involve meeting with the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Mexico  and obtaining information from a small sample of terminals. The  officials acknowledged that once all the satellites are operational, it  will be very difficult to ascertain actual end use, since that would  involve monitoring over 100,000 ground terminals, obtaining logs  showing bandwidth usage, and examining the bandwidth use  associated with each terminal. They said the engineer responsible for  monitoring this transaction would instead base his annual  determination on the percentage of ground terminals allocated to  military entities, although they identified limitations with using this  percentage measure. However, the officials said that, based on pre- approval vetting with the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Mexico, the bank  determined that it is highly unlikely that the satellites would be used  for mostly military purposes. According to the bank\u2019s board  memorandum authorizing the Mexico satellite transaction, and as we  noted in our August 2014 report, the Mexican Secretariat of  Communications and Transportation\u2013-and not the Mexican military\u2013-is  operating the satellites.", "One of the mobile service satellites was destroyed during a failed  launch in May 2015, leaving two satellites\u2013-the fixed service satellite  launched in 2012 and already in use, and one more mobile service  satellite with a planned launch in the fall of 2015. According to the  engineer, the three-satellite system requires only one mobile service  satellite to operate at a time, with the other functioning as a spare; the  two mobile service satellites would thus be able to exchange  operational and spare roles as needed. He said the government of  Mexico has not yet determined whether to replace the destroyed  satellite.", "Eutelsat. No annual determination regarding end use is required for  the Eutelsat transaction because, as we noted in our August 2014  report, once the satellite became airborne in 2013, the number and  capacity (bandwidth) of the military transponders on the satellite could  not be modified. As we previously reported, these transponders,  which are dedicated to nonlethal military use by the government of  Qatar, were not financed by Ex-Im and represent only 6 of the  satellite\u2019s 46 transponders and less than half its total transponder  capacity. A senior Ex-Im official stated that if Eutelsat were to sell any  of its transponders on the satellite to the Qatari government\u2013-thereby  increasing the number of transponders that could potentially be used  by that government\u2019s military for military purposes\u2013-the French  company would have to report this information in its technical  operating report and in financial reports required in its credit  agreement with the bank.
