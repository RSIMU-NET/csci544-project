The review was  conducted as part of our audit of the FDIC financial statements of the  Deposit Insurance Fund and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance  Corporation Resolution Fund.", "The scope of our audit included an examination of FDIC information  security policies, plans, and controls over key financial systems in order  to (1) assess the effectiveness of corrective actions taken by FDIC to  address weaknesses we previously reported and (2) determine whether  any additional weaknesses existed. This work was performed in support  of our opinion on internal control over financial reporting as it relates to  our audits of the calendar year 2015 and 2014 financial statements of the  two funds administered by FDIC.", "We evaluated and tested certain FDIC information systems controls,  including the follow-up on the status of FDIC\u2019s corrective actions during  calendar year 2015 to address open recommendations from our prior  years\u2019 reports.", "To determine whether controls over key financial systems and information  were effective, we considered the results of FDIC\u2019s actions to mitigate  previously-reported weaknesses that remained open as of December 31,  2014 and performed audit work at FDIC facilities in Arlington, Virginia.", "We concentrated our evaluation primarily on the controls for systems and  applications associated with financial processing, such as the 1) New  Financial Environment (NFE); 2) Communication, Capability, Challenge,  and Control System (4C); 3) Portfolio Investment Accounting (PORTIA);  4) Assessment Information Management System (AIMS); 5) programs,  data, and systems supporting the preparation of the estimates of losses  and costs due to shared loss agreements; 6) and general support  systems. Our selection of the systems to evaluate was based on  consideration of systems that directly or indirectly support the processing  of material transactions that are reflected in the funds\u2019 financial  statements.", "Our audit methodology was based on the Federal Information System  Controls Audit Manual, which contains guidance for reviewing  information system controls that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of computerized information.", "Using standards and guidance from the National Institute of Standards  and Technology as well as FDIC\u2019s policies and procedures, we evaluated  controls by  reviewing password settings to determine if password management  was being enforced in accordance with agency policy; analyzing user system authorizations to determine whether users had  more permissions than necessary to perform their assigned functions; observing methods for providing secure data transmissions to  determine whether sensitive data were being encrypted; assessing configuration settings to evaluate settings used to audit  security-relevant events; and  inspecting vulnerability scans for in-scope systems to determine  whether patches, service packs, and hot fixes were appropriately  installed on affected systems.", "Using the requirements of the Federal Information Security Modernization  Act of 2014, which establishes elements for an agency-wide information  security program, we evaluated FDIC\u2019s implementation of its security  program by examining an FDIC Office of Inspector General (OIG) report for  information on FDIC\u2019s implementation of risk management policies;  reviewing information security policies to determine whether they were  adequately documented and implemented; examining an FDIC OIG report for information on specialized training; reviewing assessments of security controls to determine if they had  been completed as scheduled;  reviewing an FDIC OIG report for information on the corporation\u2019s  information security continuous monitoring program; examining remedial action plans to determine whether FDIC had  addressed identified vulnerabilities in a timely manner; and examining an FDIC OIG report for information on findings related to  FDIC\u2019s remedial action process.", "We performed our work in accordance with U.S. generally accepted  government auditing standards. We believe that our audit work provided a  reasonable basis for our conclusion in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Gary Austin and Nick Marinos  (Assistant Directors), Rosanna Guerrero (Analyst in Charge), Nancy  Glover, Fatima Jahan, Franklin Jackson, Thomas J.
