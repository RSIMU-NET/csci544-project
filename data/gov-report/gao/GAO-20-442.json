This report examines the extent to which (1) the amounts reported in DOE's AFRs for fiscal years 2015 through 2019 were accurate and complete, and (2) its fiscal year 2018 risk assessment provided a reasonable basis for its risk determination. GAO reviewed DOE's improper payment reporting for fiscal years 2015 through 2019 and its fiscal year 2018 risk assessment, and reviewed documents and interviewed officials from 10 of 48 reporting sites selected to provide a range of sites and about half of fiscal year 2018 reported improper payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The improper payments amounts that the Department of Energy (DOE) reported in its annual agency financial reports (AFR) for fiscal years 2015 through 2019 may not be accurate or complete. Agencies with programs that are susceptible to significant improper payments\u2014including those with more than $100 million of improper payments in a year\u2014are required to report statistically valid estimates of their improper payments. DOE determined these requirements did not apply, but optionally reported information on actual improper payments it made and identified in the prior year. For example, in its fiscal year 2019 AFR, DOE reported fiscal year 2018 improper payments\u2014such as those made to contractors for unallowable costs\u2014totaling about $36 million, less than 0.1 percent of its outlays. However, DOE did not disclose that these amounts do not include improper payments identified through reviews, audits, and investigations completed several years after it issues its AFR (see figure). For example, as of September 2019, DOE had not audited $23.8 billion of its $38.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 outlays. Such audits may increase the improper payments in a year by millions of dollars. For example, based on a 2017 audit, DOE identified $34 million in fiscal year 2010 improper payments. DOE does not always track information on the year improper payments were made that would allow it to determine whether improper payments identified later would increase the total to more than $100 million. By tracking and disclosing such information, DOE could better inform Congress, the public, and others about whether it exceeded the $100 million threshold and should be subject to additional reporting requirements.", "DOE determined that its risk of significant improper payments was low in its fiscal year 2018 risk assessment. However, GAO found that the risk assessment may not provide a reasonable basis for DOE's determination. DOE did not provide sufficient documentation to support that it considered the known lag in identifying improper payments as an inherent risk, nor did it provide sufficient documentation to support its rationale for the scale it used to score risk factors or for weighting risk ratings of payment reporting sites. For example, a payment site processing $3 million of outlays had the same weight in the overall assessment as a payment site processing $5.7 billion of outlays. As a result, DOE cannot demonstrate that its low-risk determination is reasonable and that its risk assessment process produces reliable results."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making nine recommendations to DOE, including to track and disclose information on improper payments identified later and determine whether these payments exceeded $100 million in any year, and to revise its risk assessment process to ensure the process has a reasonable basis and reliable results. DOE agreed with six of the recommendations, but did not agree with three recommendations, including to revise its risk assessment process. GAO maintains that the recommended actions are valid."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Improper payments\u2014payments that under statutory, contractual,  administrative, or other legally applicable requirements should not have  been made or were made in an incorrect amount\u2014are a long-standing,  widespread, and significant problem in the federal government. As we  found in our most recent audit of the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated  financial statements, the federal government is unable to determine the  full extent to which improper payments occur and reasonably assure that  appropriate actions are taken to reduce them. Reducing improper  payments is critical to safeguarding federal funds.", "Federal agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), are subject  to statutory improper payment requirements established, until recently, in the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, as amended (IPIA). On  March 2, 2020, IPIA was repealed and replaced by the Payment Integrity  Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), which retains IPIAs core structure of  executive agency assessment, estimation, and reporting of improper  payments. IPIA required, among other things, that at least once every 3  years each federal agency review all of its programs and activities to  identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments\u2014 a process commonly referred to as an improper payment risk  assessment. Properly executed improper payment risk assessments are  the cornerstone of a government-wide effort to identify and reduce  improper payments. We previously reviewed DOE\u2019s improper payment  risk assessments and found in December 2014 that DOE\u2019s assessments  did not fully evaluate its risk. We recommended, among other things, that  DOE take steps to improve its risk assessments, including revising  guidance on how payment sites were to address risk factors, providing  examples of other risk factors likely to contribute to improper payments,  and directing payment sites to consider those factors. DOE updated its  guidance in May 2017 to address this recommendation.", "Under IPIA, improper payments were considered significant if in the  preceding fiscal year they might have exceeded either (1) 1.5 percent of  program outlays and $10 million, or (2) $100 million (regardless of the  improper payment rate). IPIA required agencies with programs  susceptible to significant improper payments to develop statistically valid  improper payment estimates and annually report on actions to reduce  improper payments, including a description of the causes of the improper  payments, actions planned or taken to correct those causes, and planned  or actual completion dates of the actions taken to address those causes.  In addition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may determine  on a case-by-case basis\u2014such as if an audit report or investigative result  raises questions about an agency\u2019s risk assessment or improper  payments results\u2014that certain programs that do not meet the threshold  for significant improper payments may still be subject to the more  stringent annual improper payment reporting requirements. Other federal  requirements that apply to DOE include OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C,  Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement (OMB M-18-20); OMB  Circular A-136; and internal DOE orders and directives that address  financial management oversight.", "DOE is the largest civilian contracting agency in the federal government.  According to information provided by DOE\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial  Officer (OCFO), in fiscal year 2019 DOE\u2019s obligations totaled nearly $52  billion. Approximately 80 percent\u2014about $41 billion\u2014went to contracts to  manage and operate its scientific laboratories, engineering and  production facilities, and environmental restoration sites, and to construct  new facilities. DOE relies extensively on management and operating  (M&O) contracts to manage and operate many of its government-owned,  contractor-operated sites. Identifying and preventing improper payments  on contracts is a key component of contract management. In 1990, GAO  designated DOE\u2019s contract management\u2014including both contract  administration and project and program management\u2014as a high-risk  area because DOE\u2019s record of inadequate management and oversight of  contractors left the department vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and  mismanagement. Although DOE has made progress in a number of  areas in the 30 years since its original high-risk designation, DOE\u2019s  contract management remains on GAO\u2019s High Risk List.", "DOE performed its latest department-wide risk assessment for improper  payments in fiscal year 2018 (as required under IPIA and described in  OMB guidance) and found that it was not susceptible to significant  improper payments. Therefore, DOE was not required to develop or  publish any statistically valid improper payment estimates in its agency  financial report (AFR). In its fiscal year 2019 AFR, DOE reported it  identified improper payments of $36.26 million made in fiscal year 2018,  about 0.09 percent of its $38.47 billion in outlays for fiscal year 2018.  However, DOE\u2019s reported improper payments were not included in the  nearly $175 billion government-wide total of reported estimated improper  payments for fiscal year 2019 because the government wide estimate is  calculated from agencies\u2019 statistical estimates and DOE did not\u2014and was  not required to\u2014report a statistically valid estimate.", "House Report 115-697 accompanying the Energy and Water  Development Appropriations Bill, 2019, included a provision for GAO to  investigate DOE\u2019s system for tracking improper payments and provide  recommendations to improve the department\u2019s methodology for reporting  accurate, representative, and meaningful data on improper payments.  This report examines (1) the extent to which the improper payment  amounts reported in DOE\u2019s AFRs for fiscal years 2015 through 2019 were  accurate and complete, and (2) the extent to which DOE\u2019s fiscal year  2018 improper payment risk assessment provides a reasonable basis for  its risk determination.", "To determine the extent to which the improper payment amounts reported  in DOE\u2019s AFRs for fiscal years 2015 through 2019 were accurate and  complete, we reviewed federal legislation, policies, and guidance  pertaining to improper payment reporting and compared DOE\u2019s reporting  to these federal requirements. We also reviewed documents from  DOE\u2019s OCFO for fiscal years 2015 through 2019, including the improper  payment reporting sent to the OCFO by DOE\u2019s 48 payment reporting  sites. To assess the reliability of the payment reporting sites\u2019 data, we  took several steps, including reviewing information from each of the sites  about the systems used to capture the data, reconciling the data reported  on the 48 payment site submissions to the summarized data reported for  each fiscal year, and comparing the summarized data with the data in the  AFR for each fiscal year. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable to use in our analyses of DOE\u2019s reported improper payments. We  also reviewed OCFO policies and guidance and interviewed officials  about reporting on improper payments and questioned costs. Further,  we reviewed OMB guidance pertaining to improper payments reporting  and interviewed OMB officials to obtain their perspective on how that  guidance applies to DOE\u2019s reporting.", "In addition, we selected a non-generalizable sample of 10 DOE improper  payment reporting sites for detailed review of these sites\u2019 procedures for  tracking and reporting on improper payments. We selected these sites  because they account for about half of DOE\u2019s outlays and improper  payments, and they represent different types of payment reporting sites  and DOE program and staff offices. We obtained data from the 10  selected sites and conducted semi-structured interviews with officials  from each site who are responsible for identifying and reporting improper  payments. We also reviewed information on improper payments and  questioned costs identified through investigations and published in the  DOE Office of the Inspector General\u2019s (OIG) Semiannual Reports to  Congress for fiscal years 2015 through 2018. We compared the  information in those reports with the improper payment amounts reported  in DOE\u2019s AFRs for the same period. Additionally, we reviewed external  audits that identified questioned costs to determine whether the costs  were tracked to resolution and were included in DOE\u2019s improper payment  reporting, if appropriate. Finally, we updated our prior analysis of audits  and assessments of DOE\u2019s incurred costs for its 24 largest contracts,  which we reported on in March 2019, to provide a sense of the extent of  incurred costs that have been audited or assessed since that report.", "To determine the extent to which DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2018 improper  payment risk assessment provides a reasonable basis for its risk  determination, we reviewed improper payment risk assessment  requirements in IPIA and the related guidance in OMB M-18-20. We also  reviewed relevant internal control standards to identify control activities  related to conducting effective improper payment risk assessments. We  obtained and reviewed DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2018 improper payment risk  assessment, the most recent department-wide improper payment risk  assessment that was based on the risk assessments performed by DOE\u2019s  48 payment reporting sites. We reviewed the site-specific improper  payment risk assessments for the 10 payment reporting sites we  selected, as discussed above. We then compared these risk  assessments to relevant IPIA requirements, OMB guidance, and internal  control standards to determine the extent to which DOE evaluated the  appropriate risk factors for improper payments, appropriately considered  those factors in its risk assessment, and provided a reasonable basis for  its risk determination. Additionally, we interviewed officials from the  OCFO, as well as officials from the 10 selected payment reporting sites,  about the process they used to conduct the fiscal year 2018 improper  payment risk assessments. We also reviewed our past work and DOE  OIG reports to identify (1) any reported issues related to DOE\u2019s improper  payment risk assessments and related processes, and (2) open  recommendations related to DOE\u2019s risk assessments.

Federal agencies were required to take various steps regarding improper  payments under IPIA and as directed by OMB M-18-20. The steps  include the following:  1.  Review all programs and activities and identify those that may be  susceptible to significant improper payments (commonly referred to as  a risk assessment),  2.  For those programs and activities that agency risk assessments,  OMB, or statute identifies as being susceptible to significant improper  payments, agencies should develop statistically valid improper  payment estimates, as well as analyze the root causes of improper  payments and develop corrective actions to reduce them,  3.  Report on the results of addressing the foregoing requirements.", "According to OMB officials, agencies are responsible for maintaining the  documentation to demonstrate that these steps, if applicable, were  satisfied. Figure 1 illustrates these steps, as well as the major  components of conducting an improper payment risk assessment.", "IPIA required that agencies conduct improper payment risk assessments  for all federal programs and activities at least once every 3 years and  identify any program or activity that may be susceptible to significant  improper payments. OMB M-18-20 provides guidance for implementing  the IPIA requirements and covers agencies\u2019 responsibilities for improper  payment risk assessments, estimation, and reporting. According to the  OMB guidance, agencies must institute a systematic method of reviewing  all programs and activities to identify those that may be susceptible to  significant improper payments. This systematic method can be a  quantitative evaluation based on a statistical sample or a qualitative  method, such as a risk-assessment questionnaire. Regardless of which  method of review is used, IPIA required agencies to consider seven risk  factors during the risk assessment. (See table 1.)", "OMB is also required to designate a list of high-priority programs for  greater levels of oversight and review. The threshold for high-priority  program determinations for fiscal year 2018 reporting and subsequent  years is $2 billion in estimated improper payments, regardless of the  improper payments rate estimate. In addition, OMB may determine that a  program is high-priority for reasons other than exceeding the $2 billion  threshold. High-priority programs are subject to additional requirements,  such as submitting information about semi-annual or quarterly actions  taken to reduce improper payments that can be used as a tool for tracking  progress.", "According to OMB M-18-20, another fundamental requirement that  agencies must meet is to recover any federal dollars that are a monetary  loss to the government, unless legislation specifically prevents such  recovery. Specifically, the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery  Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA) requires any program that expends at  least $1 million during the year to implement payment recapture audits, if  cost-effective to the agency, in order to recover improper payments. The  requirement to conduct payment recapture audits applies to all agencies  regardless of whether they have a program susceptible to significant  improper payments. A payment recapture audit is a review and analysis  of an agency\u2019s or program\u2019s accounting and financial records, supporting  documentation, and other pertinent information supporting its payments,  that is specifically designed to identify overpayments. It is not an audit  that is performed in accordance with government auditing standards.  OMB M-18-20 also states that for high-priority programs the agency shall  report any action it has taken or plans to take to recover improper  payments and intends to take to prevent future improper payments. If an  agency has determined that performing payment recapture audits for any  applicable program or activity is not cost-effective, a justification for that  determination must be reported. Further, OMB M-18-20 states that  agencies should report a justification for that determination through AFRs,  Performance Accountability Reports, or in the format required through  data requests from OMB."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Structure and Processes to Collect Information and Report on Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s 15 field Chief Financial Officers, in cooperation with DOE  contracting officers, are responsible for overseeing contractor and other  activities in the field, and they assist the OCFO in implementing improper  payment reporting requirements. The OCFO issues Annual Payment  Integrity Requirements and Guidance that transmits DOE\u2019s instructions  for meeting improper payments reporting and recapture requirements  prescribed by OMB M-18-20. This guidance includes instructions for  completing an attached template for reporting risk assessments and  improper payments and payment recapture information. Using this  template, 48 payment reporting sites provide information that is the basis  for DOE\u2019s department-wide improper payment risk assessment and  reporting. These payment reporting sites consist of four types of federal  entities and two types of contractors. (See appendix I for more  information about DOE\u2019s payment reporting sites.)", "In addition to the completed template, sites are directed to submit a  signed certification that attests to the accuracy of the improper payment  information and risk assessment and, if applicable, a justification for why  payment recapture audits were not conducted. The OCFO completes a  quality assurance checklist for each site and consolidates and reports the  data as one program in DOE\u2019s annual AFR. DOE reports on its  improper payments 1 year in arrears; meaning, for example, that DOE\u2019s  fiscal year 2019 AFR included information on its improper payments  identified in fiscal year 2018.", "In addition to reporting payment recovery information, as required by  OMB Circular A-136, DOE has optionally reported some information it  collected about improper payments that it identified at the time of the AFR  issuance each year for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. (See table 2.)  Specifically, DOE reported the amount of improper payments that had  been made and identified in the preceding year\u2014not based on a  statistically valid estimate of improper payments but, rather, on reported  amounts of known improper payments from individual payment reporting  sites. DOE also reported improper payment rates that it calculated  based on these reported amounts. DOE was not required to report a  statistically valid estimate of improper payments in its AFRs because it  determined it was at low risk of susceptibility to significant improper  payments. See appendix II for additional details about improper payments  in the data that DOE collected from the sites.", "In previous years, DOE reported statistical estimates of its improper  payments. Specifically, DOE\u2019s Performance and Accountability Reports  and AFRs from fiscal years 2004 and 2007 through 2011 indicated that  DOE used statistical sampling to produce projected improper payment  estimates for certain payment categories. During these years, DOE  reported estimated improper payment rates of less than 1 percent in  these categories. However, in 2012 the DOE OIG determined that the  estimated improper payment rate presented in DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2011  AFR was not based on a statistical method. According to OCFO  officials, DOE discontinued the use of statistical sampling to produce  estimates in fiscal year 2012 because it was not required to do so, due to  DOE\u2019s determination that it was at low risk for significant improper  payments.", "Since 2012, the DOE OIG has found DOE to be compliant with  requirements for improper payment reporting and risk assessments as  part of its required review. Specifically, the DOE OIG reported each year  that DOE met the requirements for publishing improper payment  information in its AFRs and performed the required risk assessments.  According to an OIG official, the OIG is not required to perform evaluative  procedures to determine the adequacy and completeness of DOE\u2019s risk  assessment and reporting in its AFR, and they have not optionally  performed these procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of Audits and Investigations in Identifying and Recovering DOE\u2019s Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["The DOE OIG and other federal agencies or external audit organizations  conduct periodic incurred cost audits and assessments of DOE\u2019s cost- reimbursement contracts.

If, as a result of these  audits or assessments, improper payments are identified\u2014such as  reimbursements for costs determined to be unallowable under the  contract\u2014DOE will question these costs, indicating that there is a  possibility the costs are improper. DOE may then negotiate or otherwise  work with the contractor to resolve the questioned costs. Sometimes, this  can result in DOE recovering funds. According to DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2019  annual payment integrity requirements and guidance, for the purpose of  improper payment reporting, a questioned cost is not deemed an  improper payment until it has been determined by the contracting officer  to be unallowable.", "In addition, investigations conducted by DOE OIG, the Department of  Justice, and other federal agencies may identify potentially unallowable  DOE payments. Upon their resolution, these investigations may find such  DOE payments to have been improper. According to OIG officials,  improper payments identified through OIG investigations may be  recovered through civil or administrative processes, and some of the  improper payments identified through OIG investigations may lead to  government-run criminal investigations. OCFO officials told us that  recovered amounts may differ from the monetary loss associated with the  original payments because of fees or fines, among other reasons. IPERIA  requires agencies to include all identified improper payments in their  reported estimate, regardless of whether the improper payment has been  or is being recovered. According to DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2019 annual  payment integrity requirements and guidance, if the terms of a settlement  require repayment to DOE, then the settlement amount would be  considered an unallowable cost. Furthermore, the 2019 guidance states  that due to the timing of when a settlement is reached, it is not possible to  report these costs as an improper payment in the current year of  reporting.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2018, DOE reported information in its AFR on  improper payments made in prior years that were identified for recapture  in the current reporting year. For example, in its fiscal year 2018 AFR,  DOE reported that $92.69 million in prior years\u2019 improper payments had  been identified for recapture in fiscal year 2017. Similarly, in its fiscal year  2019 AFR, DOE reported $14.18 million in prior-year payments identified  for recapture in fiscal year 2018. DOE\u2019s reporting sites generally identify  prior years\u2019 improper payments identified for recapture through audits and  investigations, among other strategies.

Our review of documentation and interviews with  officials at the selected payment reporting sites found some instances in  which payment reporting sites\u2019 processes for identifying and tracking  improper payments did not always result in accurate and complete  financial reporting as required. Specifically, we identified the following  errors in reporting improper payments to the OCFO at three of the 10  sites we selected for review:", "Officials at one site told us that they resolve a portion of their improper  payments by adjusting future invoices to account for the error. Site  officials told us that in such cases, they do not track or report the  amounts to the OCFO as improper payments. While adjusting future  invoices is an efficient way to recapture improper payments, not  tracking such adjustments as improper payments results in  understated improper payments reported to the OCFO. The total  amount of the understatement of these improper payments is not  known. In addition, the site may have overstated other improper  payments. In particular, site officials told us that they were unsure  whether some of the annual adjustments from its indirect cost  reconciliation process were reported as improper payments, even  though OCFO officials told us that such adjustments are routine and  are not considered improper payments. This could have resulted in  an overstatement of improper payments, but the amount overstated is  unknown.", "Officials at another site told us that they mistakenly included almost  $1 million in questioned costs in their fiscal year 2017 improper  payment reporting to the OCFO. Because questioned costs are not  considered improper until they are determined to be unallowable, this  means that the site overstated its improper payments by almost $1  million for that year. Additionally, this site subtracted its  underpayments from its overpayments for its fiscal year 2015  reporting, resulting in an understatement of improper payments.  Improper payments, regardless of whether they are over- or  underpayments, should be added together and not netted, as both  amounts are considered improper. Officials at the site told us that  these issues had been corrected as of fiscal year 2018.", "Officials at a third site told us that they do not closely track  underpayments and cannot state with certainty that all underpayments  are included in the site\u2019s annual improper payments report. The site  therefore may be understating its improper payments each year.", "DOE\u2019s Financial Management Oversight order states that financial  management processes must include procedures and methods for  ensuring that financial managers provide accurate, relevant financial  reporting to customers, such as Congress and OMB. Additionally,  federal internal control standards state that management should  implement control activities through policies, including documenting  policies in the appropriate level of detail to allow management to  effectively monitor the control activity. However, not all of the payment  reporting sites have fully documented their procedures for correctly  identifying, tracking, and reporting their improper payments or ensuring  the quality of their data, in part because there was no requirement to do  so. Specifically, officials from all 10 selected payment reporting sites we  interviewed told us they have procedures for tracking their identified  improper payments. However, three of the 10 selected sites had not  documented their procedures and two sites had documented some of  their procedures but not others, including two of the sites mentioned in  the examples above. By requiring payment reporting sites to document  their procedures for identifying, tracking, and reporting their improper  payments to ensure the quality of their data, the OCFO could better  ensure that each payment reporting site maintains consistent procedures  and provides comparable information about that site\u2019s improper payments  over time.", "Furthermore, the OCFO cannot ensure that sites are correctly identifying,  tracking, and reporting improper payments and ensuring the quality of  their data because the OCFO does not have a process to monitor that  sites have documented\u2014and are implementing\u2014procedures to do so.  The OCFO has taken some steps to help ensure the quality of the  improper payments data that the sites report to the OCFO. For example,  OCFO officials said they confirm that sites provide accurate information  by requiring sites to self-certify the accuracy and completeness of the  data, but does not take steps to verify the certification. Further, four of the  five contractor payment reporting sites we interviewed told us the DOE  field sites that oversee the contractors review the contractors\u2019  submissions before sending the information to the OCFO; OCFO officials  told us that the field sites do not formally approve these submissions.  Additionally, OCFO staff complete a quality assurance checklist for each  site\u2019s submission. The checklist contains a series of questions to  determine whether a site has submitted the required documentation and  whether certain elements of that documentation are complete. OCFO  quality assurance reviews also include simple mathematical checks for  internal consistency, such as ensuring that the amount for total identified  improper payments is the same across multiple tables.", "These steps, however, are not sufficient to ensure that sites are correctly  identifying, tracking, and reporting improper payments and ensuring the  quality of their data. For example, the quality assurance checklist does  not include any tests to verify the accuracy of the procedures sites used  to generate that data to ensure the sites\u2019 data are reliable. By developing  a monitoring process to ensure that payment reporting sites have  developed and implemented procedures for identifying, tracking, and  reporting their improper payments to the OCFO and ensuring the quality  of their data, the OCFO could better ensure that the information it reports  about improper payments in its AFR is accurate and complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Identifies a Substantial Amount of Improper Payments in Subsequent Years That Are Not Included in Any Years\u2019 Improper Payment Amount or Rate", "paragraphs": ["The amount of current year improper payments DOE reports in each  fiscal year, as well as the improper payment rate DOE calculates based  on this amount and reports in its AFRs, is not accurate or complete  because it does not disclose that there are additional improper payments  that are (1) not identified or that DOE\u2019s OCFO is not aware of until a later  date, or (2) potential improper payments that may be identified at a later  date.

In its fiscal year 2018  AFR DOE also reported $92.69 million of improper payments made  earlier than fiscal year 2017; however DOE did not disclose that the  amount of improper payments originally reported for any prior fiscal year  had subsequently increased as a result of improper payments identified  after the end of the fiscal year. While it is not possible for DOE to report  on the specific amount of improper payments it has not yet identified,  DOE also did not disclose in its fiscal year 2018 AFR that it expected to  complete audits and investigations in subsequent years that could  increase the amount of improper payments reported for fiscal year 2017.  See figure 2 for categories of improper payments and the extent to which  they are included in DOE\u2019s improper payment amount and rate.", "Specifically, the OCFO excludes some known improper payments from  the annual amount and associated rate it reports in its AFRs for the  following reasons:", "Post-payment reviews may not conclude in the same fiscal year  the reviewed payments were made. We have previously found that  DOE identifies some improper payments through post-payment  reviews. For example, DOE has not required its contractor payment  reporting sites\u2014most of which are M&O contractors\u2014to submit  invoices before DOE makes payments; instead DOE uses a  \u201cpayments cleared funding arrangement,\u201d which authorizes the  contractors to withdraw funds directly from federal accounts. OCFO  officials told us that improper payments made by DOE to contractors  without such an agreement would be reported by the responsible  federal site, and improper payments made by M&O contractors would  be reported by the M&O contractor. DOE policies and procedures  do not require that DOE site officials monitor M&O contractor  withdrawals to determine the appropriateness of their incurred costs.  DOE officials do not review M&O contractor withdrawal of funds to  determine the appropriateness of M&O contract costs, and thus can  only identify improper payments associated with these contracts  through post-payment reviews of contractor costs that may occur after  the end of the fiscal year.", "However, such post-payment reviews, such as monthly or quarterly  reviews of invoices, may not identify certain improper payments\u2014 including improper payments that occurred late in a given fiscal  year\u2014leading DOE to exclude them from their annual reported  improper payment amount and associated rate. For example,  according to a document describing improper payments that one  selected payment site reported to the OCFO, the site identified about  $103,000 in fiscal year 2016 improper payments associated with  travel during that same fiscal year. Additional reviews of fiscal year  2016 travel payments conducted in fiscal year 2017 identified further  improper payments for travel of more than $35,000. Because the  contractor identified these additional travel payments as improper  through quarterly reviews that did not conclude until after the end of  fiscal year 2016, this increase of about 35 percent in the site\u2019s known  improper travel payments was not included in the OCFO\u2019s reported  improper payment amount or rate for that year.", "In our March 2017 report, we recommended that DOE help ensure  that necessary data are available to employ data analytics\u2014which  can identify improper payments more quickly than post-payment  reviews can, increasing the likelihood that DOE will include them in its  reported amount and rate for each fiscal year\u2014as a tool to perform  contractor cost-surveillance activities. Specifically, we recommended  that DOE require contractors to maintain sufficiently detailed  transaction-level cost data that are reconcilable with amounts charged  to the government, including (1) cost data that, at a minimum,  represent a full data population; and (2) the details necessary to  determine the nature of each cost transaction. DOE disagreed with  the recommendation. According to DOE officials, DOE is now  developing plans to begin to use data analytics in fiscal year 2021.  We continue to believe it is important for DOE to employ data  analytics as a cost surveillance tool so DOE can better identify  improper payments to its contractors in a timely manner and look  forward to reviewing DOE\u2019s plans and actions to address our prior  recommendation.", "Audit coverage of DOE payments is limited, and some audits are  not completed until several years after the audited payments  were made. As we also found in March 2017, DOE uses incurred cost  audits and assessments to identify contractors\u2019 improper payments.  However, our review of DOE OIG and other external entities\u2019 audits  and assessments of incurred costs for DOE\u2019s 24 largest contractors  for this report shows that, historically, these audits are infrequent and  may occur several years after the costs have been incurred. For  example, our updated analysis shows that as of September 2019,  only about $25 billion\u2014or 23 percent\u2014of the nearly $108 billion in  costs incurred during fiscal years 2014 through 2018 by DOE\u2019s 24  largest contractors had been audited or assessed (see table 3).  Although there is no requirement for how often contractors should be  audited, the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 imposes a 6-year statute  of limitations for the government to seek recovery of unallowable  costs that could be identified through audits.", "According to our review of DOE reporting and documentation, known  DOE improper payments amounts for a given fiscal year can increase  in later years as more costs are audited. For example, one payment  reporting site reported to the OCFO nearly $164,000 in improper  payments made and identified in fiscal year 2017, and OCFO included  this amount in the improper payment rate it reported in its fiscal year  2018 AFR. According to site documentation, the same site also  identified, as the result of an audit in fiscal year 2017, an improper  payment of nearly $920,000 that had occurred in a prior year. This  improper payment was substantially more than the total amount of  improper payments that the site reported in the fiscal year 2018 AFR.  However, because the improper payment occurred prior to fiscal year  2017, the OCFO did not include it in its current year improper  payment amount or rate for any fiscal year.", "For fiscal year 2020, DOE\u2019s OIG has planned several assessments of  costs the contractors incurred in prior fiscal years. However,  contractor costs the OIG plans to review in the fiscal year 2020  planned assessments were incurred as early as fiscal year 2015.  Therefore, any improper payments identified through the planned  assessments will not be included in DOE\u2019s reported improper  payment rate using the current reporting methods and will instead be  included in an overall lump sum amount of prior year improper  payments, which has no effect on DOE\u2019s reported improper payment  rate.", "DOE does not track questioned costs centrally, and such costs  can take several years to resolve. Audits and assessments can  identify questioned costs that require additional review before they are  either allowed or deemed improper. In its Semiannual Report to  Congress, DOE\u2019s OIG reported nearly $700 million of unresolved,  questioned costs identified through its own audits and investigations  as of September 30, 2019. Our analysis of the DOE OIG\u2019s reporting  found that a substantial portion of questioned costs the OIG identified  were ultimately determined to be allowable once they were resolved;  however, our analysis also found that DOE has not consistently  resolved questioned costs in a timely manner. For example, some of  the questioned costs that the DOE\u2019s OIG identified\u2014such as potential  state gross receipts tax overpayments of $15.1 million that a DOE  payment site made in fiscal years 2010 and 2011\u2014have remained  unresolved for nearly a decade. Large amounts of unresolved costs  reported by DOE\u2019s OIG add uncertainty about the completeness of  the OCFO\u2019s improper payment reporting.", "Moreover, the nearly $700 million of unresolved questioned costs that  the DOE OIG reported does not include questioned costs identified  through external audits of non-M&O contractors, such as those  conducted by the Defense Contract Audit Agency or nongovernmental  entities. Questioned costs identified through these external audits can  be substantial, like those the DOE OIG has reported. For example, a  2017 incurred cost audit of a DOE contractor\u2019s fiscal year 2010 costs  conducted by an external firm identified nearly $280 million in  questioned and unresolved DOE payments to the contractor. In  November 2019, DOE officials told us that these questioned  payments were resolved when DOE reached a settlement agreement  with the contractor. DOE disallowed $34 million of the questioned  costs as part of the settlement agreement, according to DOE  officials. DOE\u2019s Financial Management Oversight order states that  financial management processes must include procedures and  methods for ensuring that financial managers provide accurate,  relevant financial reporting to customers. DOE customers include  Congress and OMB. Additionally, federal internal control standards  state that management should implement control activities through  policies, including documenting policies in the appropriate level of  detail to allow management to effectively monitor the control activity.", "According to OCFO officials, DOE does not have a mechanism for  tracking questioned costs identified through external audits. Instead,  OCFO officials said they rely on payment reporting sites to track these  costs to resolution. However, the office does not require payment  reporting sites to document policies for such tracking. DOE officials  from two selected sites told us that their sites do not have policies for  tracking questioned costs identified through external audits, including  questioned costs that may later be deemed improper. As a result, the  OCFO may not be aware of all potentially improper payments  identified through external audits or know the status of their resolution.  Without a requirement for sites to have policies to track questioned  costs to their resolution, the OCFO cannot ensure that payment  reporting sites are tracking\u2014and ultimately reporting\u2014all improper  payments, and thus cannot ensure that it is including all improper  payments in the amount it reports as actual in its AFRs.", "Investigations that identify DOE improper payments may not  conclude until years after the payments were made. Investigations  by DOE\u2019s OIG, the Department of Justice, and other federal agencies  can also identify DOE improper payments. However, similar to  improper payments identified through audits, these improper  payments\u2014which can be substantial\u2014may not be identified until  years after they occur due to the length of time it takes to investigate  and resolve criminal, civil, or administrative cases. For example, in  fiscal year 2018, DOE reported $60.6 million of improper payments  identified through a fiscal year 2017 settlement with a contractor. DOE  made some of these improper payments as early as 2001. Also, in  fiscal year 2018, a DOE payment site reported that no improper  payments were made or identified in fiscal year 2017, but the site  reported a $4.6 million prior-year improper payment associated with a  subcontractor\u2019s false claims that were settled with the subcontractor in  fiscal year 2017. The OCFO reported these two cases, along with  other DOE improper payments identified through investigations, as  lump sum prior-year improper payments identified for recapture in its  fiscal year 2018 AFR. However, the OCFO did not include these  known improper payments in the improper payment amounts used to  calculate its improper payment rates for the years in which DOE  incurred the disallowed costs.", "Furthermore, some DOE improper payments are not reported as  current or prior-year improper payments because the investigations of  the payments were resolved in a manner that prevented DOE from  formally considering the payments improper. For example, in 2015,  DOE\u2019s OIG reported that a company received a loan guarantee of  more than $500 million from DOE after it \u201cprovided the Department  with statements, assertions, and certifications that were inaccurate  and misleading, misrepresented known facts, and, in some instances,  omitted information that was highly relevant to key decisions in the  process to award and execute\u201d the loan guarantee. The company  later declared bankruptcy and did not repay the loan. However,  because DOE did not determine this payment to be improper through  a legal case or any other process, the $500 million of known monetary  loss was not included in DOE\u2019s improper payments reporting in its  AFR for any fiscal year. Also, in fiscal year 2017, DOE excluded a six- figure settlement with an outside party from its improper payment  reporting. OCFO officials told us that they excluded payments  associated with this case from their office\u2019s reporting due to certain  aspects of the settlement agreement.", "DOE\u2019s Information Quality Guidelines state that information disseminated  to the public, such as information on improper payments reported in  DOE\u2019s AFRs, should be presented in an accurate, complete, unbiased,  and clear manner and should be useful to the intended users of the  information. As previously noted, agencies with programs that are  susceptible to significant improper payments\u2014defined to include  improper payments exceeding $100 million in a year\u2014are required to  develop improper payment estimates and corrective action plans.  However, the OCFO cannot determine whether improper payments in a  given year exceeded the $100 million threshold because the OCFO does  not track information on the year that payments were made for all known  improper payments for a given fiscal year\u2014including improper payments  identified in later years through resolution of questioned costs or  conclusions of audits or investigations. By tracking information on the  year the payment occurred for all improper payments identified, to include  those identified in later years, and determining and disclosing in its AFR  whether improper payments in a given year exceeded the $100 million  threshold, DOE could better inform Congress, OMB, and the public about  whether it has made significant improper payments.", "Additionally, DOE sites perform some payment recapture activities, but  does not conduct payment recapture audits, which could identify  additional improper payments that could be reported, and potentially  recovered. As previously discussed, IPIA required any program that  expended at least $1 million annually to conduct payment recapture  audits, if cost-effective to the agency, or to provide justification if such  audits are determined not to be cost-effective. A payment recapture audit  is a review and analysis of an agency\u2019s or program\u2019s accounting and  financial records, supporting documentation, and other pertinent  information supporting its payments, that is specifically designed to  identify overpayments. As such, payment recapture audits are tools to  identify improper payments, in addition to an avenue for recovering those  overpayments.", "DOE included a justification for its decision not to conduct payment  recapture audits in its AFRs for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. For  example, in its fiscal year 2019 AFR, DOE cited its improper payment rate  of 0.09 percent and recapture rate of 97 percent to support the  department\u2019s determination that it was not cost-effective to perform  payment recapture audits. DOE also cited other activities it employed to  identify and recapture improper payments, such as prepayment review  and approval of invoices, post-payment reviews, contractor internal  audits, results of cost allowability audits of integrated contractors, and  results from travel audits, among others.", "The OCFO fiscal year 2018 payment integrity guidance included a list of  seven criteria that sites were to use to determine whether payment  recapture audits are cost-effective. For fiscal year 2018, 42 of DOE\u2019s 48  payment reporting sites submitted a justification stating that it would not  be cost-effective to employ payment recapture auditors. Our review of the  42 justifications found that the quality of the justifications varied by site.  We found that 40 of the 42 justifications did not demonstrate  consideration of any of the seven criteria in support of their  determinations that payment recapture audits would not be cost- effective. One DOE field site\u2019s justification included three bullet points,  as shown in figure 3, none of which aligned with the criteria.", "The OCFO uses a quality assurance checklist to review payment sites\u2019  improper payment reports that includes verifying that the site submitted a  justification and that the justification is \u201cadequate.\u201d The checklist does not  define \u201cadequate,\u201d and the OCFO approved all of the justifications  submitted, even those that did not demonstrate consideration of any of  the seven criteria from the payment integrity guidance. DOE\u2019s Financial  Management Oversight order states that financial management  processes must include procedures and methods for ensuring that  financial managers provide accurate, relevant financial reporting to  customers. Furthermore, under OMB M-18-20, agencies are required to  recover any federal dollars that are a monetary loss to the government,  unless legislation specifically prevents such recovery. By clarifying  guidance to define the factors for assessing the adequacy of the  justifications, and reviewing sites\u2019 justifications for not performing or  arranging for payment recapture audits, DOE could better ensure that the  justifications it reports have a sound basis and that DOE is not missing  opportunities to identify and recover improper payments.", "Additionally, DOE may be missing opportunities to recover federal dollars  that are a monetary loss to the government, as required under OMB M- 18-20, because it has not evaluated whether sites could identify additional  improper payments through payment recapture audits. Our analysis of  information provided by DOE shows that in fiscal year 2003 the  department conducted payment recapture audits and that the improper  payments identified through these audits far exceeded the costs of  conducting the audits. According to OCFO officials, the information on  payment recapture efforts was from a payment recapture audit at one  site; it was not an OCFO recovery audit program. The OCFO officials  reiterated that the majority of the payment reporting sites have not  performed payment recapture audits because they believe existing efforts  are effective in recovering identified improper payments. However,  payment recapture audits are designed to identify additional improper  payments not previously identified. By evaluating whether it could identify  enough additional improper payments to make payment recapture audits  cost-effective, such as performing audits at a limited number of sites,  DOE would have an opportunity to identify and recover additional  improper payments or have better information to justify that payment  recapture audits are not cost-effective."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Fiscal Year 2018 Risk Assessment May Not Provide a Reasonable Basis for Its Risk Determination", "paragraphs": ["In its fiscal year 2018 improper payment risk assessment, DOE assessed  its risk of susceptibility to significant improper payments as low.

For fiscal year 2018, DOE developed and provided each  payment reporting site with an improper payment risk assessment  template to complete. DOE directed all of its payment reporting sites to  consider the seven risk factors listed in IPIA, as well as four additional risk  factors that DOE developed. Table 4 lists the additional DOE-developed  risk factors that sites were to consider in their risk assessments.", "DOE\u2019s improper payment risk assessment template included a variable  scale for rating each of the risk factors. The OCFO provided guidance  instructing payment reporting sites to, when populating the template,  consider the site\u2019s exposure to the risk factors and to rate them by  applying a numerical score to each risk factor. Each payment site  totaled its numerical scores to calculate the site\u2019s overall level of  susceptibility to significant improper payments. DOE then consolidated all  of the payment site assessments into an overall department-wide risk  assessment. However, DOE could not explain, and did not provide us  documentation to support, its rationale for the variable scales used to  score such risk factors in its fiscal year 2018 assessments\u2014both in the  10 payment-site risk assessments we reviewed and in DOE\u2019s  department-wide risk assessment\u2014and how the scores assigned for  each risk factor affected DOE\u2019s susceptibility to significant improper  payments. As a result, we could not determine if DOE\u2019s process for  conducting its fiscal year 2018 improper payment risk assessment  provided a reasonable basis for DOE\u2019s overall risk determination.", "Furthermore, the OCFO weighted all of the payment reporting sites  equally in terms of overall risk when it aggregated the risk ratings into an  overall assessment of susceptibility to significant improper payments.  However, DOE did not provide an explanation or documentation of why  the sites were weighted equally in the overall department-wide improper  payment risk assessment, even though the payment types and dollar  amounts of outlays processed by the sites varied widely. For example, a  payment site processing $3 million of outlays in fiscal year 2017 had the  same weight in the aggregated assessment as a payment site processing  $5.7 billion of outlays.", "Finally, the OCFO did not provide evidence that it considered the known  lag in identifying certain improper payments as an inherent risk during its  fiscal year 2018 department-wide improper payment risk assessment  process. This inherent risk relates to certain limitations affecting DOE\u2019s  ability to determine the extent of improper payments until several years  after they occur, such as those identified through incurred cost audits and  investigations, as previously discussed. For example, in its fiscal year  2018 AFR, DOE reported that a total of $124.35 million in payments were  identified for recapture during fiscal year 2017, including $31.66 million  made in fiscal year 2017 and $92.69 million made in years prior to fiscal  year 2017. However, DOE did not provide us documentation to support  how it considered the $92.69 million in improper payments made during  years prior to fiscal year 2017\u2014which could represent an inherent risk to  the department\u2014when assessing its risk of susceptibility to significant  improper payments. As discussed earlier, some of the $92.69 million of  improper payments identified for recapture occurred in fiscal year 2016.  Thus, the amount of fiscal year 2016 improper payments that DOE  reported in its fiscal year 2017 AFR is understated.", "Federal internal control standards state that management should design  control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, and should  implement control activities through policies.

Additionally, management should  periodically review policies, procedures, and related control activities for  continued relevance and effectiveness. Further, although OMB does not  direct agencies to demonstrate how each risk factor contributes to the  agency\u2019s overall susceptibility of risk for significant improper payments,  OMB M-18-20 states that if a qualitative method is used during an  improper payment risk assessment, it must be designed to accurately  determine whether the program is susceptible to significant improper  payments.", "DOE may not have an adequate process to support its risk determination  because it did not properly document how it developed and considered  risk factors during its fiscal year 2018 risk assessment.

Specifically, without documenting its rationale for the variable scale used  to score risk factors and weighting of the payment reporting sites, and  consideration of the known lag in identifying the extent of total improper  payments each fiscal year to support the development of its department- level risk assessment, DOE cannot demonstrate that its process for  determining its low risk of susceptibility to significant improper payments  is reasonable. Addressing these issues may result in DOE determining  that it is susceptible to significant improper payments, and therefore  subject to additional requirements\u2014such as developing a statistically  valid estimate of improper payments and reporting on actions to reduce  improper payments, including a description of the root causes, and  developing corrective actions to reduce them, including program-specific  improper payment reduction targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Did Not Sufficiently Review the Reasonableness of Selected Payment Reporting Sites\u2019 Improper Payment Risk Assessments", "paragraphs": ["We also found that DOE\u2019s OCFO did not sufficiently review the  reasonableness of the selected payment reporting sites\u2019 improper  payment risk assessments.

First, DOE\u2019s improper payments information may not be  accurate or complete because the OCFO does not require the payment  reporting sites to document their procedures for correctly identifying,  tracking, and reporting their improper payments. By doing so, the OCFO  could better ensure that the payment reporting sites provide consistent  and comparable information about their improper payments over time.  Second, the OCFO cannot ensure that sites are correctly identifying,  tracking, and reporting improper payments to the OCFO and ensuring the  quality of their data because OCFO does not have a process to monitor  that sites have\u2014and are implementing\u2014procedures to do so. By  developing such a monitoring process, the OCFO could better ensure that  the information it reports about improper payments in DOE\u2019s AFRs is  accurate and complete. Third, DOE may not be reporting additional  improper payments in the form of unallowable costs claimed by some  contractors because, as we have previously found, DOE policies and  procedures do not require that DOE sites monitor M&O contractor  withdrawals to determine the appropriateness of costs incurred by the  contractor. Under this arrangement, DOE does not use prepayment  reviews to determine the appropriateness of M&O contract costs and,  thus, can only identify improper payments associated with these contracts  through post-payment reviews that typically occur after the end of the  fiscal year. We previously recommended that DOE ensure data are  available to employ data analytics\u2014which can identify improper payments  more quickly than post-payment reviews can\u2014but DOE has not fully  implemented the recommendation. We continue to believe it is important  for DOE to employ data analytics as a cost surveillance tool so DOE can  better identify improper payments to its contractors in a timely manner.", "DOE only includes improper payments that occur and are identified in the  same fiscal year in its reported improper payment amount and rate in the  AFR. However, DOE does not identify a substantial amount of improper  payments in the same fiscal year due to the known lag in identifying such  payments. Audits and assessments of DOE\u2019s contractors can identify  questioned costs that require additional review before they are either  allowed or deemed improper, but DOE has not consistently resolved  questioned costs in a timely manner because the OCFO does not direct  payment reporting sites to document policies for tracking questioned  costs to resolution. Without a requirement for sites to have policies to  track questioned costs to their resolution, the OCFO cannot ensure that  payment reporting sites are tracking\u2014and ultimately reporting\u2014all  improper payments, and thus cannot ensure the accuracy and  completeness of improper payments reported in DOE\u2019s AFRs.  Additionally, the OCFO cannot determine whether improper payments in  a given year exceeded the $100 million threshold because the OCFO  does not track information about the year that payments were made for all  known improper payments for a given fiscal year. By tracking and  disclosing information about all improper payments identified and the year  in which these payments were made in its AFR, DOE would have better  information to provide to Congress, OMB, and the public about whether it  has made significant improper payments.", "Although DOE\u2019s sites submitted individual justifications for not completing  payment recapture audits, the quality of the justifications varied and did  not meet DOE requirements. By clarifying guidance to define the factors  for assessing the adequacy of the justifications, and reviewing sites\u2019  justifications for not performing or arranging for payment recapture audits  to ensure that the justifications meet requirements and are supported by  appropriate analysis that considers the costs and benefits of performing  the audits, DOE can better ensure that the justifications it reports have a  sound basis and that DOE is taking advantage of all opportunities to both  identify and recover improper payments, which in turn will help reduce the  monetary loss to the government. Further, DOE may be missing  opportunities to recover federal dollars that are a monetary loss to the  government because it has not evaluated whether sites could identify  additional improper payments through payment recapture audits. DOE  has concluded that based on its self-assessed low improper payment rate  and recapture rate, it is not cost effective to perform payment recapture  audits. By evaluating whether it could identify enough additional improper  payments to make payment recapture audits cost-effective, such as  performing audits at a limited number of sites, DOE would have an  opportunity to identify and recover additional improper payments or have  better information to justify that payment recapture audits are not cost- effective.", "Finally, DOE may not have an adequate process to support its risk  determination because it did not properly document how it developed and  considered risk factors during its fiscal year 2018 risk assessment. Until  DOE revises its department-level process for conducting improper  payment risk assessments, it cannot ensure that the process produces a  reliable assessment of whether it is susceptible to significant improper  payments. Further, the process for the OCFO to oversee the accuracy of  payment site risk ratings is unclear because DOE has not defined and  documented, in its policies and procedures, the process for OCFO  reviewers to override a payment site\u2019s risk ratings in the event the  reviewer finds that the rating was not reasonable. By developing,  documenting, and implementing department-wide policies and  procedures, DOE would enhance its ability to adequately monitor its  decentralized improper payment risk assessment process and help  ensure that individual payment reporting sites accurately score their risk  factors\u2014leading DOE to obtain a more accurate and reliable assessment  of its overall risk of susceptibility to improper payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following nine recommendations to DOE:  The Office of the Chief Financial Officer should require payment   reporting sites to document their procedures for identifying, tracking, and  reporting improper payments to ensure they provide consistent and  comparable information about their improper payments over time.  (Recommendation 1)", "The Office of the Chief Financial Officer should develop a monitoring  process to ensure that payment reporting sites document and implement  procedures that will enable them to correctly identify and report improper  payments to the OCFO. (Recommendation 2)", "The Office of the Chief Financial Officer should require payment reporting  sites to document policies for tracking questioned costs to resolution.

DOE  concurred with six of our recommendations and said that it plans to  complete actions from November 2020 through December 2021 to  address these recommendations. DOE did not concur with three of our  recommendations; however, we believe that these recommendations  remain valid. DOE\u2019s written response is reproduced in appendix III and  summarized below. In addition, DOE provided technical comments, which  we incorporated as appropriate.", "DOE did not concur with our sixth recommendation to evaluate whether  its payment reporting sites could identify enough additional improper  payments through payment recapture audits to make those audits cost- effective, such as by performing audits at selected sites. In response to  this recommendation, DOE stated in its comments that it has an ongoing  Fraud Risk Management Working Group and that officials have  developed a Fraud Risk Management and Data Analytics Implementation  Plan to strengthen DOE\u2019s capability to prevent, identify, and recover  improper payments and fraud. However, DOE\u2019s plan is still in draft form,  and according to DOE\u2019s technical comments, they will not begin using  data analytics until fiscal year 2021.", "In addition, DOE stated in its comments that existing payment recapture  activities such as pre- and post-payment reviews, contractor internal  audits, use of the results of cost allowability audits of integrated  contractors, and interim and close-out reviews of contracts and financial  assistance awards are sufficient. As we discuss in the report, DOE  determined that it does not need to conduct payment recapture audits  based on justifications submitted by the reporting sites. However, most of  the sites\u2019 justifications did not include consideration of the OCFO criteria  for making determinations about the cost-effectiveness of conducting  payment recapture audits. We continue to believe that by evaluating  whether it could identify enough additional improper payments to make  payment recapture audits cost-effective, such as by performing audits at  a limited number of sites, DOE would have an opportunity to identify and  recover additional improper payments or have better information to justify  that payment recapture audits are not cost-effective.", "DOE did not concur with our seventh recommendation to (1) develop and  document the rationale for weighting risk factors, including the weighting  of all payment reporting sites; and (2) document its consideration of the  inherent risk associated with the lag in identifying certain improper  payments subsequent to the fiscal year they occurred to ensure that the  process results in a reliable assessment of whether the agency is  susceptible to significant improper payments.", "Regarding the weighting of risk factors, DOE said that its risk assessment  evaluates the volume and dollar amount of payments by payment  category, payments subject to manual controls, and fluctuations in  volume and dollar amounts. We recognize that DOE\u2019s risk assessment  template asks each site to assess its risk with regard to payment amounts  and fluctuations. However, we are recommending that the OCFO  document the weighting of all its risk factors, including its decision to  consider as equal the risks identified by all sites\u2014regardless of the dollar  amount of outlays. While assessing the risk of improper payments at an  individual site is important, it does not address the intent of our  recommendation. We continue to believe that, because DOE did not  properly document how it developed and considered risk factors during its  fiscal year 2018 risk assessment, it cannot ensure that the process  produces a reliable assessment of whether DOE is susceptible to  significant improper payments.", "Regarding the consideration of inherent risk, DOE stated in its comments  that the Payment Integrity Risk Assessment directs payment reporting  sites to consider inherent risk as part of DOE\u2019s Internal Control Program.  We recognize that sites are to assess the inherent risk that an improper  payment may occur. However, even if none of the sites identifies the  known lag in identifying improper payments as a risk, based on our  review of DOE\u2019s AFRs, this lag is a risk to DOE as a whole. Therefore, we  continue to believe that DOE should document in its risk assessment  process its consideration of the known lag in identifying improper  payments.", "Finally, DOE did not concur with our eighth recommendation to revise  DOE\u2019s department-level policies and procedures for reviewing risk  assessments. Specifically, we recommended a policy revision to require  OCFO review and approval of documentation submitted by payment  reporting sites in support of their risk assessments to help ensure the  accuracy of these sites' assessments. DOE stated in its comments that  sufficient processes are in place for ensuring the accuracy of payment  reporting sites\u2019 risk assessments. DOE also stated that OCFO\u2019s Payment  Integrity Guidance instructs payment reporting sites to maintain detailed  information supporting risk assessments, which is available to the OCFO  and DOE\u2019s auditors upon request, and that review and approval of the  documentation occurs during periodic payment reporting site visits by  OCFO staff. Further, DOE stated that as part of the OCFO\u2019s quality  assurance reviews, the OCFO evaluates the documentation used to  support risk assessment ratings and directs updates to risk assessments  if documentation listed does not support the stated risk ratings.", "As we discuss in the report, five of the 10 sites we reviewed did not  provide sufficient explanation or documentation supporting their ratings  for several of the risk factors. This includes one site that cited  \u201cdiscussions with team lead\u201d as the primary source of support for the  ratings it assigned for several risk factors. We continue to believe that by  developing, documenting, and implementing policies and procedures to  require the OCFO to review documentation supporting payment site risk  assessments, DOE would enhance its ability to adequately monitor its  decentralized improper payment risk assessment process and help  ensure that individual payment reporting sites accurately score their risk  factors, leading DOE to obtain a more accurate and reliable assessment  of its overall risk of susceptibility to improper payments.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the National  Nuclear Security Administration, and other interested parties.
