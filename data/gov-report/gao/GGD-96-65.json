Districts are responsible for Investigations\u2019 and Inspections\u2019 enforcement activities, and sectors are responsible for the Border Patrol\u2019s enforcement activities.", "The Border Patrol\u2019s 21 sectors are headed by chief patrol agents who carry out enforcement activities at 145 stations located throughout the continental United States and in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (see app. I for a map showing the 145 stations). At the end of fiscal year 1994, the Border Patrol had 4,260 Border Patrol agents on duty. As of September 13, 1995, INS had hired and finished training 530 Border Patrol agents and had an additional 369 agents in training. This represents an estimated 22 percent of INS\u2019 expected increase in the number of new agents over the next 3 years.

Inspections\u2019 mission is to determine the admissibility of all persons seeking entry into the United States at land, air, and sea ports of entry.", "The Border Patrol\u2019s portion of the INS enforcement mission is to secure and protect the borders of the United States by preventing illegal entry, and by detecting, interdicting, and apprehending illegal aliens, smugglers, and contraband. To prevent and detect illegal entry, the Border Patrol patrols the border by land, sea, and air. To apprehend illegal aliens and smugglers, it checks traffic, public transportation, and vessels, and patrols the interior (e.g., looking for illegal aliens in areas over 25 miles from the border). In addition, the Border Patrol assists Investigations and Inspections staff in carrying out their missions. To do this, the Border Patrol is to check employers for illegal workers, visit local jails or state prisons to interview aliens, and identify alien smugglers.", "All immigration officers who carry out INS\u2019 enforcement functions are to receive general and specialized training to carry out their enforcement responsibilities.

For example, the El Paso, Texas; Warroad, Minnesota; and Niagara Falls, New York, stations on the Southwest and Canadian Borders were established in 1924. In 1926, the Miami, Florida, station was established because aliens were being smuggled into the United States from Cuba. Generally, stations over 100 miles from the border, such as the stations in Dallas and San Antonio, Texas; and Boulder City, Nevada, that were opened between 1986 and 1988, were opened because there were large numbers of illegal aliens in those areas. However, INS did not establish Border Patrol stations in some large metropolitan areas known to have substantial alien populations, such as New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles, because these cities generally were considered to be the final destination for many illegal aliens. The strategy at the time called for stopping illegal aliens before they had reached their final destination.", "Recently, INS changed the Border Patrol\u2019s enforcement strategy along the Southwest Border from apprehending aliens after they had illegally entered to deterring them from entering in the first place. According to INS officials, the new strategy is to concentrate agents on the border to raise aliens\u2019 risk of apprehension to a maximum level and thereby deter aliens and alien smugglers from attempting illegal entry.

The New Orleans district had inspectors at the port who could perform this task.", "Similarly, Border Patrol agents from the Orlando, Florida, station responded to a report from a shipping agent concerning a crewman who had not returned to his ship at Port Canaveral. The agents traveled about 55 miles to the ship, picked up the crew member\u2019s passport, and searched his quarters. Inspectors stationed at the port could perform this task. In another case, Border Patrol agents from the Port Angeles, Washington, station occasionally inspect arriving ferry passengers from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. However, according to the Seattle District Director, immigration inspectors located in Victoria, Canada, inspect passengers before they board the ferry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "INS Commissioner\u2019s and District Directors\u2019 Views of the Impact on Enforcement Activities of Agent Relocation or Redirection", "paragraphs": ["The INS Commissioner and district directors pointed out that if Border Patrol agents were relocated to the border, additional resources would be needed to perform the enforcement activities they currently do. District directors said that the agents contributed to their districts\u2019 enforcement efforts. Some district directors added that they would not use replacement resources to carry out some lower priority work that the agents are doing.", "During a hearing before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, in response to questions regarding the assignment of agents to interior stations, the Commissioner of INS said, \u201cOur Border Patrol needs to be first and foremost devoted to border enforcement at the border.\u201d She favored redeploying interior agents to the border if INS could get additional resources to do the work presently being done by the agents (e.g., employer and jail checks and the removal of illegal aliens). A Continuing Resolution provides funding for INS enforcement programs through the end of fiscal year 1996 at the resource level provided in the conference report. The resource level includes $12 million for the reallocation of 200 Border Patrol positions from interior stations to the front lines of the border. INS expects to relocate these 200 agent positions to the Southwest Border. INS had 1,368 agents who were not located on the Southwest Border at the end of fiscal year 1994.", "The conferees agreed that effective border control is the most important means of controlling illegal immigration and that INS must use its Border Patrol resources in a way that ensures that apprehension of illegal aliens at the border is its first priority. They agreed that INS can no longer use Border Patrol resources on functions not directly related to border control. However, the conferees recognized the importance of an INS enforcement presence in parts of the country that have significant illegal immigrant populations. Rather than close any of these offices, the conferees directed INS to restaff these offices with criminal investigators to ensure that interior enforcement activities currently performed in these locations can continue.", "On January 29, 1996, INS told us that it is continuing to develop and review options for the relocation of interior Border Patrol agent positions and plans to present to the Appropriations Committees an integrated plan addressing the entire relocation issue in mid-March.", "Fourteen of the 15 district directors with whom we met said that the Border Patrol contributed to their districts\u2019 enforcement efforts. Thirteen district directors said that if agents were redeployed or redirected, their districts would perform some of the work currently being performed by the Border Patrol if they received additional enforcement officers. The number and specific types of replacement immigration enforcement officers that they said would be needed varied depending on the work being performed by the Border Patrol within the various districts we visited. Eight district directors said that INS is currently hiring investigative aides to interview aliens in local jails and check employers\u2019 records, the same type of work that is currently performed by Border Patrol agents. However, INS has not determined whether the aides will supplement or replace Border Patrol agents.", "Thirteen district directors generally said that they would use replacement resources to continue to perform the inspections, detention, deportation, and employer and jail checks that the Border Patrol currently performs. They added that they would not use replacement resources to perform some lower priority enforcement work currently performed by the Border Patrol, such as patrolling the interior and randomly checking traffic, public transportation, and freight trains. In their districts, only the Border Patrol routinely conducted these types of activities. In doing so, the agents contributed to fulfilling the districts\u2019 enforcement responsibilities for apprehending and removing illegal aliens.", "Fourteen district directors said that in carrying out their enforcement activities, they relied on the Border Patrol because of their limited resources. For example, the Detroit District Director said that she relied on the Border Patrol to respond to complaints in western Michigan because she had no resources in that area. The San Francisco District Director said he relied on Border Patrol agents at the Bakersfield and Fresno stations to interview aliens at three state prisons. The Los Angeles District Director said he relied on Border Patrol agents from the Oxnard station to inspect about 15 ships per month at Port Hueneme. The Dallas District Director said that he relied on the Border Patrol to transport deportable aliens from Dallas to Laredo. The Helena District Director said that he relied on the Border Patrol to apprehend aliens who had received final orders of deportation, most of whom were in the Twin Falls, Idaho, area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Cost Factors Pertaining to Relocating Agents", "paragraphs": ["According to INS\u2019 fiscal year 1995 budget data, it costs almost twice as much to hire, train, and equip a new Border Patrol agent as it does to redeploy an agent. The average cost in fiscal year 1994\u2014the most recent year for which data were available\u2014was $59,638 to redeploy agents. In comparison, the budget data showed that the cost to hire, train, and equip one agent in fiscal year 1995 ranged from $107,840 to $115,716, depending on the agent\u2019s grade level.", "The cost information necessary to estimate all potential redeployment costs was not available. A complete cost analysis would require information on the number and types of replacement staff to be hired (their numbers, training costs, and salaries), the salary levels of agents to be moved compared to those of new agents, and other factors beyond the scope of this review.", "According to an INS official, the relocation of agents could result in INS closing some of its Border Patrol stations. Should this occur, INS could reduce some of its lease costs. For example, if INS were to close the Miami, Oklahoma, station, INS estimated that it would result in lease and other cost savings of $13,180 per year.

While 63 percent of all the agents\u2019 time was spent patrolling the border, the amount of time varied among zones and among stations within zones. Most agents at stations on the coastal borders and in zones II and III did not principally spend their time patrolling the border. While agents in zone I spent 76 percent of their time patrolling the border, the agents at the Southwest Border stations spent 83 percent of their time patrolling the border. Conversely, the agents on the Southwest Border spent 17 percent of their time (or 562,926 hours) apprehending illegal aliens after entry. These agents who are already located at the Southwest Border could have their time redirected to patrolling the border.", "Redeploying agents to the border or redirecting the enforcement time of agents on the border would affect the districts\u2019 enforcement capability. In some locations, Border Patrol agents are performing activities that parallel those carried out by Inspections or Investigations. In some cases, Border Patrol agents were performing activities that INS considers to be lower priority. However, the district directors generally said that the Border Patrol made a positive contribution to the districts\u2019 enforcement efforts and that redirecting agent time or redeploying agents, without replacing them, would diminish the districts\u2019 enforcement capabilities.", "INS budget data indicated that relocating agents to the border was less costly than hiring new agents. However, information was not available to fully estimate the potential costs for replacing agents with other INS enforcement officers. Information, such as how many redeployed or redirected agents would be replaced and what type of replacement staff would be used, would be needed to determine all relocation and redirection costs.", "The INS Commissioner favors redeploying Border Patrol agents to the border, if replacement enforcement officers are provided to carry out the work being performed by the agents at these interior locations.
