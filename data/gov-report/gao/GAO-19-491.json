This trend has occurred amid generally declining IRS resources and corresponds with an overall decrease in audit activity by IRS over recent years.", "IRS has a variety of programs working collectively to identify abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities, but some internal control weaknesses exist in its approach. For example, GAO found three ways that IRS data or programs were inconsistent with internal control standards for using quality information. First, database project codes used for identifying data on abusive tax schemes are not linked across IRS's audit divisions and do not consistently identify whether a tax-exempt entity was involved. Second, IRS has not leveraged a database with cross-divisional information to facilitate its analysis and monitoring of audit data across divisions. Finally, IRS has not used existing analytic tools to mine the narrative fields of tax forms. Doing so could provide audit leads on abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities. These deficiencies inhibit IRS's ability to identify abusive tax schemes and develop responses to those schemes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations to IRS to strengthen its internal controls, including that it link data across operating divisions, test the ability of a database to facilitate analysis of audit data, and use existing analytic tools to further mine information on tax forms.

Abusive tax schemes also contribute to the tax gap, which refers  to the difference between the taxes people and businesses owe, and  what they annually pay voluntarily and on time in the United States. In  2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated the average annual  gross tax gap for tax years 2008 through 2010 to be $458 billion.

Based on our review, we  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for showing trends in IRS\u2019s  compliance efforts. We identified audits with potential tax exempt entities  by selecting audits based on IRS project codes that IRS agreed were  relevant. We also matched the SB/SE and LB&I data with IRS\u2019s Form  8886 data file that identified tax-exempt entities.

The Brookings Institution estimated that  investments in syndicated conservation easements totaled $623 million in  2016, an increase of 29 percent from $484 million in 2015. It further  estimated that because tax deductions from syndicated conservation  easement contributions generate a benefit greater than the value of the  investments themselves, the tax deductions resulted in federal tax  revenue loss between $1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2015 and between  $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion in 2016.", "According to IRS, in a syndicated conservation easement, promoters  purchase land and convey ownership to a pass-through entity, such as a  partnership.

In its guidance, IRS said the  conservation easement becomes noncompliant if, for example, the  promoters obtain an appraisal that purports to be a qualified appraisal,  but that greatly inflates the value of the conservation easement based on  unreasonable assumptions about the development potential of the real  property. Because the promoters inflate the value of the property, the  investors may benefit by claiming a charitable deduction on their tax  returns that exceeds their initial investment.
