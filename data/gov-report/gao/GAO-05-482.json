For example, IRS has not implemented effective electronic access controls over its mainframe computing environment to logically separate its taxpayer data from FinCEN's Bank Secrecy Act data--two types of data with different security requirements. In addition, IRS has not effectively implemented certain other information security controls relating to physical security, segregation of duties, and service continuity at the facility. Collectively, these weaknesses increase the risk that sensitive taxpayer and Bank Secrecy Act data will be inadequately protected from unauthorized disclosure, modification, use, or destruction. Moreover, weaknesses in service continuity and business resumption plans heighten the risk that assets will be inadequately protected and controlled to ensure the continuity of operations when unexpected interruptions occur. An underlying cause of these information security control weaknesses is that IRS has not fully implemented certain elements of its agencywide information security program.

This type of  oversight is a fundamental element because it demonstrates management\u2019s  commitment to the security program, reminds employees of their roles and  responsibilities, and identifies and mitigates areas of noncompliance and  ineffectiveness. Although control tests and evaluations may encourage  compliance with security policies, the full benefits of such activities will  not be achieved unless the results improve the security program. Analyzing  the results of monitoring efforts\u2014as well as security reviews performed by  external audit organizations\u2014provides security specialists and business  managers with a means of identifying new problem areas, reassessing the  appropriateness of existing controls, and identifying the need for new  controls.", "IRS performs periodic testing and evaluation of its Unix, Windows, and  Mainframe systems. Specifically, IRS uses software tools and monitoring  reports to determine if its systems are in compliance with agency  information security policies, procedures, and practices. However, output  from these tools was not always reliable and accurate. Further, IRS did not  effectively audit and monitor the facility\u2019s information security systems.  Specifically, user activity on critical Unix systems were not being logged,  full auditing of system user rights was not always occurring, audit logs on  Windows servers were not always retained, and monitoring reports  detailing security-related events on mainframe computers were not always  complete.", "Until IRS fully implements an effective program, it will not be able to  ensure the security of its highly interconnected computer environment,  facilities, and resources. Moreover, IRS will not be able to ensure the  confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the sensitive financial, taxpayer,  and Bank Secrecy Act data that it processes, stores, and transmits. As a  result, IRS\u2019s operations and assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized  disclosure, manipulation, use, or destruction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Significant information security weaknesses exist at IRS that place  sensitive financial, taxpayer, and Bank Secrecy Act data at risk of  disclosure, modification, or loss, possibly without detection, and place  IRS\u2019s operations at risk of disruption. Specifically, IRS has not consistently  implemented effective electronic access controls, including user accounts  and passwords, access rights and permissions, and network security, or  fully implemented a program to audit and monitor access activity. In  addition, weaknesses in physical security, segregation of duties, and  service continuity increase the level of risk. Although IRS continues to  make progress in mitigating previously reported information security  weaknesses and implementing general controls over key financial and tax  processing systems at the facility, it has not taken all the necessary steps to  mitigate known information security control weaknesses and to ensure the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of taxpayer and Bank Secrecy Act  data. Consequently, taxpayer and Bank Secrecy Act data may have been  disclosed to unauthorized individuals. Ensuring that known weaknesses  affecting IRS\u2019s computing resources are promptly mitigated and that  general controls are effective to protect the facility\u2019s computing  environment require top management support and leadership, disciplined  processes, and consistent oversight. Until IRS takes steps to mitigate these  weaknesses and fully implements its agencywide information security  program, limited assurance exists that taxpayers\u2019 personal information and  IRS-processed law enforcement information will be adequately  safeguarded against unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help fully implement IRS\u2019s information security program, we  recommend that Secretary of the Treasury direct the IRS Commissioner to  take the following three actions:  Ensure that established security policies and procedures are  consistently followed and implemented.", "Ensure that employees with significant information security  responsibilities are provided the sufficient training and understand their  role in implementing security related policies and controls.", "Implement an ongoing process of testing and evaluating IRS\u2019s  information systems to ensure compliance with established policies and  procedures.", "In addition, we recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury direct the  IRS Commissioner to perform an assessment to determine whether  taxpayer data has been disclosed to unauthorized individuals.", "Further, we recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury direct the  FinCEN Director to perform an assessment to determine whether Bank  Secrecy Act data have been disclosed to unauthorized individuals.", "We are also making recommendations in a separate report designated for  \u201cLimited Official Use Only.\u201d These recommendations address actions  needed to correct the specific information security weaknesses related to  electronic access controls and other information system controls at the  facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In providing written comments on a draft of this report (reprinted in  app. I), the Acting Deputy Secretary of the Treasury generally concurred  with our recommendations in both the public and Limited Official Use Only  reports and identified specific corrective actions that IRS has taken or  plans to take to address the recommendations.", "The Acting Deputy Secretary of the Treasury concurred with our  recommendation to take several actions to fully implement an effective  agencywide information security program.
