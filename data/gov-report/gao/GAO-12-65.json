The FTC's Funeral Rule requires that, among other things, funeral providers give consumers lists that disclose the cost of funeral goods and services before they enter into funeral transactions. Proposed legislation introduced in March 2011 would increase the federal governments role in regulating the industry by, among other things, requiring that the FTC regulate aspects of cemetery operations.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) continues to annually conduct undercover shopping at various funeral homes to test compliance with the Funeral Rule. Of the over 2,400 funeral homes that the FTC shopped since 1996, the FTC reported an overall compliance rate of about 85 percent. With respect to state regulation, consistent with GAO\u0092s findings in 2003, the way in which states regulate the industry varies across industry segments and states. Also, the extent to which state regulators reported that they had specific rules or regulations for each industry segment in both 2003 and 2011 varied. Most consistent across states in both years was reporting that there were specific rules or regulations for funeral homes (94 and 95 percent in 2003 and 2011, respectively). In contrast, 77 percent of state regulators of cemeteries reported that their states had specific rules or regulations for cemeteries in 2003, and 88 percent reported this in 2011. Certain state regulators also reported that their states made various statutory or regulatory changes since 2003, primarily to clarify legislation or regulation or to enhance consumer protections, and that they believe these changes strengthened their regulatory program to varying degrees.

For example, the Rule declares it an unfair  or deceptive act or practice for funeral providers\u2014that is, any business  that sells or offers to sell both funeral goods and funeral services to the  public\u2014to (1) fail to furnish accurate itemized price information to funeral  consumers; (2) misrepresent federal, state, local, or other requirements  related to the provision of funeral goods and services; (3) require  consumers to purchase items they do not want to buy; and (4) embalm  deceased human remains for a fee without authorization.other things, compliance with the Funeral Rule requires that funeral  providers furnish consumers with various price lists. For example, at the  beginning of the discussion about arrangements for funeral goods and  services, funeral providers must provide the consumer an itemized  general price list. Funeral providers must also provide the consumer a  casket price list before showing casket options. FTC staff opinions have  also clarified various aspects of the Funeral Rule. For example, FTC staff  opinions have provided that if a consumer purchases a casket from a  third party vendor, a funeral provider cannot require a consumer\u2019s  presence when the casket is delivered to the funeral home or charge a  fee for certain services, such as storage of third-party caskets delivered a  few days before they are needed.", "Beginning in October 1994, the FTC initiated a test-shopping enforcement  approach, called sweeps, targeting funeral homes in a particular region,  state, or city.

In 1996, the  FTC implemented the Funeral Rule Offenders Program as a nonlitigation  alternative to civil penalty actions for Rule violations. Under this  program, violators of the Funeral Rule are offered the option to attend the  Funeral Rule Offenders Program.

For example, if  a commercial cemetery provides funeral services and offers or sells funeral goods, it  would be obligated to comply with the Rule. A 2008 FTC opinion (Opinion 08-1) provided  that a crematory must comply with the Funeral Rule if it offers and sells cremation  services and any funeral goods, such as caskets, alternative containers, or urns.

Several state and industry officials stated that the increase in  cremations can partially be attributed to the downturn in the economy and  increased social acceptance of cremation. With the rise in cremations,  officials from the Cremation Association of North America stated that the  weakened economy has contributed to crematories hiring cheap,  untrained labor, which may create accidents or problems and that  regulation of this segment of the industry has not kept pace with the  increase in cremations.

For example,  Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, Tennessee, and Wisconsin require pre-need  sellers to submit annual reports that state regulators review for various  things, such as if funds were properly trusted and abnormal fluctuation in  funds. Tennessee also examines pre-need sellers every year, and  Colorado also examines the records of pre-need sellers every 5 years.  Twenty-five of the 38 state regulators who responded to our question  about violations reported tracking violations regarding the sales of pre- need plans. Fifteen state regulators provided data on the approximate  number of violations identified since 2008\u20145 reported no violations, 4  reported between 1 to 5 violations, 4 reported between 50 and 134  violations, 1 reported 379 violations, and another reported 1,578  violations during this time. Of the 17 state regulators who provided  narrative responses to our survey about the most frequent violations they  identify, violations related to improper trusting or misappropriating funds  were frequently cited by state regulators as being a common violation.  Other violations mentioned included record keeping issues, unlicensed  practice, and contract issues. Finally, 24 of 38 state regulators who  responded to our question about taking enforcement actions against  sellers of pre-need plans reported that they have taken some actions  since 2008, including actions ranging from notices of non-compliance to  revocation or suspension of licenses and civil or criminal prosecutions.  According to a state regulator in one of our case study states, although  the state has revoked about four to five licenses in the last 10 years with  the assistance of the attorney general\u2019s office, the state regulatory agency  is very limited in the disciplinary actions it is authorized to take and the  process is very slow and costly.", "In addition, some state regulators reported having other consumer  protections in their states with respect to sales of pre-need plans\u2014 including consumer protection accounts, trusting requirements, and  cancellation and transferability of contracts\u2014although these also varied  by state. The following briefly discusses each.", "Consumer protection account. A consumer protection account collects  and maintains funds for the benefit and protection of consumers of pre- need plans. Of the 40 state regulators who responded to this issue on our  survey, 10 reported that their state has a consumer protection fund that  would protect consumers of pre-need plans who suffered financial losses  because of issues such as fraud, default, or insolvency. Three of our five  case study states reported maintaining consumer protection accounts,  although the purpose of these accounts varied. For example, in Illinois  and Oregon, funds from these accounts are used for consumer  restitution, while in Tennessee, funds from this account are used to  support general operation and expenses of the state regulator, as well as  any receivership actions initiated. The 9 state regulators who provided  data on the maximum amount of funds available in their state\u2019s consumer  protection account since 2003 reported having between $30,000 and   $1.5 million.", "Trusting requirements. Trusting requirements refer to the amounts of  funds from pre-need sales that are required to be deposited into a trust  account. Whereas each state\u2019s laws or regulations will dictate applicable  trusting requirements, in general, the seller of pre-need goods or services  must deposit a specified percentage of a pre-need sale into a trust  account to cover the costs of funeral goods and services at the time of  death. Of the state regulators who responded to this issue on our survey,  33 of 38 reported that they have specific trusting requirements, although  the percentage of pre-need sales revenue that is required to be trusted  for funeral and cemetery goods and services varies.

Eighteen of the 39 state regulators who reported on whether their state  tracked the amount of funds invested in pre-need plans stated that they  did track this amount, and 9 reported the amount of funds invested in pre- need plans in 2010, which ranged from $100,000 to $2.9 billion. (See  app. II for more information on this issue.) Based on information obtained  from our case study states, individual contracts may also be tracked in  states. In Oregon, for example, sellers of pre-need plans are required to  provide numbers for each contract in consecutive order to help ensure  that each contract can be tracked.", "Finally, most state regulators reported that they track consumer  complaints regarding sales of pre-need plans and reported receiving  some complaints. Specifically, 27 of the 39 state regulators who  responded to this issue on our survey reported that their state tracks  consumer complaints. For the years 2008, 2009, and 2010, state  regulators generally reported that their state received between 0 and 25  complaints, approximately, in each respective year regarding sellers of  pre-need plans\u2014although 2 state regulators reported that their state  received more than 25 complaints in all 3 years, with 180 complaints  being the highest number reported in all 3 years.

The bulk of the survey questions were taken from our 2003 survey and  were pretested at that time. We wanted to keep many of the original  questions without changing them in order to compare the results of the  two surveys. In selecting the pretest states we identified several key  criteria that guided our selection process. The criteria included   (1) ensuring that the state regulates the segment of the industry that the  survey addresses and (2) ensuring that the state has made regulatory  changes since 2003\u2014so that relevant questions would not be skipped  during our pretests. We conducted pretests by phone with officials from  Washington State to pretest the funeral home survey, Virginia for the  cemetery survey, Kansas for the crematory survey, Mississippi and  Louisiana for the sales of pre-need plans survey, and South Carolina for  the third party sellers survey.

To develop an accurate e-mail  contact list of state regulatory officials for each of the five segments of the  death care industry for all 50 states, we used multiple sources.

These other regulator contact lists  included our 2003 survey contact list and lists from other national  regulator, industry, and consumer associations, including the International  Conference of Funeral Service Examining Boards, the Cremation  Association of North America, and the Funeral Ethics Organization. We  then used our consolidated list to contact, confirm, and update the list of  state regulators who would receive our surveys. We contacted the  individuals on this list by phone or e-mail to ensure that they were the  proper contacts regarding regulation of the identified industry segment.  We attempted to identify officials with direct responsibility for regulation.  For some states, this meant we identified a number of different officials as  survey recipients because some industry segments were regulated by  different state entities. In other states, this meant we identified one official  as the survey recipient for all five surveys in the state because one entity  was responsible for regulation of all segments of the death care industry.  However, if the state did not regulate a specific industry segment we  sought out the office most appropriate to respond to our questions. In  some states more than one entity regulated the same industry segment,  and we selected an official from only one entity to respond to our survey.  As such, we only collected information from one of the regulatory  entities.", "Survey time frames and response rates. To ensure that we obtained  the highest response rate possible, we made the web-based surveys  available to the designated state contacts from April 14, 2011, through  June 20, 2011.

In analyzing the five surveys, we computed descriptive  statistics for all closed-ended survey questions, providing the frequency of  specific responses as a proportion of the total number of states for which  the question applied. We also developed a closed-ended question data  run for each of our five case study states that completed an industry  segment survey, and we developed a close-ended data run for each  question by state to be included in the e-supplement companion to the  report. Open-ended survey responses were compiled for each of the five  segment surveys and reviewed for content. In addition, open-ended  responses for the most prevalent types of violations were compiled for all  states that responded to the question. We also analyzed and compared  the responses for survey data for selected questions to the responses we  received in 2003. Differences in the responses from year to year could be  attributable to the fact that different states responded in 2003 and 2011.  Specifically, depending on the industry segment, 85 to 98 percent of  those that responded to our 2011 survey also responded to our survey in  2003.", "Since this was not a sample survey, there are no sampling errors;  however, the practical difficulties of conducting a survey may introduce  errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors.

We took  steps in developing the questionnaires, collecting the data, and analyzing  them to minimize such nonsampling errors. For example, as mentioned  earlier, the surveys were developed by our survey specialist in  collaboration with our staff with subject matter expertise. In addition, as  stated earlier, we pretested the surveys with various states to ensure that  the questions were clear and concise. Since this was a web-based  survey, respondents entered their answers directly into the electronic  questionnaire, eliminating the need to key data into a database,  minimizing the opportunity for error.

Generally, the pre-need contract is between the  individual for whom the services will be provided and the funeral director  or cemetery operator. The options for paying pre-need expenses vary  from state to state, and according to industry information and state  regulators we contacted, the most commonly used options are trust  accounts and insurance policies. Upon the individual\u2019s death, the  representative of the funeral home or cemetery uses the trusted funds or  the amount covered by the insurance policy to provide the designated  goods and services.", "With an insurance-funded plan, generally the consumer purchases,  either in a lump sum or by installments, an insurance policy that upon  the consumer\u2019s death is paid out to provide the goods and services as  specified in the contract. These pre-need insurance policies typically have an increasing death benefit to cover future increases in the  prices of funeral goods and services.", "With a trust-funded plan, the seller is generally required to deposit a  certain percentage of the funds into a trust that is established in  accordance with state law and managed by one or several trustees.  State laws vary on how much of the pre-need funds must be placed  into a trust, who can qualify as a trustee\u2014such as a bank or other  financial institution\u2014and who receives any interest earned on a trust  account. The rationale behind this funding method is that interest  earned on the trust account will accumulate over time and can be  used to cover all or most of any increases in the cost of the goods and  services purchased between the time the trust is established and the  goods and services are provided, which may be a number of years.", "According to state regulators from our five case study states, they have  seen more insurance-funded pre-need contracts than trust-funded  contracts in recent years.

Another form of death care service  is cemetery perpetual care, also called endowment care. This differs from  pre-need plans in that it does not involve direct care of the individual at  the time of death.

For example,  Massachusetts informs consumers that if they wish to prepay for their  funerals, the funeral director is to provide a standardized contract  approved by the Board of Registration in Embalming and Funeral  Directing, which includes an itemized statement of funeral goods and  services that is FTC compliant, and a trust document with a bank or  insurance policy.

The indictment also alleged that company employees used  white-out or cross-outs to change the names of beneficiaries on pre-need  insurance applications, including naming the company as sole  beneficiary, in order to extract money without the customers\u2019 knowledge.  Additionally, the indictment alleged that the defendants concealed their  practices from insurance regulators.

The press release further states that as a result of  these transfers, $20 million of the fund were lost.
