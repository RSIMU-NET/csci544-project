In addition, the OIG did not adopt these CIGIE standards in its policies and procedures. Instead, the current IG emphasized \u201ccontinuous review\u201d of mega projects, which he defined as an effort to alert AOC and the Congress of contract management issues as they occurred. This approach and the prior IG's efforts did not result in any audit reports of AOC's mega projects during fiscal years 2012 through 2015. The OIG also reported a decline in total audit reports and monetary accomplishments of potential dollar savings during fiscal years 2014 and 2015 (see table). Further, the OIG provided only one audit report of an AOC jurisdiction program during the 4-year period. Because of incomplete plans, a limited number of audit reports, and the lack of audit reports of AOC's mega projects, AOC and the Congress did not have the full benefit of OIG findings and recommendations and were not kept fully and currently informed of possible AOC problems and deficiencies during the 4-year period.", "In fiscal year 2014, the IG rescinded the OIG's law enforcement authority and removed the OIG investigators' responsibility to complete criminal investigations. Instead, the OIG's investigators have responsibility for administrative investigations and rely primarily on the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) to perform criminal investigations, and on occasion other AOC program offices perform their own investigations. USCP and AOC program offices are not subject to CIGIE standards. The OIG is required to follow CIGIE standards for investigations.

According to USCP officials, USCP is the only law  enforcement agency with primary law enforcement authority for the U.S.  Capitol buildings and grounds. In addition, USCP statutory authority  extends to the protection of congressional members, officers, visitors, and  facilities, which includes performing criminal investigations relating to  AOC and other Capitol Hill entities. USCP officials confirmed that USCP  does not have access to AOC\u2019s internal systems and therefore cannot  develop leads for proactive criminal investigations of fraud in AOC\u2019s  program management and contracting areas without being granted such  access. Instead, USCP investigations are focused on criminal allegations  referred to it by the OIG. USCP officials stated that USCP personnel have  extensive training in performing criminal investigations. OIGs are required  to follow CIGIE\u2019s Quality Standards for Investigations when they conduct  investigations, which contain, among other things, explicit requirements  for investigator independence, objectivity, and due professional care. As  mentioned previously, AOC OIG has incorporated these investigative  standards into its policies and procedures. Although USCP is not subject  to CIGIE\u2019s investigative standards, USCP officials stated that the  requirements in CIGIE\u2019s investigative standards are required for all of its  criminal investigations and are integral to USCP directives, processes,  policies, and procedures.", "In addition to the IG\u2019s elimination of the OIG investigators\u2019 responsibility to  complete criminal investigations, the AOC OIG also changed its  investigative operations with respect to noncriminal investigations.  According to OIG investigators, shortly after the current IG took office,  they were told in a meeting with the IG that senior AOC leadership would  need to build its own investigative capabilities because the OIG would no  longer handle many issues it previously investigated. Also, in the  semiannual report for the period ending fiscal year 2014, the IG  emphasized that the OIG would defer to AOC supporting offices in the  absence of reasonable cause to believe complaints of alleged fraud,  waste, and abuse of government resources. Consequently, the OIG may  refer allegations of noncriminal wrongdoing to AOC\u2019s program offices for  investigation and rely on the investigative capabilities developed by  AOC\u2019s program offices. The review of allegations by other AOC offices is  often appropriate when administrative actions can address the issues  without OIG assistance. For example, AOC\u2019s policies specify that  individual complaints of discrimination or retaliation, individual employee  benefits and compensation issues, individual grievances, individual  workplace conflicts, matters covered in the collective bargaining  agreement, or complaints regarding workplace safety and health or  environmental issues are addressed by AOC offices in association with  the Office of Compliance. The AOC IG Act allows the IG to exercise  judgment when determining whether to conduct an OIG investigation.  However, according to OIG investigators, the IG has also encouraged  AOC program offices to conduct their own investigations, which can result  in these offices addressing wrongdoing in areas outlined in the OIG\u2019s  policies and procedures as OIG responsibilities regarding fraud, waste,  and abuse. The program offices are not subject to explicit policies  requiring independence, objectivity, and due professional care, which are  requirements under CIGIE\u2019s investigative standards for OIGs.", "To illustrate, the OIG under the prior IG conducted investigations of  alleged abuses of worker\u2019s compensation benefits by employees who  filed potentially fraudulent claims. The OIG investigations conducted  under the prior IG found that these employees were not always potentially  eligible for worker\u2019s compensation benefits. However, the AOC Human  Capital Management Division is responsible for investigations of worker\u2019s  compensation issues. The Human Capital Management Division awarded  a 1-year contract for $150,000 in August 2015 to a private investigative  firm to perform the surveillance work once done by OIG investigators and  to determine whether AOC employees have filed false claims in order to  collect worker\u2019s compensation or disability benefits. Since these  investigations are not being performed by the OIG, they are not subject to  CIGIE standards requiring independence, objectivity, or due professional  care, which are among the requirements for investigations performed by  the OIG. Human Capital Management Division officials stated that any  suspected criminal violations would be referred to the OIG; however,  under the IG\u2019s current investigative operations, even if such criminal  referrals were made they would not be investigated by the OIG but rather  referred to USCP.", "In another example, the OIG referred allegations of potential ethics  violations to the AOC Office of General Counsel for investigation, even  though such cases are consistent with the OIG\u2019s responsibilities to  investigate fraud, waste, and abuse. By referring these allegations to the  Office of General Counsel for investigation, the resulting investigations  are subject to neither CIGIE investigative standards for independence,  objectivity, and due professional care nor the AOC IG Act, which requires  the OIG to safeguard the identity of complainants. The lack of a statutory  protection may hinder complainants from coming forward with information  about potential wrongdoing within AOC. To illustrate, we reviewed an  investigative case file provided by OIG investigators indicating that the  OIG had received an allegation about a potential violation of AOC orders  that prohibit using public office for private gain by the complainant\u2019s  supervisor. Such violations of abuse are specified by OIG policies and  procedures as matters the OIG investigates. However, the IG determined  this allegation was an ethical matter to be investigated by the AOC Office  of General Counsel. Upon learning that the AOC Office of General  Counsel rather than the OIG would be performing the investigation,  according to the case file, the complainant withdrew the allegation  because of fear of possible repercussions for moving forward with the  case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investigative Changes Contributed to a Decline of Reports and Accomplishments", "paragraphs": ["Although the OIG continues to perform investigations, the IG\u2019s changes in  investigative operations have contributed in part to a significant decline in  the number of investigative reports and monetary accomplishments  reported by the OIG. To illustrate, under the prior IG, the OIG issued 53  investigative reports in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, compared to 23  reports in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 under the current IG, an almost 60  percent reduction. Also, as illustrated in table 4, since fiscal year 2013 the  reported monetary accomplishments from investigations have declined  from approximately $444,930 to approximately $7,260 in fiscal year 2015,  as the current IG\u2019s changes to investigative operations gradually became  effective.", "In fiscal year 2015, the OIG reported monetary accomplishments that  accounted for less than 1 percent of the 4-year total reported by both IGs.  In addition, the OIG had previously provided management advisories,  which reported internal control weaknesses identified by investigations;  however, it did not issue any management advisory reports in fiscal year  2015.", "The AOC OIG has voluntarily agreed to be a part of the CIGIE peer  review process, which includes a review of its investigative operations by  another OIG. The primary purpose of CIGIE peer reviews is to determine  whether OIGs have consistently applied CIGIE\u2019s Quality Standards for  Investigations. However, the OIG\u2019s reliance on investigations by other  entities will not necessarily be included in CIGIE\u2019s peer review process.  For example, the investigative operations of USCP when addressing  criminal allegations and the investigations performed by AOC\u2019s program  offices, such as the Human Capital Management Division, would not be  included in a peer review of the AOC OIG\u2019s investigations. We discussed  the objectives and scope of CIGIE\u2019s investigative peer reviews with the  outside OIG scheduled to perform the AOC OIG\u2019s next review. We  concluded that the issues raised in our report could be included within the  scope of a peer review if expanded to include consideration of the OIG\u2019s  reliance on investigations provided by USCP, AOC\u2019s Human Capital  Management Division, the Office of General Counsel, and any additional  AOC program offices that perform investigations of potential fraud, waste,  and abuse."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Congress passed legislation establishing the AOC OIG, in part, to  address the cost overruns and time delays of AOC projects, such as  those found during the construction of the CVC, and the failure of  appropriate oversight responsibilities. In addition, the stated purposes of  the AOC OIG as established by the AOC IG Act include OIG audits and  investigations and for the OIG to keep the Architect and the Congress  fully and currently informed through semiannual reports and otherwise  concerning fraud and other serious problems, abuses, and deficiencies.  The Congress also intended the AOC OIG to promote economy and  efficiency in AOC programs and to detect and prevent fraud, waste, and  abuse.", "During fiscal years 2012 through 2015, the AOC OIG issued no audit  reports of AOC\u2019s mega projects, which have an estimated combined cost  of over $1 billion. In addition, the current IG\u2019s emphasis on the continuous  review of specific mega projects since fiscal year 2014 contributed to this  outcome. During the same 4-year period, the OIG provided only one audit  report that addressed a single program among all the programs provided  by AOC\u2019s 10 jurisdictions, and reported a declining number of other audit  reports accompanied by a corresponding decline in the reported amount  of monetary accomplishments. As a result of the OIG\u2019s minimal audit  report coverage, the Architect and the Congress may not be fully and  currently informed about the operations of AOC\u2019s jurisdictions, offices,  and major contracts. The OIG\u2019s efforts during the 4-year period, including  its continuous review of mega projects, did not have audit plans that were  based on an assessment of risk or assignment of priorities. This is in part  because the OIG has not adopted CIGIE\u2019s Quality Standards for Federal  Offices of Inspector General that includes these requirements for planning  audits, investigations, and evaluations based on an assessment of  agency risk and priority of efforts. Without policies and procedures for  complete OIG plans with an assessment of AOC\u2019s risks and established  priorities to help direct its resources, the OIG can provide little assurance  that it will provide future audit reports that address AOC\u2019s most critical  areas.", "In addition, the current IG rescinded the OIG\u2019s law enforcement authority  and removed its investigators\u2019 responsibility to complete investigations of  potential criminal allegations, resulting in these allegations being referred  to USCP for investigation. Furthermore, under the IG\u2019s changes, AOC  program offices can perform their own investigations of alleged  wrongdoing in areas that can include the OIG\u2019s responsibilities under its  current policies regarding fraud, waste, and abuse. USCP and AOC  program offices are not subject to CIGIE\u2019s Quality Standards for  Investigations. The OIG is subject to CIGIE\u2019s standards that require  investigations to be objective, independent, and consistent with due  professional care, and to AOC IG Act requirements that complainants\u2019  identities be protected. The current IG\u2019s changes have contributed, at  least in part, to fewer investigative reports and monetary  accomplishments and may hinder potential complainants from coming  forward with allegations of wrongdoing. As a result, the OIG\u2019s practices  raise questions about whether the OIG is carrying out its work in a way  that fulfills the Congress\u2019s original intent regarding the oversight of AOC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making two recommendations to the AOC OIG regarding its   (1) audit planning and (2) investigative operations.", "To provide increased oversight of AOC and to keep the Architect and  the Congress fully and currently informed, we recommend that the  AOC OIG revise and implement policies and procedures to provide  audit reports that are based on planning that includes an assessment  of risk and the assignment of priorities, consistent with requirements  in CIGIE\u2019s Quality Standards for Federal Offices of Inspector General.", "To reduce the risk that fraud, waste, and abuse and criminal activities  are not detected or fully addressed, we recommend that (1) the AOC  OIG work with CIGIE to obtain a peer review from another federal OIG  of the AOC OIG\u2019s overall investigative operations, including  consideration of the OIG\u2019s reliance on investigations performed by  other entities, and (2) make any needed changes in its operating  procedures based on the results of the review to help ensure that  investigations of AOC are conducted in accordance with CIGIE  standards for investigations and AOC IG Act requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the AOC OIG for review and  comment. In written comments reprinted in appendix V, the AOC OIG  agreed with the two recommendations and stated that it would implement  them. The AOC OIG also provided information on changes made in late  2015 and 2016, which was after our review period. Although these  changes were outside the scope of our work, our report acknowledges  the hiring of a civil engineer in fiscal year 2016 and the issuance of two  reports on AOC mega projects, also in fiscal year 2016. The OIG  acknowledged our findings on audit planning and the number of audit  reports on AOC\u2019s major construction projects and jurisdictions and stated  that the OIG has now moved away from an approach that appeared to  simply monitor projects and will incorporate a more formal risk  assessment and prioritization process into its audit planning. We also  received technical comments from the AOC OIG, which were addressed  as appropriate. However, the OIG disagreed with a number of the  statements and findings in the report related to its investigative  operations, as discussed below. The USCP General Counsel also  provided technical comments on behalf of USCP, which were addressed  as appropriate.", "In its written response, the AOC OIG stated that a CIGIE investigative  program review had been scheduled to be completed in fiscal year 2016,  and that without advance notice to the AOC OIG, the GAO review team  requested that the designated CIGIE OIG peer review team suspend its  activities pending the completion of this GAO audit. As we state in our  report, our purpose in contacting the OIG peer reviewer was to determine  the extent to which the AOC OIG\u2019s investigative operations would be  included in a peer review. The peer review had not yet begun when we  met with the OIG peer reviewer, who provided information on CIGIE\u2019s  peer review process. We did not request that the peer review be  suspended or postponed. We also discussed the ability of the peer review  to include the OIG\u2019s overall investigative operations, including  consideration of the OIG\u2019s reliance on investigations performed by other  entities.", "In its written comments, the AOC OIG also stated that the GAO draft  confuses program responsibilities with investigative responsibilities and  that the OIG does not rely on agency program offices to perform OIG  investigations. The OIG commented that AOC program offices do not  investigate any allegations of fraud, waste, or abuse for the OIG and that  the AOC OIG is the only office responsible for performing such  investigations pursuant to the IG Act. The OIG added that it is the only  AOC office that can guarantee confidentiality to employees and other  witnesses. The OIG concluded that GAO\u2019s factual findings in this area are  mistaken and not supported. Our report discusses AOC\u2019s policies  applicable to the OIG that specify the issues that program offices can and  should address, and the issues of fraud, waste, and abuse that are  specifically OIG responsibilities. Our report provides examples of AOC  program offices that have addressed wrongdoing in areas of OIG  responsibilities regarding fraud, waste, or abuse. These examples are  based on our review of documentation in the OIG\u2019s case files.  Specifically, as noted in our report, we reviewed an investigative case file  provided by OIG investigators indicating that the OIG had received an  allegation about a supervisor\u2019s potential violation of AOC orders that  prohibit using public office for private gain. Such violations of abuse are  specified by OIG policies and procedures as matters the OIG  investigates. However, the OIG determined that this allegation would be  investigated by the AOC Office of General Counsel. In another example,  we obtained documentation from the Human Capital Management  Division of its contract for $150,000 in August 2015 for a private  investigative firm to perform the surveillance work once done by OIG  investigators, to determine whether AOC employees have filed false  claims in order to collect worker\u2019s compensation or disability benefits.  Based on these examples, AOC program offices may have investigated  matters of fraud, waste, and abuse, which are specifically OIG  responsibilities. The OIG agreed with our recommendation to work with  CIGIE to obtain a peer review of the AOC OIG\u2019s investigative operations,  including consideration of the OIG\u2019s reliance on investigations performed  by other entities.", "The AOC OIG stated that our draft report rejects the OIG\u2019s reliance on the  law enforcement authority of USCP and that this is contrary to law. Our  report does not assess and therefore provides no opinion on the law  enforcement authority of USCP and how these investigations were  handled or resolved. Contrary to the OIG\u2019s assertion, our report  specifically addresses the OIG\u2019s investigative process, including the  referral of matters for investigation, relative to CIGIE\u2019s quality standards.  In addition, our report does not address whether the policies and  procedures of USCP align with CIGIE standards on how referrals are to  be handled. Also, as stated in our report, the AOC OIG had law  enforcement authority, which includes the authority to carry firearms,  already in place when the current IG entered office in September 2013,  which he rescinded based on reasons outlined in our report. In addition,  the Attorney General had previously determined under the criteria laid out  in Section 6 of the IG Act that law enforcement authority was appropriate  for the AOC OIG. We did not assess this determination.", "The AOC OIG also provided several comments about the qualifications of  USCP, citing its accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation for Law  Enforcement Agencies, Inc. The OIG includes the attributes for  accreditation, which included among others, professionalism,  independence, and objectivity. As stated in our report, our focus was on  OIG investigations and specifically how OIG investigations follow quality  standards provided by CIGIE, which were established, in part, to help  ensure the independence of OIG investigative efforts. Based on technical  comments provided by the USCP General Counsel on behalf of USCP  officials, we added certain information regarding requirements of USCP\u2019s  criminal investigations. However, we did not audit USCP or the policies  and procedures that apply to its investigations. AOC OIG has  responsibility for ensuring that its investigations comply with applicable  standards. It is for these reasons that we have recommended that the  AOC OIG work with CIGIE to obtain a peer review from another federal  OIG of the AOC OIG\u2019s overall investigative operations, including  consideration of the OIG\u2019s reliance on investigations performed by other  entities, and make any needed changes in its operating procedures  based on the results of the review to help ensure that investigations of  AOC are conducted in accordance with CIGIE standards for  investigations and AOC IG Act requirements.
