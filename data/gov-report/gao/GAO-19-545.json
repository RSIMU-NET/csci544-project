In April 2019, NIST issued a  discussion draft for its privacy framework. According to the discussion  draft, NIST will use feedback received on the discussion draft to develop  a preliminary draft of the privacy framework, which is intended to assist  organizations in identifying, assessing, and responding to privacy risks.  Further, the framework is intended to foster the development of innovative  approaches to protecting individuals\u2019 privacy and increase trust in  systems, products and services.

Further, while agencies indicated that the collaborative CyberStat  engagements with DHS and OMB have aided with their FISMA  implementation, the number of these engagements has declined  significantly. In addition, the OMB-approved metrics that inspectors  general use to evaluate FISMA implementation do not include one of the  elements\u2014system security plans\u2014required by FISMA for information  security programs.
