In recent years, SSA instituted mandatory antifraud training, established a centralized antifraud office to coordinate and oversee the agency's fraud risk management activities, and communicated the importance of antifraud efforts. These actions are generally consistent with GAO's Fraud Risk Framework, a set of leading practices that can serve as a guide for program managers to use when developing antifraud efforts in a strategic way. However, SSA's new antifraud office, the Office of Anti-Fraud Programs (OAFP), faced challenges establishing itself as the coordinating body for the agency's antifraud initiatives. For example, the OAFP has had multiple acting leaders, but SSA recently appointed a permanent leader of OAFP to provide accountability for the agency's antifraud activities.", "SSA has taken steps to identify and address fraud risks in its disability programs, but it has not yet comprehensively assessed these fraud risks or developed a strategic approach to help ensure its antifraud activities effectively mitigate those risks. Over the last year, SSA gathered information about fraud risks, but these efforts generally have not been systematic and did not assess the likelihood, impact, or significance of all risks that were identified. SSA also has several prevention and detection activities in place to address known fraud risks in its disability programs such as fraud examination units, which review disability claims to help detect fraud perpetrated by third parties. However, SSA has not developed and documented an overall antifraud strategy that aligns its antifraud activities to its fraud risks. Leading practices call for federal program managers to conduct a fraud risk assessment and develop a strategy to address identified fraud risks. Without conducting a fraud risk assessment that aligns with leading practices and developing an antifraud strategy, SSA's disability programs may remain vulnerable to new fraud schemes, and SSA will not be able to effectively prioritize its antifraud activities.", "SSA monitors its antifraud activities through the OAFP and its National Anti-Fraud Committee (NAFC), which serves as an advisory board to the OAFP, but the agency does not have effective performance metrics to evaluate the effect of such activities. The OAFP has responsibility for monitoring SSA's antifraud activities and establishing performance and outcome-oriented goals for them. It collects metrics to inform reports about its antifraud initiatives, and the NAFC receives regular updates about antifraud initiatives. However, the quality of the metrics varies across initiatives and some initiatives do not have metrics. Of the 17 initiatives listed in SSA's 2015 report on antifraud initiatives, 10 had metrics that did not focus on outcomes, and 4 did not have any metrics. For example, SSA lacks a metric to help monitor the effectiveness of its fraud examination units. Leading practices in fraud risk management call for managers to monitor and evaluate antifraud initiatives with a focus on measuring outcomes. Without outcome-oriented performance metrics, SSA may not be able to evaluate its antifraud activities, review progress, and determine whether changes are necessary."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends SSA (1) conduct a comprehensive fraud risk assessment for its disability programs, (2) develop a corresponding antifraud strategy, (3) develop outcome-oriented metrics for antifraud activities, and (4) review progress and change activities as necessary.

In addition, leading  practices call for the designated antifraud entity to, among other things,  serve as the repository of knowledge on fraud risks and controls and lead  or assist with trainings and other fraud-awareness activities. Since the  OAFP was established, the office has performed several of these  activities. For example, the OAFP has taken steps to coordinate antifraud  initiatives across SSA by gathering information about progress on the  initiatives, and has helped create antifraud training materials for the  agency.

SSA\u2019s plans state that it will use information produced by its data- analytics system to assist with its risk assessments but, as discussed  below, this data-analytics system is in the early stages of development  and it may be years before the system produces information on disability  fraud schemes and trends that could be incorporated into a fraud risk  assessment. According to a senior OAFP official, the risk-assessment  effort is on hold because the OAFP is focusing its staff resources on  developing its data-analytics system.

Unit  leaders screen referrals and, if the case is accepted, law-enforcement  officers conduct an investigation. Staff from one CDI unit we  interviewed said they spend more investigative resources on cases  that could have more of a financial effect, such as younger individuals  who could potentially receive more benefits over their lifetimes. After  an investigation, CDI units prepare a summary report of their findings  that DDS or SSA staff are required to consider in making a disability  determination, which could help prevent or stop fraudulent benefits  from being paid.", "Categories of Fraud Control Activities  Control activities for managing fraud risks fall  into three general categories\u2014prevention,  detection, and response. These categories  are interdependent, and activities can often  serve more than one purpose.  Fraud prevention activities include efforts to  mitigate the risk of fraud occurring or to  identify potential fraud before making  payments.  Fraud detection activities help discover fraud  that has already occurred.  Response activities include actions to  address instances of potential fraud, such as  referring potential fraud cases for investigation  and prosecution, as well as actions to remedy  the harm caused by proven fraud.  Preventive activities generally offer the most  cost efficient use of resources, since they  enable managers to avoid a costly and  inefficient \u201cpay-and-chase\u201d model in which  fraudulent transactions are detected and then  attempts are made to recover funds after  payments have occurred.", "Fraud examination units: SSA established fraud examination units in  2014.

The units are staffed with  SSA disability examiners from regional offices who assist the OIG with  disability fraud investigations involving third parties and help  reevaluate disability claims that could have been affected by known  fraudsters. For example, unit staff can analyze groups of potentially  fraudulent cases to identify trends or suspicious information, such as  inconsistencies, altered medical records, or similar or identical  medical evidence used in multiple claims. After their analysis,  examiners share their findings with the OIG to consider in its  investigation. In addition, fraud examination unit staff reevaluate  disability claims that have evidence from third parties involved in fraud  schemes, such as a case that was uncovered in Puerto Rico where  third-party facilitators conspired with claimants to submit evidence for  fabricated or exaggerated disabilities, resulting in 27 defendants  sentenced as of September 2014, according to a report from SSA\u2019s  OIG. During a reevaluation, unit examiners help evaluate whether  there is sufficient evidence of a claimant\u2019s disability after evidence  from a physician or other third party involved in a fraud scheme is  excluded, or whether other evidence and further evaluation is needed  to support the claim.", "Antifraud training and awareness-raising for SSA employees: As  mentioned earlier in this report, SSA has annual mandatory antifraud  training for all staff and multiple activities designed to raise awareness  among employees about fraud, which can help deter and detect  potential disability fraud by educating staff on how to identify and  report suspicious activity. Since 2014, SSA has developed three 30- minute antifraud training videos that explain fraud and fraud-related  terms, highlight OIG success stories and agency antifraud activities,  and instruct employees on how to report potential fraud.

According to agency officials, this system will include multiple models,  and SSA plans to contract for a disability-related model after mid- fiscal year 2017 that will likely use data from several SSA databases  to help identify pending disability claims that may be fraudulent on the  basis of conditions that are indicative of disability fraud. As previously  discussed, the OAFP worked with a contractor in fiscal year 2016 to  conduct interviews with SSA staff who are familiar with the disability  programs to help understand how fraud might occur in those  programs. The OAFP plans to use that information to help guide its  development of the model and what data may be required.  According to OAFP officials, the agency plans to develop models that  will rank claims by the likelihood of potential fraud so that analysts can  focus on reviewing highly ranked claims more closely. SSA plans for  the system to run in real time, which would allow SSA to examine  questionable claims before they are fully processed and prevent  potentially fraudulent benefits from being paid.", "Prosecution and sanctions: SSA has additional activities to respond to  fraud and potential fraud and has taken steps to improve its  processes. For example, SSA has provided attorneys to serve as  fraud prosecutors to supplement the prosecutorial resources of the  Department of Justice, which has responsibility for criminally  prosecuting SSA fraud cases. Specifically, SSA doubled the number  of fraud attorneys to 24 in fiscal year 2015 compared with early fiscal  year 2014. In fiscal year 2015, the SSA attorneys secured 171  convictions resulting in over $16 million in restitution, according to an  SSA report. Additionally, SSA can impose administrative sanctions\u2014a  temporary suspension of benefit payments for 6 to 24 months\u2014on  individuals who knowingly provide false or misleading information to  SSA or fail to disclose information that is material to determining a  right to benefits. In 2013, SSA implemented a new process to  increase the consistency of imposing administrative sanctions and  implemented a tool for improved tracking and monitoring of  administrative sanctions in 2016.", "SSA has other program integrity activities that can help detect potential  fraud in its disability programs, although these activities were not  designed for this specific purpose. For example, SSA performs analytics  to prevent and detect suspicious online transactions, such as unusual  direct deposit requests. According to SSA officials, in fiscal year 2016,  SSA reviewed over 29,000 suspicious online transactions and referred  1,460 of those transactions to the OIG. Some of these transactions may  involve disability benefits. According to SSA officials, the agency\u2019s system  to prevent and detect suspicious online transactions ranks such  transactions by the likelihood of potential fraud, which helps focus reviews  on the cases that are most likely to be fraudulent. SSA also uses data- matching techniques and participates in external data-sharing  agreements to help determine benefit eligibility and detect improper  payments, of which some may be fraudulent disability benefit payments.  For example, SSA uses the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019  National Directory of New Hires\u2014a database containing quarterly wage  data\u2014to help determine an individual\u2019s initial and continued eligibility for  DI and SSI benefits. Another data match enables the agency to verify SSI  applicants\u2019 and recipients\u2019 bank account balances to determine whether  they failed to report monetary resources that could affect their benefit  amount or render them ineligible. Additionally, DDS examiners conduct  periodic continuing disability reviews of disability beneficiaries to  determine whether they remain eligible for benefits. If examiners identify  suspicious evidence, such as conflicting medical information, during these  reviews and perceive potential fraud, they are instructed to refer the case  to the OIG for investigation.", "SSA has reported on the status of its antifraud initiatives and has a plan  that includes high-level goals and objectives for managing fraud risks.  However, it is unclear whether SSA\u2019s antifraud initiatives are targeting the  most significant fraud risks in SSA\u2019s disability programs because SSA has  not developed or documented an antifraud strategy that aligns antifraud  activities to the most significant fraud risks identified through a  comprehensive fraud risk assessment. SSA reported to the  Subcommittee on Social Security, Committee on Ways and Means, in the  House of Representatives in December 2014 and November 2015 on its  antifraud initiatives, but these reports essentially provide summaries of  antifraud efforts rather than a proactive strategy to guide SSA\u2019s efforts  moving forward. In particular, the reports generally do not clearly link  antifraud activities to specific fraud risks by, for example, describing how  the activities can address identified fraud risks. In September 2016, SSA  completed a high-level antifraud plan that lists the agency\u2019s antifraud- related goals for 2016 to 2018. The plan outlines specific initiatives  related to each goal but generally does not describe how these initiatives  can help SSA address identified fraud risks. For example, the plan  includes an initiative to increase the number of attorneys that serve as  fraud prosecutors for SSA. The plan states that officials responsible for  the initiative will determine strategic locations for the prosecutors but does  not indicate how SSA will consider fraud risk in different areas when  identifying locations for the prosecutors.", "Without developing and documenting an antifraud strategy that considers  the likelihood and impact of fraud risks along with its tolerance for these  risks and its existing activities to mitigate them, as called for in leading  practices, SSA cannot ensure that it has a coordinated approach to  address the range of fraud risks in its disability programs and  appropriately target the most significant risks. Developing an antifraud  strategy can help SSA ensure that it has an appropriate balance of fraud  prevention and detection activities to address its risks and can help SSA  target its program integrity resources to the antifraud activities that would  most cost effectively mitigate its fraud risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA Does Not Have Effective Metrics to Monitor and Evaluate Its Antifraud Activities", "paragraphs": ["SSA monitors its antifraud activities\u2014including those to protect its  disability programs\u2014through the OAFP and NAFC, but the metrics SSA  uses do not enable effective monitoring and evaluation. According to SSA  documents, the OAFP is responsible for monitoring SSA\u2019s antifraud  activities and establishing performance and outcome-oriented goals for  them. The OAFP receives updates from the components that are  responsible for each antifraud initiative and has shared these updates  with the NAFC through periodic meetings and with Congress through  reports about SSA\u2019s antifraud initiatives. The OAFP provides flexibility to  the SSA components in developing and identifying the metrics that are  used to assess and report on antifraud initiatives, and, according to an  OAFP official, the office does not revise the metrics submitted by  components. Leading practices identified in the Fraud Risk Framework  call for managers to develop outcome-oriented measures to monitor and  evaluate fraud risk management activities and to adapt activities based  on the results. In addition, according to federal internal control standards,  managers should establish and operate activities to monitor the internal  control system and evaluate the results, which may be compared against  an established baseline. Furthermore, agency-wide strategic planning  requirements established under the Government Performance and  Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and enhanced by the GPRA Modernization  Act of 2010 required agencies to establish outcome-oriented goals and a  balanced set of performance indicators, including output and outcome  indicators as appropriate, in measuring or assessing progress toward  goals. Although these requirements apply at the agency level, in our  prior work we have reported that these requirements can serve as leading  practices for strategic planning at lower levels within federal agencies,  such as planning for individual divisions, programs, or initiatives.", "However, we found that SSA does not track most of its antifraud  initiatives via outcome-oriented metrics to help the agency regularly  measure progress in achieving targets. Of the 17 ongoing initiatives listed  in SSA\u2019s 2015 antifraud initiatives report, we found that 10 had metrics  that were not outcome-oriented, and 4 did not have any metrics. For  example, the percentage of staff trained in fraud detection and prevention  methods (an output) is listed as a metric of the antifraud training initiative, but SSA does not evaluate the outcomes associated with those trainings  such as the change in particular behaviors following the trainings (e.g.,  the number of referrals to OIG about schemes covered during the  trainings). In addition, the 2015 report lists the fraud examination units  and fraud case reviews as initiatives but does not include metrics for  either. Further, the majority of antifraud initiatives do not provide targets  against which to measure performance and track progress relative to a  baseline. For example, the initiative to add antifraud language to SSA  notices states the \u201cnumber of notices issued annually with antifraud  language is over 186 million notices\u201d as a metric but does not include a  target.", "As previously mentioned, the NAFC receives updates on SSA\u2019s antifraud  initiatives from the OAFP, but it plays a limited role in monitoring and  making decisions about the initiatives. SSA antifraud initiatives reports  state that the NAFC monitors certain antifraud initiatives. For example,  the 2015 report notes that the NAFC identified 10 major antifraud  initiatives to monitor that year. Although not all NAFC members attend its  meetings, the NAFC meets at least quarterly to sustain attention on  antifraud initiatives. The NAFC meetings provide an opportunity to  present updates and ensure committee members are aware of ongoing  initiatives. However, our review of summaries from the seven NAFC  meetings held during fiscal year 2016 found that the NAFC generally did  not take an active role in monitoring the initiatives. For example, six of the  seven NAFC meeting minutes did not indicate instances in which the  NAFC requested further information to determine whether antifraud  initiatives were meeting their intended goals or recommend changes to  improve antifraud initiatives. According to SSA officials with responsibility  for implementing antifraud initiatives, the NAFC serves as a forum for  updates about antifraud initiatives, including efforts being implemented in  SSA\u2019s regions, but makes few decisions about the initiatives and  performs limited monitoring of them.", "SSA recognizes the importance of monitoring, but it is unclear how it  plans to evaluate its antifraud activities and adapt them if necessary. We  have previously reported that agencies may face challenges measuring  outcomes of fraud risk management activities in a reliable way. These  challenges include the difficulty of measuring the extent of deterred fraud,  isolating potential fraud from legitimate activity or other forms of improper  payments, and determining the amount of undetected fraud. However, as described in the Fraud Risk Framework, it is possible for agencies to  gather additional information on the short-term or intermediate outcomes  of some antifraud initiatives, which may be more readily measured than  ultimate benefits. For example, although SSA does not have a metric to  monitor the fraud examination units or to evaluate their effect on fraud, it  is possible for SSA to identify more immediate outcomes such as the  number of potential fraud patterns that the units uncover doing  nonreevaluation work. SSA\u2019s antifraud strategic plan for 2016 to 2018  includes an objective to \u201cadapt fraud risk management activities and  communicate the results of monitoring and evaluations to management.\u201d  Although the plan highlights the importance of monitoring to help  strengthen fraud risk management activities, it does not include specific  steps for monitoring its antifraud initiatives. Identifying performance  metrics, including baselines and targets as appropriate, and requiring  additional information from the responsible components on progress  made would help the OAFP and NAFC better monitor whether SSA is  achieving its antifraud goals. Without this information, the OAFP and  NAFC may not be able to determine whether SSA\u2019s antifraud activities  are operating effectively or determine whether changes are necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Proactively managing fraud risks can help facilitate SSA\u2019s mission by  ensuring that government services function as intended, and SSA has  taken some steps to manage these risks. Many of SSA\u2019s actions such as  establishing an entity dedicated to coordinating fraud risk management  activities and instituting annual antifraud training throughout the agency  are consistent with leading practices and demonstrate a commitment to  managing fraud risks. However, gaps exist in the agency\u2019s fraud risk  assessment, corresponding strategy design, and monitoring of antifraud  activities. Despite some foundational efforts such as piloting a method for  conducting future assessments by profiling four particular risks, until it  conducts a thorough, systematic assessment of its fraud risks, SSA will  lack robust information on the risks that may most affect the integrity of its  disability programs. As a result, SSA may be using its resources to  combat fraud schemes that are unlikely to materialize or that have a  relatively minimal effect on SSA\u2019s finances or reputation. Although SSA  plans to assess fraud risks, it is unclear when an assessment of its  disability programs will occur and whether it will reflect leading practices.", "Absent a comprehensive fraud risk assessment that aligns with leading  practices and is regularly updated, SSA will not be equipped to address  the fraud schemes to its disability programs that are considered to be the  most significant before they occur. Similarly, without developing,  documenting, and implementing a comprehensive antifraud strategy that  builds on a comprehensive risk assessment, as called for by leading  practices, SSA cannot ensure that its antifraud control activities are  targeted to its fraud risks, and therefore may be using its resources for  program integrity efforts inefficiently.", "Further, by creating the OAFP and reestablishing the NAFC, SSA has laid  some important groundwork for monitoring and evaluating SSA\u2019s  antifraud activities. However, without establishing outcome-oriented  metrics and then regularly reviewing progress toward meeting these  goals, the OAFP will not be able to determine whether the agency\u2019s  antifraud control activities are working as intended. The OAFP is charged  with coordinating among SSA\u2019s components that lead particular antifraud  efforts and establishing outcome-oriented goals; the NAFC\u2014with its  higher, cross-agency authority\u2014is well-positioned to consider, act on, and  help enforce the OAFP\u2019s recommendations. If the OAFP does not review  progress toward meeting antifraud goals and then recommend changes  to any antifraud control activities that are not meeting goals, SSA will be  hard-pressed to address known fraud risks and to respond to emerging  risks that could undermine the agency\u2019s antifraud efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner (or Acting Commissioner) of SSA  direct the OAFP to take the following four actions for its disability  programs:  lead a comprehensive fraud risk assessment that is consistent with  leading practices, and develop a plan for regularly updating the  assessment; develop, document, and implement an antifraud strategy that is  aligned to its assessed fraud risks; work with components responsible for implementing antifraud  initiatives to develop outcome-oriented metrics, including baselines  and goals, where appropriate for antifraud activities; and  review progress toward meeting goals on a regular basis, and  recommend that the NAFC make changes to control activities or take  other corrective actions on any initiatives that are not meeting goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SSA for review and comment, and its  written comments are reproduced as appendix I in this report.
