SAMHSA officials told us that coordination with these federal partners  helped identify risks in at least two of our selected programs, Puerto Rico  and Oklahoma.

In particular,  SAMHSA officials told us that these review process changes do not  pertain to the portion of the onsite review that focuses on state PAIMI  program compliance with applicable fiscal requirements. Officials noted  that the SAMHSA office that conducts the fiscal portion of the review has  had staff shortages for the past 16 months and is not able to operate  within normal time frames for completing this portion of the report.

The protection and advocacy services provided by state  PAIMI programs play an important role in reducing these serious issues  for this vulnerable population. Therefore, it is important to monitor how  effective the programs are in addressing such issues. SAMHSA has a  number of procedures in place to monitor program compliance with  statutory and regulatory requirements, which enable the agency to  identify and resolve potential issues with program compliance, and it is  taking steps to streamline and improve its compliance oversight. At the  same time, the agency\u2019s processes for oversight of program effectiveness  could be improved, such as by examining trends in mid-performance  changes programs make to their priority goals, objectives, and targets  across multiple years. Without such monitoring, SAMHSA may not  recognize a pattern of changes that signal larger concerns about that  program\u2019s effectiveness. Finally, SAMHSA has not been timely in  completing its onsite monitoring reviews or providing the results of these  reviews to the programs.
