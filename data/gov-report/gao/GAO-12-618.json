During the 5-year period, the HUD OIG had total budgetary resources ranging from $121 million to $144 million, consistently ranking it fifth among all Cabinet-level OIGs. However, while the total budgetary resources for all Cabinet-level OIGs increased by about 45 percent over the 5-year period, the HUD OIG\u0092s total budgetary resources increased by 19 percent. In terms of staffing, the HUD OIG\u0092s full-time-equivalent staff (FTE) consistently ranked in the top four or five of the Cabinet-level OIGs. Also, the HUD OIG\u0092s FTEs increased by about 13 percent during the 5-year period, as compared to about a 17 percent average increase for all Cabinet-level OIGs. During the same 5-year period, the HUD OIG reported an estimated average dollar return of about $13.62 for each HUD OIG total budgetary dollar received, while the 16 OIGs in the Cabinet-level departments reported an estimated average dollar return of about $11.12 for each OIG total budget dollar received over the same period.", "The HUD OIG reported the majority of its audit, inspection, and investigative coverage in the three largest HUD program offices during fiscal years 2007 through 2011. Specifically, of the OIG\u0092s reported 905 total audit and inspection reports completed over the 5-year period, 90 percent addressed programs in HUD\u0092s Offices of Public and Indian Housing, Housing, and Community Planning and Development, which comprised about 93 percent of HUD\u0092s fiscal year 2011 total budgetary resources. Also, of the 6149 investigative cases opened during this same period, almost 95 percent involved programs in these same offices. In addition, the OIG\u0092s reports and investigative cases focused on HUD\u0092s responsibilities related to recent increases in hurricane and disaster relief funds and HUD\u0092s implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act), administered through these HUD program offices. Also, of the almost $6.94 billion in reported potential monetary savings from the OIG\u0092s audits and inspections, approximately $2.46 billion (about 36 percent), were in the three largest HUD program offices. Of the remaining amount, approximately $4.45 billion (about 64 percent), was mostly from a financial control deficiency not directly related to the three large program offices, and an additional $28.4 million resulted from audits and inspections of hurricane relief and disaster assistance not reported as part of a specific HUD program. Of the OIG\u0092s reported $1.39 billion in investigative recoveries during the 5-year period, approximately $1.2 billion (about 86 percent), was related to mortgage fraud investigations in programs administered by HUD\u0092s Office of Housing. The OIG also reported an additional $866 million in potential savings from other investigative efforts throughout HUD\u0092s programs during the 5-year period.

As the market for home  mortgages tightened in recent years, HUD saw its duties expand  significantly as borrowers increasingly turned to federally insured or  guaranteed mortgage loan programs such as those offered by HUD  through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). As of fiscal year 2011,  FHA oversaw an insured mortgage portfolio of over $1 trillion. Along with  its historical duties, in 2006 and 2007 HUD received about $19.5 billion in  supplemental appropriations to assist states and communities in their  recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.", "In the joint explanatory statement accompanying the Omnibus  Appropriations Act, 2009, the Congress expressed concerns about the  recent increases in demands on the department and its OIG resulting  from HUD\u2019s expanding role in insured mortgage loans and in disaster  recovery. The statement directed that we study the HUD OIG\u2019s resources  and those of comparable OIGs in other departments. In response, this  report (1) compares the staffing levels, budgetary resources, and returns  on investment of the HUD OIG with other Cabinet-level OIGs between  fiscal years 2007 and 2011; and (2) presents the HUD OIG\u2019s reported  results of its oversight of HUD\u2019s largest programs for the same 5-year  period.", "To address our first objective, we obtained and compared the total  budgetary resources and staffing levels of the 16 OIGs in the Cabinet- level departments using budget information from the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB). We also obtained the monetary  accomplishments reported by the HUD OIG and the Cabinet-level OIGs in  their semiannual reports for the 5-year period and compared these  accomplishments to their total budgetary resources to determine an  overall return on each budget dollar received.", "To address our second objective, we identified HUD\u2019s largest programs  from the relative size of the offices that administer these programs, based  on our analysis of HUD\u2019s total budgetary resources reported by OMB for  fiscal year 2011. We summarized data on the extent of the HUD OIG\u2019s  reported oversight coverage in each large program office, including the  number of audit and inspection reports, and investigative cases opened  as reported by the OIG. We also summarized data on the OIG\u2019s reported  monetary accomplishments, which include potential monetary savings  from audits and inspections and monetary recoveries from OIG  investigations related to each of HUD\u2019s large program offices. In addition,  we summarized the OIG\u2019s reported data on nonmonetary  accomplishments, which include the number of convictions, pleas, and  mistrials, as well as administrative and civil actions resulting from OIG  investigations in each large program office. We also reviewed the HUD  OIG\u2019s annual audit plans, strategic plans for HUD oversight, and annual  budget justifications to determine the OIG\u2019s reported emphasis in  providing oversight of HUD\u2019s programs. We interviewed OIG officials at  HUD headquarters responsible for planning, directing, and managing the  OIG\u2019s resources to obtain information on their priorities and assessments  of risks in HUD\u2019s programs; and obtained documentation of reasonable  assurance on the reliability of the OIG\u2019s reported data.", "We conducted our work from January 2011 to May 2012 in accordance  with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that were  relevant to our objectives.

Specifically, HUD\u2019s Office of Public and  Indian Housing (PIH) had total budgetary resources of approximately  $71.2 billion (about 53 percent), the Office of Housing (OH) had about  $32.9 billion (approximately 24 percent), and the Office of Community  Planning and Development (CPD) had about $21.4 billion (approximately  16 percent). (See fig. 1.)", "The remaining 7 percent of HUD\u2019s total budgetary resources included the  Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae); the Offices of  Policy Development and Research, Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity,  and Lead-Based Paint and Poisoning Prevention; and HUD\u2019s  management and administration including financial operations across all  of HUD\u2019s programs.", "PIH-administered programs are intended to ensure safe, decent, and  affordable housing for low-income families; create opportunities for self- sufficiency and economic independence; reduce improper payments; and  support mixed income developments to replace distressed public  housing. These programs include grants and subsidies to public housing  authorities (PHA) nationwide to provide affordable housing opportunities  for about 3.3 million low-income families. Section 8 of the United States  Housing Act of 1937, as amended, includes programs for tenant-based  vouchers and project-based rental assistance. During fiscal years 2007  through 2011, the number of PHAs increased from 3,100 to 4,150.", "The OH-administered programs include FHA, which insures mortgages  and loans made by FHA-approved lenders for single and multifamily  housing units intended to serve borrowers who are not being adequately  served by the conventional market, including first-time homebuyers,  minorities, low-income families and residents of underserved  communities. During the recent mortgage crisis, larger segments of the  market began using FHA-insured loans, resulting in the more than  doubling of the dollar amount of these mortgage loans from about   $439 billion in fiscal year 2007 to over $1 trillion in fiscal year 2011.   (See fig. 2.)", "CPD provides funding mainly through the Community Development Block  Grants (CDBG) Program, which is the most widely available source of  federal assistance to state and local governments for neighborhood  revitalization, housing rehabilitation activities, and economic  development. Because of the funding mechanism that the CDBG  Program already has in place to provide federal funds to states and  localities, the program is widely viewed as a convenient tool for disbursing  large amounts of federal funds to address emergencies. Over the past  two decades, CDBG has repeatedly been adapted as a vehicle to  respond to federal disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, and terrorist  attacks\u2014including being used to facilitate disaster relief funds in the  wakes of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2006 and 2007.", "In addition, HUD programs are used to deliver funds for activities  associated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (Recovery Act), which is one of the federal government\u2019s key efforts to   The stimulate the economy in response to the recent economic crisis. goals of the Recovery Act include helping preserve and create jobs,  promoting economic recovery from the recent economic recession,  providing investments to increase economic efficiency by spurring  technological advances, and investing in infrastructure to provide long- term economic benefits. Under the Recovery Act, HUD received   $13.6 billion in appropriations to be used to fund several housing program  areas, and the OIG received an additional $15 million to its annual  appropriation for the oversight and audit of HUD programs, grants, and  activities funded by the act.", "The Cabinet-level OIGs, including the HUD OIG, were established by the  IG Act which, among other things, requires each OIG to report specific  accomplishments in semiannual reports provided for the Congress.

As defined by the IG Act, questioned costs include either  alleged violations of laws, regulations, contracts, grants, or agreements  governing the expenditure of funds; costs not supported by adequate  supporting documentation; or the expenditure of funds for an intended  purpose that was unnecessary or unreasonable. In addition, unsupported  costs are defined as costs that do not have adequate supporting  documentation, and funds to be put to better use are inefficiencies  identified by the OIG in the use of agency funds. The OIGs also include  investigative accomplishments in their semiannual reports.

In prior years the HUD OIG ranked fourth, immediately ahead of the  Department of Homeland Security OIG during fiscal years 2007 through  2009, and immediately behind the same OIG during fiscal years 2010 and  2011.

(See fig. 3.) The emphasis on  the PIH programs is a result of the OIG\u2019s concerns with the overpayment  of housing assistance in the Section 8 programs. The OIG addressed  CPD-administered programs through 270 reports with an emphasis on  the oversight of funding that goes to nonprofit organizations that have  historically not participated in federal programs and may lack the capacity  to comply with all grant requirements. Also, according to OIG officials, the  OIG\u2019s 201 audit and inspection reports of OH-administered programs are  a result of the OIG\u2019s recognition that FHA\u2019s share of mortgage  originations has been at an all-time high over the past few years.", "The HUD OIG also reported opening a total of 6,149 investigative cases,  with most of them providing investigative coverage of HUD\u2019s three largest  program offices during the 5-year period. Specifically, of these cases,  5,841 (about 95 percent), were in programs administered by PIH, OH,  and CPD. The OIG opened 2,944 investigative cases to address alleged  fraud in PIH-administered programs, which included rental assistance  programs and the administration of public housing authorities. (See fig.  4.) In addition, through expanded mortgage fraud initiatives to address  the unprecedented increase in the number of new and refinanced FHA  loans, the OIG reported opening 2,018 investigative cases in OH- administered programs.

The majority of this figure\u2014approximately  $4.27 billion (about 96 percent), is related to ongoing significant  deficiencies reported by the OIG in HUD\u2019s financial process for reviewing  outstanding obligations and recapturing amounts no longer needed to  fund them. This process was reported by the HUD OIG as a significant  deficiency in fiscal year 2011 and in prior years because it allowed invalid  obligations to remain in HUD\u2019s accounting records.", "The HUD OIG identified about $1.25 billion in monetary accomplishments  over the 5-year period from audits and inspections of PIH-administered  programs, particularly the Section 8 programs. These monetary  accomplishments were from audits and inspections of tenant eligibility  issues, the accuracy of rental assistance payments, the quality of  housing, and the cost of administering the programs.", "Over the 5-year period, the OIG reported monetary accomplishments  from audits and inspections of CPD-administered programs of  approximately $835.7 million. These audits and inspections focused on  the control systems in place, especially for subrecipients of HUD grant  funds, to determine whether these controls provide the review and  oversight necessary to ensure funds are spent on eligible activities and  put to good use.", "Also, over the same period, the HUD OIG reported monetary  accomplishments of about $381.3 million related to OH-administered  programs. The HUD OIG\u2019s audits and inspections target FHA lenders  based on a number of high-risk indicators. In fiscal year 2010, the OIG  conducted Operation Watchdog that involved reviewing the underwriting  of 284 mortgages. Of these mortgages, the OIG concluded that almost   50 percent never should have been insured and resulted in an estimated  loss in excess of $11 million. The OIG recommended that HUD take  administrative actions against each lender and that HUD develop and  implement a risk-based selection of loans to verify that the loans met FHA  requirements.", "The HUD OIG reported a total of about $1.392 billion in investigative  recoveries during fiscal years 2007 through 2011. Approximately   $1.2 billion (about 86 percent), of these recoveries were from  investigations in OH\u2019s housing programs administered by FHA. (See fig.  6.) The OIG reported mortgage fraud investigations into FHA\u2019s programs  as a continuing priority and reported working closely with the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to coordinate mortgage fraud initiatives. OIG  investigations focused on various frauds perpetrated by mortgage  companies and brokers, title companies, loan officers, real estate agents,  closing attorneys, appraisers, builders, and nonprofit entities. For  example, a HUD OIG investigation found that HUD, Ginnie Mae, and  other financial entities had realized losses in excess of $1.9 billion due to  bank, wire, and securities fraud committed by the chairman of a former  FHA-approved lender. The chairman was sentenced to 30 years in prison  and ordered to forfeit $38.5 million. For investigative recoveries related to  other HUD offices, the OIG reported about $94.5 million in PIH- administered programs, and investigations of CPD-administered  programs resulted in about $63.4 million in investigative recoveries during  the same 5-year period.", "Regarding nonmonetary accomplishments in HUD\u2019s three largest  program offices, the HUD OIG reported that its PIH-related investigative  priorities include Section 8 rental assistance fraud committed by tenants  and landlords, Section 8 administrators, and PHAs. An important part of  the investigative efforts in this area included outreach by the OIG staff to  meet with executive directors of housing authorities, provide training  seminars for the identification of fraud, and develop liaisons for referrals.  As a result, during fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the OIG reported  participating in almost 3,000 convictions, pleas, and mistrials (See fig. 7.),  and 3,655 administrative and civil actions to address wrongdoing in PIH- administered programs. (See fig. 8.)", "The OIG also reported full-time participation on the FBI National  Mortgage Team with mortgage fraud task forces at over 40 locations  throughout the country. These activities led to increased investigations,  as well as civil actions, to address fraud in HUD\u2019s single family programs.  As a result the OIG reported 1,440 convictions, pleas, and mistrials and  1,680 administrative and civil actions in OH-administered programs.", "With respect to recent increases in HUD oversight responsibilities, the  HUD OIG reported investigative activities that focused on CDBG grants  that included federal funding for hurricane and disaster assistance. As a  result, the OIG reported a total of 308 convictions, pleas, and mistrials  and 200 administrative and civil actions during the 5-year period. For  example, a 2010 OIG investigation resulted in a Gulf Coast resident being  charged in U.S. District Court with making false statements in the theft of  government funds after receiving $300,000 in CDBG disaster assistance  funds for damaged property that was not the recipient\u2019s primary residence  during Hurricane Katrina and therefore did not qualify for disaster  assistance.", "In fiscal year 2009, the Congress provided the HUD OIG with additional  funding of $15 million to provide oversight of Recovery Act funds through  HUD\u2019s programs. This resulted in an increased focus by the OIG on  HUD\u2019s Recovery Act responsibilities. The coverage and accomplishments  reported by the OIG include a total of 177 audit and inspection reports  that address the Recovery Act, as well as about $133.7 million in related  monetary accomplishments during fiscal years 2009 through 2011. (See  table 5.)", "The HUD OIG considers Recovery Act activities to be high risk with the  potential for housing-related fraud because significant allocations of these  funds are processed in an unusually short time frame. The OIG\u2019s  Recovery Act audits and inspections included determining whether funds  are awarded and distributed in a prompt, fair, and reasonable manner.
