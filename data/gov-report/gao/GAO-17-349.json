This report examines: (1) the factors that affect VA facility alignment with veterans' needs, (2) the extent to which VA's capital-planning process facilitates the alignment of facilities with the veteran population, and (3) the extent to which VA has followed best practices by integrating stakeholders in facility alignment decisions. GAO reviewed VA's facility- planning documents and data, and interviewed VA officials in headquarters and at seven medical facilities selected for their geographic location, population, and past alignment efforts. GAO also evaluated VA's actions against federal standards for internal control and best practices for capital planning."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Geographic shifts in the veteran population, changes in health care delivery, and an aging infrastructure affect the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to align its services and real property portfolio to meet the needs of veterans. For example, a shift over time from inpatient to outpatient care will likely result in underutilized space once used for inpatient care. In such instances, it is often difficult and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit existing facilities given the challenges associated with these older facilities.", "VA relies on the Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but SCIP's limitations\u2014including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information\u2014undermine VA's ability to achieve its goals. Although VA acknowledges many of these limitations, it has taken little action in response. Federal standards for internal control state that agencies should evaluate and determine appropriate corrective action for identified limitations on a timely basis. Without doing so, VA lacks reasonable assurance that its facility-alignment reflects veterans' needs.", "A separate planning process\u2014VA Integrated Planning (VAIP)\u2014was designed to supplement SCIP and to provide planners with a more strategic vision for their medical facilities through the creation of facility master plans. However, GAO found limitations with this ongoing effort, which VA estimated to cost $108 million. Specifically, the facility master plans assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. However, VA's use of care in the community has increased to an obligated $10.1 billion in fiscal year 2015. Federal capital-acquisition guidance identifies inefficient spending as a risk of not considering other options for delivering services. This consideration is particularly relevant as VA's data project that the number of enrolled veterans will begin to fall after 2024. Officials who oversee the VAIP process said that they were awaiting further analyses required by recently released VA guidance on the proportion of care and types of services to obtain from the community. As a result of this and other limitations, some local VA officials said that they make little use of the VAIP facility master plans and contract for their own facility master plans outside the VAIP process.", "Although VA instructs local VA officials to communicate with stakeholders, its guidance is not detailed enough to conform to best practices. VA has not consistently followed best practices for effectively engaging stakeholders in facility consolidation efforts\u2014such as in utilizing two-way communication early in the process and using data to demonstrate the rationale for facility alignment decisions. GAO found that when stakeholders were not always engaged consistently with best practices, VA's efforts to align facilities with veterans' needs were challenged. Also, VA officials said that they do not monitor or evaluate these communications efforts and, therefore, have little assurance that the methods used effectively disseminate information to stakeholders. This approach runs counter to federal standards for internal control, which instruct agencies to monitor and evaluate activities, such as communications methods."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made four recommendations, including that: VA improve SCIP's scoring and approval process among other limitations and discontinue or improve the utility of the VAIP facility master plans, and improve guidance to effectively communicate facility alignment decisions with stakeholders and to evaluate these efforts.

Each VISN has a Capital Asset Manager and a  planner who are responsible for coordination and oversight of facility  alignment activities, and work with individual facility planners and  engineering staff. Annually, planners at the medical facilities develop a  10-year action plan for their respective facilities, which include capital or  non-capital improvement projects to address gaps in service identified by  the SCIP process. According to VA, these long-range plans allow the  department to adapt to changes in demographics, and health care and  benefits delivery, while at the same time incorporating infrastructure  enhancements. Medical facility officials then develop more detailed  business plans for the capital improvement projects that are expected to  take place in the first year of the 10-year action plan.

In addition, VA has been the subject of  several assessments focusing on facility alignment, and planning efforts  to modernize its facilities. In 1999, VA initiated the CARES process to  assess federally owned buildings and land ownership in response to  changing veterans\u2019 inpatient and outpatient demand for care. CARES was  the first comprehensive, long-range assessment of VA\u2019s health care  capital-asset priorities since 1981 and was designed to assess the  appropriate function, size, and location of VA facilities.

According to VA officials who oversee the EHCPM, the aging of enrolled  veterans and the increasing prevalence of service-connected disabilities  (either through these disabilities appearing later in life or through VA  changing its scope for eligibility) are driving significant increases in  projected utilization and financial expenditures. For example, Vietnam era  veterans are expected to account for an increased utilization of long-term  care services. In addition, these enrollees also tend to have increased  rates of transition into the higher acuity priority groups for benefits.  Overall, the number of veterans in these higher acuity priority groups is  projected to continue to increase and is a key driver of utilization for VA  health care services, including in-home and community- based services.  As a result of this projected short-term growth in demand, followed by an  eventual decline in veteran enrollment, VA must balance the expansion of  services to meet the near-term demand with the potential excess capacity  in the long-term."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shifts in Care Delivery", "paragraphs": ["Shifts in the type of care that VA provides and where its veterans obtain  that care affect VA\u2019s efforts to align its facilities to meet the changing  veteran population."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Shift from Inpatient Care to Outpatient Care", "paragraphs": ["Similar to trends in the health care industry overall, VA\u2019s model of care  has shifted away from providing care in an inpatient setting, to that of an  outpatient setting, which VA largely houses in converted inpatient space,  or in a growing number of CBOCs. This reflects, in part, the shift in  demand from inpatient to outpatient services. According to the  Independent Assessment, between 2007 and 2014, outpatient visits  increased 41 percent while inpatient bed days declined 9 percent.  Further, it reported that inpatient bed days have dropped as much as 21  percent in some VISNs and, over the next 20 years, are expected to  decline an additional 50 percent or more. This shift in the utilization of  inpatient to outpatient services will likely result in underutilized space  once used for inpatients, as a majority of VA medical facilities were  originally designed for the delivery of inpatient care. Officials who oversee  SCIP as well as some of the planners at medical facilities in our review  told us that they can close portions of facilities that are underutilized.  However, these planners also told us that the savings are small when  compared to closing an entire building. For example, a medical facility in  our review temporarily closed one of its inpatient wings due to decreased  utilization. Although the unused space was technically closed, the wing  still had beds and equipment, and used electricity and utilities, including  lights in the hallways and power to operate computers. (See fig. 4.)", "In addition to shifts in the veteran population and the type of care  provided, changes to VA\u2019s use of care in the community affect facility  alignment. Although VA has traditionally provided care primarily through  its own facilities, it has, and does also use its statutory authority to  purchase care from providers in the community. VA\u2019s purchased care  accounted for a small but growing proportion of VA\u2019s health care budget  in the past decade. For example, in fiscal year 2015, VA obligated about  $10.1 billion for care in the community for about 1.5 million veterans.  Three years earlier, in fiscal year 2012, VA spent about $4.5 billion on  care in the community for about 983,000 veterans. VA officials who  oversee the EHCPM told us that although under VA\u2019s care in the  community programs, a portion of health care utilization may potentially  move from VA facilities to community care, the costs of VA facilities\u2014 costs such as staffing, utilities, transportation, and laundry\u2014do not  decrease proportionally when this shift occurs. As a result, VA may be  expanding care in the community while simultaneously operating  underutilized and vacant space at its medical facilities. According to the  Independent Assessment, if purchased care continues to increase then  VA will need to realign resources by reducing its facilities.", "As VA expands its care in the community programs, questions remain  regarding its impact on facility alignment. Planning officials at two of the  seven medical facilities in our review told us that there is uncertainty  surrounding the extent to which care in the community, as it currently  exists, will continue in the future. These officials added that the  uncertainty affects capital planning because capital projects are planned  years in advance. For example, a planning official from one medical  facility told us that in planning for future renovations to address SCIP  utilization gaps, officials are hesitant to send entire clinical service lines to  the community because if the Choice Act and its associated funds are not  re-authorized, the facility may be financially responsible for providing that  service through non-VA providers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Aging Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Aging infrastructure affects facility alignment because many VA facilities  are no longer well suited to providing care in the current VA system, and  VA will need to make decisions about how it can adapt to current needs.

A planning official  from one medical facility told us it is difficult to reconfigure a facility in  accordance with these new standards after it is already built, and instead,  these standards would have to be incorporated in the preliminary design  phase. We observed at various locations where despite renovations, VA  was unable to fully reconfigure existing spaces to meet newer care  standards. See figures 5 and 6 for examples of these challenges to  current health care delivery standards.", "We previously reported that the historic status of certain VA property can  add to the complexity of converting or disposing of outdated facilities. In  2014, VA reported having 2,957 historic buildings, structures, or land  parcels\u2014the third most in the federal government after the Department of  Defense and the Department of the Interior. In some instances it may be  more expensive to do renovations then it would be to demolish and  rebuild. However, the option to demolish may not always be an option  because of restrictions due to these buildings\u2019 designation as historic.", "For example, planning officials at four of the medical facilities told us that  state historic preservation efforts prevented them from demolishing  vacant buildings, even though these buildings require upkeep costs and  pose potential safety hazards. (See figs. 7-9.)", "In addition, some VA medical facilities were built as large medical  campuses with multiple unattached buildings. This configuration no longer  meets modern health care delivery standards where services are more  concentrated in one building or a series of attached buildings. For  example, three facilities we visited had large campuses that included  portions of vacant land and buildings designated as historic.

To score high enough to be  approved for funding, a project\u2019s narrative portion of the evaluation must  demonstrate how it addresses predetermined VA priorities\u2014this narrative  portion represents about one-third of a project\u2019s overall score. Planning  officials at two of the VISNs and three of the medical facilities in our  review told us that the narrative portion is a limitation of the SCIP\u2019s  project-scoring and approval process because it relies on facility planning  officials\u2019 ability to write an accompanying narrative that addresses more of  the priorities. This introduces subjectivity to the process, where the  writer\u2019s ability to demonstrate how the project\u2019s narrative addresses more  of the priorities can affect scoring independent of project merits. This can  undermine SCIP\u2019s goal of ensuring all project requests are reviewed  equitably and consistently. The Independent Assessment also found that  some facilities have learned to place considerable emphasis on the ability  to write a project\u2019s narrative tailored to perceived high value criteria\u2014 often using both in-house staff and consultants to try and maximize the  scores. For example, planning officials from one medical facility told us  that they needed a SCIP project to expand a women\u2019s health center but  did not think that it would score highly. Therefore, they told us they wrote  the narrative carefully so that it linked back to more priority areas that  they would not have originally thought of, such as \u201cincreasing patient  privacy,\u201d in order for it to score higher.", "In addition, another limitation to SCIP is that it allows facility planners to  gain credit for closing service gaps by proposing capital projects that they  have no intention of implementing. Specifically, planners at VA medical  facilities must demonstrate within SCIP that they plan to address all  service gaps within the 10-year action plan. However, planners can show  that they are addressing a gap by including such a project in future or  \u2018out\u2019 years of their 10-year plan but then continue to delay the project into  future years without implementing the project or addressing the service  gap. Such actions can undermine the department\u2019s goal of using SCIP to  strategically manage its health care facilities. Although the extent to which  this is occurring is unclear, facility planners at two of the facilities in our  review told us that they routinely enter projects for future years that they  have little or no intention of actually pursuing. For example, planning  officials from one medical facility told us that in instances where they did  not agree with the gaps that SCIP identified, they would include  construction or demolition projects in the later years of their SCIP  submission. They said they did this because (1) they could include a  general project description without having to be too specific, and (2)  demolition projects would most likely not score high enough to obtain  funding. Planning officials from another medical facility told us that they  continue to promote demolition projects to the out years of their SCIP  plan as a way of appearing to address an excess space gap in SCIP  plans without actually implementing the project.", "Even though some facility-level planning officials told us they did not think  demolition projects would score high enough to get funding, officials who  oversee SCIP told us it is possible if the projects\u2019 narratives linked back to  several different priority areas, such as \u201csafety\u201d or \u201creducing facility  condition assessment deficiencies.\u201d As a result, they said facilities will  only submit a demolition project in SCIP if it is part of a demolition-and- rebuild type project that links back to more priority areas. Figure 11  shows an example of a non-clinical building on a medical facility campus  that the facility\u2019s planning officials would like to demolish due to structural  issues.", "In addition, the SCIP scoring and approval process is limited in that it  does not have a mechanism in place to correctly sequence projects.  Specifically, planning officials at three of the seven medical facilities in our  review told us that the SCIP approval process does not allow for, or  ensure that projects will be approved in the chronological order they  determined to be appropriate. For example, planning officials at one of  the medical facilities said that they have been submitting projects in SCIP  to try and collocate specialty outpatient clinics that were in separate areas  of the campus. On several occasions, a project that needed to start after  a predecessor project was finished was approved and funded first  because the project addressed a higher priority area. Out of fear that they  would lose the funding if they waited for the first project to get approved,  these planning officials told us they changed the planned location of one  clinic to a less desirable location instead of their initial goal of collocating  the clinics. According to OMB guidance, improper funding of segments of  a project can lead to poor planning or higher costs. VA officials told us  that this problem could be addressed through better training for facility  planners, but budget thresholds may also play a role. Specifically, VA  officials told us, and the Independent Assessment reported that VA facility  planners often divide a larger project into several smaller projects so that  they stay under the statutorily-defined threshold for major medical facility  projects ($10 million)\u2014a threshold that the Independent Assessment  recommended eliminating."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations with SCIP Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["SCIP\u2019s lengthy project-development and approval timeframes can hinder  capital project planning. Specifically, the time between when planning  officials at VA medical facilities begin developing the narratives for  projects that will be scored in SCIP and when they are notified that a  project is funded has taken between 17 and 23 months over the past 6  fiscal-year SCIP submissions. As such, facility planning officials  routinely submit their next year\u2019s planned projects before knowing the  outcomes of those from the previous year. In one instance, for example,  facility planning officials were required to begin working on the narratives  for the projects planned for fiscal year 2015 before they learned which  projects for fiscal years 2013 or 2014 were approved for funding. In  another example, facility planning officials had to wait about 18 months to  officially learn that VA only funded 2 of the 1,403 projects submitted for  fiscal year 2017. Officials who oversee the program told us that while  they recognize that this is a concern, some information for unfunded  projects is automatically loaded into the next year\u2019s SCIP submission,  reducing rework. Long time frames can also exacerbate SCIP\u2019s inability to  correctly sequence projects in the desired order. For example, under  current time frames and SCIP guidelines, a facility planner may have to  delay submitting subsequent projects in a sequenced group of projects for  up to 2 years each while planners wait to ensure the predecessor project  was funded. Figure 12 shows the overlapping timelines of the last 6 fiscal- year SCIP submissions. An official from the office that oversees SCIP told  us that the timing of the budgeting process that is outside VA\u2019s control  contributes to these delays.", "While aspects of the process are outside VA\u2019s control, over the last 6  fiscal-years\u2019 SCIP submissions, VA has chosen to wait about 6 to 10  months to report the results of the SCIP scoring process to the medical  facilities. This situation makes it difficult for local officials to understand  the likelihood that their projects will receive funding. Federal standards for  internal control note that agencies should ensure that quality  information\u2014such as information about approved projects\u2014should be  provided on a timely basis. A VA official said that for future SCIP cycles,  VA plans to release the scoring results for minor construction and non- recurring maintenance projects to local officials earlier in the process.

According to federal standards for internal control,  agencies should identify quality information and ensure that it is  accessible. Planning officials from four of the medical facilities told us  that these access limitations to SCIP information make it difficult to obtain  a comprehensive understanding of their needs for capital-planning  purposes. For example, planning officials at one of the medical facilities  told us that as a result of the lack of access to information about nearby  projects, a VA medical facility in a neighboring VISN had plans for a new  CBOC near its VISN boundary progress farther than it should have before  VA officials determined that it would have been too close to an existing  CBOC just over the VISN boarder."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Has Done Little to Address Known Limitations with the SCIP Process", "paragraphs": ["VA is aware of many of the limitations of the SCIP process\u2014as the  Independent Assessment found many of the same limitations and made  recommendations to address them\u2014but has taken little action.

In addition,  the Independent Assessment made several recommendations to address  those limitations, including: (1) refining the SCIP processes to simplify scoring methods; (2) strengthening the business case submission  process; and (3) developing mechanisms to ensure projects met  promised objectives. Officials who oversee SCIP told us that they were  aware of, and mostly agreed with the Independent Assessment\u2019s findings  in the facilities section. In order to address all of the Independent  Assessment\u2019s recommendations, including most of the same SCIP  limitations we found, VA created a task force called the Integrated Project  Team, as we reported in September 2016. According to VA officials, the  task force identified several actions to enhance and restructure the  department\u2019s infrastructure based on the facility section of the  Independent Assessment. However, after 6 months of work, the task  force disbanded before it developed an implementation plan for those  initiatives. VA officials said that they were instead focused on addressing  other priorities such as those in the Commission on Care\u2019s report\u2014which  built upon the Independent Assessment\u2014and proposed legislation that  could affect VHA operations. However, the Commission on Care did not  address facility management issues on the level of the Independent  Assessment\u2019s recommendations.

However, the facility master-planning process has several limitations,  including that it assumes that all future growth in services will be provided  directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, including the  status quo and purchasing care from the community. This assumption  runs counter to VA guidance from November 2016 that notes the need for  using taxpayer resources wisely by avoiding building facilities that create  100-year commitments if they could use community capacity.  Nonetheless, facility master plans produced by the VAIP Process make  construction recommendations that directly contradict this policy because  the plans do not adequately consider care in the community, for example:", "To address one medical facility\u2019s master plan would require about  $762 million to relocate and renovate spaces within a building, acquire  adjacent land, demolish inadequate buildings, construct a new  medical tower, and provide seven clinical services that are currently  provided elsewhere. No analysis was done to determine if these  services could be better or more cost effectively purchased through  care in the community.", "Another medical facility\u2019s master plan indicated a need to construct  five new structures estimated to cost about $100 million to provide  clinical services that veterans were already obtaining elsewhere.  Similarly, no cost-benefit analyses were done to consider care in the  community as an option. This construction was recommended in  addition to an unrelated major construction upgrade costing in excess  of $366 million.", "Because these plans do not consider that care could be provided in the  community, if implemented, they increase the risk for spending more than  necessary to provide the services. OMB\u2019s acquisition guidance notes that  investments in major capital assets should be made only if no alternative  private sector source can support the function at a lower cost. Long- term costs for capital assets are particularly relevant for VA as its data  project that the number of enrolled veterans will begin to fall after 2024.", "VA officials told us that operations and maintenance represent 85 to 90  percent of the total life-cycle costs for VA health care facilities. Officials  who oversee the VAIP Process told us that the facility master plans\u2019 lack  of analyses regarding care in the community was because they were  awaiting further guidance from VA on the proportion of care and types of  services to obtain from the community versus in VA facilities. VA released  this guidance in November 2016. That guidance requires individual  analyses at the local level in order to determine the mix of services  provided in VA facilities versus those in community care, a requirement  that is not in the facility master-planning process.", "We also identified other limitations that limit the utility of the VAIP  Process:", "Lack of standardization: According to VA officials, they have mostly  completed the VAIP Process for 6 of the 18 VISNs, but in part  because it is conducted by several contractors, VA has not fully  standardized the process across VISNs. As such, the results are also  not comparable across VISNs. Officials who oversee the program said  that they are proposing an enhancement to the Health Service  Delivery Plan portion of the process that would allow for standardized  analyses, planning, and reporting. But the proposal was still in its  early stages, and at the time of our review, there was no timeline for  completion.", "Lack of accountability for implementing VAIP recommendations:  Officials who oversee the program told us that there is no requirement  that the facilities or VISNs implement recommendations based on the  VAIP Process\u2019s Health Services Delivery Plans or the facility master  plans\u2014although VA officials said there have been discussions about  requiring this accountability in the future. As a result, there is no  accountability for evaluating or responding to the VAIP  recommendations.", "Incomplete cost estimates: The VAIP Process\u2019s facility master plans  include estimates for construction and design, but do not include any  long-term estimates for operating costs. OMB\u2019s Capital Programming  Guide notes that these life-cycle costs, such as operations and  maintenance, should be included in a credible life-cycle cost  estimate. As previously noted, VA officials said that operating and  maintenance cost for VA medical facilities can represent 85 to 90  percent of total facility costs.

Failure to effectively engage with  stakeholders in these ways can undermine or derail facility alignment.  These best practices suggest that VA leadership should engage both  external stakeholders, such as veterans groups and local politicians, and  internal stakeholders, such as VA employees. However, we found that  two-way communication did not always occur when VA engaged  stakeholders.", "External stakeholders: VA often takes steps to involve external  stakeholders, but those efforts often fall short of the best practice of  developing a two-way communication strategy. VA requires VISN  leadership to hold quarterly town hall meetings with external stakeholders  to promote ongoing communications. Planning officials from each of the  five VISNs and seven medical facilities in our review told us that they  meet regularly with external stakeholder groups, usually through quarterly  town hall meetings or roundtables. However, in speaking with external  stakeholders, we found that, in large part, these meetings were for VA to  communicate information, not necessarily to involve stakeholders in the  decision-making process. For example, a local VA official said that the  monthly stakeholder meetings were primarily a mechanism for VA officials  to announce projects after decisions were made. Officials from two local  veterans\u2019 organizations agreed with this characterization, and  representatives from one stopped attending the meetings as a result. In  one of these locations, the breakdown in two-way communication resulted  in picketing when veterans\u2019 organizations opposed the closure of a  facility.", "We also found that when stakeholders were not always engaged  consistently with best practices, VA\u2019s facility alignment efforts were  challenged by external stakeholders. For example, one area that has a  declining number of veteran enrollees also has three medical facilities  within 25 miles of each other. According to the CARES report, the veteran  population and enrollment in this area did not justify multiple inpatient  facilities. Based on the CARES recommendation, VA considered a  consolidation of services. Officials from a local veterans group told us that  due to the one-way nature of communication with VA officials, they did  not fully trust that VA would follow through on plans to replace the  services following the consolidation and feared this VA property would be  sold or disposed of and not replaced with a new VA facility. This  alignment proposal prompted members of Congress and of the city  council and VSOs to conduct a campaign that resulted in all three  facilities remaining operational 13 years after the CARES report was  issued.", "We found that local facility alignment efforts in which VA officials better  followed best practices\u2014building transparency by providing data-driven  information and utilizing two-way communication strategies\u2014with external  stakeholders were more successful. For example, planning officials from  one medical facility\u2014which successfully implemented a CARES  recommendation to consolidate inpatient beds in a neighboring facility\u2014 told us that they communicated with external stakeholder groups as far in  advance as they could and presented data to support any proposed  change. Planning officials from another medical facility were able to close  an underutilized inpatient wing, a leased CBOC that had experienced  decreased utilization and increased costs, and relocate a domiciliary from  one campus to another. During this process, facility officials developed a  communication plan and held meetings with external stakeholders to  present their data and explain the reasoning behind the change.", "Internal stakeholders: Best practices also include engaging internal  stakeholders to build consensus for facility alignment actions. Facility  alignment can mean job loss, relocation, or changes in the way  employees perform their duties. VA officials told us that employees have  sometimes challenged the facility alignment process and in some  instances, affected the outcomes where these best practices were not  incorporated. Specifically, effective communication with internal  stakeholders can foster trust and an understanding of the planned  changes, potentially defusing opposition while strengthening commitment  to the effort. For example, as part of a consolidation and closure at one  medical facility, planning officials addressed concerns, as well as  presented data-driven information that highlighted the benefits and  rationale to employees.

Without official guidance VA cannot be  assured that the VISNs and medical facilities are consistently applying  best practices that integrate stakeholders into the decision-making  process in a way that better ensures the success of alignment efforts.", "Further, existing VA guidance does not instruct VISNs and facilities to  involve stakeholders throughout the decision-making process. Some of  the guidance cites required notification procedures, but does not address  general best-practice strategies for engaging and building consensus with  stakeholders.

However, in our review, planners at two medical facilities told us that  they enter projects for future years that they have little or no intention  of actually pursuing\u2014which is different than not having enough capital  to pursue the project. As such, we continue to believe that SCIP has a  limitation in that it does not have a mechanism in place to prevent  facility planners from gaining credit for closing service gaps by  proposing capital projects that they have no intention of ever  implementing.   4.  In regard to our finding that SCIP\u2019s development and approval  timeframes can hinder capital planning, VA stated that it agrees that  the planning process is lengthy, but added that the timeliness of the  SCIP process is driven by the government-wide budget process,  which is outside of VA\u2019s control. We agree that there are elements of  the timeframes that are outside of VA\u2019s control and clarified our report  to address this situation and focus on what is within VA\u2019s control.  Specifically, over the last 6 fiscal-year SCIP submissions, VA has  chosen to wait about 6 to 10 months to report the results of the SCIP  scoring process to the medical facilities.  5.  In regard to our finding that the SCIP process\u2019s scoring and approval  process relies on facility planning officials\u2019 ability to write an  accompanying narrative that addresses more of the priorities, VA  stated that it disagreed that the scoring was highly based on narrative  and/or subjective information. We clarified our report to note that the  narrative portion represents about one-third of a project\u2019s overall  score, but as VA states, it relies on the planners\u2019 ability to articulate  the business need for the project. GAO continues to believe that that  relying on planners\u2019 abilities to articulate the business need for a  project introduces subjectivity to the scoring process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": ["David J.
