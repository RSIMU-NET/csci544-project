The inner city schools that GAO examined generally spent more per pupil than suburban schools in Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis, while in Fort Worth and New York the suburban schools in GAO's study almost always spent more per pupil than the inner city schools. In Denver and Oakland, spending differences between the selected inner city and suburban schools were mixed. In general, higher per-pupil expenditures at any given school were explained primarily by higher staff salaries regardless of whether the school was an inner city or suburban school. Two other explanatory factors were student-teacher ratios and ratios of students to student support staff, such as guidance counselors, nurses, and librarians. Federal funds are generally targeted to low-income areas to compensate for additional challenges faced by schools in those areas. In some cases, the infusion of federal funds balanced differences in per-pupil expenditures between the selected inner city and suburban schools. There is a broad consensus that poverty itself adversely affects academic achievement, and inner city students in the schools reviewed performed less well academically than students in the suburban schools. The disparity in achievement may also be related to several other differences identified in the characteristics of inner city and suburban schools. At the schools GAO visited, inner city schools generally had higher percentages of first-year teachers, higher enrollments, fewer library resources, and less in-school parental involvement--characteristics that some research has shown are related to school achievement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 has focused national attention on the importance of ensuring each child\u2019s access to equal educational opportunity. The law seeks to improve the performance of schools and the academic achievement of students, including those who are economically disadvantaged. The heightened challenge of meeting the act\u2019s new accountability requirements underscores the necessity of ensuring that all schools have the support they need to provide students with a quality public education. The challenge is particularly great for inner city schools serving low-income neighborhoods, where students on average continue to perform below students in suburban areas. The Congress and other policymakers have been concerned that this achievement gap may be related to possible differences in the amount of funding and resources available to low-income schools and school districts and affluent schools and school districts. Research has shown that such funding gaps are common at the district level; for example, a recent study by The Education Trust found that in 30 of the 47 states studied, school districts with the greatest numbers of poor children had less money to spend per student than districts with the fewest poor children. However, little research has been done at the school level.", "To provide you with information about inner city school spending and other school characteristics, we determined similarities and differences between selected inner city and suburban schools in (1) per-pupil spending and (2) other factors that may relate to student achievement, such as teacher experience, school enrollment, educational facilities and materials, and types of parental involvement.", "This study focuses on differences between inner city and suburban schools, and as such is distinct from a study of differences between urban and suburban schools; inner city schools, as a subset of urban schools, are in the central core of the city and have higher poverty rates. We selected 42 schools, 21 inner city and 21 suburban public elementary schools, to gather information on (1) school level, per-pupil spending, and federal revenues and (2) school, teacher, other staff, and student characteristics for the 2000-01 school year. We analyzed data from three inner city and three suburban schools from each of seven different metropolitan areas of medium, large, and very large population sizes: Oakland and St. Louis (medium); Boston, Denver, and Fort Worth (large); and New York and Chicago (very large). In analyzing these data, we applied weights\u2014a technique that allowed us to make adjustments to account for varying compositions of student need. We applied three different levels of weights.", "To obtain a selection of \u201ctypical\u201d schools, we chose the inner city schools in each metropolitan area that were at the median for poverty among the inner city schools; similarly we chose the school districts at the median for poverty among the suburban school districts. We attempted also to include one high-performing inner city school in each metropolitan area we visited, but were able to identify only two high-performing inner city schools\u20141 in St. Louis and 1 in Oakland. For this selection, we used The Education Trust database, which includes high-performing schools in low- income areas. We did not include high-performing schools that were special schools (e.g., magnet schools, science academies, etc.)", "In addition, we visited 24 of the 42 selected schools in the New York, St. Louis, Fort Worth, and Oakland areas. We visited these schools to obtain supplementary information on student achievement, the condition of the buildings and facilities, educational materials, and parental involvement. We analyzed similarities and differences separately for each geographic area and for all seven sites collectively. Our results are not generalizable beyond the schools in these seven sites. We conducted our work from January to November 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The disparity between poor students\u2019 performance on standardized tests and the performance of their nonpoor peers is well documented, and there is broad consensus that poverty itself adversely affects academic achievement. For example, on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading assessment, 14 percent of fourth grade students who qualified for the free and reduced lunch program (a measure of poverty) performed at or above the proficient level in comparison to 41 percent of those students who did not qualify for the program. Furthermore, research has indicated the importance of socioeconomic status as a predictor of student achievement. Research has shown that the achievement gap falls along urban and nonurban lines as well: students living in high-poverty, urban areas are even more likely than other poor students to fall below basic performance levels.", "In addition to the achievement gap between poor and nonpoor students, concerns exist that this gap may be related to differences between per- pupil spending among schools that serve poor and nonpoor communities. School district spending is generally related to wealth and tax levels, and differences in school district spending can have an impact on spending at the school level. Recently, efforts have been made to achieve greater spending equity. Using a variety of approaches, a number of states have targeted some additional funding to poor students to amend the unequal abilities of local districts to raise revenues for public schools. Comparing spending between schools in simple dollar terms provides one way to check for differences; however, this type of straightforward comparison may be insufficient to explain spending differences because it does not capture the higher cost of educating students with special needs. Schools with similar spending per pupil may actually be at a comparative disadvantage when adjustments are made to account for differing compositions of student needs. Though not definitive, some research shows that children with special needs\u2014low-income students, students with disabilities, and students with limited English proficiency\u2014may require additional educational resources to succeed at the level of their nondisadvantaged peers. Because these additional resources require higher spending, some researchers have adjusted per-pupil expenditures by \u201cweighting\u201d these students to account for the additional spending they may be required.", "Weighting counts each student with special needs as more than one student, so that the denominator in the expenditures to students ratio is increased, causing the weighted per-pupil expenditure figure to decrease accordingly. For example, a school with an enrollment of 100 students may have 20 low-income students, 20 students with disabilities, and 10 students with limited English proficiency. Weighting these three groups of special needs students twice as heavily as other students causes weighted enrollment to rise to 150 students. If spending per-pupil is $4,000 without weighting, it drops to $2,667 when weights are applied. The actual size of the weights assigned to low-income students, students with disabilities, and students with limited English proficiency is subject to debate and generally ranges between 1.2 and 2.0 for low-income students, between 1.9 and 2.3 for students with disabilities, and between 1.10 and 1.9 for students with limited English proficiency.", "The inner city schools selected for our study had high proportions of children in poverty in comparison to the selected suburban schools. The elected inner city schools also generally had more students with limited English proficiency than their suburban counterparts. However, the proportions of students with disabilities in our selected inner city and suburban schools differed within and among metropolitan areas. In Denver, the selected inner city schools consistently had a higher proportion of students with disabilities than the selected suburban schools while in Fort Worth, the suburban schools had a higher proportion of students with disabilities. (See table 1 for total enrollment and percentages of children in poverty, students with disabilities, and students with limited English proficiency for selected schools in the seven metropolitan areas reviewed in this study.)", "Differences in school spending can affect characteristics that may be related to student achievement. There is a large body of research on factors that may directly or indirectly contribute to student achievement. Spending has been the factor most studied for its effect on student achievement. Differences in student outcomes have also been related to factors such as teacher quality, class size, quality of educational materials, and parental involvement.

In Denver and Oakland, no clear pattern of spending emerged. Three factors generally explained spending differences between inner city and suburban schools: (1) average teacher salaries; (2) student- teacher ratios; and (3) ratios of students to student support staff, such as guidance counselors, librarians, and nurses. When we adjusted per-pupil expenditures to account for the extra resources students facing poverty, disabilities, and limited English proficiency might need, inner city schools almost always spent less per pupil than suburban schools.

For example, in Chicago, where inner city schools generally outspent suburban schools, the median inner city school average teacher salary was $47,851, compared with $39,852 in the suburbs.

However, ratios of students to both teachers and student support staff were lower in our selected suburban schools. For example, the median spending inner city school in Fort Worth had 21 students per teacher, compared with 17 students per teacher in the suburbs. Additionally, the median spending inner city school had 1 student support staff professional for every 162 students, whereas in the suburbs the ratio was 1 to 68.

In a similar fashion, we applied weights to our per- pupil expenditure data.", "The use of the lowest and medium weights had little impact on spending differences between inner city and suburban schools. Inner city schools in Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis continued to outspend neighboring suburban schools in most cases. For example, in Chicago, when students were weighted with the lowest weight, the median per-pupil spending for inner city school was $3,743 per pupil compared with $2,996 for the suburban school. Similarly, the use of medium weights generally did not result in higher per-pupil spending at suburban schools.

For example, in Chicago when the highest weight was applied, per-pupil spending at the median inner city school was less than that of the suburban school, $2,629 as compared with $2,734. Similarly, in the New York metropolitan area, where suburban schools we reviewed outspent inner city schools, the use of the highest weights to adjust for student needs caused the differences between inner city and suburban school spending to be substantially enlarged.

The identified high- performing inner city school in Oakland, however, was a school that would have been selected through the described census tract approach and was, therefore, treated similarly to the other selected inner city schools. (See table 5 for the selected inner city census tracts and child poverty rates.)", "To select suburban schools, we (1) collected census child poverty rates for all school districts in the defined suburban area outside the central city of the selected metropolitan area and within the same state as the central city; (2) ranked by census child poverty rates in the suburban school districts; and (3) identified the three suburban school districts closest to the 50th percentile, that is, the median suburban school districts, based upon child poverty rates. We dropped districts that were contiguous or had a 5 to 17-year-old population of less than 500 and replaced them with the district with the next closest median level child poverty that did not have any of these attributes.", "For those districts, we selected the elementary school of the district. If more than one elementary school served the school district, we selected the elementary school in the district with the median child poverty rate (as determined by free and reduced lunch eligibility) for elementary schools in that district.

The practical difficulties of conducting any data collection effort may introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted or in the sources of information that are available can introduce unwanted variability into the results. We took steps in the development of the instrumentation, the data collection, and the data editing and analysis to minimize these errors. We pretested our data collection instrument with the Boston school district and called individual district officials to clarify answers. Completed instruments were examined for inconsistencies, and follow-up calls were made to districts to clarify imprecise responses or data that were unusually different from other respondent data.", "School spending data included (1) instructional staff salaries, (2) certified professional staff salaries, (3) administrative staff salaries, (4) operations staff salaries, (5) education materials and supplies spending, and (6) building maintenance and repair spending. In addition, schools reported federal sources of revenue.", "School, staff, and student information included numbers of (1) regular education teachers, special education, English as a second language instructional staff, and other specialized instructional staff, for example, art teachers, reading teachers; (2) regular education teacher assistants, special education teacher assistants, and other instructional staff teacher assistants, for example, art teacher assistants, reading teacher assistants; (3) student support professional and nonprofessional staff by job title; (4) administrators and administrative assistants by job title; (5) operations staff by job title; (6) the number of first-year teachers; (7) total enrollment; (8) number of students with disabilities and number of students with limited English proficiency; (9) race and ethnicity of students; and (10) the number of students eligible for free and reduced lunch.", "Data on student achievement, facilities, educational materials, and parental involvement that may contribute to academic achievement were obtained from site visits to 12 inner city and 12 suburban schools. We developed a site visit protocol and pretested it at site visits to inner city and suburban schools in the New York and Baltimore metropolitan areas.", "We obtained information on student achievement. In Fort Worth, we used Grade 3 reading scores on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. In New York, we used Grade 4 scores on the State English Language Arts Assessment. In Oakland, we used Grade 4 reading scores on the Stanford 9 test. In St. Louis, we used Grade 3 Communication Arts scores on the Missouri Assessment Program. In each metropolitan area, we contrasted the achievement scores of the selected schools to the state average.", "Depending upon data, information was collected as a dichotomous variable (yes/no), date or period of time, number, or ranked scale assessment.

Regression analysis is a statistical methodology that measures the relationship between one variable and one or more other variables.", "In our regression model, we tried to determine the extent to which total per-pupil spending at a selected individual school could be explained by (1) average teacher salary at the school, (2) adjusted student-teacher ratio at the school, (3) the ratio of students to student support staff at the school, and (4) annual spending at the school on building maintenance and repair.", "The variables in the model were defined as follows:   Total per-pupil spending\u2014total dollars spent by the school in the 2000-01 school year divided by total enrollment.", "Average teacher salary\u2014total salary expenditure for teachers at the school divided by the number of teachers. Teacher salary was used in the regression to capture the salary structure at the school.", "Adjusted student-teacher ratio\u2014total enrollment adjusted for students with special educational needs divided by the total certified instructional staff. Adjusted enrollment differed from total enrollment in that the adjusted enrollment included an additional weight of 100 percent for each child receiving special education instruction at the school and 50 percent for students with limited English proficiency. Adjusted enrollment was used to capture the direct higher spending by the school for students with special needs. Teachers included: regular classroom teachers, special education teachers, teachers of students with limited English proficiency, art teachers, music teachers, physical education teachers, reading teachers, teachers for the gifted and talented, science teachers, and computer laboratory teachers.Teaching assistants and paraprofessionals were not included because their direct involvement with instruction was not always certain.", "The ratio of students to student support staff at the school was computed by dividing the total enrollment by the total certified professional staff. Support staff was not adjusted for students with special needs because it was assumed that at the school level support staff to student time is less dependent upon the disability of the child. Total certified professional staff included: administrators, health providers, and certified staff providing services to students.", "Spending on building maintenance and repair at the school included contracted maintenance and repair and salary expenditures for building custodians and maintenance workers for the 2000-01 school year.
