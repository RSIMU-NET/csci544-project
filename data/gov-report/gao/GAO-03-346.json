Appropriated in different ways in fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, these funds are meant to pay for expenses that DOD would not normally incur, such as contingency military operations and Pentagon building repairs. Because our prior work raised questions about DOD's oversight of contingency fund spending, GAO was asked to review DOD's management of emergency response funds, specifically: (1) DOD's adherence to OMB guidance in managing funds and the sufficiency of DOD's guidance on the use of these funds, and (2) DOD's ability to track the use of emergency response funds in general. We limited our review of DOD's guidance to the initial funds placed in the Defense Emergency Response Fund.

DOD allocated the funds according to OMB's 10 funding categories. However, DOD's designations of allowable line items for each category were broad and, thus, could be interpreted in different ways. Also, while OMB directed that the funds were to be used for urgent and known needs, DOD did not define those needs further. Finally, DOD directed the components to use an internal financial management regulation for contingency funding to determine if costs were incremental or not; however, as we have reported previously, these regulations are insufficient for this purpose. In the absence of detailed guidance military officials sometimes had to use their best judgment in obligating emergency response funds. DOD's ability to track the use of emergency response funds has varying limitations depending on the appropriation. For the fiscal years 2001 and 2002 emergency response funds managed separately in the Defense Emergency Response Fund ($15 billion), DOD can report a breakdown of obligations by its 10 funding categories, but cannot correlate this information with its appropriation account structure. For emergency response funds provided in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 ($20.5 billion) that were transferred into or placed directly into DOD's regular appropriations accounts, DOD cannot use its accounting system to track the use of these funds because they are commingled with those appropriated for other purposes. While DOD has an alternative process intended to track obligations for contingency operations related to the war on terrorism, it cannot identify the portion of obligations that are funded with emergency response funds. DOD acknowledged these limitations and, in December 2002, began requiring additional reporting on the use of these funds. DOD partially concurred with this report, noting it clearly told components to use DOD's financial regulation for guidance and also held meetings for clarification. DOD agreed funds were commingled, but noted it had a process to track incremental costs for the war on terrorism."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As of January 2003, Congress had provided a total of about $38 billion to  fund the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) efforts to recover from and  respond to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Following the  attacks, Congress initially provided, and the President approved, about  $17.5 billion in emergency response funds to DOD through two emergency  supplemental appropriations in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Because of the  urgent circumstances, Congress sought an expeditious means to provide  funds to DOD and, with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  agreed that DOD could manage these initial funds in the Defense  Emergency Response Fund\u2014an existing account that is separate from  DOD\u2019s regular appropriations accounts. Of the initial $17.5 billion, DOD  received about $15 billion in the Defense Emergency Response Fund,  $2.3 billion was provided to other accounts, and $0.2 billion was rescinded.  Concerned about dual accounting, Congress provided the remaining  $20.5 billion in two subsequent appropriations in fiscal year 2002 and  fiscal year 2003 to DOD\u2019s regular appropriation accounts either through  transfers from the Defense Emergency Response Fund or directly. Among  other things, DOD is using emergency response funds to cover the cost of  repairs to the Pentagon and contingency operations related to the global  war on terrorism.

In March 2002, you requested that we continue  this effort by examining DOD\u2019s oversight of the Defense Emergency  Response Fund and the cost of contingency operations in the Balkans and  Southwest Asia. In June 2002, we briefed your staff on the preliminary  results of this work. In September 2002, we reported on the costs  associated with operations in the Balkans and Southwest Asia. This report  summarizes our observations on (1) the extent to which DOD had adhered  to OMB\u2019s guidance for managing funds provided separately for the  Defense Emergency Response Fund (appropriated in the first two  emergency supplemental appropriations), (2) the sufficiency of DOD\u2019s  guidance to its components on the use of these funds, and (3) its ability in  general to track the use of emergency response funds.

In September 2001 and December 2001, Congress  enacted two emergency supplemental appropriations to quickly provide  initial funds to meet the emergency needs of DOD and other federal  agencies to recover from and respond to the September 11 terrorist  attacks. These supplementals, enacted in two separate fiscal years, fiscal  year 2001 and fiscal year 2002, provided about $17.5 billion to DOD. Given  the urgent circumstances, Congress sought an expeditious mechanism to  transfer funds and, therefore, provided funds to DOD through the Defense  Emergency Response Fund. This fund is a distinct account and DOD  manages it separately from its regular appropriations accounts. Of the  initial $17.5 billion, DOD received about $15 billion in the Defense  Emergency Response Fund, $2.3 billion was provided to other accounts,  and $0.2 billion was rescinded.", "Shortly after the September 11, 2001, attacks, OMB and DOD agreed on  certain parameters for managing funds placed in the Defense Emergency  Response Fund, including that funds would be obligated in 10 funding  categories. OMB stipulated that DOD was to manage the allocation of  funds within the 10 categories and could not transfer these funds to its  regular appropriations accounts. Moreover, OMB used these categories in  its reports to Congress on the expenditure of the funds.", "Based on DOD\u2019s limited estimates regarding requirements for each  category, OMB apportioned funds to the Defense Emergency Response  Fund. According to DOD officials, these estimates had to be prepared  quickly, within days of the attacks, and reflected the best judgment of  DOD\u2019s needs at the time without knowing the exact nature of the U.S.  response to the attacks. For each category, DOD also identified multiple  line items for which expenses could be incurred. Figure 1 identifies the  10 categories and identifies some of the line items that DOD established  for one of the categories.", "The 10 categories do not correlate with DOD\u2019s existing appropriation  accounts (see app. II). However, the expenses related to a category  would be similar to the types of expenses funded under several  appropriation accounts. For example, DOD may incur operation and  maintenance, and procurement expenses under the categories of improved  command and control and enhanced force protection. Because the  10 funding categories established by OMB and DOD did not correlate  with DOD\u2019s existing appropriation account structure, a dual system of  accounting emerged, which some believed to be cumbersome for tracking  purposes. Therefore, for subsequent appropriations\u2014a second  supplemental appropriation in fiscal years 2002 and DOD\u2019s regular  appropriation in fiscal year 2003\u2014Congress changed its method of  providing funds. Specifically, in these appropriations, DOD received about  $20.5 billion in funds either through the Defense Emergency Response  Fund (fiscal year 2002) to its regular appropriation accounts or directly to  its appropriation accounts (fiscal year 2003). Appendix II provides  additional details on these two appropriations.", "On September 14, 2001, OMB issued specific guidelines and criteria for  federal departments and agencies to apply in identifying and evaluating  requirements to be funded under the initial emergency supplemental  appropriations. This guidance covered two areas\u2014response and recovery,  and preparedness and mitigation\u2014and outlined 15 conditions to be met.  Among other things, these conditions stipulated that requirements must be  known, not speculative; urgent, not reasonably handled at a later time; and  unable to be reasonably met through the use of existing agency funds.  Appendix III lists OMB\u2019s guidelines and criteria.", "Because expenses related to contingency operations could be funded with  emergency response funds, DOD also relied on its existing financial  management regulation for guidance. Specifically, volume 12, chapter 23  of this regulation requires that costs incurred in support of contingency  operations be limited to the incremental costs of the operation\u2014costs that  are above and beyond the baseline costs for training, operations, and  personnel. The regulation further states that incremental costs are  additional costs that would not have been incurred had the contingency  operation not been supported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Provided Limited Internal Guidance on Use of Initial Emergency Response Funds", "paragraphs": ["DOD adhered to OMB guidance in managing the allocation of $15 billion in  initial emergency response funds placed in the Defense Emergency  Response Fund after the September 11th attacks.

We did not verify the  accuracy or completeness of this data.", "As table 1 shows, as of December 31, 2002, DOD reported data shows over  $1 billion of the funds in the Defense Emergency Response Fund remains  unobligated. Over half of that amount, $526 million, had not been allocated  to the 10 funding categories. According to DOD officials, in March 2003,  DOD plans to review the status of the unobligated funds and validate  whether requirements for the funds continue to exist."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Provided Limited Internal Guidance for Specific Use of Funds", "paragraphs": ["For each of the 10 funding categories established by OMB and DOD,  DOD identified line items that could be funded under the 10 categories.  However, these line items were broad in nature and DOD did not identify  the specific types of expenses that could be funded within each line item.  In addition, OMB, among other things, directed that any requirement to be  funded must reflect an urgent and known need. However, DOD did not  establish any specific parameters to define the meaning of urgent and  known. Also, in the event that funds in the Defense Emergency Response  Fund would be needed to meet the requirements of contingency  operations, DOD stipulated that funds would be used to cover the  incremental costs of contingency operations. DOD directed components to  use its existing financial management regulation in reporting incremental  costs, but it did not offer any further guidance as to how commands were  to distinguish incremental from baseline costs. In May 2002, we reported  that DOD\u2019s financial management regulation did not provide sufficient  information on what types of costs met DOD\u2019s definition of incremental  costs, which resulted in various interpretations among the services\u2014and  even among units within a service\u2014as to appropriate and proper  expenditures. As a result, we recommended that DOD expand its  financial management regulation to include more comprehensive  guidance governing the use of contingency funds. DOD agreed with our  recommendation and, as of April 2003, is still working on revisions to its  guidance. Because DOD is in the process of improving its guidance based  on recommendations from our prior work, we are not making a new  recommendation in this report.", "In the absence of detailed guidance, command officials often had to  use their best judgment in deciding how to spend the defense emergency  response funds, and we found the same type of uncertainty among  commands as we reported in May 2002. For example, command officials  told us that determining what could be purchased from each category  and line item was often difficult because the categories and line items  were broad and generally differed from DOD\u2019s regular appropriation  accounts. For example, DOD designated mobilization of guard and  reserves as an allowable line item for the category of increased worldwide  posture. Mobilization involves many factors, such as special pay,  transportation, and equipment, but DOD did not specify which could be  appropriately funded.", "We also found differing interpretations existed as to whether requirements  were urgent or known. Some commands used emergency response funds  on items that could not be delivered in a reasonable time frame to be  considered urgent. For example, one command purchased a RC-135  Rivet Joint aircraft for intelligence, communications, and reconnaissance.  Typically, this aircraft would not be fielded for 8 years because it needed  multiple contractors to install and test its integrated electronics suite.  In another example, one command, before it knew its specific role in  supporting the war on terrorism, obligated $52 million for spare parts  based on an analysis of prior usage. By contrast, another command was  reluctant to obligate funds until its specific role had been determined.  Moreover, in some cases, command officials were unclear about how  to determine the incremental costs to their regular appropriations.  For example, commands used emergency response funds to pay for  accelerated ship maintenance that was already planned for future budgets  and to purchase computer and communication upgrades that were  previously unfunded from the regular appropriation.", "DOD officials told us that they had to quickly develop funding  requirements after the terrorists attacks and used OMB guidance and  available DOD instructions to instruct their components on how the funds  could be used. The officials said that obligating funds in 10 categories and  related line items that were not directly related to their appropriation  accounts was confusing. In recognizing the lack of detailed guidance, DOD  officials also told us that they maintained constant communication among  all levels of DOD, especially at the command and unit levels, in order to  review and clarify the use of emergency response funds. Furthermore, the  officials said that they believe most of the funds were obligated for  appropriate purposes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Ability to Track the Use of Emergency Response Funds Has Varying Limitations", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s ability to track funds appropriated for the war on terrorism has  varying limitations depending on the appropriation. For funds provided  under the two emergency supplemental appropriations of fiscal years 2001  and 2002 and managed out of the Defense Emergency Response Fund,  DOD is able to report a breakdown of obligations by the 10 categories,  but found that tracking these obligations was cumbersome because the  categories do not correlate with its regular appropriations account  structure. For the two subsequent appropriations in fiscal year 2002 and  2003, DOD cannot separately identify obligations funded with emergency  response funds because these funds are commingled with funds  appropriated for other purposes, and DOD\u2019s accounting system does not  distinguish among obligations. For example, in its fiscal year 2003  appropriation, Congress appropriated about $3.7 billion for the Air Force\u2019s  operation and maintenance subactivity group related to primary combat  forces, including about $389 million in emergency response funds for  expenses related to the war on terrorism, and about $3.3 billion for  expenses not related to the war on terrorism. All of these funds were  commingled in the Air Force\u2019s operation and maintenance account. Within  DOD\u2019s accounting system, DOD records obligations, but does not identify  the source of funds. Therefore, at any given time, DOD is only able to  track and report total obligations for operation and maintenance purposes  and cannot separately identify obligations funded from emergency  response funds.", "DOD officials agreed that DOD\u2019s accounting system does not separately  track obligations funded with emergency response funds, but they  emphasized that DOD has established procedures intended to track  obligations for contingency operations, including operations associated  with the war on terrorism such as in Afghanistan. Under DOD\u2019s financial  management regulation, DOD components are required to track and report  the incremental costs (obligations) for each contingency operation. DOD  established a special code for each operation, and components track  obligations in a management tracking system separate from DOD\u2019s  accounting system. The components report the total obligations for each  contingency operation according to four specific cost categories:  personnel, personnel support, operating support, and transportation\u2014and  by appropriation account. This information is reported monthly and is  provided to Congress. However, the contingency cost categories do not  correlate with DOD\u2019s appropriation accounting structure. Also, funding  for contingency operations comes from both special funding sources  such as emergency response funds, as well as, the regular peacetime  appropriations given to components.

Specifically, in addition to continuing the separate tracking  of fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002 emergency supplemental funds  contained in the Defense Emergency Response Fund, components are  now required to report more detailed data on obligations associated  with the two subsequent appropriations in fiscal year 2002 and 2003.  The additional reporting requirements are as follows:    For the fiscal year 2002 supplemental, components are, on a monthly  basis, to describe the purpose of the obligation, provide the amount, and  identify the appropriation account.", "For the fiscal year 2003 appropriation, components are, on a monthly  basis, to identify which funds they are obligating from their peacetime  budget to directly support the global war on terrorism, i.e., components  are using their baseline budget for the war on terrorism obligations.

Officials believe that requiring  components to provide additional data on obligations is preferable to  modifying the accounting system to distinguish war on terrorism-related  obligations from other obligations. Officials told us that modifying the  accounting system would be too costly, time consuming, and the effort  would not justify the value added at this time. Also, officials point out that  the additional work involved and learning curve associated with a  modified accounting system would pose problems because of the  complexity involved with additional reporting, the time involved with  obtaining staff competency, and the need to retrain staff due to assignment  rotations.

DOD also noted that, because the category structure used  for emergency response funds was unique, some confusion existed among  the components. DOD stated that the confusion dissipated as the  components became more familiar with the structure.", "In our report, we recognized that DOD directed components to rely on the  financial regulation, as well as other guidelines, and acknowledged DOD\u2019s  view that it maintained constant communication to review and clarify the  use of emergency response funds. However, in our May 2002 report, we  noted that the financial regulation does not provide sufficient guidance on  the types of costs that are defined as incremental, which resulted in  various interpretations among the services. DOD agreed with the  recommendation made in that report that the regulation be expanded to  include more comprehensive guidance. During our work conducted for  this report, we found that command officials were sometimes uncertain  about whether certain expenses were allowable, including how to  determine incremental costs, and sometimes had to use their best  judgment in obligating emergency response funds. We continue to believe  that more comprehensive guidance is warranted.

DOD noted that it had implemented a process to track incremental costs  related to the war on terrorism and, in particular, the Defense Finance  Accounting Service collects cost information on contingencies from  components. DOD also noted that it is implementing procedures to  capture the incremental costs of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Our report  specifically recognizes DOD has established procedures intended to track  incremental costs for contingency operations including operations  associated with the war on terrorism, and that the components report this  type of information. However, we note that this information is compiled in  a management tracking system separate from DOD\u2019s accounting system.
