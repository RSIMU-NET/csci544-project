The genes necessary for these improved crops are contained in plant germplasm\u2014the material in seeds or other plant parts that controls heredity. To maintain a high level of agricultural productivity, plant breeders need access to an ample supply of germplasm with diverse genetic characteristics so that they can continue to develop plant varieties that will provide increased yields and better resist pests, diseases, and environmental stresses. However, the diversity of germplasm available to present and future generations of breeders has been reduced by several factors, including the widespread use of genetically uniform crops in commercial agriculture and the destruction of natural habitats, such as forests, that have been important sources of germplasm.", "In the United States, the National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS), primarily administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), maintains germplasm collections for over 85 crops at 22 sites nationwide and in Puerto Rico. These collections contain numerous germplasm samples and provide breeders with access to germplasm with a broad range of genetic traits. In addition to maintaining the collections, NPGS is responsible for acquiring germplasm, developing and documenting information that describes the germplasm in the collections, and distributing germplasm to plant breeders and other users in the United States and worldwide."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Germplasm Collections Are Critical to Agricultural Productivity, Food Security, and Biodiversity", "paragraphs": ["Germplasm collections are an important source of genetic material for plant breeders targeting specific traits, such as higher yield, increased resistance to disease and pests, good taste, improved nutritional quality, and environmental and climatic hardiness. To be of greatest use, these collections need to be genetically diverse, thereby giving breeders more possibilities to find the traits they need to develop improved crop varieties. In addition, information on germplasm traits and other related information (e.g., site of origin of the germplasm) should be obtained and documented, and the germplasm must be adequately preserved to be of optimal use to potential users.", "Diverse germplasm has played a key role in increasing food security through enhanced crop productivity and reduced crop vulnerability to pests and diseases. For example:", "According to a survey on the use of germplasm in 18 crops grown in the United States from 1976 to 1980, from 1 percent (sweet clover) to 90 percent (sunflower and tomato) of the crop varieties had been improved in part by the use of germplasm from wild relatives of the cultivated crops.", "The high productivity of modern wheat\u2014resistant to many pests, diseases, and other stresses\u2014results from combining germplasm from various varieties of wheat grown around the world to create improved wheat varieties. For example, one well-known germplasm sample from Turkey has been a source of resistance for three different types of disease\u2014common bunt, stripe rust, and snow mold. This germplasm also has the ability to establish vigorous seedlings in hot, dry soils that deter the emergence of many other varieties.", "Most of the genes for insect and disease resistance in tomatoes come from a related wild species that originated outside of the United States. Germplasm from wild species is also a source of tolerance to environmental stress, such as drought. In particular, the discovery of resistance to a soil-borne organism known as the root-knot nematode has made the difference between growing or not growing tomatoes in many subtropical areas of the United States (such as southern California and Florida).", "In addition to providing a source of genetic diversity for plant breeders, germplasm collections serve as an archive for rare and endangered crop species. The loss of biodiversity worldwide has made the need for these collections all the more compelling. Expanding human populations, urbanization, deforestation, destruction of the environment, and other factors threaten many of the world\u2019s plant genetic resources. These resources are vital to the future of agricultural productivity and the world\u2019s food security. Many national and international collections have been established to rescue and conserve these resources for future use.", "In breeding plant germplasm into a narrowing genetic base of highly productive crop varieties, breeders have also reduced the genetic diversity of these crops, making them more uniform. Genetic uniformity in breeding also results when breeders inadvertently eliminate certain traits (such as resistance to disease and pests) that do not contribute directly to the desired characteristic (such as high yield) for which they were searching. While the resulting genetic uniformity can offer substantial advantages in both the quantity and quality of a commercial crop, it can also make crops more vulnerable to pests, diseases, and environmental hazards. A narrow genetic base presents the potential danger of substantial crop loss if a crop\u2019s genetically uniform characteristics are suddenly and adversely affected by disease, insects, or poor weather. The risk of loss through the genetic vulnerability of uniform, common-origin planted crops is a serious concern.", "Such losses have occurred in the past. The Irish potato famine of the 1840s was a major factor in the death, impoverishment, and emigration of millions of Irish people. A single variety of the potato became Ireland\u2019s staple food after its arrival from South America in the eighteenth century. The widespread use of this single variety increased the potato crop\u2019s vulnerability to a previously unknown blight, which devastated a number of successive potato harvests. While the United States has not experienced such a widespread loss, several sizable crop failures have occurred as a result of a crop\u2019s vulnerability to a particular disease. For example, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, about 70 percent of the wheat crop in the Pacific Northwest was wiped out by a disease known as stripe rust. In 1970, a disease known as the southern corn leaf blight swept from the southeastern United States to the Great Plains, costing farmers 15 percent of their corn crop that year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Germplasm for U.S. Crops Comes From Other Countries", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agriculture is based on crops that originated from areas outside of the United States. For example, as shown in figure 1.1, corn originated in Mexico and Guatemala, wheat in the Near East (in such countries as Iran), and soybeans in China. Crops of economic importance that are native to the United States are limited and include sunflowers, cranberries, blueberries, strawberries, and pecans. Thus, almost all the germplasm needed to increase the genetic diversity of U.S. agriculture comes from foreign locations.", "While immigrants to the United States, including the first colonists from Europe, brought seeds with them, native North Americans had already introduced corn, beans, and other crops from Central and South America. Today, to obtain new germplasm for U.S. collections, plant breeders and researchers often rely on collections located in foreign countries or on plant exploration trips to the centers of origin for their crops. Between 1986 and 1996, an estimated 75 percent of the germplasm samples added to NPGS\u2019 collections were obtained from foreign countries.", "Although plant exploration trips are an important source of germplasm, most of the germplasm in NPGS has been obtained from existing collections both in the United States and in foreign national and international collections. Some of the U.S. and foreign collections belong to universities and private companies. Other foreign collections include (1) an international collection based in 16 international agricultural research centers that is administered by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research and (2) foreign national collections.", "The international agricultural research centers, located primarily in developing countries, specialize in research intended to enhance the nutrition and well-being of poor people through sustainable improvements in the productivity of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. These centers, according to the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute, have together assembled the world\u2019s largest international collection of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. They account for a significant proportion, possibly over 30 percent, of the world\u2019s unique germplasm samples maintained in collections away from their native environment. The international research centers are funded by voluntary contributions, and their plant germplasm has historically been freely available to any user. Moreover, users have not applied intellectual property protection to the material. The United States works cooperatively with these centers to support international activities to preserve germplasm. For example, U.S. germplasm facilities maintain duplicate collections for some of the international centers to provide for secure backup. In addition, U.S. scientists help various centers screen germplasm for resistance to pests and pathogens and serve in scientific liaison roles between the centers and the U.S. Agency for International Development.", "Finally, many countries, including most European nations, maintain germplasm collections. These national collections vary considerably in terms of the quality of preservation, organizational structure, the number of crops preserved, and the access provided to requesters. One of the largest collections of plant germplasm in the world is maintained at Russia\u2019s Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry, named for the Russian scientist who was a pioneer in the study of plants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Profile of USDA\u2019s National Plant Germplasm System", "paragraphs": ["The National Plant Germplasm System is primarily a federally and state-supported effort aimed at maintaining supplies of germplasm with diverse genetic traits for use in breeding and scientific research. While NPGS has been evolving since USDA established its plant-collecting program in 1898, the main components of NPGS were not established until the passage of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. The act also provided a legal basis for state and federal cooperation in managing crop genetic resources. The current organizational structure of NPGS\u2014a geographically dispersed network of germplasm collections administered primarily by USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service (ARS)\u2014emerged in the early 1970s. Although ARS provides the lion\u2019s share of support for NPGS, the system is also supported by the agricultural experiment stations at the state level.In addition, private industry provides some support for selected projects and develops and transfers germplasm in the form of plant hybrids and varieties to farmers and other consumers.", "NPGS\u2019 major activities are (1) acquiring germplasm, (2) developing and documenting information on the germplasm in its collections, and (3) preserving the germplasm. (See table 1.1.) NPGS also distributes samples, free of charge, on request to plant breeders and other scientists. NPGS maintains about 440,000 germplasm samples for over 85 crops. In 1996, NPGS distributed about 106,000 germplasm samples to requesters in the United States and in 94 countries; it received about 7,800 germplasm samples, about 5,000 of which originated in foreign countries.", "NPGS is responsible for developing characterization information\u2014data on traits such as plant structure and color that are little influenced by the environment. However, other information critical to the use of NPGS germplasm and documented in the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) is generally developed outside of NPGS. (GRIN, a database of NPGS\u2019 holdings, is available to scientists and researchers worldwide.) For example, most evaluation data, which document traits typically affected by environmental conditions (e.g., plant yield and disease resistance), are developed outside of NPGS. These data are particularly important in providing plant breeders with the information they need to select the specific germplasm samples they seek from the sometimes thousands of possible choices offered by NPGS. Passport data, often provided by the person or organization that collected or supplied the germplasm, document the geographic origin and ecological conditions of its site of origin.", "Other germplasm collections in the United States\u2014beyond NPGS\u2019\u2014are maintained by private companies, institutions such as universities and state agricultural experiment stations, and nonprofit organizations such as the Seed Savers Exchange. Some of these collections, as well as some foreign collections, are not freely available to users of germplasm.

Figure 1.2 shows the locations of these sites and laboratories.", "While most NPGS collections are maintained at sites that house germplasm for numerous crops, NPGS also has five sites that specialize in crop-specific collections, such as potatoes or soybeans. In addition, NPGS has nine sites that are national clonal germplasm repositories and four that maintain genetic stock collections. The four regional plant introduction stationsare responsible for maintaining many of the major seed-reproducing species held by NPGS. In total, as of June 1997, they accounted for almost half of the germplasm samples maintained in NPGS collections.", "NPGS sites generally contain either \u201cbackup\u201d or \u201cactive\u201d collections, depending on the storage objectives. Backup collections maintain germplasm for long-term conservation, and active collections maintain germplasm for short- to medium-term conservation and distribution. Germplasm is maintained either as seeds or as living plants. The latter category is generally referred to as \u201cclonal\u201d germplasm and includes fruit trees, sugarcane, and strawberries. Clonal germplasm is likely to lose some of its distinct genetic characteristics when reproduced from seed; therefore, it is reproduced asexually from its own plant parts. Clonal germplasm can be costly to preserve. Some fruit trees, for example, may require isolation to prevent loss from pests as well as screened protection and other measures to ensure the normal development of plants or to keep the fruit free of pests.", "At each site, crop curators and other staff are responsible for maintaining the germplasm collections. Curators regenerate (or replenish) germplasm samples by growing additional plants from seed or other plant parts to ensure that an adequate number of samples are available for (1) distribution to plant breeders, research scientists, and institutions and (2) storage in long-term collections. In the process of regeneration, curators must ensure that each plant generation is as genetically similar to its predecessor as possible. During regeneration, curators also document certain plant characteristics (such as plant height and color) if this information is not already available. Curators and other staff are responsible for entering information about each germplasm sample into GRIN.", "The National Seed Storage Laboratory (NSSL) at Fort Collins, Colorado, maintains the long-term backup collection of seeds for NPGS and some non-NPGS collections located in the United States and foreign countries and conducts research on preserving plant germplasm. NSSL\u2019s storage facilities were modernized and expanded fourfold in 1992, with high-security vaults to protect the germplasm against natural disasters. The collection duplicates (or backs up) many of the germplasm samples in NPGS\u2019 active collections in the event that the germplasm kept in active collections is lost. Germplasm can be lost for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters or degeneration through inadequate storage. Seeds preserved at NSSL are kept in colder, more secure conditions (i.e., sealed, moisture-proof containers in vaults at \u201318 degrees Celsius or containers over liquid nitrogen at \u2013160 degrees Celsius) that preserve them longer than seeds preserved at many active sites. With few exceptions, such as apple buds that can be preserved in liquid nitrogen, NSSL does not back up clonal germplasm. Clonal collections may be backed up\u2014in greenhouses, as tissue culture, or through cryopreservation\u2014 at the same sites as their active collections.", "The National Germplasm Resources Laboratory, located in Beltsville, Maryland, contains several units that support NPGS. The Plant Exchange Office\u2014with extensive input from the CGCs and NPGS\u2019 crop curators\u2014is responsible for setting priorities for the germplasm needs of NPGS\u2019 collections. Furthermore, the Office coordinates plant exploration trips, facilitates germplasm exchanges with other collections, and documents the entry of germplasm into NPGS, including its passport data.

All plant germplasm coming into the United States must comply with federal quarantine regulations intended to prevent the introduction of pests and pathogens that are not widespread in the United States. APHIS writes, interprets, and enforces quarantine regulations, while ARS is generally responsible for providing research support, including the development of tests for pests and pathogens.

Similarly, the Sweet Potato CGC wanted to enhance the limited genetic diversity of the NPGS sweet potato collection by obtaining a representative sample of germplasm from the International Potato Center in Peru.

First, most CGCs reported that at least one of the following types of germplasm in their collections is insufficiently diverse for reducing crop vulnerability: wild and weedy relatives of cultivated crops, landraces, and genetic stocks. Only obsolete and current cultivars, the fourth type of germplasm samples in a collection, are considered to be sufficient by most CGCs. Specifically:", "Wild and weedy relatives of crops were reported to be insufficient by almost half the CGCs, including those for major crops such as corn and soybeans. Wild relatives have often been used to improve crops, such as tomatoes, and sometimes to develop new ones.", "Landraces\u2014many of which are grown from selected quality seed passed down by farmers from one generation to another\u2014were reported to be insufficient by 12 of the 40 CGCs. Landraces are rich sources of genes for traits such as resistance to pests and pathogens.", "Genetic stocks are insufficiently diverse, according to over half the CGCs, including those for major crops such as alfalfa, peanuts, and grapes. While genetic stock material is essential to genetic research, according to NPGS officials, it has generally played a minor role in commercial breeding programs. However, it is expected to become increasingly important in breeding programs that use molecular genetic tools to manipulate and transfer genes to create new products, according to the National Research Council.", "Obsolete and current cultivars are sufficient for reducing the vulnerability of their crops, according to most CGCs. Only five CGCs cited insufficiencies in this area.", "Furthermore, 39 CGCs said that NPGS should place increased emphasis on acquiring germplasm endangered in nature or acquiring germplasm from collections at risk, such as the Vavilov collection in Russia or the collections of scientists who are retiring. If such collections are not obtained and preserved, their germplasm may be lost. Finally, 37 CGCs reported that certain plants are becoming extinct or hard to find.", "NPGS\u2019 acquisition policy is to rely heavily on the 40 CGCs and the NPGS curators to assess the adequacy of their respective germplasm collections and recommend areas where additional acquisition may be needed. However, NPGS has not developed a comprehensive, long-term plan to establish critical acquisition needs for its germplasm collections and priorities for collection trips to fill those needs. Currently, NPGS\u2019 collection trips are based primarily on proposals that are submitted to NPGS\u2019 Plant Exchange Office by federal and university scientists and endorsed by the appropriate CGCs. In addition, staff from the Plant Exchange Office occasionally make or participate in collection trips. However, some exploration trips are funded by other USDA or non-USDA federal agencies.", "According to NPGS officials in the Plant Exchange Office, some germplasm collections are more frequently targeted for collection trips than others because (1) the gaps in some collections are better known and (2) some collections have more assertive champions\u2014e.g., a germplasm curator, CGC, or other interested scientist who aggressively seeks out collection opportunities. This approach may overlook the needs of some crops. For example, according to the head of the Plant Exchange Office, 16 of the CGCs\u2019 reports state acquisition needs only in a general fashion and therefore are of limited value for planning or setting acquisition priorities.", "The exchange officer acknowledged the need to develop a long-term plan that would reflect collection priorities for each crop. He noted that such a plan would use existing funds more efficiently and help ensure that the needs of all crops are being addressed. NPGS has been working to develop such a plan for several years, but progress has been slow because the office has lacked the resources to adequately staff the project and provide needed scientific expertise. The initial plan, which is intended to be flexible to accommodate changing needs and conditions, is expected to be completed by Spring 1998.", "Concerns about NPGS\u2019 acquisition planning process are long-standing. For example, over 15 years ago, GAO recommended that a long-range plan be developed to address gaps in germplasm collections and objectives for collecting or otherwise acquiring needed germplasm. In 1991, the National Research Council recommended, among other things, that NPGS develop a comprehensive plan for plant exploration.

The report stated that the few soybean germplasm samples from North Korea in NPGS\u2019 collection were either obtained more than 60 years ago or have been received since then through third parties. Several other CGC reports\u2014including those for sugarbeets, peas, and wheat\u2014cited difficulties in obtaining germplasm from the Middle East. The Wheat CGC, for example, noted that Iran, a country with which the United States does not have diplomatic relations, holds potentially valuable wheat germplasm.", "In addition, issues relating to the ownership and use of foreign germplasm have become more problematic as a result of the entry into force of the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1993. Prior to the Convention, germplasm from most countries, other than those where access was restricted, has been generally available to requesters. However, the Convention recognizes the sovereign rights of nations over their natural resources and their rights to exchange these resources under terms mutually agreeable to the nation and the germplasm recipient.

Nearly all of the quarantine testing procedures currently in use date back to the early 1980s or before. These procedures involve testing for pathogens such as viruses and other infectious agents. For some crops, testing begins by closely observing the quarantined plants for symptoms of disease during plant growth and subjecting the plants to a battery of tests for latent pathogens. Some tests for trees can take considerable time because the tree must first bear fruit before tests can be completed. For example, tests on prunus trees generally require a minimum of about 3, and no more than 4, years to complete, according to APHIS officials.", "More sophisticated testing methods using molecular techniques to identify pathogens are being developed, and some are already available.

Furthermore, at some locations, facilities for regeneration are inadequate, and at others the growing conditions for germplasm are less than ideal for producing good yields of high-quality seed. For some collections, these regional climatic conditions also contribute to the development of pests and pathogens, which can hinder the preservation and use of germplasm. To overcome these problems and increase its capacity to regenerate quality seed, NPGS recently established a new site\u2014at Parlier, California\u2014that is in an arid region with a long growing season. The Department has requested increased funding for genetic resources research in the fiscal year 1998 budget, part of which is to increase regeneration capability, according to an NPGS official.", "CGC responses to our survey regarding the sufficiency of regeneration activities were similar to those on viability testing. Only 7 of the 40 CGCs we surveyed reported that NPGS\u2019 regeneration activities are insufficient for their collections, although 29 CGCs reported that the lack of staff for regeneration and viability testing had hindered the preservation of their collections. When we examined the responses of the curators (those most knowledgeable about the collections\u2019 conditions), curators for part or all of 15 of 39 crop collections reported that regeneration is insufficient for part or all of their crop collections. The curator responsible for most of NPGS\u2019 corn collection reported that regeneration is insufficient and that the 15-year regeneration backlog for corn placed an important part of this collection at the risk of losing diversity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Much Germplasm Is Not in Long-Term Backup Storage", "paragraphs": ["Although NPGS\u2019 policy requires that all seed samples in active collections be backed up at NSSL, over one-third are not. Furthermore, methods to ensure the secure backup of most clonal germplasm have not yet been developed. Backup is needed to provide protection against losses at the active sites resulting from (1) deterioration, which generally occurs more rapidly in seeds stored at active sites, or (2) human error, extreme weather, equipment failure, flood, fire, vandalism, or other catastrophes.", "Sixty-one percent of the approximately 440,000 seed samples at NPGS\u2019 active sites are backed up at NSSL, where they are stored at \u201318 degrees Celsius or in containers over liquid nitrogen to slow deterioration. Of these backed-up samples, 44 percent do not meet NPGS\u2019 standards and goals for the quantity of seeds and the percentage that should be viable\u201465 percent. The seed samples not stored at NSSL are at increased risk of deterioration because seeds generally deteriorate much more rapidly at active sites, which generally store germplasm at warmer temperatures\u20145 degrees Celsius.", "According to NPGS officials, seeds have not been adequately backed up primarily because of the large regeneration backlogs at active sites. That is, until the sites regenerate germplasm, they often do not have a sufficient number or quality of seeds to send to NSSL for backup storage. In addition, even when they have sufficient quantities of seeds, some sites have not sent the seeds to NSSL because before they can be sent, the sites must reinventory the germplasm samples and repackage the seeds. According to NPGS officials, these activities use resources that are in short supply. In addition, NSSL has its own 16-month backlog of about 27,000 samples that must be processed (which includes viability testing) before being placed in secure, long-term storage.", "The backup of clonal samples is even more limited, with only 4 percent of the approximately 30,000 samples at the active sites backed up at NSSL. This limited backup occurs because the methods for providing secure, long-term storage for most clonal germplasm have not yet been developed. Clonal germplasm may be backed up\u2014in greenhouses as living plants, as tissue culture, or through cryopreservation\u2014at the active site where the primary collection is maintained. Thus, in case of a natural disaster, disease, or other catastrophe, both the active and backup samples could be destroyed. For example, in 1992, over 2,000 germplasm samples were lost at NPGS\u2019 Miami facility following Hurricane Andrew. These samples were not backed up at another NPGS site or at NSSL. Included in this group were about 30 percent of the mango and avocado collections and about 50 percent of the site\u2019s ornamental collection (e.g., palm trees). The storm uprooted the trees, and they could not be successfully replanted. The curator for these crops stated that most of this material will not be replaced because of resource constraints, difficulties in locating the material, and difficulties in getting foreign collections to provide replacement samples.", "CGC responses to our survey regarding the sufficiency of backup storage of germplasm varied. Only 6 of the 40 CGCs surveyed reported that NPGS\u2019 activity in the area of backup storage/preservation is insufficient for their crop collections. In contrast, the curators for part or all of 15 of 40 crop collections reported that NPGS\u2019 activity in the area of backup storage/preservation of their crop collection is insufficient. The curators for the collections of six major crops\u2014corn, soybeans, wheat, alfalfa, potato, and cotton\u2014reported no insufficiencies in this area."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
