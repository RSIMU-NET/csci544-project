At peak periods during the summers and on weekends, severe traffic congestion on the Commission\u2019s bridges resulted in long lines of cars and significant delays. The delays were not caused by insufficient bridge capacity, but rather by the time required for customs and immigration inspections at international border crossings. In response to projections of further traffic increases, the Commission undertook a long-term capital improvement program entitled A Thirty-Year Plan (the Plan). In addition, officials from the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service had said that they needed improved working facilities because the space that they leased from the Commission was antiquated, unsafe, and insufficient.", "This Plan, published in September 1990, set forth capital projects to meet projected traffic needs through the year 2020. The Plan called for expanding the capacity for collecting tolls and conducting inspections and for improving working facilities at the Commission\u2019s three bridges. These projects, estimated in 1990 to cost $122 million, were to be financed through long-term bonds and accumulated Commission revenues. The Plan also called for the possible future construction of a new bridge to handle traffic volumes expected to exceed the capacity of the existing bridges.

The act applies to the Rainbow Bridge project because (1) the Commission leases space in its buildings to federal agencies for customs and immigration activities; (2) the bridge and its related structures are eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places; and (3) the plaza is on an easement within the boundaries of the Niagara Reservation, which has been designated both an endangered National Historic Landmark and a National Natural Landmark.", "The National Environmental Policy Act and the State Environmental Quality Review Act, like the National Historic Preservation Act, require that potential adverse impact be identified and mitigated and call for consultation with affected agencies. Federal guidelines require the entity undertaking a project to determine the appropriate level of environmental review, which can range from the completion of a checklist in response to plans for certain repairs or alterations, to an environmental assessment that briefly analyzes a project\u2019s impact, to a full environmental impact statement for major undertakings. Federal guidelines include indicators to determine whether an area is environmentally significant and may require a full study. The Rainbow Bridge project met at least three of these indicators: it is located near a unique geological feature, lies within parklands, and is likely to affect historic properties.", "Issues considered under the National Historic Preservation Act overlap with issues of the environmental analysis. The review processes for both the National Historic Preservation Act and for federal and state environmental laws are consultative processes designed to identify all adverse effects of proposed projects, to consider alternatives, and to identify measures that could be taken to mitigate any adverse effect of the project. While the review process under the National Historic Preservation Act is concerned with accommodating historic preservation concerns, federal and state environmental reviews are more broadly focused. Environmental reviews are designed to determine whether the project may affect its surroundings including, among many elements of consideration, historic places.", "The results of the historic and environmental analyses are also considerations in the approval of a land exchange needed for the Rainbow Bridge project. The federal Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 provides that any lost parklands, including easements, must be replaced with land of equal or higher value. As planned, the Rainbow Bridge project required about half an acre of additional land to expand the U.S. plaza\u2014land that is within the Niagara Reservation State Park. For the parcel of parkland adjacent to the Rainbow Bridge, the Commission proposed to exchange land near the Rainbow Bridge for which it now holds an easement and land near the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. The exchange of this state parkland required agreement from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation. Because the Niagara Reservation had received funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the exchange also requires the Department of the Interior\u2019s approval.

Furthermore, the regulations require that the ACHP be involved in the consultation process when a National Historic Landmark may be adversely affected. The regulations recommend that these consultations take place as early in the planning as possible to provide maximum flexibility in resolving any identified conflicts. In 1990, the Commission took two steps it regarded as initiating coordination for the historic review process. However, neither of these steps directly involved the SHPO or the ACHP. As a consequence, the views of key officials were not obtained until the process had been underway for 2-1/2 years.", "The first step the Commission took to involve historic preservation interests in the project was to include an employee of the state\u2019s Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation on the project\u2019s design selection committee in 1990. In New York, the SHPO is a designated official within the state\u2019s Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation. The Commission has stated that it included the employee on the design selection panel for the purpose of ensuring input regarding historic preservation, and that since the design selection was unanimous, historic preservation interests were addressed. However, the state park\u2019s representative on the panel was not authorized to represent the state of New York in making decisions regarding the historical preservation of properties within the Niagara Reservation. Federal regulations specify that the SHPO is the appropriate official to represent the interests of the state in preserving its cultural heritage.", "In 1990, the Commission took the second step by initiating coordination with the Deputy Commissioner for Planning and Development of the state\u2019s Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation. This official consulted with the Commission regarding the land exchange necessitated by the project. Commission officials cited an October 1990 letter from this official as signifying his intent to guide them in their historic preservation and environmental consultation processes and to act as their liaison to the state agency. This letter commented on land use matters and cited concerns about the Commission\u2019s plans and notes that the Rainbow Bridge proposal represented an adverse effect on a National Historic Landmark. The letter directed the Commission to contact and consult with specified agencies and individuals, including the SHPO and the ACHP. However, this official told us that his role was principally limited to land acquisition and usage and that he was not responsible for the historic preservation review process. The official could not explain why the Commission had the impression that he was coordinating the historic preservation aspects of the Rainbow Bridge project for the state since he was not the SHPO. The Commission\u2019s mistaken reliance continued for 2-1/2 years, during which time it had no contact with the SHPO or the ACHP.", "The SHPO was aware of the Rainbow Bridge project but said that she had not been consulted by the Commission in accordance with federal regulations. The SHPO maintains that, due to the large number of projects requiring historic preservation determinations, those initiating a project have the responsibility under federal and state law to consult with her office before any final decision is made to proceed.", "In November 1990, Commission consultants together with various representatives from the state\u2019s Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation agreed that an environmental assessment would be the appropriate level of analysis for the Rainbow Bridge project. While an environmental assessment may have been an appropriate first step, the project had at least three features that suggested a full environmental impact statement might be needed.", "Acting on this agreement, the Commission\u2019s consultants began an environmental assessment in late 1990. The first product of the assessment process was a November 1991 report on the effect of the proposed project on historic properties that concluded that although the project would directly affect the National Historic Landmark Niagara Reservation, it would have no significant adverse impact. However, this report was prepared without input from either the SHPO or the ACHP. The Commission\u2019s consultants then produced a draft environmental assessment and issued it for comment in December 1992. The draft assessment concluded that the proposed project would have no significant averse impact. During the subsequent comment process, the SHPO\u2019s concerns surfaced about the project\u2019s visual impact on the Niagara Reservation. In March 1993, the SHPO disagreed with the finding of no significant impact. Both the SHPO and the Commission told us that this was the first instance in which the Commission was notified of such concerns.", "The SHPO urged the General Services Administration (GSA), which leases space from the Commission to house federal customs and immigration operations at the bridge and which was familiar with historic preservation and environmental reviews, to take the lead in seeking the needed agreements. GSA officially assumed responsibility for coordinating the historic preservation and environmental reviews for the Rainbow Bridge project in June 1993 and has begun to obtain the needed agreements. As required by the National Historic Preservation Act, GSA formally notified the SHPO and the ACHP of the project on June 30, 1993. ACHP then requested assistance from its consulting agency, the National Park Service, to assess the project\u2019s potential impact on the Niagara Reservation. In December 1993, the National Park Service concluded that the proposed project was incompatible with the setting. Subsequent to this report, the Commission decided to amend its design for the Rainbow Bridge plaza. In April 1994, GSA announced that it would require a full environmental impact statement for the Rainbow Bridge project. A preliminary draft of this document was available for public comment in December 1994. The final draft of the document was delayed to allow consultation under the historic preservation review process, which was largely completed in May 1995. GSA expects to announce the availability of the final draft of the environmental impact statement by the end of July 1995, and, if no further substantive comments are received, it expects to complete the environmental review process with a record of decision in late August.", "On several occasions, the Commission\u2019s general manager told us that the Commission and its consultants had relied on the Deputy Commissioner for Planning and Development in their decision to perform an environmental assessment instead of a full environmental impact statement and relied on him to conduct their coordination with other units within the Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Commission said that the advice received from that state official was from the person whom they thought to be the \u201cperson in charge of\u201d the Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation.

As of August 31, 1994, the Commission had spent about $500,000 on environmental studies, which have been suspended. While the work done thus far may be usable if the project eventually proceeds as planned, it may be of limited value if the major improvements at the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge are not needed in the near future.", "Additionally, the Commission purchased an option on land that would be needed when the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge project got under way. The project as originally planned required about 50 acres of land owned by the Canadian National Railway for the construction of approach roadways and inspection facilities. Rather than purchase the land outright, the Commission purchased an option in June 1993 to maintain flexibility for phasing in the capital program. As payment, the Commission placed $15.5 million in Canadian currency in escrow, with the interest accruing to Canadian National.

However, in contrast to the Commission\u2019s plans, this study did not envision the use of the upper level by large commercial trucks. The study recommended that use of the bridge be restricted, as it currently is, to open bed and single commodity trucks, and the plan specified that provision for commercial vehicle warehouse inspection facilities, planned by the Commission, not be made.", "While the bridge study was under way, another study was started that drew into question the major highway linkages that were needed to make this project feasible. The Commission\u2019s Thirty-Year Plan called for it to acquire land and construct roadways from the bridge out to major local streets by 1996. In the longer term, connection would be made by U.S. and Canadian agencies to major highways in each country. The second study, TransFocus 2021, was issued in draft for comment by the Province of Ontario in April 1994 and finalized in April 1995. The study called for an environmental assessment as well as a study of the feasibility and timing of linking the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge with highway 420 in Canada, rather than the linkage with Canadian highway 405 which the Commission had planned.
