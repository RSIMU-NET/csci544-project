Medicare payments to IRFs have grown steadily over the past decade. In this report, GAO (1) identifies the conditions--on and off the list--that IRF Medicare patients have and the number of IRFs that meet a 75 percent threshold, (2) describes IRF admission criteria and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) review of admissions, and (3) evaluates use of a list of conditions in the rule. GAO analyzed data on Medicare patients (the majority of patients in IRFs) admitted to IRFs in FY 2003, spoke to IRF medical directors, and had the Institute of Medicine (IOM) convene a meeting of experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2003, fewer than half of all IRF Medicare patients were admitted for having a condition on the list in the 75 percent rule, and few IRFs admitted at least 75 percent of their patients for one of those conditions. The largest group of patients had orthopedic conditions, not all of which were on the list in the rule, which had been suspended in 2002. Almost half of all patients with conditions not on the list were admitted for orthopedic conditions, and among those the largest group was joint replacement patients. Although some joint replacement patients may need admission to an IRF, GAO's analysis showed that few of these patients had comorbidities that suggested a possible need for the IRF level of services. Additionally, GAO found that only 6 percent of IRFs in fiscal year 2003 were able to meet a 75 percent threshold. IRFs varied in the criteria used to assess patients for admission, and CMS has not routinely reviewed IRF admission decisions. IRF officials reported that the criteria they used to make admission decisions included patient characteristics such as function, as well as condition. CMS, working through its fiscal intermediaries, has not routinely reviewed IRF admission decisions. The experts IOM convened and other clinical and nonclinical experts GAO interviewed differed on whether conditions should be added to the list in the 75 percent rule but agreed that condition alone does not provide sufficient criteria to identify the types of patients appropriate for IRFs. The experts IOM convened questioned the strength of the evidence for adding conditions to the list, finding the evidence for certain orthopedic conditions particularly weak, and they called for further research to identify the types of patients that need inpatient rehabilitation and to understand the effectiveness of IRFs. Other experts did not agree on whether conditions, including a broader category of joint replacements, should be added to the list. Experts, including those IOM convened, generally agreed that condition alone is insufficient for identifying appropriate types of patients for inpatient rehabilitation, since within any condition only a subgroup of patients require the level of services of an IRF, and contended that functional status should also be considered."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under authority provided in the Social Security Act, the Secretary defines a rehabilitation  hospital and unit. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a71395ww(d)(1)(B) (2000).", "Not all patients with a given condition may require the level of rehabilitation provided in  an IRF. For example, although a subset of patients who have had a stroke may require the  intensive level of care provided by an IRF, others may be less severely disabled and require  less intensive services.", "Medicaid Services (CMS) relies on a regulation commonly known as the  \u201c75 percent rule,\u201d which was initially issued in 1983 and most recently  revised in 2004. The 2004 rule, which is being implemented over a 3-year  transition period, states that if a facility can show that during a 12-month  period at least 75 percent of all its patients, including its Medicare patients,  required intensive rehabilitation services for the treatment of at least 1 of  the 13 conditions listed in the rule, it may be classified as an IRF. The rule  allows the remaining 25 percent of patients to have other conditions not  listed in the rule. An IRF that does not comply with the requirements of  the 75 percent rule may lose its classification as an IRF and therefore no  longer be eligible for payment at a higher rate. In addition to the   75 percent rule, IRFs must meet six other facility criteria to be classified as  an IRF.", "IRF compliance with the requirements of the rule has been problematic,  and some IRFs have questioned the requirements of the rule. CMS data  indicate that in 2002 only 13 percent of IRFs had at least 75 percent of  patients in 1 of the 10 conditions on the list at that time. CMS suspended  enforcement of the rule in 2002. IRF officials have contended that the list  of conditions in the rule should be updated because of changes in  medicine that have occurred since the list was established in 1983 and the  concomitant expansion of the population that could benefit from inpatient  rehabilitation services. They have noted that their patients are older than  the population served in 1983 and are surviving longer with conditions  they may not have survived in earlier years. CMS issued a final rule\u2014 effective July 1, 2004\u2014that increased the number of conditions from 10 to  13, adding, for example, certain hip and knee joint replacements. The 2004  final rule also laid out a 3-year transition period during which enforcement  of the rule is to be resumed, with the threshold for percentage of patients  meeting the condition requirements being lowered to 50 percent for the  first year and rising in stages to reach 75 percent for the IRF\u2019s cost  reporting period starting on or after July 2007.", "IRFs need to be correctly classified to be distinguished from settings in  which less intensive rehabilitation is provided because the difference in  payments to IRFs and payments to these other settings can be substantial.  For example, the estimated Medicare per case payment in 2004 for a  patient who underwent a major joint and limb replacement of a lower  extremity was $17,135 to an IRF and $6,165 to a SNF. Similarly, the  estimated per case payment for a patient with a stroke was $34,196 to an  IRF and $8,905 to a SNF. Therefore, if IRFs are not correctly classified,  Medicare is at risk of making large overpayments to incorrectly classified  facilities. Medicare is also at risk of overpayment for individual patients in  an IRF if patients are admitted who could be treated in a less intensive  setting. IRFs are required to assess patients prior to admission to ensure  they require the level of services provided in an IRF, and CMS is  responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of individual admissions  after the patient has been discharged through reviews for medical  necessity conducted under contract by its fiscal intermediaries (FI).", "The Conference Report that accompanied the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 directed us to issue a report,  in consultation with experts in the field of physical medicine and  rehabilitation, to assess whether the current list of conditions represents a  clinically appropriate standard for defining IRF services and, if not, to  determine which additional conditions should be added to the list. In this  report, we (1) identify the conditions that IRF Medicare patients have, the  number of these patients considered to have 1 of the 13 conditions, and  the number of IRFs that meet the requirements of the 75 percent rule;   (2) describe how IRFs assess patients for admission and whether CMS  reviews admission decisions; and (3) evaluate the approach of using a list  of conditions in the 75 percent rule to classify IRFs.", "We analyzed the 2003 data\u2014the most recent data available at the time\u2014using the 13  conditions in the current regulation even though in fiscal year 2003 there were 10  conditions on the list. used these codes to determine whether we considered the patient\u2019s  primary or comorbid condition to be linked to a condition on the list in the  rule. We also obtained and analyzed Medicare claims records for fiscal  year 2003 to identify patients that had been discharged from an acute care  hospital to an IRF. We assessed the reliability of the IRF-PAI data by  interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data and by  interviewing other researchers who had conducted analyses using the IRF- PAI data. For both the IRF-PAI data and the claims data we performed  electronic testing of required data elements. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for this analysis. Although we applied different  threshold levels to illustrate the impact of the transition period on the  number of IRFs that meet the requirements of the rule, we did not assess  the appropriateness of any threshold level. Our analyses used  administrative data only, and estimates could be different if medical  records were used.", "To determine how IRFs assess patients for admission and whether CMS  reviews admission decisions, we conducted structured interviews. We  interviewed the medical director at each of 12 IRFs selected to vary by  region and level of compliance with the 75 percent rule. We also  interviewed the medical director (or designee) at each of the 10 FIs that  covered the states in which the 12 IRFs are located (out of a total of 30  FIs). In addition, we interviewed an official representing each of CMS\u2019s 10  regional offices to determine whether any IRFs had ever been declassified  based on failure to comply with the 75 percent rule, and we interviewed  three insurers and one regional managed care organization about their  procedures for referring enrollees to IRFs.", "To evaluate the approach of using a list of conditions in the 75 percent rule  to classify IRFs, we contracted with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of The  National Academies to convene a 1-day meeting of clinical experts in  physical medicine and rehabilitation, including physicians, rehabilitation  nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, a speech and language  therapist, and clinical researchers in the field (referred to in this report as  \u201cthe experts IOM convened\u201d).", "In total, we talked with 106 individuals, of whom 65 were clinicians,  including the experts IOM convened.

However, the amendments excluded  \u201crehabilitation hospitals,\u201d and so IRFs continued to be paid under a  reasonable-cost-based retrospective system. Before the IPPS was  implemented, CMS consulted with the Joint Commission on Accreditation  of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and other accrediting organizations  to determine how to classify IRFs, that is, distinguish them from other  facilities for payment purposes. The 75 percent rule was established for  that purpose in 1983. To develop the original list of conditions in the 75  percent rule, CMS relied, in part, on information from the American  Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, the American Congress  of Rehabilitation Medicine, the National Association of Rehabilitation  Facilities, and the American Hospital Association. According to CMS, the  conditions on the list accounted for approximately 75 percent of the  admissions to IRFs when the original list was developed. In January 2002 a  prospective payment system (PPS) was implemented for IRFs\u2014known as  the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (IRF PPS).", "On June 7, 2002, CMS suspended the enforcement of the 75 percent rule  after its study of FIs, which have responsibility under contract with CMS  for verifying compliance with the rule, revealed that they were using  inconsistent methods to determine whether an IRF was in compliance and  that in some cases IRFs were not being reviewed for compliance at all.  Specifically, CMS found that only 20 of the 29 FIs conducted reviews for  IRF compliance with the 75 percent rule and that the FIs that did these  reviews used different methods and data sources. In 2004, CMS  standardized the verification process that the FIs were to use to determine  if an IRF met the classification criteria, including how to determine  whether a patient is considered to have 1 of the 13 conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 2004 Final Rule", "paragraphs": ["When the final rule was made effective on July 1, 2004, a transition period  was established for IRFs to meet the requirements of the rule.

But at the end of the transition period, a patient cannot be counted toward  the required threshold on the basis of a comorbidity on the list in the rule.  The requirements of the transition period are as follows:    July 1, 2004, to June 30, 2005: 50 percent threshold, counting comorbidities    July 1, 2005, to June 30, 2006: 60 percent threshold, counting comorbidities    July 1, 2006, to June 30, 2007: 65 percent threshold, counting comorbidities  Effective July 1, 2007, the threshold will be 75 percent, not counting  comorbidities.", "During the 3-year transition period, CMS plans to analyze claims and  patient assessment data to evaluate if and how the 75 percent threshold  should be modified. In addition, the agency has announced its willingness  to consider alternative policy proposals to the 75 percent rule submitted  during this period. In the past, CMS has declined requests to modify the  rule\u2019s threshold or list of conditions, citing a lack of supporting or  objective data from the clinical community. However, in the final rule, the  agency solicited \u201cobjective data or evidence from well-designed research  studies\u201d that would support a change in the rule\u2019s 75 percent threshold or  list of conditions.

Although the experts IOM convened did not comment on every  condition on the list, the group generally agreed that the data on the  benefits of intensive inpatient rehabilitation for stroke are  \u201cincontrovertible.\u201d For certain other conditions on the list, such as spinal  cord injury and traumatic brain injury, they reported that it is reasonable  to expect intensive inpatient rehabilitation to provide good outcomes  because these patients need intensive training about self-care and patients  with traumatic brain injury may also require behavioral services. One  expert questioned the strength of the evidence related to hip fractures,  saying it was unclear whether patients with a hip fracture would be better  served by sending them home right away, by putting them in an IRF, or by  giving them some combination of intensive inpatient rehabilitation, home  health care, or care in a SNF.", "The condition the experts IOM convened discussed most was joint  replacement, which was the most common condition for patients admitted  to IRFs and is included on the list of conditions in the rule but only under  certain circumstances. In general, they reported that, except for a few  subpopulations, uncomplicated unilateral joint replacement patients rarely  need to be admitted to an IRF. For example, one of the experts said that  admission to an IRF of a healthy person with an uncomplicated joint  replacement is an example of a practice that is not evidence-based, and  others said that there are no data and little evidence on the effectiveness  of intensive inpatient rehabilitation for elective joint replacement patients.  Another expert stated that the evidence on the benefits of IRF services for  hip fracture and joint replacement patients is \u201cvery, very weak,\u201d that  orthopedics is the \u201cheart of the issue\u201d related to the list of conditions in  the rule, and that a panel of clinicians should be convened to focus solely  on the orthopedic conditions.", "Most of the experts IOM convened called for more research in several  areas, including which types of patients can be treated best in IRFs and the  effectiveness of IRFs in comparison with other settings of care. CMS has  also identified questions for a future research agenda that can assess the  efficacy of rehabilitation services in various settings.

Of these, all suggested the  addition of cardiac conditions, and some identified other conditions, such  as pulmonary conditions, transplants, and more joint replacements than  are currently on the list. The reasons these IRF officials gave for adding  these conditions included that these patients can become weakened  physically during a hospital stay and need services in an IRF to regain their  strength and also that their experience shows they can achieve good  outcomes for these patients. The remaining IRF officials said no  conditions should be added. Some reasons they cited were that these  patients can be treated in a less intensive setting, the conditions are too  broad to be meaningful, and using a list of conditions is the wrong  approach. IRF officials differed regarding the addition of joint replacement  patients. Half of them suggested that joint replacement be more broadly  defined to include more patients, saying, for example, that the current  requirements were too restrictive and arbitrary, and a couple of them said  that unilateral joint replacement patients are not generally appropriate for  IRFs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Contended That Functional Status, in Addition to Condition, Should Be Used to Identify Appropriate Types of Patients for Intensive Inpatient Rehabilitation", "paragraphs": ["The experts IOM convened contended that condition alone was  insufficient for identifying which patients, or types of patients, required  the level of services available in an IRF and generally agreed that  functional status should also be used.

But the experts IOM  convened generally agreed that condition, by itself, was insufficient and  that more information was needed. They said that condition alone fails to  identify the subgroup within each condition that is most appropriate for  intensive inpatient rehabilitation. For example, one of them noted that  although an IRF could be filled with patients that have conditions on the  list in the rule, the patients could be completely inappropriate for that  setting. Another expert at the meeting reported general agreement among  the group that using diagnosis alone is not sufficient.", "In addition to the experts convened by IOM, other experts we interviewed  also said that condition alone was insufficient because having a condition  on the list in the rule does not automatically indicate the need for intensive  inpatient rehabilitation (e.g., even though stroke is on the list, only a  subgroup of stroke patients require IRF services) and having a condition  not on the list does not necessarily mean the patient does not need IRF  services (e.g., although there is no cardiac condition on the list, a  subgroup of cardiac patients need the level of services of an IRF). In  addition, the FI and IRF officials we interviewed generally reported as well  that condition alone was insufficient. Over half the FI officials we  interviewed said that condition is insufficient by itself to determine the  need for intensive inpatient rehabilitation, and some said that diagnosis is  only a starting point. As noted earlier, all the IRF officials reported using a  variety of criteria, beyond condition, to assess patients for admission,  including function.", "Among the experts convened by IOM, functional status was identified  most frequently as the information required in addition to condition. Half  of the experts IOM convened commented on the need to add information  about functional status, such as functional need, functional decline, motor  and cognitive function, and functional disability. To measure both  diagnosis and function, one of them suggested using the case-mix groups  because they combine both dimensions.", "Experts we interviewed also raised some concerns, however, about using  function as a measure of need for intensive inpatient rehabilitation. The  concerns voiced by the FI officials we interviewed included the potential  for abuse by qualifying more patients for admissions and the potential for  difficulty in adjudicating claims. One FI official said that moving toward an  assessment of functional status would require a better instrument than  currently exists. Another expert we interviewed said that using only  functional status could lead to including custodial patients that are  currently in SNFs. Officials at CMS also expressed concerns regarding  how to measure the need for intensive inpatient rehabilitation based on  functional status because a patient can have a low functional status but  not need intensive inpatient rehabilitation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts IOM Convened Suggested Factors to Consider Using to Classify IRFs", "paragraphs": ["Almost all the experts IOM convened said that IRF classification should  include characteristics of the patients served, but a couple said that IRF  classification should not include patient characteristics.

Some of the experts IOM convened also suggested that the  percentage threshold be set at a lower level than 75 percent (for example,  60 percent or 65 percent) as a compromise until more information  becomes available to modify the list in the rule.", "The experts IOM convened who opposed using patient characteristics to  classify IRFs suggested that IRFs be classified with just the other six  facility criteria, potentially looking at state licensure requirements for  additional facility criteria that could be applied specifically to IRFs. These  experts (as well as others we interviewed) said that no other facility is  classified using both patient and facility characteristics and that IRFs are  unique in being subjected to this approach. However, Medicare does  classify other facilities that are exempt from IPPS using a characteristic  about the patients served in those facilities.

Of those patients whose primary or comorbid  condition was not on the list, the largest group was joint replacement  patients whose condition did not fit the list\u2019s specific criteria for joint  replacement. The experts IOM convened and other experts we interviewed  reported that unilateral, uncomplicated joint replacement patients rarely  need to be in an IRF. These experts also reported that patients who may  not need to be in an IRF may have been admitted because CMS has not  been routinely reviewing the IRFs\u2019 admission decisions to determine  whether they were medically justified. Increased scrutiny of individual  admissions through routine reviews for medical necessity following  patient discharge could be used to target problems and vulnerabilities and  thereby reduce the number of inappropriate admissions in the future.", "While some patients do not need to be in an IRF, the need for IRF services  may be more difficult to determine for other patients. The experts  convened by IOM called for more research to understand the effectiveness  of intensive inpatient rehabilitation, reporting that the evidence for the  effectiveness of IRF services varied in strength for conditions on the list  and was particularly weak for certain orthopedic conditions. CMS has also  recognized the need for more research in this area and asked NIH to  convene one meeting to help identify research priorities for inpatient  rehabilitation. Research studies that can produce information on a timely  basis, such as observational studies or meetings of clinical experts with  specialized expertise, would be especially helpful in this effort.", "The presence of patients in IRFs who may not need that level of services  and the calls for more research on the effectiveness of inpatient  rehabilitation lead us to conclude that greater clarity is needed in the rule  about what types of patients are most appropriate for rehabilitation in an  IRF. There was general agreement among the experts we interviewed,  including the experts convened by IOM, that condition alone is not  sufficient to identify the most appropriate types of patients since within  any condition only a subgroup of patients require the level of services of  an IRF. We believe that if condition alone is not sufficient to identify the  most appropriate types of patients, it would not be useful to add more  conditions to the list at the present time. There was also general  agreement among the experts that more information is needed to  characterize appropriate types of patients, and the most commonly  identified factor was functional status. However, some of the experts  convened by IOM recognized the challenge of operationalizing a measure  of function, and some experts questioned the ability of current assessment  tools to predict which types of patients will improve if treated in an IRF.  Despite the challenge, more clearly delineating the most appropriate types  of patients would offer more direction to IRFs\u2014and to the health  professionals that refer patients to them\u2014about which types of patients  can be treated in IRFs.", "We believe that action to conduct reviews for medical necessity and to  produce more information about the effectiveness of inpatient  rehabilitation could support future efforts to refine the rule over time to  increase its clarity about which types of patients are most appropriate for  IRFs.

In its technical comments, CMS also raised concerns about our use  of fiscal year 2003 data.

We used  several different sources of data, including data from the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) about Medicare patients admitted to  IRFs; interviews with officials at IRFs, fiscal intermediaries (FI), CMS  regional offices, and private insurers; a 1-day meeting of clinical experts in  the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation; and interviews with other  clinical and nonclinical experts and researchers in the field of  rehabilitation as well as officials from professional associations of various  disciplines involved in inpatient rehabilitation. In total, during this  engagement, we spoke with 106 individuals, of whom 65 were clinicians.  We conducted our work from May 2004 through April 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "To identify the conditions that IRF patients have, we obtained from CMS  the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility\u2014Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF- PAI) records for all IRF admissions of Medicare patients for fiscal year  2003 (October 1, 2002, to September 30, 2003), which have data on patient  age and sex, impairment group code and case-mix group (CMG)  classification, and comorbid conditions. To assess whether individual  patients were considered to have 1 of the 13 conditions defined by the list  of conditions in CMS\u2019s 75 percent rule, we applied the criteria laid out in  CMS\u2019s Medicare Claims Processing Manual. This document lists the  specific impairment group codes and ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes for  comorbid conditions entered into the patient\u2019s IRF-PAI record that were  used to identify patients who belonged in the 13 conditions. We  conducted our analyses on Medicare patients only because CMS records  contained data on the largest number of IRFs and the majority of patients  in IRFs are covered by Medicare. Prior work by RAND found that the  percentage of Medicare patients with the conditions on the list in the rule  was a good predictor of the percentage of total patients in the conditions  on the list in the rule. We analyzed these data at the patient level to  compare compliance with the rule across impairment groups. To permit a  discrete assignment of each patient to one impairment group, we gave  priority to the impairment group code designated at admission. To assess  the extent to which Medicare patients in IRFs with joint replacements had  comorbidities, we examined their distribution among the four payment  tiers assigned under the prospective payment system for IRFs. The  assigned CMG in the IRF-PAI data set includes a letter prefix that indicates  that the patient either had no comorbidities related to the cost of  providing inpatient rehabilitation or had one or more comorbidities  expected to have a low, medium, or high impact on those costs. We  calculated the proportion of joint replacement patients that fell into the  no-comorbidity group, both overall and within each of the six joint  replacement CMGs. To do our supplementary analysis on a sample of 2004  data, we compared the proportion of Medicare patients admitted to an IRF  whose primary condition was joint replacement from July through  December 2003 to the proportion of such patients from July through  December 2004, using data from IRF-PAI records. We computed the  proportion of Medicare patients admitted to IRFs that were joint  replacement patients, ranked the facilities according to the proportion of  Medicare joint replacement patients in 2003, and calculated the difference  across the two time periods.", "To determine the number of IRFs that met the requirements of the   75 percent rule, we aggregated Medicare patients treated at the same IRF  and calculated the total percentage of each IRF\u2019s patients that were  admitted with a primary condition or a comorbid condition on the list in  the rule. We examined the distribution of compliance levels across IRFs,  applying the different thresholds that the rule phases in over several years,  but we did not assess the appropriateness of any threshold level. To  determine whether any IRFs had ever been declassified based on failure to  comply with the 75 percent rule, we interviewed officials at CMS\u2019s 10  regional offices.", "Our analyses rely on Medicare billing information, and we determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for this analysis. We followed the  instructions CMS provided to FIs to \u201cpresumptively verify compliance\u201d  using the list of codes in the Medicare Claims Processing Manual to  estimate how many patients have one of the conditions on the list in the  rule as recorded on the IRF-PAI instrument. FIs use the list of codes in this  manual as a first step to estimate how many patients have one of the  conditions on the list in the rule. To assess the reliability of the IRF-PAI  records for our data analyses, we interviewed two researchers who had  experience using the IRF-PAI data set, and performed electronic testing of  the required data elements, including impairment codes, comorbid  conditions, and admission dates. We examined the IRF-PAI data set and  found few missing or invalid entries for the variables we used. We did not  compare the information entered on the IRF-PAI to medical records. All of  these analyses encompassed services provided in facilities located in the  50 states and the District of Columbia.", "To determine how IRFs assess patients for admission and how CMS  reviews admission decisions for medical necessity, we interviewed the  medical directors at 12 IRFs and the medical director or designee at 10 FIs.  We used data from the RAND Corporation\u2019s \u201cCase Mix Certification Rule  for Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities\u201d (2003), prepared under contract to  CMS, to select our respondents out of a total of more than 1,200 IRFs.  RAND had analyzed the level of compliance of each IRF with the rule  using the 10 conditions on the list at that time. We used RAND data to  create a sampling frame to select IRFs to interview, but we did not rely on  RAND\u2019s data for any findings or conclusions. We matched facilities with  data from the IRF-PAI to identify them and sorted them by zip code  according to the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West regions as defined  by the U.S. Census Bureau. Within each region, we selected IRFs with a  high, median, and low level of compliance with the 75 percent rule. We  identified the median complier in each region, and if necessary adjusted  the selection of IRFs to (1) avoid interviewing more than one IRF in the  same state and (2) provide a selection of for-profit, freestanding, and rural  facilities. If a selected provider was unwilling or unable to participate in  the interview, we substituted the IRF next on the list that was most similar  in characteristics to the facility originally chosen. We conducted a  structured interview with the medical director of each facility, and  provided unstructured time at the end of the interview for the respondent  to raise other issues. For nonclinical questions that the medical directors  were unable to answer, we spoke to a member of the administrative team.  We identified the areas covered in the interviews through background  interviews with professional associations, advocacy groups, CMS, and  experts in inpatient rehabilitation and health policy research, and  pretested the interview protocol with two IRFs not included in our sample.", "The FIs we selected to interview were those that serviced the states in  which the IRFs we selected were located. Because some FIs serviced more  than one state, our selection yielded 10 FIs (out of a total of 30). To  facilitate our interviews, we spoke with the appropriate CMS regional  office, which notified an official at each FI about this engagement. We  conducted a structured interview with the medical director or designee  regarding (1) appropriate patients for inpatient rehabilitation, (2) the list  of conditions in the rule, (3) assessment for compliance, and (4) reviews  for medical necessity. We pretested the interview protocol with three FIs  that were not included in our sample. We also spoke with FI officials who  had been identified as being interested in inpatient rehabilitation. All FI  officials had the opportunity to discuss issues other than those we  highlighted. To compare Medicare\u2019s approach to the approaches of other  payers, we selected a convenience sample of three insurers and one  regional managed care organization to learn about their activities  regarding inpatient rehabilitation. We interviewed officials from these  payers, asking how they identified facilities for intensive inpatient  rehabilitation, and how they identified appropriate patients for such  services.", "Our interviews do not represent all concerns or experiences of inpatient  rehabilitation facilities, FIs, or private payers, and the answers to the  structured interviews were not restricted to Medicare patients. Because  we were directed to examine the 75 percent rule and not directly to  evaluate the relative value of inpatient rehabilitation, we did not ask  questions about the full spectrum of postacute care.", "To evaluate the approach of using a list of conditions in the 75 percent rule  to classify IRFs, we contracted with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of The  National Academies to convene a 1-day meeting of clinical experts broadly  representative of the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. We  identified for IOM the categories of participants preferred at the meeting.  To identify specific participants, IOM obtained input from us, IOM  members, advocacy groups, and individual experts in the field. It identified  a pool of participants according to the preferred categories. In total, 14  experts participated: 4 practicing physicians, 2 physical therapists, 2  occupational therapists, 1 speech therapist, 2 nurses, 1  physician/researcher in postacute care, 1 physician/researcher from a  research institute, and 1 health services researcher. The meeting was  facilitated by a physician/researcher with expertise in Medicare payment  policy. Invitations to participate were issued by IOM. Participants were  invited as individual experts, not as organizational representatives. The  group was not asked to reach consensus on any issues, and IOM was not  asked to produce or publish a report of the meeting. We observed the  meeting and subsequently reviewed the transcript and audiotape of the  meeting, listed the individual comments made during the meeting, and  grouped the comments around a limited number of themes. The comments  from the meeting of the experts IOM convened represent their individual  statements and not a consensus of the group as a whole. In convening the  meeting, IOM was not able to get participation of clinical experts who  were not employed in IRFs (such as referring physicians or therapists in  acute care settings) and a private payer. The comments of participants  should not be interpreted to represent the views of IOM or all clinical  experts in the field of rehabilitation.", "To examine the proportion of Medicare patients discharged from hospitals  with different diagnosis-related groups (DRG) who went to IRFs for  postacute care, we obtained CMS\u2019s Medicare Provider Analysis and  Review (MEDPAR) file that contained all Medicare inpatient discharges  from both acute care hospitals and IRFs for fiscal year 2003. This file  provided information on patient admission and discharge dates from acute  care hospitals and rehabilitation facilities along with the DRG assigned for  each acute care stay. We identified all the patients who entered IRFs  within 30 days of their hospital discharge during fiscal year 2003 and  calculated the frequencies for each DRG among them. We then selected  the 19 DRGs that represented at least 1 percent of IRF admissions from  acute care hospitals. Next we determined the total number of hospital  discharges with those DRGs and computed the proportion of patients in  each of these DRGs that were admitted to an IRF within 30 days. The  analysis of acute hospital discharges required that we use the separate  MEDPAR file that had information on inpatient DRGs and on patients who  did not enter IRFs as well as those who did. The MEDPAR analysis may  therefore reflect a slightly different IRF patient population from that  reflected in the analyses conducted with the IRF-PAI data set.
