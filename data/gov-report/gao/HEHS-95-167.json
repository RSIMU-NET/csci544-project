States remain concerned about the growing number of individuals lacking health coverage and about financing health plans for low-income individuals. Employers have become increasingly aggressive in managing their health plans and have adopted a wide variety of managed care plans and innovative funding arrangements. Despite the recent moderation of health care cost increases, both states and employers continue to seek approaches that will enable them to more effectively provide health care coverage to their respective constituencies.", "Much of the debate on this subject centers on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides a federal framework for regulating employer-based pension and welfare benefit plans, including health plans. Most Americans receive health care coverage through employment, and most of these health plans are subject to ERISA requirements. ERISA preemption effectively blocks states from directly regulating most employer-based health plans, but it permits states to regulate health insurers. Because the distinction between prohibiting states from directly regulating employer health coverage and allowing them to regulate health insurers is sometimes obscure, the courts have had to determine many of the actual implications of ERISA preemption.", "Because employer health plans are generally beyond the scope of state authority, states consider ERISA a major obstacle to their ability to effectively manage their health care markets. Although states seek changes in ERISA to give them more flexibility to increase access to health care and lower health costs, only Hawaii has received a statutory exception from ERISA. The business community, however, notes that, by specifically preventing states from regulating employers\u2019 voluntary provision of health coverage, ERISA promotes more effective provision of such coverage. Business leaders maintain that ERISA is the lynchpin of their efforts to effectively manage the cost and quality of the health care plans they offer their employees.", "To assist the Congress in its decision-making on this issue, you asked us to provide information on (1) ERISA\u2019s relationship to the current system of employer-based health coverage, (2) the implications of the trend toward employer self-funding on the oversight of employees\u2019 health care coverage, (3) the kinds of state actions preempted by ERISA, and (4) the advantages of ERISA preemption to employers that offer health care coverage to their workers.", "To develop this information, we interviewed officials representing the following entities: state associations; the states of Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington, and North Carolina; large multistate employers; business associations; and the Department of Labor. To a lesser extent, we also contacted several insurers, managed care plans, unions, providers, consumer advocates, and their national representatives.

In general, ERISA prevents states from regulating employer health plans but allows them to regulate the terms and conditions of health insurance sold in the state. Thus, for example, states cannot require employers to provide health care coverage, but they can require that all health insurance policies sold in the state include specific benefits (for example, mental health benefits). This results in a very different regulatory framework depending on whether the employer purchases its health care coverage from an insurer, which the state regulates, or self-funds its health plan, avoiding many state regulations.", "Although ERISA prevents states from directly regulating employer health plans, it does impose certain federal requirements on all health plans. These include reporting requirements providing, for example, that information about each plan be reported annually to the Department of Labor; disclosure requirements ensuring that plan participants and beneficiaries have access to information about the plan; fiduciary obligations prohibiting conflicts of interest and imposing certain fund management and investment practices; and plan claims filing procedures including, for example, a process for appealing claim denials.", "ERISA does not, however, require employers to provide or maintain a minimum level of health benefits nor to set aside funds to pay for expected health claims.", "ERISA requirements apply to all private employer-based health plans, whether fully insured through a third party or self-funded. In a self-funded health plan, an employer directly holds much of the financial risk associated with its employees\u2019 health care costs. Often, an employer that self-funds simplifies its administrative burden by contracting with an insurance company or other organization to perform administrative services. In addition, an employer that self-funds often purchases stop-loss insurance that moderates its risk by capping the amount of claims it will pay directly for either an individual or the group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect on Health Plans Changing as Courts Continue to Interpret ERISA Preemption", "paragraphs": ["Court decisions on the scope of ERISA preemption continue to affect the nature and structure of employer-based health plans. ERISA was initially passed primarily in response to concerns about the solvency and security of employer-based pension plans, but its preemption clause made it possible for employers to provide all employee benefits\u2014including health plans\u2014largely free from state regulation. The impact of ERISA has become increasingly significant as the number of self-funded health plans has grown."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Court Decisions Lead to Sharp Distinction in Regulating Self-Funded and Fully Insured Plans", "paragraphs": ["The original ERISA preemption language was sufficiently ambiguous that courts have had to elaborate on its scope. Courts have tried to delineate how closely state laws must relate to employer health plans to be preempted. In Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, a unanimous Supreme Court identified a crucial distinction under ERISA between the treatment afforded health plans that are self-funded and those that are fully insured. The Court\u2019s decision permitted states to generally enforce laws that apply to insurers even though this would impact the employee health plans that they insure.", "In effect, this decision has produced a divided regulatory system: the federal government retains the sole authority under ERISA to regulate employer-based health plans but not health policies sold by insurance companies; states can regulate health insurance companies and their policies but not the plans provided by employers. Thus, insured health plans are subject to specific consumer protections, state-mandated benefit laws, premium taxes, any-willing-provider laws, and participation in community-rated or high-risk pools; self-funded health plans are not.", "The distinction between self-funded and fully insured health plans does not, however, extend to health care coverage offered by federal, state, and local governments. For example, health plans offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), although not self-funded, are not subject to many state regulations such as insurance premium taxes and mandated benefits. Similarly, some state health plans are legally exempt from compliance with state requirements, although these plans often do comply or, in some instances, have legal requirements that apply only to state employee health plans.", "Table 1 categorizes and summarizes regulatory differences among employer-based health plans.", "The courts continue to delineate what state actions are allowed or preempted under ERISA. Recently, the Supreme Court issued its decision in New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co. This decision did not delineate fully between state actions that are preempted and those that are not but indicated that courts may approve state actions that do not conflict with ERISA\u2019s underlying objectives or impact too greatly on employee benefit plans. In the wake of the Court\u2019s ruling in Travelers, states are likely to perceive that they have more options and greater flexibility than previously recognized. In particular, the decision permits New York and other states to adopt hospital rate setting systems and may permit states to tax providers. The case suggests that state laws affecting employee health plans will have to be judged individually on the facts and circumstances in each case. The nature and magnitude of the impact on employee benefit plans of each state law at issue will determine the outcome. In cases in which the state law does not conflict with ERISA\u2019s objectives, it should survive legal challenge. The Travelers case leaves substantial questions unresolved about ERISA preemption that may need to be resolved through further litigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employers Adopt Funding Methods That Blur Distinction Between Self-Funded and Fully Insured", "paragraphs": ["Although ERISA and court decisions have produced a sharp distinction in the regulatory status of self-funded and insured health plans, most employer plans can be categorized as ranging from full insurance to complete self-funding. Clearly distinguishing between self-funded and fully insured plans is growing more difficult as the health market changes. Among factors contributing to the confusion are more extensive use of stop-loss coverage and innovative risk-sharing arrangements between employers and managed care organizations.", "The level of stop-loss coverage that a self-funded employer purchases is one factor that influences where an employer\u2019s plan fits within this range: A plan with a low stop-loss threshold self-funds a smaller share of its risk than a plan with a high stop-loss threshold. Particularly among smaller employers, some health plans have stop-loss coverage beginning at a relatively low level of health claims. In addition, many employers that offer self-funded health plans also provide insured coverage to some employees. For instance, many employers that provide a self-funded plan also offer their employees a choice of one or more health maintenance organizations (HMO) that may not be self-funded. Some employers, however, are beginning to adopt alternative financing arrangements with managed care plans that place some financial risk with the employer as well as the plan and its providers. Some employers may also provide coverage for specific conditions, such as cancer or mental health care, through a separate plan that may be either insured or self-funded. In many cases, employees will not know whether their employer-based health plan is self-funded or purchased through an insurer, especially since commercial insurers often provide administrative services for self-funded health plans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data Are Limited but Indicate That Employers Are Increasingly Self-Funding", "paragraphs": ["Data on the number and characteristics of self-funded ERISA plans are scant largely because efforts to collect this information on the federal level have been limited.

Employers have increasingly self-funded to better manage their costs, through greater control over their health benefits and plan assets, as well as to maintain uniformity in health plans that cross state borders.", "The federal government is the only entity that can collect complete data on the number and characteristics of self-funded plans because ERISA preempts state efforts to require employers to provide health plan data. Because (1) the current federal reporting requirements focus on pension plans rather than health plans, (2) health plans with fewer than 100 participants are generally exempt from reporting, and (3) inconsistencies exist among the data reported for health plans, the current data are of little value in assessing the number or characteristics of employers that self-fund their health plans. Furthermore, the Department of Labor is currently considering revisions, but whether this would enhance or reduce the information available on self-funded health plans is unclear.", "The lack of a clear distinction between self-funded and insured health plans also contributes to the difficulty in estimating the number of individuals enrolled in self-funded plans. Particularly as the distinction between self-funded and fully insured plans has blurred due to the increased use of stop-loss coverage and alternative funding arrangements with HMOs, surveys and employers inconsistently report whether a plan is self-funded or fully insured.", "Despite incomplete data, our analysis of employer benefits surveys shows that in 1993 approximately 44 million individuals, or 17 percent of the U.S. population, were enrolled in self-funded ERISA health plans (see fig. 1). An additional 27 percent of the population, or about 69 million individuals, were enrolled in insured plans that are also subject to ERISA. Thus, a total of nearly 114 million Americans were enrolled in ERISA plans. The remainder of the population either had coverage from a government or church employer (27 million), Medicare (31 million), Medicaid (24 million), individual insurance (20 million), or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) health plans (5 million); 40 million individuals were uninsured.", "The number of individuals enrolled in self-funded plans appears to be growing. On the basis of calculations we made from existing data sources, the total number of individuals enrolled in self-funded plans increased by nearly 6 million from 1989 to 1993. This growth is occurring in firms of all sizes. As shown in figure 2, the percentage of plan participants enrolled in self-funded health plans has increased from about 28 percent in 1986 to about 46 percent in 1993 in medium sized and large private establishments (those with at least 100 employees).", "Growth in self-funding appears to be occurring in small firms as well. In 1992, 32 percent of plan participants covered by private establishments with fewer than 100 employees were in self-funded plans; in 1990, 28 percent of plan participants in such firms were in self-funded plans. Limited evidence shows that even smaller firms\u2014those with fewer than 50 employees\u2014are beginning to self-fund. For example, a trade association representing self-funded plan interests provided examples of employers with as few as 13 employees that chose to self-fund. One third-party administrator we contacted has rapidly expanded its business among small self-funded employers. By 1994, this firm had contracts with more than 2,300 self-funded firms with 50 or fewer employees, including 132 firms with fewer than 10 employees.", "The growth in self-funding in small and large firms reflects employers\u2019 recognition that self-funding employee health benefits offers several advantages. Employers believe that self-funding allows them to directly gain from their cost-containment efforts by having plan design flexibility, control of premium assets, and reduced administrative costs. In addition, employers\u2019 self-funding allows them to avoid potentially costly state regulation, including premium taxes, reserved funding requirements, benefit mandates, any-willing-provider laws, and participation in community-rated or high-risk pools.

With these changes, states are concerned that they cannot provide consumer protections to self-funded health plan participants and that their ability to tax and collect data on health plans is eroding.", "More broadly, states view ERISA preemption as an obstacle to their adopting a wide range of health care reform strategies. Given the improbability of federal reforms to achieve universal coverage in the near future, many state governors and legislators are seeking an active role in expanding the number of individuals covered and in controlling health care costs.

Our analysis of CPS data indicates that the number of individuals under state insurance commission oversight (that is, those with insured health plans offered through employers or purchased individually) declined by nearly 8 million between 1989 and 1993. Much of this decline was attributable to growth in the uninsured population and Medicare and Medicaid enrollment. However, enrollment in self-funded health plans increased by nearly 6 million during this time, also contributing to the decline in the number of insured health plan participants under state oversight. Although little evidence exists to substantiate self-funding\u2019s adverse effect on plan participants, state regulators are concerned that federal fiduciary standards and their enforcement may not provide sufficient consumer protections for these participants.", "State regulators are particularly troubled that firms that they believe cannot adequately absorb the costs of self-funding will nonetheless choose this option. Although only anecdotal evidence exists of the difficulties facing small firms if they self-fund, in part because states do not have access to this information, some regulators contend that firms with fewer than 500 employees should not be completely self-funded. However, the size of firm that can adequately bear risk is subject to debate, especially since small firms can purchase stop-loss coverage to moderate their exposure to large, unexpected losses. In addition, disagreement exists about whether a firm\u2019s size should be the measure of its ability to self-fund rather than its wage structure or financial condition. For example, some believe that even very small firms with relatively large assets can self-fund safely with adequate stop-loss coverage.", "Of more concern to state regulators than small firms\u2019 purchase of traditional stop-loss coverage, however, are new stop-loss insurance products that more closely resemble traditional health insurance products with a high deductible. These products allow small firms to self-fund, avoiding state regulation, while only bearing a small portion of the risk. To address this issue, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is developing a model act that would define minimum stop-loss coverage levels, preventing the sale of products that are merely a subterfuge for traditional health insurance.

They believe that their increased reliance on managed care has been integral to lowering their health care costs. Because the basic tenets of managed care are to limit choice of provider to control utilization and ensure adequate patient volume and provider quality, employers argue that if the law requires managed care plans to accept all providers meeting certain criteria, managed care will lose its ability to control health costs. Although the courts are deciding the scope and extent of any-willing-provider laws, these laws have not been applied to arrangements between self-funded plans and managed care providers.

For these reasons, to the extent that employers support health care reforms, they prefer uniform national standards to varying state standards.", "Employers are concerned that ERISA may be modified to permit states to directly or indirectly tax employer health plans. Employers contend that many states that are experiencing severe financial constraints, in part due to rapidly increasing Medicaid costs, may seek the authority to tax employers who already provide health coverage. Employer groups maintain that they do not necessarily oppose state programs to improve access but believe that states should fund their initiatives through generally applicable taxes clearly within the scope of their authority, even if politically unpopular. This would more fairly distribute the burden of providing health care coverage to the uninsured rather than create an incentive for employers to not offer coverage.", "To illustrate their point, employers point to state taxes, even typical ones like premium taxes of 2 to 3 percent, that may create significant costs as health care costs become an increasing share of total employee compensation. For example, these taxes would cost between $10 million to $15 million if applied to some Fortune 100 firms that spend more than $500 million on their employees\u2019 health coverage. Moreover, employers note that states may more easily increase these taxes if states are not restrained by firms\u2019 ability to easily exit the insured market. Furthermore, the costs that employers incur from state taxation may increase as more states turn to provider taxes as a financing source, especially after the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling upholding states\u2019 ability to impose comprehensive rate-setting schemes that essentially function like provider taxes.", "Employers have also expressed concerns that state solvency standards requiring the establishment of reserves will force them to restrict a portion of their plan assets that could be used for other purposes.

Because ERISA left regulating the insurance industry to the states, however, its impact achieved great significance only as the result of the growth of self-funded health plans.", "The relevant ERISA language has been recognized as among the most complex and confusing in the federal code. It includes three significant clauses: the preemption clause, the saving clause, and the deemer clause. The preemption clause provides that ERISA supersedes any and all state laws that \u201crelate to\u201d any employee benefit plan. The saving clause, consistent with long-standing national policy, provides nonetheless that ERISA will not be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any state law regulating insurance. Therefore, a state insurance law may relate to employee benefit plans but nonetheless not be preempted by ERISA. Finally, the deemer clause narrows the possible scope of the saving clause by providing that no employee benefit plan will be deemed an insurer or in the insurance business for the purpose of any state law purporting to regulate insurance. The result is to restrict the extent to which state insurance regulation can affect, or serve as a pretext for regulating, employee benefit plans.", "As discussed more fully below, the phrase \u201crelate to\u201d has been the source of much legal dispute in part because of the lack of a clear legislative record on congressional intent. Original versions of the legislation passed by the House and the Senate did not include this sweeping preemption language. Instead, both the House and Senate versions had preemption language that would have limited state regulation related only to the specific provisions of the respective bills. The conference report provides little guidance on interpreting the final language. Given the sparse discussion in the conference report, particularly with the evolution of employee benefits plans since ERISA\u2019s passage, courts have played a major role in defining the scope and extent of ERISA preemption.", "Although many states have tried to narrow the scope of ERISA preemption to gain more flexibility in regulating employer health plans, Hawaii is the only state that has received an exemption from ERISA. This exemption, enacted in 1983, has allowed Hawaii to enforce a mandate requiring all employers to provide employees a standard health package and pay for 75 percent of the premium. However, congressional approval of Hawaii\u2019s ERISA exemption was due in part to the fact that Hawaii had enacted comprehensive health care reform concurrently with the original federal passage of ERISA.

Delta Airlines, a unanimous Supreme Court relied on the dictionary meaning of \u201crelate\u201d and ERISA\u2019s legislative history to hold that a law relates to an employee benefit plan \u201cif it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d However, the Court indicated that \u201come state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law \u2019relates to\u2019 the plan.\u201d By way of example, the Court cited a 1979 case upholding garnishment of a spouse\u2019s income to pay child support but expressly refused to indicate where to draw the line between state actions that are preempted and those that are not.", "Two years later, in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, a unanimous Supreme Court identified a crucial distinction under ERISA between the treatment afforded employee benefit plans that are self-funded and those that are insured. At issue in the Metropolitan case was the effect of ERISA on a so-called mandatory benefit law under which Massachusetts required health insurance in the state to include certain minimum coverage for mental illness. Noting the dearth of discussion about the saving clause in the legislative history, the Court observed that the wording of the saving clause did not change during the conference, although its prominence was certainly enhanced when the preemption clause was significantly broadened.", "The Court went on to construe the saving clause broadly to permit states to enforce such laws against insurers even though this would impact the employee benefit plans that they insure. The Court noted that its holding resulted in a distinction between insured and self-funded plans, with the former being indirectly subject to state regulation, such as mandated benefit laws, and the latter escaping such regulation. This distinction provides an incentive for employers, particularly those operating in more than one state, to self-fund because it frees them from state laws that would otherwise affect them.", "Two years later, in Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, a unanimous Supreme Court explained that although the saving clause was to be interpreted broadly, it could not save from preemption state laws that conflict with substantive provisions of ERISA. The effect was that common law tort and contract causes of action seeking damages for improper processing of an employee benefit plan claim are preempted. In Pilot Life, an employee sought to recover damages from the insurer that had, on the behalf of his employer, denied him benefits under an employee welfare benefit plan. The employee based his claims on state law, and the Court held that the civil enforcement provisions of ERISA were the exclusive means for employees to seek such recoveries. Because the state law claims conflicted with ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions, they were not saved from preemption by the saving clause.", "Relying on Pilot Life, ERISA has been held to protect third parties in addition to insurers from tort liability and other state claims when they are performing services on behalf of an employee benefit plan. For example, in Corcoran v. United Healthcare, Inc., a utilization control organization disagreed with a pregnant employee\u2019s attending physician and indicated that, if she remained in the hospital as her physician advised, her health plan would not cover the costs. Although the employee could have remained in the hospital at her expense, she left the hospital to receive nursing care at home, which the utilization control organization indicated would be covered. While the employee was at home when the nurse was not present, the fetus went into distress and died.", "In response, the employee brought a wrongful death action against the utilization control organization. While mindful that its interpretation left a gap in the remedies for protecting plan participants and beneficiaries, the Court held that the case was controlled by Pilot Life, and the wrongful death claim was preempted. The Court noted that fundamental changes in employee benefit plans since ERISA\u2019s passage may indicate a need to reevaluate protections but acknowledged that such a task falls to the Congress and not the courts.", "Most recently, the Supreme Court issued its decision in New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co. This decision did not delineate fully between state actions that are preempted and those that are not but indicated that courts may approve state actions that do not conflict with ERISA\u2019s underlying objectives or impact too greatly on employee benefit plans. The case reached the Supreme Court as a result of a conflict between federal circuits over the extent to which states can impose hospital surcharges on employee benefit plans. The Third Circuit had upheld a New Jersey hospital tax used to compensate hospitals with higher shares of indigent and Medicaid patients; the Second Circuit had rejected New York\u2019s system of imposing hospital surcharges on the basis of whether the care was financed by commercial insurers, HMOs, or Blue Cross & Blue Shield plans as a violation of ERISA. Reversing the Second Circuit in a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court elaborated upon its holding in Shaw that \u201crelate to\u201d means \u201chas a connection with or reference to\u201d and held that New York\u2019s hospital surcharge system was not preempted by ERISA. Because New York\u2019s law was not directed specifically at employee benefit plans, the Court concluded that its hospital rate system had no reference to ERISA. Acknowledging that \u201cconnection with\u201d was no more helpful than \u201crelate to\u201d in defining ERISA preemption, the Court reviewed the legislative history and ERISA objectives. The Court found that its basic thrust was to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans by eliminating conflicting state regulation and reiterated that state laws mandating benefits or otherwise directly regulating the content or administration of plans are preempted. However, the Court distinguished New York\u2019s system from these preempted state laws because the New York law\u2019s purpose was to assist Blue Cross & Blue Shield rather than to regulate the content or administration of employee benefit plans. While conceding that economic impacts alone could in some cases sufficiently trigger ERISA preemption, the Court held that New York\u2019s hospital surcharges had only an indirect economic influence on employee benefit plans and therefore was not preempted.", "In the wake of the Court\u2019s ruling in Travelers, states are likely to perceive that they have more options and greater flexibility than previously recognized. The case suggests that state laws affecting employee benefit plans will have to be judged individually on each instance\u2019s facts and circumstances.

Their promoters often represent to employers and state regulators that MEWAs are employee benefit plans covered by ERISA and as such are exempt from state insurance regulation under ERISA\u2019s preemption provision.", "By avoiding state insurance reserve, contribution, and other requirements applicable to insurance companies, MEWAs can often market insurance coverage at substantially lower rates. This makes MEWAs an attractive alternative for small businesses that find it difficult to get affordable employee health care coverage. In practice, some MEWAs have been unable to pay claims due to insufficient funding and inadequate reserves, or, in the worst situations, they were operated by people who drained a MEWA\u2019s assets through excessive fees and embezzlement.

Further, over 600 MEWAs failed to comply with state insurance laws, and some violated criminal statutes.", "Recognizing that it was both appropriate and necessary for states to establish, apply, and enforce state insurance laws concerning MEWAs, the Congress amended ERISA in 1983 to provide an exemption to ERISA\u2019s broad preemption provision for regulating MEWAs under state insurance laws. Since the late 1980s, Labor has acted to alleviate MEWA problems. In May 1990, the Secretary of Labor announced a program to improve MEWA enforcement efforts.

Mathematica excluded firms with 100 or fewer employees because the data were too incomplete.", "A 1994 survey in 10 states conducted by Rand, Inc., for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Department of Labor found results very similar to the BLS survey we used. In the 10 states it surveyed, Rand found that 41 percent of participants were enrolled in self-funded health plans. Like the BLS survey, these results included health plans of all sizes, including those with fewer than 100 employees. However, it is limited to the states included in the survey. The National Center for Health Statistics is currently using a similar survey nationwide; the results of its employer benefit survey are expected in fall 1995.", "Finally, several private employer benefits consulting firms have estimated the proportion of health plans offered by employers of different size categories that are self-funded. In 1993, Foster Higgins reported that, among employers with more than 500 employees, 64 percent of indemnity plans were self-funded and 62 percent of preferred provider organization (PPO) plans were self-funded. For employers with fewer than 500 employees, only 17 percent of indemnity plans were self-funded and 4 percent of PPO plans were self-funded. Similarly, KPMG Peat Marwick\u2019s 1994 survey of employers with at least 200 employees found that 62 percent of conventional (indemnity) plans were self-funded, 63 percent of PPOs were self-funded, and 58 percent of point-of-service plans were self-funded. Peat Marwick did not survey firms with fewer than 200 employees. In both cases, these surveys only reported the percentage of plans that are self-funded, not the percentage of individuals enrolled in self-funded health plans.", "Because the BLS survey is the only one of these sources that reports national percentages of participants in self-funded health plans in firms of all sizes, we used this source in our final estimates of the number of Americans enrolled in self-funded health plans.

Using the same approach, we estimate that approximately 39 million participants were enrolled in self-funded ERISA health plans in 1989.", "Because of uncertainties in the number of enrollees in employer health plans sponsored by governments or churches, we tested the sensitivity or our estimate using a lower number of participants in ERISA health plans. By estimating that 106 million individuals participated in ERISA health plans (rather than 114 million), we calculated approximately 41 million enrollees in self-funded ERISA health plans in 1993 rather than 44 million enrollees.

Most insurers and HMOs will pass on the costs of these taxes to their customers through higher premiums. However, their ability to do so, as well as the overall impact on an employer, depends on factors such as the competitiveness of the market, size of the employer, and insurer\u2019s marketing strategy.", "As shown in table IV.1, premium taxes on commercial health insurers range from less than 1 percent to over 4 percent, with most states having premium tax rates of about 2 or 3 percent.

For instance, all states maintain guaranty funds to pay outstanding claims in cases of an insurer\u2019s failure. Every state except New York retroactively assesses insurers to finance these guaranty funds. That is, in years that moneys are drawn from the guaranty funds because of an insurance failure, insurers are assessed a fee on the basis of their market share within the state to pay for the guaranty fund expenses. States cap the maximum rate insurers may be assessed in a year, typically at about 2 percent of gross premiums. However, except in a few states where a large insurer failed, actual assessments are much lower than the maximum rate. For example, in 1990, actual assessments against life and health insurers for guaranty funds averaged about 0.15 percent. That year, 20 states (including Puerto Rico) either made no assessments or made refunds for surpluses in life and health insurance guaranty funds; guaranty fund assessments exceeded 1 percent of premiums in only three states.", "Another significant cost for health plans in some states results from taxes assessed on providers, such as hospitals. A 1994 survey by the American Public Welfare Association found that about half of the states have adopted provider revenue taxes. Many states have tax rates ranging from 1 to 7 percent, although New York imposes a 13-percent tax on hospital services paid by commercial insurers. In many states, these funds are popular because they can be used to receive federal matching funds for Medicaid. In other states, such as Massachusetts, these taxes are redistributed to hospitals to reimburse for uncompensated care costs. Finally, New York has used these taxes for hospital rate-setting programs and to provide a competitive advantage to Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield because the insurer has maintained a policy of open enrollment and has thereby insured higher risk and costly individuals.", "Even though these taxes are imposed on providers rather than directly on health plans, they have an indirect effect on health plan costs. Hospital services provided to enrollees in self-funded health plans as well as those provided to fully insured health plan enrollees have been taxed. Because of this indirect effect on health plans, several states, including New York and New Jersey, have had their provider taxes challenged under ERISA. However, the Supreme Court ruled in the Travelers case that the New York system of hospital surcharges, which is essentially a provider tax, has too indirect an effect on health plans to be preempted by ERISA. Thus, pending further litigation, states appear to have the ability to impose general provider taxes without violating ERISA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State-Mandated Benefits", "paragraphs": ["State governments require, or mandate, that companies selling health insurance cover specified health services or the services provided by specified providers.

Treatment mandates require insurance companies to cover treatment for specific conditions, such as alcoholism and mental health problems, or for specific procedures, such as in vitro fertilization services. Provider mandates require payment for covered services from specific types of providers, such as chiropractors, psychologists, or optometrists. Special-population mandates require insurance coverage for defined groups, such as newborns, adopted children, or handicapped dependents.", "Mandated benefits are often debated, the debate usually centering on the value of mandated benefits relative to their cost. Proponents of mandates, including many consumer groups and health care providers, argue that they may (1) provide equal access to necessary services; (2) pay for themselves in the long run, especially preventive care services; (3) make certain benefits available to those who are likely to become uninsured or uninsurable; and (4) prevent some insurers from experiencing substantial adverse selection, that is, attracting individuals who have costly health conditions or are more likely to incur high health costs. Opponents, including many business groups and insurers, argue that mandates may (1) raise total health care costs and thus premiums, (2) cause employers to self-fund or discontinue their health plans, (3) interfere in the voluntary contract between insurers and employers, (4) result from political pressure from special interest groups and providers, and (5) create administrative burdens for insurers or employers operating in many states."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Usually Mandate Benefits for Select Types of Coverage", "paragraphs": ["The number and type of benefits mandates vary by state.

In addition, states often require coverage for more common alternative providers like chiropractors and optometrists and for special populations like newborns and the handicapped. A small number of states requires coverage for more specific conditions or treatments, such as congenital defects like cleft palate or hair loss due to specific medical conditions or treatment.

Also, a mandate\u2019s cost effect on an employer can vary sharply depending on the demographics and health needs of the employee population.
