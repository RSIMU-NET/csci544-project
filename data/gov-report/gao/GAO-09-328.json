In March 2006, GAO reported that OMB's approach did not fully integrate certain fundamental system implementation-related concepts and recommended OMB take specific actions. This report discusses (1) OMB's progress in addressing GAO's prior FMLOB recommendations and implementation challenges and (2) the effectiveness of OMB's monitoring of financial management system modernization projects and their costs.

In March 2006, GAO recommended that OMB place a high priority on fully integrating four key concepts into its approach. As shown in the table, OMB has completed actions to fully address 5 of GAO's 18 recommendations. Although OMB has made progress toward completing the remaining 13 recommendations, extensive work remains before the goals of the FMLOB initiative are achieved. For example, OMB has yet to finalize a financial management system concept of operations, the first and foremost critical building block on which the remaining three concepts will be built. In addition, development of a migration timeline reflecting agencies' commitment for migrating to shared service providers has not yet been completed. Further, agencies are not required to consider migrating until the next major release of their core financial system and much work remains before the software used by shared service providers will incorporate the standard business processes currently under development. Accordingly, FSIO officials stated it could take 15 years or more before software that incorporates these standard business processes is in use governmentwide. We recognize that the FMLOB initiative represents a long-term effort; however, expediting efforts to address our prior recommendations could help achieve more effective and timely benefits. Until OMB fully integrates the four key concepts into its approach, the extent to which FMLOB goals will be achieved is uncertain. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and other information technology (IT) reform legislation contain requirements related to OMB's oversight of agency financial management systems modernization and other IT projects. Achieving FMLOB goals requires effective OMB oversight of agency modernization projects, but OMB has yet to fully address GAO's previously reported oversight-related recommendations such as taking actions to define and ensure that agencies effectively implement disciplined processes and develop a more structured review of agency efforts. In addition, OMB does not obtain and report complete and accurate data concerning agencies' spending on financial management system modernization projects. The lack of sufficient information and processes to effectively monitor agency modernization efforts and their costs limits OMB's ability to evaluate and help reduce the risks associated with financial management system implementations as well as achieve FMLOB goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government\u2019s ability to efficiently and effectively manage and  oversee its day-to-day operations and programs relies heavily on the ability  of agency financial management systems to produce complete, reliable,  timely, and consistent financial information for use by executive branch  agencies and Congress. Agencies continue to spend billions of dollars on  maintaining, developing, and implementing financial management systems  throughout the federal government. Although modernization of these  systems is expensive, these efforts represent a critical element in  facilitating agencies\u2019 ability to institute strong financial management as  called for by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, Federal  Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA), and other  financial management reform legislation.", "Over a number of years, we have reported that modernizing federal  financial management systems has been a challenge at many federal  agencies due, in part, to the past practices of each federal agency  attempting to implement its own systems which have all too often resulted  in failure, have been delayed, and cost too much. Recognizing the  seriousness of this problem, in March 2004, the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) launched the financial management line of business  (FMLOB) initiative, in part, to improve the outcome of governmentwide  financial management system modernization efforts and provide timely  and accurate data for decision making through the use of more cost- effective shared service solutions. Under this approach, agencies are to  consider the use of certain shared service providers for meeting common  support services, such as information technology (IT) hosting and  application management, rather than investing in costly and redundant  agency-specific solutions.", "In March 2006, we made 18 recommendations to help reduce the risks  associated with financial management system implementation efforts and  facilitate the implementation of the FMLOB initiative across the  government. Specifically, we recommended that OMB place a high  priority on fully integrating into its approach four key concepts:   (1) developing a concept of operations that articulates the  interrelationships among financial management systems and how the  shared service provider concept fits into the overall federal financial  management framework, (2) defining standard business processes to  promote consistency within and across agencies, (3) developing a strategy  for ensuring that agencies\u2019 financial management systems are migrated to  a limited number of service providers, and (4) defining and effectively  implementing applicable disciplined processes necessary to properly  manage financial management system implementation projects.", "Because of your continuing interest in transforming the federal  government\u2019s financial management systems and the broad-reaching  impact of the FMLOB initiative, you asked us to study a range of issues  related to the FMLOB initiative as well as efforts at shared service  providers and agencies involved in migrating to those providers. As agreed  to with your office, this report provides the results of the first phase of our  work, including our efforts to determine (1) OMB\u2019s progress toward  addressing our prior recommendations related to the FMLOB initiative and  other challenges that impede its implementation and (2) the effectiveness  of OMB\u2019s monitoring of FMLOB and financial management system  modernization projects, including their costs.

In addition, we  conducted interviews with key OMB and FSIO officials as well as officials  with other selected organizations knowledgeable about large financial  management transformation initiatives to obtain views on FMLOB efforts  and related challenges. We also interviewed knowledgeable officials of  two agencies from among those agencies spending the most on financial  management modernization projects to obtain information on agency  reporting of such costs.

Recognizing the need for a more  holistic approach to address the seriousness of these problems, OMB  launched the FMLOB initiative in March 2004, in connection with the 2001  President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA).", "In part, the FMLOB initiative is intended to reduce the cost and upgrade  the quality and performance of federal financial management systems by  leveraging shared service solutions and implementing other  governmentwide reforms that foster efficiencies in federal financial  operations. According to OMB, the goals of the FMLOB initiative are to   (1) provide timely and accurate data for decision making; (2) facilitate  stronger internal controls that ensure integrity in accounting and other  stewardship activities; (3) reduce costs by providing a competitive  alternative for agencies to acquire, develop, implement, and operate  financial management systems through shared service solutions;   (4) standardize systems, business processes, and data elements; and   (5) provide for seamless data exchange between and among federal  agencies by implementing a common language and structure for financial  information and system interfaces.", "In connection with this initiative, OMB developed an approach for  agencies to migrate financial management systems to a limited number of  application service providers, such as OMB-designated shared service  providers or private sector entities, which is intended to avoid costly and  redundant agency investments in \u201cin-house\u201d financial management  systems. These providers are third-party entities that manage and  distribute software-based services and solutions to customers across a  wide area network from a central data center. This concept has commonly  been used in the private sector and in other foreign governments where  application service providers provide services such as payroll, sales force  automation, and human resource applications to many clients. OMB is the  executive sponsor for the FMLOB initiative and in conjunction with FSIO,  provides oversight and guidance for the initiative. In addition to serving as  the program manager for the FMLOB initiative, FSIO is responsible for  core financial systems requirements development, testing and product  certification, supporting the federal financial management community on  priority projects, and other activities.", "Although the FMLOB initiative was launched in 2004, modernizing federal  financial management systems so they can produce reliable, useful, and  timely financial data needed to efficiently and effectively manage the day- to-day operations of the federal government has been a high priority for  Congress for many years. In recognition of this need, and in an effort to  improve overall federal financial management, Congress passed a series of  financial management reform legislation dating back to the early 1980s.  Some of the notable legislation included in this series are the (1) Federal  Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), (2) CFO Act of 1990,  (3) Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, (4) Government  Management Reform Act of 1994, (5) FFMIA, (6) Clinger-Cohen Act of  1996, and (7) Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002. FFMIA, in  particular, requires the departments and agencies covered by the CFO Act  to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply  substantially with (1) federal financial management systems requirements,  (2) applicable federal accounting standards, and (3) the U.S. Government  Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. In addition to the  specific requirements related to financial management systems contained  in FFMIA, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires the head of each  executive agency to establish policies and procedures to ensure that,  among other things, the agency\u2019s financial systems are designed,  developed, maintained, and used effectively to provide financial or  program performance data.", "OMB plays a central role in governmentwide efforts to meet the  requirements included in these reforms including the establishment of  federal financial management policy and guidance, as well as overseeing  the implementation and management of federal financial management  systems and other IT investments. Specifically, the CFO Act of 1990  established OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) to  carry out various financial management functions, including (1) providing  overall direction and leadership to the executive branch on financial  management matters by establishing financial management policies and  requirements, and by monitoring the establishment and operation of  federal government financial management systems; (2) reviewing agency  budget requests for financial management systems and operations; and   (3) monitoring the financial execution of the budget in relation to actual  expenditures, including timely performance reports.", "The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 expanded OMB responsibilities further to  include establishing processes to analyze, track, and evaluate the risks and  results of major capital investments in information systems made by  executive agencies. In addition, in implementing the E-Government Act of  2002 OMB\u2019s Office of Electronic Government and Information  Technology is responsible for, among other matters, providing overall  leadership and direction to the executive branch on electronic  government; overseeing the development of enterprise architectures  within and across agencies; and overseeing implementation of IT  throughout the federal government, including monitoring and consulting  on agency technology efforts, as well as identifying opportunities for joint  agency and governmentwide IT projects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OMB\u2019s IT Investment Oversight Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In connection with these responsibilities, OMB reviews and evaluates IT  spending and other information submitted by the agencies during the  budget formulation process. Specifically, in accordance with OMB  Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission and Execution of the Budget,  agencies are required to provide information related to their IT investment  projects. As part of this process, agencies submit Capital Asset Plans and  Business Cases (exhibit 300s) and Agency IT Investment Portfolios  (exhibit 53s) that provide information useful for evaluating agency  financial management system projects. Agency exhibit 300s are intended  to describe the business case for each investment and serve as the primary  means of justifying IT investment proposals as well as monitoring IT  investments once they are funded. Further, as a reporting tool, exhibit  300s are intended to help demonstrate to agencies\u2019 management, as well as  to OMB, that major projects have strong business cases for the investment  and meet other administration priorities in defining the proposed cost,  schedule, and performance goals.", "Similarly, information included on agency exhibit 53s is designed, in part,  to help OMB better understand the amounts agencies are spending on IT  investments as well as provide information in support of cost analyses  prescribed by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. For example, agencies are  required to classify investment projects into one of six categories as well  as specify how much of these amounts are for development and  modernization of IT versus operating and maintaining the status quo for  IT. In addition, agencies are required to report amounts being spent on  each investment over a 3-year period including the current and prior fiscal  years as well as the amount included in the agencies\u2019 budget request for  the next fiscal year.

These projects are not necessarily at risk of  failure, but may be on the list because they meet criteria specified by  OMB for inclusion. Further, agency Chief Information Officers (CIO) are to  assess, confirm, and document each of these projects\u2019 performance based  on whether the project was meeting one or more of four performance  evaluation criteria and identify those with performance shortfalls.

Table 1 summarizes the status of efforts to address  our prior recommendations in each of these four areas. Additional  information on the progress and remaining actions we believe are needed  to address each recommendation can be found in appendix II. For  example, OMB and FSIO have developed guidance to assist agencies\u2019  efforts in selecting shared service providers and preparing for migration,  and have taken steps to encourage agencies to embrace standard business  processes that will help provide consistency as they are adopted across  federal agencies.", "While guidance and communication-related efforts are important, OMB  and FSIO efforts have not yet fully integrated any of the four key building  blocks into the FMLOB implementation approach. Further, the  recommendations not yet completed, in particular, involve critical  elements integral to success and will require much more extensive work  before the promised benefits of the FMLOB initiative can be fully realized.  OMB has not completed development of a concept of operations  representing the first and foremost building block on which all system  planning processes as well as the remaining building blocks are built. This  critical tool is essential for providing an overall road map for FMLOB  efforts by describing the interrelationships among financial management  systems and how information is to flow from and through them, within  and across agencies, and ensuring the validity of each agency\u2019s  implementation approach. Even if FMLOB-related activities proceed as  planned, efforts to address our recommendations related to this and other  key concepts involve a variety of challenges which, in some cases, could  take years to fully resolve. For example, according to FSIO officials, it may  take as many as 15 years or more before software that incorporates the  standard business processes currently under development is in use  governmentwide. In addition, development of a migration timeline  reflecting agencies\u2019 commitment to migrating to shared service providers  has not yet been completed. OMB officials stated that a draft migration  timeline as well as a draft concept of operations have been developed and  are under internal review. Until OMB finalizes these critical tools, the  extent to which its efforts to date address our recommendations remains  unclear.", "As previously reported, we believe OMB has correctly recognized that  enhancing federal financial management systems needs to be addressed as  a governmentwide solution, rather than individual agency stovepiped  efforts designed to meet a given entity\u2019s needs. However, given the  implications of this initiative and the extended time frames involved, we  emphasize the need to expedite efforts to address our remaining  recommendations. Such efforts are essential to help facilitate FMLOB  implementation and achieve a more effective and timely realization of  benefits.

Although this initiative began in 2004, and we reported  that efforts were under way to develop a concept of operations in our 2006  report, as shown in table 2, none of our four prior recommendations  related to this area have been completely addressed. Further, developing a  concept of operations was not included as a priority in OMB\u2019s January  2008 memorandum to agency CFOs that summarized FMLOB priorities  through December 2009. OMB officials stated that a draft concept of  operations is in internal review; however, they did not provide us an  estimated date for its completion. OMB officials stated that finalizing a  concept of operations has been a challenge due to limited resources  available to devote to this effort, as well as the need to ensure that the  various elements of a concept of operations are appropriately linked to  relevant guidance, policy documents, and requirements such as the core  financial system requirements. We agree with OMB\u2019s recognition of this  need and believe it helps to illustrate the importance of finalizing this  critical tool. Given the importance of articulating how the shared service  provider concept fits into the overall federal financial management system  framework and how systems operated at the agency and governmentwide  level should be integrated, we believe efforts should be taken to expedite  the completion of a clear concept of operations.", "OMB and FSIO officials, as well as knowledgeable officials from other  selected organizations, and our recent work related to financial  management system implementations, confirm the need for an effective  governmentwide concept of operations to guide FMLOB efforts. For  example, identifying the interrelationships among financial management  systems within and across agencies would help to identify and avoid  additional stovepiped efforts designed to meet their unique needs when  common solutions to address their common needs are more effective. A  clear understanding of the flow of information from and through these  systems is also needed to ensure that the FMLOB initiative goal of  providing accurate and timely data for decision making is achieved.", "The federal government is one of the largest and most complex  organizations in the world and its agencies use a variety of financial  management systems and other systems that interrelate with them to meet  their needs. As a result, defining the nature and scope of the systems  involved in transformation initiatives, such as FMLOB, is an important  aspect for ensuring that efforts are properly aligned and focused toward  meeting clearly articulated goals. Officials at the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) Business Transformation Agency considered this a critical element  of the lessons they learned in achieving progress toward developing a  framework for DOD efforts to transform a multitude of business systems  to better meet its financial management needs. We concur with this  assessment and, as we testified in February 2008, we believe DOD is  making progress toward establishing a framework to guide its business  transformation efforts.", "While we are in broad agreement with the goals of OMB\u2019s FMLOB  initiative, it appears that OMB is not looking broadly enough as it frames  its efforts. According to OMB and FSIO officials, FMLOB-related efforts  are initially focused on addressing agency core financial systems needs  and therefore may not currently fully address the existing  interrelationships between core financial systems and the financial portion  of mixed systems. Recent revisions to OMB\u2019s Circular No. A-127 issued in  January 2009 confirm our concerns that the importance of these  interrelationships is not adequately incorporated into OMB\u2019s approach.  Specifically, OMB\u2019s revised guidance states that federal financial  management system requirements for determining substantial compliance  with FFMIA include computer security requirements and internal controls  as well as FSIO core financial system requirements but explicitly do not  include the existing financial management systems requirements related to  mixed systems.", "Due to the magnitude of efforts and challenges associated with  modernizing financial management systems across government,  knowledgeable officials at other selected organizations we spoke with  stated that focusing on addressing agency core financial system needs first  may be appropriate. Nonetheless, an essential part of developing an  effective, comprehensive concept of operations includes identifying the  interrelationships between core financial systems and other systems, such  as payroll or inventory systems, which perform financial functions. In  addition, agencies are increasingly considering the use of large, complex,  and costly enterprise resource planning (ERP) programs to provide an  integrated solution for addressing both financial and mission-related  business needs. DOD, in particular, has been making significant  investments in a number of ERPs to take advantage of the enterprisewide  features that address various financial management and other business  needs. We have reported that, as envisioned, DOD\u2019s Navy ERP program is  expected to cost approximately $2.4 billion over its 20-year life cycle and  to be fully operational in fiscal year 2013. As we previously reported, a  concept of operations should have a clear definition and scope of the  financial management activities to be included and identify the  interrelationships of core financial and other systems such as ERPs.", "The ability to properly align governmentwide and agency efforts also  depends, in part, upon the availability of effective concepts of operations  at the governmentwide level as well as the agency level. We have  reported the lack of adequate concepts of operations associated with  agency financial management system projects, including selected projects  at the Army, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the  Department of the Treasury. For example, in connection with the Army\u2019s  efforts to achieve total asset visibility, we reported that, without a  concept of operations, the Army is hindered in its ability to apply an  enterprise view in (1) making decisions as to how certain systems will  individually and collectively enhance the Army\u2019s asset accountability and  (2) determining what changes are needed in its related business processes.  As a result, we also reported that the Army failed to take advantage of  business process reengineering opportunities, perpetuating the use of  some of its cumbersome and ineffective business processes used in  existing legacy systems.", "Finally, participants at a Comptroller General\u2019s forum held in December  2007 on improving federal financial management systems confirmed our  concerns regarding the need for a concept of operations, pointing out that  OMB\u2019s various lines of business initiatives are serving to preserve  existing stovepipes. For example, participants said it is unclear why  separate lines of business are needed for budget and financial  management. OMB officials stated that FSIO has been working with OMB  staff knowledgeable of the federal enterprise architecture (FEA) to  better understand and document the relationships between mixed and core financial systems as well as communicate with the various line business initiatives and help ensure they are effectively coordinated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB\u2019s Current Priorities Focus on Standardization and Transparency", "paragraphs": ["Adopting standardized processes is a fundamental step needed for all  financial management system implementations. Recognizing the  importance of this step in connection with implementing the FMLOB  initiative, we made five recommendations, as shown in table 3, related to  identifying, defining, and implementing standard business processes to  help facilitate greater efficiency and consistency, lower the cost, and  improve the quality and performance of financial management operations  across government. OMB and FSIO efforts have effectively addressed two  of our five recommendations by encouraging agencies to embrace, and  requiring shared service providers to adopt, standard business processes  in support of the FMLOB initiative. For example, in a July 2008  memorandum, OMB encouraged the federal financial management  community to begin preparations for adopting standard business  processes by taking several actions, including using such processes as a  framework for system implementation projects.", "Much work remains before the standard business processes needed to  realize the goal of optimizing financial management practices across  government become operational. According to FSIO officials, the process  of developing the first set of standard business processes and  incorporating them into software products certified as meeting FSIO core  financial system requirements may take up to 3 years to complete under  existing plans. We also recognize that incorporating standard business  processes into operational systems will be a much longer-term effort since  OMB is not requiring agencies to consider migrating to a shared service  provider until upgrading to the next major release of their core financial  systems, and adoption of these standards is not required until migration  occurs. Accordingly, FSIO officials stated it may take up to 15 years to  incorporate the standards currently under development into software,  subsequently test and certify the software, and implement the certified  software governmentwide. According to OMB officials, this approach  reflects OMB\u2019s recognition of the long-term nature of agency  modernization efforts and the need to provide agencies time to adequately  assess FMLOB migration risks.", "Due to the wide array of current business processes in use across agencies  to address common and agency-specific needs, OMB and FSIO officials  acknowledge that developing standard business processes that can be  used across all federal agencies is a significant challenge. Thus far, their  efforts to increase standardization have resulted in the development and  issuance of three standard business processes, and OMB expects two  more to be finalized by September 2009. In a January 2008 memorandum  to agency CFOs, OMB acknowledged that efforts during the transparency  and standardization stage of the FMLOB initiative have taken longer than  expected. However, OMB added that the additional time has allowed for  the preparation of more comprehensive material and greater buy-in and  support for the initiative. Nonetheless, expediting efforts to address our  prior recommendations related to standard business processes is essential  since the ability to operationalize these standards, and begin realizing their  benefits, depends on their completion.", "The extended time frame for implementing the FMLOB initiative involves  other challenges, such as responding to changes in stakeholder needs or  new financial reporting requirements. For example, FSIO officials stated  that financial management systems currently used to compile and report  financial information on a governmentwide level will face unique  transition-related challenges as agencies begin to use systems that  incorporate the recently developed common governmentwide accounting  classification structure and FMLOB-compliant standard business  processes. Specifically, modernization efforts under way at Treasury will  need to ensure that certain centralized systems will receive, process,  report, and transmit financial data to and from these agencies\u2019 systems. In  addition, these centralized Treasury systems will need to continue to  interface with and convert information received from agency legacy  systems to ensure the overall consistency of consolidated information  used for government financial reporting and other purposes. To ensure  that these issues are properly identified and managed during the transition  period, FSIO officials stated that they are working with Treasury data  architects to facilitate the data standardization effort and develop a joint  plan that includes Treasury system update milestones. However, these  challenges and the risks associated with agency legacy systems that  produce financial management information using inconsistent business  processes will continue until the standardization envisioned by the  FMLOB initiative is actually implemented across the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Migration Strategy Developed, but Timetable for Migration Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the historical tendency for agencies to view their needs as  unique and resist standardization, we made five recommendations, as  shown in table 4, related to developing a strategy for ensuring that  agencies are migrated to a limited number of shared service providers.

In  addition, OMB has taken steps toward addressing the remaining three  recommendations in this area related to developing a migration strategy,  articulating a clear goal and criteria for ensuring that agencies are  migrated, and developing a timeline, or migration path, for when agencies  should migrate to a shared service provider. However, efforts to develop  such a timeline are taking longer than expected and this important tool  has not yet been finalized. Until a reliable, detailed timetable for  migrations across the federal government is developed, the ability to  assess when governmentwide migrations will be completed remains  limited.", "As previously noted, we plan to address key issues related to OMB\u2019s  migration strategy in the second phase of our work and therefore are  deferring an assessment of OMB\u2019s efforts in this area. Specifically, we plan  to review the implementation of OMB\u2019s strategy at shared service  providers and agencies involved in migration activities during the next  phase of our work. OMB\u2019s Competition Framework for FMLOB  Migrations (Competition Framework) and Migration Planning  Guidance, provided important guidance to agencies to support and  facilitate shared service provider migration activities. This guidance  includes principles agencies must use when acquiring new financial  management systems and best practices for managing organizational  changes and developing effective change management strategies to ensure  that migrations achieve intended results. Agencies are required to comply  with OMB\u2019s stated migration strategy and OMB relies, in part, on  information agencies provide with their budget submissions to ensure they  are planning their migration activities accordingly. In addition, OMB  officials stated that they hold meetings with agencies to discuss this and  other information regarding FMLOB-related activities such as the life cycle  of existing agency financial management systems, IT investment plans,  and ongoing migration activities.", "While we plan to perform an in-depth analysis of OMB\u2019s strategy as part of  our follow-on work, we found that additional efforts are needed to develop  a timeline for agency migrations, as well as efforts to continue refining and  developing additional tools to facilitate the effectiveness of agency efforts.  A migration timeline reflecting agencies\u2019 IT investment plans that are  aligned with existing financial management system life cycles and their  commitment toward migrating their financial management systems to  shared service providers would help to ensure that agencies do not  continue developing and implementing their own stovepiped systems.  Such a timeline would provide greater assurance that the migrations will  actually occur as planned and help guide and assess governmentwide  progress. OMB officials told us they are working with agencies to develop  an overall migration timeline and expected to have it in place by the end of  2008. However, this important tool has not yet been finalized and OMB  could not provide an estimated completion date. As a result, the reliability  of targets reported by OMB for migrating agencies, including its February  2008 estimate that many migrations are expected through 2015, is  unclear. In addition to a migration timeline, FSIO and OMB officials  acknowledged that agencies need additional migration guidance and tools  in more specific areas that will further improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of agency migration activities\u2014such as tools for navigating  the acquisition process for shared financial services, providing templates  for developing agency service-level agreements, and providing agencies  with change management support and training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Actions Needed in Defining and Implementing Disciplined Processes", "paragraphs": ["To help reduce the risks associated with financial management system  implementations, we highlighted the importance of incorporating  disciplined processes into implementation efforts and made four  recommendations, as shown in table 5, to ensure that they are more  effectively used to properly manage and oversee specific projects.

Additional efforts are needed to fully address the remaining three  recommendations in this area.", "OMB officials expressed the belief that existing guidance provides  sufficient descriptions and requirements to agencies involved in federal IT  capital investment projects and system implementations regarding the use  of disciplined processes. Further, they stated that additional guidance is  not needed since agencies will be migrating to an established shared  service provider with a proven track record and would therefore  incorporate the disciplined processes used by the provider, which would  reduce or eliminate the traditional project management tasks associated  with system implementations. Although the use of such providers may  help reduce risks related to core financial system migrations, this position  does not address the need for more effective guidance to clearly  communicate the extent to which agencies are required to ensure that  disciplined processes are incorporated into all financial management  system implementations. Our review of OMB guidance indicates that its  existing guidance does not adequately define specific disciplined  processes nor adequately specify agency requirements concerning their  use in connection with financial management system implementations.  For example, our analysis of OMB guidance related to requirements  management, risk management, data conversion, and testing activities that  agencies should follow during system implementations shows that the  guidance describes the purpose and high-level descriptions of these  activities, but does not adequately describe and provide sufficient  guidance regarding the methods agencies could use to incorporate certain  critical disciplined processes into their implementation efforts.", "For example, sound requirements management processes, in part, should  ensure that requirements are stated in clear terms that allow for  quantitative evaluation and traceability among various requirements  documents. With regard to traceability, OMB guidance states that \u201ca  complete set of requirements that maintain traceability throughout the  Design, Development and Testing phases will contribute to the system\u2019s  success.\u201d However, this and other OMB guidance does not provide  detailed guidance on how agencies are to ensure traceability is to be  attained (e.g., through the use of a requirements traceability matrix) nor  does it include specific guidance requiring test plans to include links to the  specific requirements they address.", "For data conversions, OMB guidance does not address the need to  consider specific issues that apply uniquely to converting data as part of  the replacement of a financial system, such as identifying specific open  transactions and balances to be established through automated or manual  processes, as well as using different conversion options for different  categories of data. Data conversion issues can also result in problems  beyond financial reporting such as those we previously reported in June  2005 in connection with the Army\u2019s implementation of its Logistics  Modernization Program (LMP) involving excess items being ordered and  shipped to one of its depots. Specifically, we noted that three truckloads  of locking washers (for bolts) were mistakenly ordered and received, and  subsequently returned, because of data conversion problems.", "Further, the guidance does not specifically address or require agencies to  incorporate characteristics typically found in successful disciplined testing  efforts, such as processes that ensure test results are thoroughly inspected  and test cases that include exposing the system to invalid and unexpected  conditions. Without specific guidance on the use of these and other  disciplined processes during financial management system  implementations, agency projects may not achieve their intended results  within established resources (costs) and on schedule.", "In addition to guidance, officials at OMB, FSIO, and other organizations  cited challenges associated with the lack of appropriate resources to  ensure disciplined processes are implemented in connection with financial  management system projects. For example, officials at FSIO and DOD\u2019s  Business Transformation Agency told us that agencies do not always  maintain or involve internal staff with appropriate system implementation  and business process expertise needed to ensure successful  implementations. Further, according to OMB officials, OMB\u2019s ability to  perform detailed implementation oversight reviews on all financial  management system projects continues to be hampered due to the limited  staff available to perform them. Although we recognize this challenge, we  continue to believe that proper oversight should entail verification that  disciplined processes are, in fact, incorporated into these projects in order  to maximize their likelihood of success.", "As we previously reported, requiring agencies to have their financial  management system projects undergo independent verification and  validation reviews could provide an alternative means for ensuring  agencies are incorporating disciplined processes into these projects.  According to OMB officials, they do not need to require agencies to use  independent verification and validation as a tool because most large  agencies are already using independent verification and validation  contractors to monitor large system implementations. In addition, OMB  officials said they do not believe it would be appropriate to require all  system implementations to use independent verification and validation  contractors since they may not be cost-justified on smaller, less complex  projects. OMB officials stated that they rely, in part, on activities OMB  performs in connection with assessing projects for inclusion on its  Management Watch List and High Risk List to identify projects having  implementation risks needing further attention.", "As described in more detail in the next section of this report, while  Management Watch List and High Risk List related activities are designed  to identify planning and performance deficiencies and provide useful  information to assist OMB in monitoring IT modernization projects, they  do not provide for an adequate assessment of the extent to which agencies  are incorporating disciplined processes to better manage financial  management system modernization projects. Further, we continue to  believe that verifying that projects adequately incorporate disciplined  processes, whether performed by an independent verification and  validation contractor or otherwise, is an essential aspect of effectively  overseeing financial management system implementation projects to  ensure the risks associated with these projects are managed to acceptable  levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Challenges and Risks Highlight Importance of Continued Strong Commitment", "paragraphs": ["FMLOB implementation efforts are affected by other broad and  crosscutting issues related to the overall federal financial management  environment such as ensuring the availability of sufficient resources and  federal financial management human capital strategies, and addressing the  myriad of weaknesses in existing systems across federal agencies.

In this respect, our work at Treasury, DOD, DHS, and other  agencies has confirmed that problems associated with strategic workforce  planning, human resources, and change management have hampered  financial management operations and system implementations and help to  illustrate that the federal financial management workforce supporting the  business needs of today is not well positioned to meet the needs of  tomorrow. Participants at a Comptroller General\u2019s forum suggested that  federal financial management human capital strategies could be better  focused on attracting and retaining a new technology-savvy generation of  financial professionals. However, FSIO officials noted that they believe the  FMLOB-related efforts to standardize business processes, operate  financial management systems through shared service solutions, and  provide training materials and change management support will help  mitigate the growing shortage of federal financial management human  capital. As we previously reported, effective human capital management  is critical to the success of systems implementations and the extent to  which these and other efforts will lead to having staff with the appropriate  skills is key to achieving financial management improvements.", "In addition, in connection with our efforts to report annually on the  implementation status of FFMIA, we continue to report that assessments  for the 24 CFO Act agencies illustrate that agencies still do not have  effective financial management systems, including processes, procedures,  and controls in place that can routinely produce reliable, useful, and  timely financial information that federal managers can use for day-to-day  decision-making. Further, problems at some agencies, such as DOD and  DHS, are so severe and deep-rooted that we have designated their  transformation efforts as high risk due to financial management and  business practices that adversely affect their ability to control costs,  ensure basic accountability, measure performance, and meet other  financial management needs. Against the backdrop of our nation\u2019s long- term fiscal imbalance, addressing these issues represents key challenges  to fully realizing the world-class financial management anticipated by  Congress through the enactment of federal financial management reform  legislation as well as FMLOB initiative goals.", "Given the broad spectrum of challenges associated with modernizing  federal financial management systems, strong leadership and commitment  of OMB, FSIO, and other key FMLOB stakeholders are especially  important to ensure that needed improvements are achieved.

However, the methodology OMB used to report this overall  governmentwide estimate did not provide a complete and accurate  measure of spending on these projects. Specifically, agencies are required  to indicate certain FEA categories that each project relates to in  connection with their exhibit 53 submissions. While OMB\u2019s estimate of  agencies\u2019 planned spending includes amounts related to five of these  categories, it does not take into account certain types of mixed systems  that support financial management activities, such as those related to  supply chain management. For example, even though DOD\u2019s Navy ERP  project is a business system with many integrated financial management  functions, OMB\u2019s estimate did not include any of the $112 million planned  to be spent on this project in fiscal year 2009 because it was identified as a  supply chain management project.", "For projects involving mixed systems such as the Navy ERP, OMB  guidance requires agencies to provide the percentage of planned spending  on projects associated with the financial portion of these systems related  to their budget request for the next fiscal year.

In addition, OMB guidance does not require agencies to specify the  amount that was actually spent on the financial portion of mixed system  projects in prior and current years. Further, on the basis of our review of  spending data for two selected agencies, the reliability of information  reported by agencies is unclear. Specifically, these two agencies  interpreted OMB\u2019s guidance differently and, as a result, used inconsistent  methodologies for determining the percentages they reported.

Without an  effective concept of operations providing the foundation to guide FMLOB- related activities, efforts to modernize federal financial management  systems are at an increased risk of not fully achieving their goals. Further,  addressing many of our recommendations will require extensive work to  complete remaining development activities and, more importantly,  actually place them into operation to achieve the federal financial  management framework envisioned. In addition, despite its critical role in  overseeing agency financial management systems modernization efforts,  OMB has not yet fully addressed our oversight-related recommendations,  including assessing whether agencies have incorporated disciplined  processes into their modernization efforts, fully using its Management  Watch List and High Risk List to more effectively oversee projects, and  reporting to Congress.
