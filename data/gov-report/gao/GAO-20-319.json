In certain states, they may receive both types of benefits through private managed care plans. As of January 2019, about 386,000 such individuals were enrolled in both a private Medicare plan known as a dual-eligible special needs plan (D-SNP) and a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO) that were offered by the same or related companies. This arrangement, known as aligned enrollment, may create opportunities for better coordination between Medicare's acute care services and Medicaid's long-term services and supports, such as nursing facility care or personal care services.", "Medicaid officials in seven selected states described challenges with aligned enrollment. One challenge cited by officials in six of the states was using D-SNP and Medicare data to implement and evaluate aligned enrollment. For example, officials in one state said they cannot separate D-SNP quality data for just their state, because some D-SNPs report data spanning multiple states to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). As of December 2019, CMS officials said they are determining the best way for D-SNPs to report these quality data.", "CMS has assisted states with aligned enrollment, but lacks quality information on the experiences of dual-eligible beneficiaries who have aligned enrollment through a process known as default enrollment. With default enrollment, states allow automatic assignment of beneficiaries who are enrolled in a Medicaid MCO and are about to become eligible for Medicare to the D-SNP aligned with that MCO. However, CMS's monthly reports on default enrollment do not include information on beneficiaries who choose to disenroll in the first 90 days after being default enrolled, a time frame specified in regulation. According to one beneficiary group, some beneficiaries may disenroll, because they did not realize they were default enrolled and their provider is not in the D-SNP's network. Quality information on the experiences of dual-eligible beneficiaries after default enrollment would allow CMS to better identify the extent to which beneficiaries face challenges and to determine how, if at all, to address the challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS take steps to obtain quality information on the experiences of dual-eligible beneficiaries who have been default enrolled into D-SNPs. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2017, about 12 million of Medicare\u2019s over 61 million beneficiaries were  also enrolled in Medicaid. These individuals, known as dual-eligible  beneficiaries, are often in poorer health and require more care than other  Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. As such, in 2019, the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers Medicare and  oversees Medicaid, established better care for dual-eligible beneficiaries  as one of its 16 strategic initiatives. Dual-eligible beneficiaries can face  challenges in dealing with the separate Medicare and Medicaid programs,  which have different or overlapping sets of benefits, provider networks,  and payment policies. For example, the Medicare program is generally  responsible for covering dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2019 primary and acute  care, including hospitalizations and physician services, while state  Medicaid programs are generally responsible for covering their long-term  services and supports, such as nursing facility care or personal care  services. The fragmentation between these separate programs can lead  to poorly coordinated care for dual-eligible beneficiaries.", "In certain states, dual-eligible beneficiaries may receive Medicare  benefits, Medicaid benefits, or both types of benefits through private  managed care plans. Like other Medicare beneficiaries, dual-eligible  beneficiaries can choose to enroll in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans,  which are the private plan alternative to traditional Medicare and generally  must cover all traditional Medicare benefits. In particular, as of January  2019, about 2.2 million dual-eligible beneficiaries in 42 states and the  District of Columbia had chosen to enroll in dual-eligible special needs  plans (D-SNP), which are a type of MA plan. Congress first authorized the  establishment of D-SNPs in 2003 to address the unique needs of dual- eligible beneficiaries. D-SNPs are required to provide certain specialized  services targeted at the needs of dual-eligible beneficiaries, such as  performing health risk assessments and creating individualized care  plans. Since January 2013, federal law has required all D-SNPs to have a  contract with each state in which it wants to operate. In addition, some  states require or allow Medicaid beneficiaries, including dual-eligible  beneficiaries, to receive their Medicaid benefits through a Medicaid  managed care organization (MCO).", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 directed CMS to assist states that are  interested in using D-SNPs as a platform for integration with state  Medicaid programs, among other things. Some states have pursued  such integration through the use of an arrangement known as aligned  enrollment. Aligned enrollment occurs when a dual-eligible beneficiary is  enrolled in a D-SNP and Medicaid MCO that are offered by the same or  related companies. Some studies suggest that aligned enrollment may  create opportunities for the company or companies to better coordinate  care and integrate benefits, which may help prevent unnecessary  hospitalizations and institutionalizations.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 includes a provision for us to review  the integration between D-SNPs and state Medicaid programs. This  report  1.  describes what is known about the extent to which states have  encouraged aligned enrollment of dual-eligible beneficiaries in D- SNPs,  2.  describes what is known about selected states\u2019 experiences with  3.  examines CMS\u2019s role in and oversight of states\u2019 use of aligned  enrollment.", "To describe what is known about the extent to which states have  encouraged aligned enrollment of dual-eligible beneficiaries in D-SNPs,  we reviewed published materials from the Integrated Care Resource  Center (a CMS initiative to provide technical assistance, which is  operated by contractors) and others. To corroborate this information, we  interviewed officials from CMS, the Integrated Care Resource Center, and  Medicaid agencies in seven selected states. We selected the seven  states (Arizona, Florida, Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,  and Virginia) based on the variation in their experiences with aligned  enrollment in D-SNPs, the number of D-SNP enrollees, and their length of  time using a managed care delivery system to provide long-term services  and supports in Medicaid, also referred to as managed long-term services and supports (MLTSS). We limited our scope to states with MLTSS, in  part, because about 80 percent of Medicaid spending on relevant dual- eligible beneficiaries was for long-term services and supports in 2013, the  most recent year such data were available. We reviewed the selected  states\u2019 contracts with D-SNPs and other available documentation to  corroborate evidence gathered in these interviews. We also received data  on aligned enrollment from five of the seven selected states.

In addition, we reviewed available  documentation to corroborate officials\u2019 statements. To supplement this  information, we interviewed seven beneficiary groups, which included  nonprofit organizations, State Health Insurance Assistance Programs in  two of our seven selected states, and the long-term care ombudsman in  one selected state. We also interviewed three companies that offered D- SNPs and Medicaid MCOs, and these companies varied in their number  of D-SNP enrollees and number of selected states served.

Individuals  ages 65 or older can qualify for Medicare based on age, and individuals  ages 18 to 64 can qualify for Medicare based on disability. Medicaid  eligibility varies by state, but beneficiaries may qualify based on having a  low level of income, a need for nursing home care, high medical  expenses, or other criteria.", "For dual-eligible beneficiaries, Medicare is the primary payer for any  benefits covered by both programs. As a result, Medicare is the primary  payer for acute and post-acute care, such as physician services,  hospitalizations, prescription drugs, and skilled nursing facility care. For  many dual-eligible beneficiaries, Medicaid covers benefits not covered by  Medicare. This includes long-term services and supports, which may  include nursing home care, personal care services, or adult day care.  Whether Medicaid covers these benefits varies between the two main  categories of dual-eligible beneficiaries. Those in the first category are  known as full-benefit, dual-eligible beneficiaries, because they may  receive all Medicaid benefits, in addition to Medicare benefits. Medicaid  also pays for their Medicare premiums and, in some cases, the cost- sharing for their Medicare benefits. Those in the second category are  known as partial-benefit, dual-eligible beneficiaries, because Medicaid  assistance is limited to payment of their Medicare premiums and, in some  cases, the cost-sharing for their Medicare benefits. Partial-benefit, dual- eligible beneficiaries have limited income and assets, but their income  and assets are not low enough to qualify them for full Medicaid benefits in  their state.", "For Medicare, dual-eligible beneficiaries can choose to receive their  Medicare services from either traditional Medicare or from MA plans.  These options differ in key ways. For example, traditional Medicare may  have a more extensive provider network than MA plans. However, MA  plans may cover additional benefits, such as vision or dental care, which  are generally not covered under traditional Medicare. If dual-eligible  beneficiaries choose to enroll in MA plans, they may also have the choice  between regular MA plans and D-SNPs, which offer certain services  targeted at the needs of dual-eligible beneficiaries. For example, D-SNPs  are required to perform health risk assessments, create individualized  care plans, and provide an interdisciplinary care team for each beneficiary  enrolled. They may also cover transportation services, home  modifications, or other specialized services that are more likely to be used  by dual-eligible beneficiaries.", "For Medicaid, states may allow or require Medicaid beneficiaries,  including dual-eligible beneficiaries, to receive their Medicaid benefits  through an MCO. In this managed care model, Medicaid MCOs are  responsible for arranging for and paying providers\u2019 claims for a specific  set of Medicaid benefits provided to beneficiaries. More recently, some  states have created new Medicaid managed care programs or expanded  the benefits covered by existing Medicaid managed care programs in  order to include additional populations previously covered through  Medicaid fee-for-service.

Since January 2013, all D-SNPs have  been required to have an executed contract with the Medicaid agency in  each state in which it operates. A state can enter into contracts with all,  some, or none of the D-SNPs seeking to operate in the state, and any D- SNPs that the state declines to contract with cannot operate in the state.  Each year, CMS reviews D-SNPs\u2019 contracts with states to ensure that  they include eight required elements, including the D-SNP\u2019s responsibility  for providing or arranging the provision of Medicaid benefits, among other  things. According to CMS officials, in these reviews, CMS does not  collect information regarding whether states are imposing requirements  pertaining to aligned enrollment. States also have contracts with Medicaid  MCOs, which can include requirements that could facilitate or encourage  aligned enrollment.", "As shown in table 1, CMS\u2019s Integrated Care Resource Center has  identified five types of approaches that states can use to encourage  aligned enrollment. For example, states can manage which D-SNPs  operate in the state, such as only allowing D-SNPs with an aligned  Medicaid MCO (that is, a MCO offered by the same company or a related  company). This gives dual-eligible beneficiaries greater options for  choosing aligned enrollment. As another example, states can allow the  automatic assignment of certain dual-eligible beneficiaries to a D-SNP  aligned with a Medicaid MCO, a process known as default enrollment.

Of those 16 states, 11 managed which D-SNPs operate in the  state, which is the foundation for promoting aligned enrollment, according  to officials from the Integrated Care Resource Center.", "Of our seven selected states, all of them had implemented at least one of  the five approaches to encourage aligned enrollment in 2019. The three  most common approaches among our selected states were (1) managing  which D-SNPs operate in the state; (2) limiting D-SNP enrollment to full- benefit, dual-eligible beneficiaries; and (3) encouraging D-SNP marketing  to better support informed beneficiary decision-making. The details of the  approaches implemented in each state varied widely.", "Managing which D-SNPs operate in the state. Five of the seven  selected states (Arizona, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and  Virginia) managed which D-SNPs operated in 2019, but they varied in  how they implemented this approach. For example, when Virginia  established its Medicaid MLTSS program in 2017, only one D-SNP  operated in the state, and Virginia required the companies with Medicaid  MLTSS contracts to also start offering D-SNPs within 3 years. In contrast,  when Pennsylvania and Tennessee implemented this approach, multiple  D-SNPs already operated in each state. Pennsylvania and Tennessee  required new D-SNPs to have aligned Medicaid MCOs, but allowed  existing D-SNPs to continue operating. As a result, beneficiaries had the  choice between D-SNPs that had aligned Medicaid MCOs and D-SNPs  that did not have aligned Medicaid MCOs. Medicaid officials in these two  states told us they chose not to cancel existing D-SNPs that did not have  aligned Medicaid MCOs, as doing so could have disrupted beneficiary- provider relationships.", "As a result of the selected states\u2019 differing approaches to managing which  D-SNPs operated, the proportion of aligned to unaligned D-SNPs in each  state varied.

Five of the selected states (Arizona, Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,  and Virginia) limited D-SNP enrollment in some or all of their D-SNPs to  full-benefit, dual-eligible beneficiaries in 2019. In particular, Arizona and  New Jersey Medicaid officials said that limiting D-SNP enrollment to full- benefit, dual-eligible beneficiaries allowed D-SNPs to provide a more  straightforward benefit package. In turn, this can be more easily  described in D-SNP materials and communications, which may help  beneficiaries to make more informed decisions around aligned  enrollment.", "Encouraging D-SNP marketing to better support informed  beneficiary decision-making. Five of the selected states (Arizona, New  Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia) took steps to encourage  D-SNP marketing to support informed beneficiary decision-making in  2019. For example, Arizona and Pennsylvania encouraged D-SNPs to  directly market themselves to beneficiaries in the D-SNP\u2019s aligned  Medicaid MCO, in order to promote aligned enrollment. In addition, New  Jersey Medicaid officials told us they review D-SNP marketing and work  directly with D-SNPs to develop standard marketing language. In  particular, the officials said some D-SNPs had marketed themselves as  offering certain extra benefits, but those benefits were already a standard  part of the state\u2019s Medicaid package. The officials said they worked with  the D-SNPs to correct the marketing, and they also developed standard  language for marketing in the state. This can help reduce beneficiary  confusion when making enrollment decisions.", "Automatically assigning certain beneficiaries to plans with aligned  enrollment. Four selected states (Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, and  Tennessee) allowed automatic assignment of certain beneficiaries to  plans with aligned enrollment in 2019. For example, Arizona,  Pennsylvania, and Tennessee allowed default enrollment by which  certain Medicaid beneficiaries were automatically assigned to aligned D- SNPs. Under federal rules, beneficiaries have the opportunity to opt out  prior to being default enrolled and select a different source of Medicare  coverage; they also have the opportunity to disenroll within the first 90  days after default enrollment and select a different source of Medicare  coverage.", "In addition, Florida and Pennsylvania automatically assigned certain dual- eligible beneficiaries to aligned Medicaid MCOs. For example, Florida law  requires the state Medicaid agency to automatically assign certain D-SNP  enrollees to aligned MLTSS plans when beneficiaries become eligible for  long-term services and supports and have not voluntarily chosen an  MLTSS plan.", "Engaging counselors to assist beneficiaries with aligned enrollment  decisions. Two of the seven selected states (Arizona and Pennsylvania)  engaged enrollment counselors to encourage aligned enrollment in 2019.  For example, Arizona\u2019s state Medicaid office works with the state\u2019s Aging  and Disability Resource Center and State Health Insurance Assistance  Program counselors to increase beneficiary understanding of aligned  enrollment and options to enroll in aligned plans. In 2019, Pennsylvania\u2019s  contracts with D-SNPs required collaboration between the D-SNPs and  the state\u2019s independent enrollment broker that assists beneficiaries with  Medicaid enrollment.", "In addition to there being variation in the selected states\u2019 use of  approaches to encourage aligned enrollment, the proportion of D-SNP  enrollees with aligned enrollment varied from 20 percent in Pennsylvania  to 100 percent in New Jersey among the selected states that were able to  provide data for 2019. (See fig. 3.) There can be multiple reasons for the  varied levels of aligned enrollment between D-SNPs and MLTSS.

Medicaid officials in six of the selected states (Florida, Kansas, New  Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia) told us that using D-SNP  and Medicare data to implement and evaluate aligned enrollment policies  can be difficult. For example, Tennessee Medicaid officials told us that  getting the data from CMS needed for default enrollment was a challenge.  In particular, they said that, when the state was first starting to implement  default enrollment, they had challenges with getting data from CMS in a  timely fashion to identify which Medicaid beneficiaries were about to  become dually eligible for Medicare, particularly those with eligibility due  to disability. This meant that the state could not provide D-SNPs with  the information needed by the D-SNPs to send notices to those  beneficiaries in the required time frame. CMS officials also  acknowledged that its data do not always identify individuals becoming  eligible for Medicare early enough for D-SNPs to send notices in the  required time frame. Tennessee Medicaid officials told us that CMS has  worked with the state on this issue and it has now become easier for the  state to receive the needed data. Furthermore, CMS and its Integrated  Care Resource Center have also developed materials and, according to  CMS officials, provided ongoing technical assistance for states on  accessing data for default enrollment and other aspects of  implementation of aligned enrollment.", "Medicaid officials in Virginia and New Jersey described related  challenges with using D-SNP data to determine whether their policies  work. Virginia Medicaid officials told us that it can be difficult to evaluate  the health benefits of aligned enrollment, because data on quality  measures can span multiple states. Specifically, one of the state\u2019s D- SNPs operates in multiple states and therefore reports health outcome  data to CMS for its entire service area. Virginia Medicaid officials told us  they are not able to separate data for Virginia residents from those of  other states. As a result, they said they currently cannot determine the  effect of their aligned enrollment policies, and they plan to require the D- SNP to report Virginia-specific quality data in the future. New Jersey  Medicaid officials described a challenge with receiving the relevant data  to evaluate health outcomes for dual-eligible beneficiaries with aligned  enrollment. The state has CMS approval to receive Medicare data directly  from CMS. However, as of November 2019, the state\u2019s data vendor was  not in compliance with federal Medicare data security requirements for  storing certain data, which meant that the state could not accept the  Medicare data.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 encourages CMS to require reporting  of MA quality measures, including D-SNP quality measures, at the plan  level. However, CMS has identified several challenges to developing  such a requirement. One challenge CMS has identified is that about two- thirds to three-quarters of D-SNPs would not have reliable ratings, for  example, because those plans had too few participants in the survey.  Another challenge CMS has identified is the additional complexity and  administrative burden for plans completing this reporting. As of December  2019, CMS officials told us they are continuing to work to determine the  best reporting level for each quality measure. They also plan to collect  additional feedback from stakeholders and a technical expert panel.", "Difficulties with information dual-eligible beneficiaries receive about  Medicare enrollment choices. Medicaid officials in five of the selected  states (Kansas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia) told  us they have experienced challenges in ensuring that beneficiaries  receive quality information about their Medicare enrollment choices. For  example, in 2019, Pennsylvania\u2019s contracts with D-SNPs required  collaboration between the D-SNPs and the state\u2019s independent  enrollment broker that assists beneficiaries with Medicaid enrollment.  However, Pennsylvania Medicaid officials told us the state\u2019s independent  enrollment broker did not have the capacity to provide this type of  assistance in addition to its primary responsibility of assisting  beneficiaries with Medicaid enrollment.", "As another example, Virginia Medicaid officials told us they have faced  challenges using state D-SNP contracts to regulate D-SNP marketing.  They told us that certain provisions in the state\u2019s contracts with D-SNPs  were intended to regulate the extent of D-SNP marketing in 2019. In  particular, each D-SNP was supposed to only market to beneficiaries  enrolled in that D-SNP\u2019s aligned Medicaid MCO, which was intended to  increase the extent of aligned enrollment in the state. However, state  Medicaid officials told us that D-SNPs had different interpretations of the  contract provisions, and one D-SNP had billboards and television  advertisements available to the general public. Due to the difficulty of  enforcement, among other reasons, Virginia Medicaid officials told us  they chose to not include these provisions in the D-SNP contracts for  2020.", "Through the Integrated Care Resource Center, CMS has developed  materials describing how states can regulate D-SNP marketing in their  contracts with D-SNPs, and the agency reviews and may disapprove D- SNP marketing materials that do not follow federal requirements. CMS  officials also told us they make themselves available to states to explain  how to include marketing restrictions in the contracts that states have with  D-SNPs.", "Limits of staff knowledge. Medicaid officials in four of the selected  states (Florida, Kansas, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) told us that  limited staff knowledge of Medicare presents a challenge. For example,  Medicaid officials in Kansas told us only one or two staff in the state\u2019s  Medicaid agency are knowledgeable about Medicare and would have the  knowledge to implement aligned enrollment approaches. Similarly,  Medicaid officials in Florida said they only recently learned about one of  the approaches for encouraging aligned enrollment, which is that the  state can decline to contract with certain D-SNPs. In addition, New Jersey  and Pennsylvania Medicaid officials told us staff knowledge of Medicare  is limited and that they would like to increase their level of knowledge as  they continue to foster aligned enrollment.", "Competition from look-alike MA plans targeted to dual-eligible  beneficiaries. Medicaid officials in four of our selected states (Arizona,  Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia) identified certain MA plans that  are so-called \u201clook-alike\u201d plans to the D-SNPs, which create a potential  challenge to fostering aligned enrollment. According to CMS, look-alike  plans are MA plans that are designed for and marketed exclusively to  dual-eligible beneficiaries, but that are not D-SNPs. Therefore, look-alike  plans do not need a contract with the state to operate and do not have to  comply with state approaches that foster aligned enrollment.", "Medicaid officials from our selected states and the Medicare Payment  Advisory Commission gave examples of the impact of look-alike plans.  For example, Tennessee Medicaid officials told us that dual-eligible  beneficiaries in look-alike plans do not receive care coordination between  Medicare and Medicaid, in contrast with dual-eligible beneficiaries in D- SNPs, which are required to provide such coordination. In addition,  Arizona Medicaid officials told us that look-alike plans have affected  levels of aligned enrollment in the state. Similarly, according to the  Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, look-alike plans can undermine  states\u2019 efforts to develop D-SNPs that integrate Medicare and Medicaid  by encouraging dual-eligible beneficiaries to instead enroll in look-alike  plans.", "CMS has also identified look-alike plans as a challenge and is  considering some steps in response. In 2018, CMS revised its marketing  guidelines to prohibit look-alike plans from marketing themselves as  designed for dual-eligible beneficiaries and as having a relationship with  the state Medicaid agency. In its April 2019 policy update for MA plans,  CMS said that look-alike plans enable companies to offer plans that  circumvent state and federal requirements for D-SNPs, which undermines  efforts to improve the quality of care. In February 2020, CMS published  a proposed rule that, if finalized, would prohibit the offering of MA plans  whose enrollment of dual-eligible beneficiaries exceeds specific projected  or actual enrollment thresholds in states with a D-SNP. According to  CMS, this would prevent look-alikes from undermining the statutory and  regulatory framework for D-SNPs.", "Extent of overlapping provider networks. Medicaid officials in two of  our selected states (Pennsylvania and Tennessee) reported challenges  with aligned D-SNPs and Medicaid MCOs that do not have completely  overlapping networks of relevant providers. That is, even though the D- SNP and Medicaid MCO are offered by the same or related companies,  certain providers may be in only the D-SNP network or only the Medicaid  MCO network\u2014but not both. For example, representatives from a  beneficiary group in Pennsylvania told us that a dual-eligible beneficiary\u2019s  provider may be in the Medicaid MCO network, but not the D-SNP  network. This can disrupt that beneficiary\u2019s continuity of care if he or she  is default enrolled into the D-SNP. There are no requirements for the  state or D-SNP to ensure that a beneficiary\u2019s primary care provider is in  the D-SNP into which he or she is default enrolled. CMS\u2019s model for the  notice sent to beneficiaries identified for default enrollment suggests (but  does not require) that the D-SNP include information on whether or not  the beneficiary\u2019s primary care provider is in the D-SNP\u2019s network.", "CMS officials said they did not know of any complaints the agency has  received on the issue. They also said they have not analyzed how the  provider network of a D-SNP compares to the provider network of its  aligned Medicaid MCO. Furthermore, in the preamble to the default  enrollment final rule issued in April 2018, CMS said that it did not include  any criteria related to provider networks, but that network adequacy  requirements would apply and states can use their contracts with D-SNPs  to create requirements for continuity of care. One state that does this is  Tennessee, which specifically requires D-SNPs to develop provider  networks that have substantial overlap with the provider network of their  aligned Medicaid MCOs. The state also requires D-SNPs to ensure  continuity of care for beneficiaries who have been default enrolled. For  example, Tennessee Medicaid officials said that if a beneficiary who has  been default enrolled has a long-standing primary care provider with the  D-SNP\u2019s aligned Medicaid MCO, the state requires the D-SNP to  continue covering services by that provider for at least 30 days and to  attempt to contract with the provider."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Assisted States with Aligned Enrollment, but Lacks Quality Information on the Experience of Beneficiaries Whose Aligned Enrollment Was Due to Default Enrollment", "paragraphs": ["CMS has assisted states with aligned enrollment. In particular, CMS has  provided technical assistance to states on implementing the various  approaches that encourage aligned enrollment. One way that CMS has  done this is through its Integrated Care Resource Center, which has  developed materials on how states can use their contracts with D-SNPs  to align enrollment and promote integration. The Integrated Care  Resource Center has also facilitated peer-to-peer assistance between  states. For example, Integrated Care Resource Center officials said they  facilitated conversations and assistance between state Medicaid officials  in New Jersey and Pennsylvania on D-SNP marketing. Medicaid officials  in six of our selected states said they had utilized CMS\u2019s technical  assistance, and they had overall positive views of CMS\u2019s assistance.", "CMS reviews some aspects of the contracts between states and D-SNPs,  including checking that the contracts include the eight required elements.", "According to CMS officials, in these reviews, CMS does not collect  information regarding whether states are imposing requirements  pertaining to aligned enrollment. CMS\u2019s program audits of MA plans  similarly do not include reviews of such state requirements pertaining to  aligned enrollment.", "CMS has a direct role with one aspect of aligned enrollment: default  enrollment. In particular, CMS approves D-SNPs to receive beneficiaries  through default enrollment, and it processes the enrollment transactions  of beneficiaries being default enrolled.", "D-SNPs\u2019 approval for default enrollment: Before a D-SNP can  receive beneficiaries through default enrollment, it must submit a  proposal to CMS for approval. CMS reviews the D-SNP\u2019s proposal  and checks that the D-SNP meets an established list of requirements  outlined in regulation. Among other requirements, the D-SNP must  demonstrate it has the state\u2019s support for default enrollment and that  the required elements have been included in its template for the  notice that is sent to beneficiaries identified for default enrollment.  CMS also checks that the D-SNP is not facing any CMS enrollment  sanctions and that the D-SNP has a quality rating of three or more  stars. CMS grants approval for up to 5 years if it determines the D- SNP meets these requirements.", "Default enrollment transactions: CMS processes the enrollment  transactions of dual-eligible beneficiaries being default enrolled, and it  tracks these transactions in a monthly report. The monthly report lists  the total number of beneficiaries identified for default enrollment for  each applicable D-SNP, and the report lists numbers for certain  subsets of beneficiaries who were ultimately not default enrolled.  These subsets include beneficiaries who opted out prior to being  default enrolled and beneficiaries whose default enrollment was not  allowed by CMS for various reasons.", "Despite its direct role in default enrollment, CMS lacks quality information  on the experiences of dual-eligible beneficiaries after they are default  enrolled. This is inconsistent with federal internal control standards on  information and communication, which state that management should use  quality information to achieve the agency\u2019s objectives. In particular, the  monthly reports on enrollment transactions do not include data on the  extent to which dual-eligible beneficiaries choose to disenroll after being  default enrolled. Although the reports include data on the number of  beneficiaries who opt out prior to being default enrolled (which CMS  officials said was low), they do not include data on beneficiaries who  choose to disenroll in the first 90 days after being default enrolled. This  90-day time frame for disenrollment is specified by federal regulation, and  beneficiaries may choose to disenroll for various reasons. For example,  one reason for disenrollment given by one beneficiary group we  interviewed is that some beneficiaries may not realize they have been  default enrolled into a D-SNP until they next see their provider, and that  provider may not be in the D-SNP\u2019s provider network. They said that  beneficiaries may not have seen the notice or other information about  being default enrolled, or they may not have understood the information.  In addition, CMS cannot systematically review beneficiary complaints for  trends or concerns related to default enrollment. Dual-eligible  beneficiaries, like other Medicare beneficiaries, can submit complaints to  CMS. These complaints are entered in the agency\u2019s complaint tracking  module, and D-SNP account managers, like other MA plan account  managers, are responsible for monitoring complaints. CMS officials said  that the D-SNP account managers have not identified any trends or  concerns about default enrollment. However, CMS officials said default  enrollment is not tracked as a distinct category in the complaint tracking  module, and the guidance on monitoring complaints that is provided to  the D-SNP account managers does not direct them to look for issues  explicitly related to default enrollment. Quality information on the  experiences of dual-eligible beneficiaries after they are default enrolled  would allow CMS to better identify the extent to which these beneficiaries  face challenges as a result of default enrollment and to determine how, if  at all, to address the challenges.", "Future studies may provide CMS with additional information on  beneficiaries in D-SNPs with aligned enrollment, but that information will  not be available until 2022 or later. In particular, federal law directs the  Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, in consultation with the  Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, to compare the  quality of the different types of D-SNPs, including those with aligned  enrollment, as well as comparing them to other types of plans. The  commission is to develop an initial report by 2022 with subsequent  reports afterward."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Better care for dual-eligible beneficiaries is one of CMS\u2019s strategic  initiatives, and the agency has supported states\u2019 decisions to encourage  aligned enrollment in order to encourage better coordination of care.
