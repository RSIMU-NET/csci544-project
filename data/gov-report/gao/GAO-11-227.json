Nonproliferation programs administered by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) are working to secure nuclear materials in Russia and other countries. GAO assessed (1) U.S. governmentwide efforts to implement the President's 4-year nuclear material security initiative; (2) the status and challenges, if any, of NNSA's nuclear security programs in Russia; and (3) NNSA efforts to secure nuclear materials in countries other than Russia. To address these issues, GAO analyzed U.S. nuclear security strategies and plans and interviewed U.S. and Russian government officials. This report summarizes the findings of GAO's classified report on securing nuclear materials worldwide."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NSC officials have approved a governmentwide strategy for the President's 4-year global nuclear material security initiative that describes the scope and objectives of the interagency effort and identifies the main efforts by U.S. agencies and programs to support the initiative. However, this interagency strategy lacks specific details concerning how the initiative will be implemented, including the identity of vulnerable foreign nuclear material sites and facilities to be addressed, agencies and programs responsible for addressing each site, planned activities at each location, potential challenges and strategies for overcoming those obstacles, anticipated timelines, and cost estimates. As a result, key details associated with the initiative are unclear, including its overall estimated cost, time frame, and scope of planned work. Three NNSA nuclear nonproliferation programs GAO reviewed--the MPC&A program, the Materials Consolidation and Conversion (MCC) program, and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI)--have made varying degrees of progress in securing Russian nuclear warheads and materials. While the MPC&A program has made considerable progress securing Russia's nuclear warhead and material facilities, the MCC and GTRI programs have had more limited success achieving their objectives in Russia. Moreover, the future of these efforts in Russia is unclear because of questionable high-level Russian political commitment to nuclear security cooperation with the United States. Each of these three programs also faces implementation challenges. The MPC&A program, in particular, faces challenges in successfully completing upgrades against insider and outsider threats at some Russian nuclear material facilities and in transitioning responsibility to Russia for sustaining MPC&A systems. Because of the time required to address these challenges, NNSA is unlikely to meet a deadline under current U.S. law requiring Russia to assume sole responsibility for sustaining MPC&A by January 1, 2013, and MPC&A program activities will need to continue in Russia beyond the statutory deadline. In addition to its efforts in Russia, NNSA is working with other countries on issues related to the security of weapon-usable nuclear materials. In two countries believed to have large nuclear material stockpiles--China and India--political sensitivities have limited NNSA's efforts in both nations to the relatively noncontroversial exchange of nuclear security best practices, training, and demonstration projects instead of implementing MPC&A activities directly at nuclear sites. NNSA is also seeking to accelerate the removal of weapon-usable nuclear materials from other priority countries through the GTRI program, including key countries that made new commitments at the April 2010 Nuclear Security Summit to relinquish or reduce their weapon-usable nuclear material stockpiles. In particular, NNSA officials reported progress in negotiations with several nations--including Ukraine and South Africa--following the summit for the removal of some highly enriched uranium located in those countries. GAO suggests that Congress consider extending the deadline for NNSA to complete Material Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) program activities in Russia."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Department of Energy (DOE) and NNSA take several actions regarding three nonproliferation program efforts in Russia, such as clarifying the remaining scope and costs of MPC&A work in Russia. GAO also recommends that the National Security Council (NSC) lead interagency development of a more detailed implementation plan for the President's 4-year initiative. DOE and NNSA agreed with the recommendations. NSC did not comment on GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["One of the most serious threats facing the United States and other  countries is the possibility that other nations or terrorist organizations  could steal a nuclear warhead or nuclear weapon-usable materials from  poorly secured stockpiles in various locations around the world.  Terrorists or countries seeking nuclear weapons could use as little as 25  kilograms (Kg) of weapon-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) or 8 Kg of  plutonium to construct a nuclear weapon. To address this threat and  related nuclear proliferation concerns, the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE)  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) implements more than  20 nonproliferation programs worldwide. Among other things, these  programs include efforts to secure nuclear warheads; protect, consolidate,  and dispose of weapon-usable nuclear materials and radiological sources;  reduce the risks of nuclear smuggling; research and develop  nonproliferation technologies; redirect weapons of mass destruction  (WMD) expertise to peaceful research; and enhance international export  controls and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear  safeguards.", "Many of these programs were initiated in the early 1990s, following the  dissolution of the Soviet Union, and have focused principally on improving  nuclear security in Russia because of the large size of its nuclear complex  and its vast nuclear material and weapons stockpiles. In 2005, the U.S. and  Russian Presidents issued a joint statement in Bratislava, Slovakia, on  nuclear security cooperation between both countries, including  accelerating security improvements to Russian nuclear material and  warhead storage sites. Some NNSA programs are winding down as work is  completed in Russia\u2014such as the program to end Russian production of  weapon-grade plutonium\u2014while others are planning to continue  indefinitely. A major area of continuing focus is ensuring the long-term  sustainability of U.S.-funded security improvements at nuclear facilities in  Russia and other countries as U.S. assistance phases out. Congress has  required that the NNSA program to improve Russian nuclear material and  warhead security\u2014known as the Material Protection, Control, and  Accounting (MPC&A) program\u2014conclude efforts in that country by the  beginning of 2013, with Russia assuming responsibility for sustaining the  program at that time.", "In recent years, NNSA nuclear nonproliferation programs have focused  increasing attention on the security of weapon-usable nuclear materials in  countries beyond Russia and the former Soviet states. For example, the  Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) was created in 2004 to  consolidate and accelerate NNSA efforts to secure and recover nuclear  and radiological materials overseas and convert HEU-fueled research  reactors in dozens of countries around the world. The NNSA programs  have engaged more than 100 countries, and are seeking to increase nuclear  security work with several countries where there has been limited prior  cooperation. In fiscal year 2009, NNSA spent over $2 billion on its nuclear  nonproliferation programs.", "The Obama administration has proposed to further strengthen and expand  U.S. efforts to reduce nuclear proliferation risks and improve nuclear  security worldwide. As Congress directed, President Obama created a  position within the National Security Council (NSC)\u2014Special Assistant to  the President and Coordinator for Weapons of Mass Destruction\u2014to serve  as the central organizer for U.S. efforts to improve nuclear security and  prevent nuclear terrorism worldwide. In April 2009, in a speech in Prague,  Czech Republic, President Obama announced a new international effort to  secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within 4 years.  NSC staff have taken the lead in coordinating efforts among different  federal agencies that will contribute to this 4-year nuclear material  security initiative. In addition, leaders of 47 nations\u2014including Russia,  China, India, and Pakistan\u2014endorsed this 4-year nuclear material security  goal in a communiqu\u00e9 from a Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the  President in April 2010. The summit work plan accompanying the  communiqu\u00e9 committed countries to voluntarily take steps to improve  nuclear security by bringing international nuclear agreements into force,  improving nuclear security standards, and exchanging information on  nuclear security best practices. Senior representatives from each  government will meet in December 2010 to evaluate progress toward the  summit\u2019s goals, and a follow-on summit is planned for 2012 in South  Korea.", "We have performed several reviews of NNSA nuclear nonproliferation  programs, as well as those implemented by the Department of State  (State) and Department of Defense (DOD), and found a number of  limitations, management weaknesses, and other challenges facing these  efforts. For instance, in 2005, we assessed the DOD and DOE strategies  guiding their nuclear nonproliferation programs and efforts to coordinate  DOE, DOD, and State nonproliferation activities. We found that there was  no overall strategy integrating the threat reduction and nuclear  nonproliferation programs of these agencies. We also found that  coordination of DOD, DOE, and State border security programs could be  improved. To that end, we recommended that NSC issue clear guidance  for the coordination of border security programs, as it has done with  programs to employ biological weapons scientists. We also recommended  that the Secretaries of Defense and Energy develop an integrated plan for  improved coordination of all U.S. threat reduction and nonproliferation  programs. DOE concurred with the report and our recommendations.  DOD concurred with the need for better integration of nonproliferation  and threat reduction programs but did not specify whether it agreed about  the need for an integrated plan, while neither State nor NSC commented  on the report.", "This report responds to your request that we conduct a review of U.S.  nuclear nonproliferation strategies. Specifically, our objectives were to  assess (1) U.S. governmentwide efforts to implement the President\u2019s  initiative to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide within 4  years; (2) the status and challenges, if any, of NNSA\u2019s nuclear security  programs in Russia; and (3) NNSA efforts to secure nuclear materials in  countries other than Russia. In September 2010, we reported to you on the  results of our work in a classified report. This report summarizes certain  aspects of our classified report.", "To address these objectives, we obtained and analyzed official  documentation, including an interagency document describing the strategy  for improving security of nuclear materials worldwide, an international  nuclear security status report, NNSA\u2019s plan for advancing the President\u2019s  initiative to secure vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within 4  years, materials on MPC&A program efforts in Russia, and other  information on NNSA\u2019s efforts to secure nuclear materials in countries  other than Russia. We also interviewed senior U.S. officials at NSC, NNSA,  DOD, State, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)  and representatives of the intelligence community. We also interviewed  senior Russian officials who have worked with the NNSA nuclear  nonproliferation programs, including officials from the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs; the Russian State Corporation for Atomic Energy  (Rosatom); the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD); Russian Federal  Customs Service; and Russian Federal Service of Environmental,  Technological, and Nuclear Supervision (Rostekhnadzor), which provides  oversight of Russia\u2019s civilian nuclear facilities.

In 1992, the United  States and Russia signed a CTR \u201cumbrella agreement\u201d that established an  overall legal framework for U.S. nuclear security assistance to Russia.  The United States and Russia completed 7-year extension protocols for the  umbrella agreement in 1999 and 2006, and similar CTR umbrella  agreements have been concluded with other former Soviet states.", "In 1993, DOE began implementing some CTR program activities funded by  DOD, principally the MPC&A effort to help secure weapon-usable nuclear  materials in the former Soviet Union. In 1995, DOE established its own  MPC&A program with its own funding, and in 1996, funding for the  MPC&A program shifted directly from DOD to DOE. The scope of DOE  nonproliferation programs further expanded with DOE assuming  responsibility for the CTR effort to shut down Russia\u2019s three remaining  plutonium production reactors, initiating efforts to detect nuclear  smuggling in Russia and other countries, and undertaking programs to  redirect WMD scientific expertise through cooperative peaceful research  projects. In October 1999, DOE\u2019s nonproliferation programs were  realigned in the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation with the  creation of NNSA. This office consists of six line offices under which  various nuclear nonproliferation programs are implemented (see fig. 1).", "The principal NNSA nuclear nonproliferation offices involved in securing  and eliminating nuclear warheads and materials in foreign locations  include the following:    The Office of International Material Protection and Cooperation. This  office administers the MPC&A program through four suboffices: (1) the  Office of Nuclear Warhead Protection, which, in cooperation with DOD,  works with the Russian MOD, including the 12th Main Directorate, the  Russian organization responsible for nuclear munitions; Navy; and  Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF) to improve security of Russian warheads;  (2) the Office of Weapons Material Protection, which enhances MPC&A  systems at nuclear weapons material facilities controlled by Rosatom; (3)  the Office of Material Consolidation and Civilian Sites, which conducts  MPC&A upgrades at civilian nuclear facilities in Russia, supports  conversion of Russian HEU to low-enriched uranium (LEU), consolidates  nonweapons Russian HEU and plutonium to fewer locations, and  cooperates with other key countries on nuclear security; and (4) the Office  of National Infrastructure and Sustainability, which is working with Russia  and other countries where MPC&A security improvements have been  made to develop and strengthen national-level infrastructures that can  sustain MPC&A systems over the long term.", "The Office of Global Threat Reduction. This office implements the GTRI  program, which protects, removes, and eliminates the use of nuclear and  radiological materials located at civilian sites worldwide. GTRI  subprograms work in the United States and internationally to convert  research reactors from use of HEU to LEU, remove and dispose of excess  nuclear and radiological materials, and protect high-priority nuclear and  radiological sources from theft. The GTRI program has removed all  significant amounts of HEU from 17 countries and Taiwan, including  removals from Chile, Libya, Romania, Taiwan, and Turkey, since the  President\u2019s April 2009 Prague speech; removed or assisted in the disposal  of more than 2,800 Kg of HEU and plutonium from 39 countries; and  assisted in the conversion from the use of HEU to LEU or verified the  shutdown of 72 HEU research reactors around the world, including  reactors in the Czech Republic, Ukraine, South Africa, Uzbekistan, and  Vietnam.", "The Office of Nuclear Risk Reduction. This office has led work with Russia  under the Elimination of Weapons Grade Plutonium Production program  to facilitate the permanent shutdown of the three remaining Russian  weapon-grade plutonium production reactors\u2014which collectively  produced approximately 1.2 metric tons of weapon-grade plutonium each  year\u2014by refurbishing existing and constructing new replacement fossil- fuel-based sources of power. The last reactor was shut down in April 2010,  and the program is to come to an end in fiscal year 2011.", "The Office of Fissile Materials Disposition. This office has two major  missions: the disposition of surplus U.S. weapon-grade HEU, and the  elimination of U.S. and Russian plutonium no longer needed for defense  programs. Under this latter mission, the fissile material disposition  program will assist Russia in modifying reactors that will dispose of 34  metric tons of Russian weapon-grade plutonium. In April 2010, the United  States and Russia concluded a revised agreement laying the groundwork  for both countries to begin this process by 2018.", "The two other U.S. agencies that conduct major nuclear nonproliferation  programs and activities overseas are DOD and State. DOD administers the  CTR program, which has facilitated the removal of nuclear weapons from  Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan and has helped Russia and Ukraine  meet their arms control commitments by assisting in the elimination of  strategic delivery systems. CTR has also provided assistance to secure  Russian nuclear warheads, destroy the Russian chemical weapons  stockpile, reduce biological proliferation risks across the former Soviet  Union, and combat WMD smuggling in the region. The CTR program has  expanded its geographic scope in recent years, notably helping Albania  eliminate its chemical weapons.", "State manages its own nonproliferation programs, provides support to  NNSA and other U.S. agency nuclear nonproliferation programs working  overseas, and conducts bilateral and multilateral diplomacy to address  proliferation threats around the world under the Bureau of International  Security and Nonproliferation.

This effort draws  heavily on information from the Nuclear Materials Information Program  (NMIP), an interagency program whose details are classified that  organizes, consolidates, and assesses information from a range of U.S.  government agencies and sources on worldwide nuclear material  inventories, locations, and security status in an integrated and  continuously updated information management system. On the basis of  information from NMIP, nuclear material sites around the world were  placed in one of seven different categories:    sites in high-income countries with a relatively high degree of security;    sites now considered relatively secure based on prior assistance from the  MPC&A program and other U.S. nonproliferation assistance programs;   sites where MPC&A security upgrades have been made, but where residual  security concerns still remain;   sites to be addressed by the GTRI program for protection and/or removal  of nuclear materials, or conversion of facilities so they no longer require  HEU;   sites in countries that have been reluctant to relinquish their HEU for  shipment to more secure facilities in the United States or Russia;   a separate category for several specific countries where there are political  sensitivities and access limitations to working with the United States on  nuclear material security issues; and   sites in high-income countries with large nuclear industries where there  may be security vulnerabilities.", "According to the interagency strategy document for the 4-year nuclear  material security initiative, several hundred sites around the world were  determined to have significant amounts of nuclear material. While the  majority of these sites were determined to meet IAEA baseline security  guidelines, a large number of sites were determined to be most vulnerable.  NSC officials told us that a list of the most vulnerable sites, derived from  NMIP, is being used in planning for the 4-year nuclear material security  initiative. We received and reviewed information describing the NMIP  methodologies and criteria used to assess the security of nuclear material  storage sites. However, the interagency strategy document did not identify  the total universe of sites evaluated or the subset of sites determined to be  most vulnerable, and we did not obtain additional information specifying  or providing further details about these sites within the time frame of this  engagement.", "In a 2008 U.S. government report inventorying known facilities and sites  worldwide with nuclear weapons or formula quantities of strategic special  nuclear materials, which draws on information from NMIP, we found a  list of foreign nuclear material sites that could be within the scope of the 4- year effort.

For this reason, the scope of international facilities  with nuclear materials that are considered vulnerable is constantly  evolving. Furthermore, NSC officials also told us that they are taking a  broad view of what constitutes vulnerable nuclear material. Specifically,  they told us that any material that could be used in a nuclear explosive  device is inherently dangerous and that some weapon-usable materials  located in high-income countries could still be considered vulnerable and  within the scope of the President\u2019s initiative.", "In addition, it is unclear how the initiative intends to address foreign sites  with potentially vulnerable nuclear materials in cases where the host  countries have imposed access limitations that could complicate or  preclude security assessments and assistance. Some countries with  weapon-usable nuclear materials may resist nuclear security cooperation  with the United States, and U.S. programs may never be given access to  some foreign nuclear sites and facilities. For example, the Russian  government has refused to include in the scope of cooperation with NNSA  three major facilities in the closed nuclear cities of Lesnoy, Trekhgorny,  and Zarechny that are responsible for serial production of nuclear  weapons material. NNSA has not been provided access to and is not  anticipating conducting future MPC&A work at those locations.", "Finally, the criteria for determining when foreign nuclear material sites  can be considered secure remain vague. The interagency strategy  document for the initiative states that the goal of the effort is to ensure  that all nuclear material sites are secured at least to IAEA guidelines on  the \u201cPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities\u201d  (INFCIRC/225/Rev.4) and to integrate when and where possible the most  recent versions of these guidelines. However, NSC and NNSA officials  told us that nuclear material security is a long-term and evolving endeavor  that extends beyond making near-term improvements to nuclear material  sites, such as installing modern MPC&A systems. While near-term security  upgrades to nuclear material are important, NSC and NNSA officials both  told us\u2014and as we have previously reported\u2014that effective and lasting  nuclear material security requires working with other countries to adopt  effective security practices so they can sustain MPC&A systems on their  own; removing and consolidating nuclear materials to fewer, more secure  locations; converting facilities such as research reactors so they no longer  require weapon-usable materials; and ultimately eliminating nuclear  materials wherever possible."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "NNSA\u2019s Nuclear Security Programs Have Made Varying Levels of Progress in Russia and Face Challenges That Are Delaying Program Implementation and Could Increase Future Program Costs", "paragraphs": ["Three NNSA nuclear nonproliferation programs we reviewed\u2014the  MPC&A program, the nuclear Material Consolidation and Conversion  (MCC) program, and the GTRI program\u2014have made varying degrees of  progress in securing Russian nuclear warheads and materials.

Moreover,  the prospects and timelines for future shutdowns or actual conversions of  Russian HEU research reactors are unclear and contingent on Russian  government support, which we also believe is uncertain. As we noted in  our report, NNSA officials told us that completion of the implementing  agreement with Russia to allow for conversion feasibility studies on 6  Russian research reactors that was expected in early 2010 has been  delayed, the agreement would not constitute a Russian agreement to  actually convert any of its facilities, and any future conversion activities  beyond feasibility studies may require implementation of a U.S.-Russian  agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation.", "In addition, DOE and NNSA commented that some recent GTRI program  accomplishments were not addressed in our report. We have modified  language in our report to reflect those accomplishments.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretaries of Energy, State, and Defense; the  Administrator of NNSA; the Assistant to the President for National  Security Affairs; the Director of National Intelligence; and other interested  parties.

The Department of Defense  (DOD) and Department of State (State) did not develop comparable  written plans detailing how their programs would contribute to the 4-year  initiative. We interviewed National Security Council (NSC) officials on the  initiative, the April 2010 Nuclear Security Summit, and issues related to  broader national-level nuclear nonproliferation strategies and planning.  We also interviewed officials at NNSA, DOD, and State concerning their  contributions to the 4-year nuclear material security initiative. We also  interviewed officials from the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence (ODNI) and representatives of the intelligence community,  and reviewed documentation provided to us by ODNI, on issues and  threats related to worldwide nuclear material security.", "We focused our evaluation of the status of and challenges facing NNSA  nuclear security programs in Russia on three NNSA nuclear  nonproliferation programs working in that country\u2014the nuclear Material  Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) program; the nuclear  Material Consolidation and Conversion (MCC) program; and the Global  Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI). We selected these three programs  because they work directly on securing Russian nuclear warheads and  materials in place (MPC&A program), converting Russian highly enriched  uranium (HEU) to non-weapon-usable low-enriched uranium and  consolidating the number of Russian sites with HEU to fewer, more secure  locations (MCC program), or eliminating Russian use of HEU (GTRI  program). We did not address other NNSA nuclear nonproliferation  programs in Russia that are nearing completion (such as the Elimination  of Weapons Grade Plutonium Production program), have not yet initiated  significant programs of assistance to Russia (such as the program that will  assist Russia in the disposition of its excess weapon-grade plutonium), or  are indirectly related to nuclear warhead or material security (such as  nuclear smuggling detection or weapons of mass destruction scientist  reemployment programs).", "To evaluate the status of and challenges facing the efforts of these NNSA  nuclear security programs in Russia, we examined these issues in  interviews with the NNSA Administrator, senior officials in the NNSA  Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and the principal  nonproliferation program offices involved in nuclear material security  activities in Russia, including the Office of International Material  Protection and Cooperation, which implements the MPC&A and MCC  programs in Russia; the Office of Global Threat Reduction, which  administers the GTRI program to, among other things, facilitate  conversion of Russian research reactors and related facilities from use of  HEU to use of low-enriched uranium; the Office of Nuclear Risk  Reduction, which has facilitated the shutdown of Russia\u2019s last remaining  weapon-grade plutonium production reactors; and the Office of Fissile  Materials Disposition, which is working with Russia to eliminate  plutonium it has declared excess to defense needs.", "We reviewed documentation and analyzed information provided to us by  NNSA describing nuclear warhead and material security program efforts  and the challenges they face in Russia, including documentation on the  status of MPC&A upgrades at Russian nuclear warhead and material sites  and efforts to transition responsibility to Russia for sustaining MPC&A  over the long term.", "In addition, we obtained documentation from and interviewed senior  Russian officials who have worked with the NNSA nuclear  nonproliferation programs, including those from the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs; Russian State Corporation for Atomic Energy (Rosatom);  Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD); Russian Federal Customs Service;  and Russian Federal Service of Environmental, Technological, and  Nuclear Supervision (Rostekhnadzor), which provides oversight of  Russia\u2019s civilian nuclear facilities.", "We obtained and reviewed documentation from and interviewed U.S.  officials to assess NNSA\u2019s efforts to secure nuclear materials in countries  other than Russia. Specifically, we reviewed documentation provided by  NNSA and interviewed MPC&A program officials concerning nuclear  security program activities in China and India. We also interviewed DOD  officials on DOD\u2019s plans to work jointly with NNSA in developing nuclear  security centers of excellence in China and India. We analyzed relevant  information from and interviewed GTRI program officials concerning  program plans for foreign HEU removal and reactor conversion.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2009 to December 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
