To support relocations, agencies can use an Appraised Value Offer (AVO). Under an AVO, the relocation management company buys a relocating employee's home for its appraised value if it cannot be sold during a stated period of time. From fiscal years 2012 to 2016, use of AVO varied for federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). For example, in fiscal year 2012, the federal agencies that used GSA's contract spent over $66 million on 936 homes and in fiscal year 2016 they spent over $42 million on 601 homes.", "In response to GAO's questionnaire (which was not sent to VA), most of the 20 agencies that were using AVO identified the following two types of critical internal controls as part of their AVO policies. First are transaction control activities, which are actions built directly into operational processes to support the entity in achieving its objectives and addressing related risks. For example, 18 agencies reported that the AVO approval process must be complete before payments are made. Second is assessing and responding to misconduct risks by considering how misuse of authority or position can be used for personal gain. For example, 19 agencies reported that their AVO had safeguards to prevent it from being used for the personal gain of employees. An agency could require an independent review of its permanent change of station program.", "While none of the 20 agencies reported they had evaluated whether AVO improved recruitment and retention of employees, 12 of the 20 agencies provided examples of how AVO had been beneficial. For example, four agencies noted the use of AVO had helped them recruit the most qualified employees or assisted with hard-to-fill positions. GSA officials also identified six good practices based on lessons learned from their role, which includes managing the relocation contract that they believe agencies should incorporate into their AVO. When GAO compared these good practices to VA's AVO process, it found that all of these good practices had been adopted by VA. For example, VA offers pre-decision counseling and VA employees work with the relocation company before their home is put on the market.", "Since fiscal year 2016, VA has strengthened the administration of AVO by implementing new policies that include internal controls, but does not track data on whether AVO improves recruitment and retention. For example, VA revised its policies to require approval prior to initiating recruitment efforts and that a relocating employee's participation cannot be approved by the employee's subordinates. VA officials stated AVO is beneficial for hard-to-fill Senior Executive Service positions and for mission critical skills occupations, however, VA does not track data to determine whether AVO improves the recruitment and retention of employees. VA officials stated the agency does not have the resources or capabilities to track such data. These data could be useful in identifying trends and options for targeting certain occupations or skill sets that may improve the agency's use of home sales to support relocation. Without tracking these data, VA will be unable to determine whether AVO has improved recruitment and retention."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA track data to determine whether AVO improves recruitment and retention.

The justification must be based on the critical need for the position and  difficulty in recruiting for the position without offering AVO, substantiated  by recent unsuccessful recruitment efforts. This is a new policy since  2015, according to VA officials. The decision to use AVO is to be made by  the hiring manager in consultation with the human resource specialist.  The human resource specialist is to provide consultation to help  determine whether the position is designated as difficult to fill or will meet  a critical need. The job opportunity announcement is to clearly state  whether AVO is or is not authorized.

Specifically, this report (1) describes federal  agencies\u2019 and VA\u2019s use of AVO; (2) describes federal agencies\u2019 key AVO  internal controls, evaluations of whether AVO improved recruitment and  retention of employees, and lessons learned; and (3) analyzes the extent  to which VA has implemented additional internal controls for AVO since  2015 and has evaluated whether the use of AVO improved the  recruitment and retention of employees.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed federal statutes and regulations  related to relocation programs, conducted a literature review, and  reviewed our prior work on relocation and mission-critical skills. We  reviewed Title 5 of the U.S. Code related to relocation, including agency  authority, roles, and responsibilities in administering AVO. We also  reviewed the Federal Travel Regulation at Title 41 of the Code of Federal  Regulations, and VA\u2019s appropriations from fiscal years 2015 to 2017. We  also conducted a literature review to find reports and articles about VA  and federal use of AVO.", "We reviewed relevant documents from the General Services  Administration (GSA) and Office of Personnel Management and  interviewed officials from these agencies about their roles in agency use  of relocation programs generally and on AVO specifically. We reviewed  GSA\u2019s guidance on agency relocation programs. We also interviewed  GSA officials about their role managing the contract with relocation  management companies that federal agencies can use and about  providing agencies guidance and assistance in administering relocation  programs. In addition, we interviewed Office of Personnel Management  officials about their review and oversight role for agencies offering  relocation programs.", "To describe how federal agencies and VA use AVO, we reviewed  documents from VA and GSA and interviewed VA and GSA officials. We  reviewed data on AVO transactions completed through GSA\u2019s contract,  which includes VA, in fiscal years 2012 to 2016. According to GSA  officials, about 80 percent of federal agencies\u2019 home sale relocation  transactions occur through GSA\u2019s contract with relocation management  companies. GSA stated that the number of agencies that use its contract  for home sales can differ from year to year. In addition, we reviewed VA\u2019s  data on completed AVO transactions in fiscal years 2012 to 2016. To  assess the reliability of the GSA and VA data on completed AVO  transactions, we interviewed GSA and VA officials and reviewed related  documentation. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our objectives.", "To describe federal agencies\u2019 key AVO internal controls, evaluations of  effectiveness, and lessons learned, we developed a questionnaire. The  questionnaire is reprinted in appendix II. To develop the internal controls  section of the questionnaire (question 4), we used relevant federal  internal control standards and the internal control weaknesses in the  administration of relocation programs identified in the VA Inspector  General\u2019s 2015 report on misuse of relocation program funds. In  addition, we reviewed other agencies\u2019 inspector general reports on  weaknesses in the administration of their relocation programs to identify  key internal controls that would be relevant to the AVO process. We  created a list of key controls relevant to AVO and asked the agencies to  identify which internal controls they were using. We modified the list in  response to feedback from pretests of our questionnaire.", "After we drafted the questionnaire, we conducted pre-tests on the phone  with two officials from agencies that had used AVO but did not use GSA\u2019s  contract with relocation management companies, as well as an official  from GSA who was familiar with how agencies manage their AVO utilizing  the contract. We conducted these tests with officials familiar with the AVO  process to check that (1) the questions were clear and unambiguous, (2)  terminology was used correctly, (3) the questionnaire did not place an  undue burden on agency officials, (4) the information could feasibly be  obtained, and (5) the questionnaire was comprehensive and unbiased.  We made changes to the content of the questionnaire after the three pre- tests, based on the feedback we received.", "We distributed the questionnaire we developed via email to the 28  agencies or components of agencies with completed home sale  transactions through GSA\u2019s contract in fiscal year 2015 or 2016. We did  not include VA when distributing the questionnaire. We selected this set  of agencies for distribution of the questionnaire to remain consistent with  our reporting of federal agencies\u2019 spending on AVO through GSA\u2019s  contract. We emailed the questionnaire to recipients as a Word  attachment on January 9, 2017. We sent reminder emails to and called  non-respondents. We also emailed secondary points of contact where  available at non-responsive agencies. We closed the questionnaire on  March 10, 2017. Twenty-four of 28 agencies completed the questionnaire,  20 of which had an operational AVO, which we interpreted to mean that  AVO was being offered at the agency. Thus, we report on the 20  agencies\u2019 responses to the questionnaire. We characterize the responses  to the questionnaire as \u201cmost\u201d when 12 to 19 agencies responded the  same way. All questionnaire data were double key-entered into an  electronic file in batches and were 100 percent verified. All data in the  electronic file were verified again for completeness and accuracy.", "To assess the extent to which VA has implemented additional internal  controls since 2015 and has evaluated whether the use of AVO has  improved the recruitment and retention of employees, we analyzed  documents from VA and interviewed VA officials. We assessed VA\u2019s  controls and evaluations using federal internal control standards. We  reviewed VA human resources and financial policy documents about the  administration of AVO with a focus on what changes had been made  since fiscal year 2015. We interviewed VA officials who administer AVO  about these changes and additional changes that are planned. We also  reviewed the 2015 VA Inspector General report on relocation programs and a 2016 review of VA\u2019s Permanent Change of Station program.
