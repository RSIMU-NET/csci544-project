As a result of the hurricane and its aftermath, many children experienced psychological trauma, which can have long-lasting effects. Experts have previously identified barriers to providing and obtaining mental health services for children. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal agencies have supported mental health services for children in greater New Orleans through various programs, including grant programs initiated in response to Hurricane Katrina. GAO was asked to study the federal role in addressing barriers to these services in greater New Orleans. In this report, GAO (1) identifies barriers to providing and to obtaining mental health services for children in greater New Orleans, and (2) describes how federal programs, including grant programs, address such barriers. To do this work, GAO used a structured interview and a written data collection instrument to gather views on barriers from 18 state and local stakeholder organizations selected on the basis of experts' referrals and the organizations' roles in children's mental health. To learn how federal programs address these barriers, GAO reviewed documents from and interviewed federal, state, and local officials involved in providing mental health services to children. GAO's work included a site visit to greater New Orleans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholder organizations most frequently identified a lack of mental health providers and sustainability of funding as barriers to providing mental health services to children in the greater New Orleans area; they most frequently identified a lack of transportation, competing family priorities, and concern regarding stigma as barriers to families' obtaining services for children. Fifteen of the 18 organizations identified a lack of mental health providers--including challenges recruiting and retaining child psychiatrists and psychologists--as a barrier to providing services to children. Thirteen organizations identified sustainability of funding, including difficulty securing reliable funding sources, as a barrier to providing services. A lack of transportation was most frequently identified--by 12 organizations--as a barrier to families' ability to obtain services for their children. The two second most frequently identified barriers to obtaining services were competing family priorities, such as housing problems and financial concerns, and concern regarding the stigma associated with receiving mental health services. A range of federal programs, including grant programs, address some of the most frequently identified barriers to providing and obtaining mental health services for children, but much of the funding they have supplied is temporary. Several federal programs support state and local efforts to hire or train mental health providers. For example, HHS's Professional Workforce Supply Grant has resulted in recruitment and retention incentives to mental health providers in the greater New Orleans area. Several HHS programs allow funding to be used to transport children to mental health services, including Medicaid and the 2006 Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) supplemental funding provided to Louisiana. However, much of the funding, including that from the Professional Workforce Supply Grant and the supplemental SSBG, is hurricane-related and will no longer be available after 2010. School-based health centers (SBHC) have emerged as a key approach in the area to address barriers to obtaining mental health services for children, and although there is no federal program whose specific purpose is to support SBHCs, state programs have used various federal funding sources to support them. For example, a Louisiana official told us funds from HHS's Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant and Community Mental Health Services Block Grant support SBHCs in greater New Orleans. SBHCs address the transportation barrier because they are located on school grounds, and they help families by reducing the need for a parent to take time off from work to take a child to appointments. In addition, because SBHCs provide both mental health and other primary care services, the type of service a child receives is not apparent to an observer, which may reduce concern about stigma. In commenting on a draft of this report, HHS provided additional information on mental health services provided in schools other than through SBHCs and emphasized the effect of a lack of stable housing on children's mental health. HHS also provided technical comments. GAO incorporated HHS's comments as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The greater New Orleans area has yet to fully recover from the effects of  Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall on August 29, 2005. One issue of  concern with regard to the rebuilding effort is the availability of mental  health services for children. We estimate that in 2008 about 187,000  children were living in the greater New Orleans area\u2014which we defined as  Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard parishes. Many of these  children experienced psychological trauma as a result of Hurricane  Katrina and its aftermath, and studies have shown that such trauma can  have long-lasting behavioral, psychological, and emotional effects on  children. Experts have found increases in the incidence of depression,  post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, risk-taking behavior, and  somatic and psychosomatic conditions in children who experienced the  effects of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, children in the greater New  Orleans area may continue to experience psychological trauma because of  the slow recovery of stable housing and other factors, such as the  recurring threat of hurricanes. Data collected by Louisiana State  University (LSU) Health Sciences Center researchers have indicated that a  substantial number of these children may need referrals for mental health  services.", "Hurricane Katrina devastated the health care system in the greater New  Orleans area, resulting in the closure of many area hospitals and clinics,  including Charity and University hospitals, which provided outpatient  services through clinics in addition to inpatient services. These hospitals,  which were part of the statewide LSU public hospital system, had been the  main points of entry for many low-income and uninsured children and  families to gain access to health care services. In November 2006, LSU  reopened University Hospital under its new, temporary name, Interim LSU  Public Hospital, which is operating at a lower capacity than Charity\u2019s and  University\u2019s pre-Katrina capacity; Charity Hospital remained closed as of  June 2009.", "Experts have previously identified barriers both to providing and to  obtaining mental health services for children, such as a lack of providers  or concerns regarding the stigma often associated with mental health  services. The current state of the health care system in greater New  Orleans may have exacerbated some of these barriers. Since Hurricane  Katrina, the federal government has directed over $400 million toward  restoring health services, including mental health services for children, in  Louisiana and the greater New Orleans area. Other federal funding, not  targeted to Katrina recovery, also supports the delivery of children\u2019s  mental health services. For example, the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), Department of Education (Education), and Department of  Justice (DOJ) have programs, including grant programs, that support  mental health services for children in the greater New Orleans area. These  programs provide funding through annual formula grants\u2014 noncompetitive awards based on a predetermined formula\u2014to Louisiana  and through various discretionary grants to state and local agencies and  nongovernmental organizations.", "You asked us to study the federal role in addressing barriers to mental  health services for children in the greater New Orleans area.

To develop these tools, we reviewed relevant data and  literature and conducted interviews with subject-matter experts  knowledgeable about mental health services for children in the greater  New Orleans area to identify known barriers to mental health services for  children. We selected 18 state and local stakeholder organizations to  participate in our structured interviews and DCI based on referrals from  subject-matter experts and knowledge of the organizations\u2019 roles related  to children\u2019s mental health services in greater New Orleans. Each  represented at least one of the following types of organizations: state  government agency; local government agency; school district; mental  health provider organization; nonprofit organization, including faith-based  organizations; and social service or juvenile justice organization.", "In our structured interviews, we asked open-ended questions to gather the  18 stakeholder organizations\u2019 views concerning barriers, using a  combination of in-person and telephone contacts with representatives  from each organization. Specifically, we asked the representatives of each  organization, as a group, to identify the three greatest barriers to providing  and the three greatest barriers to obtaining mental health services for  children. At the conclusion of each structured interview, we administered  the DCI to collect the views of each representative about the current  barriers to mental health services for children in a standardized way, using  a scale to assess whether the barriers had increased or decreased since  Hurricane Katrina. In our analysis of the DCI, we aggregated the  representatives\u2019 responses to develop an overall response for each  organization. Because the 18 organizations were not selected by random  sample, their views cannot be generalized to all organizations or  individuals working in the field of children\u2019s mental health services in the  greater New Orleans area.", "We obtained data from HHS\u2019s Health Resources and Services  Administration (HRSA) and the Greater New Orleans Community Data  Center to provide context for the information we collected on barriers. We  used parish-level data and national comparison data on the pre- and post- Katrina numbers of pediatricians and psychiatrists from the Area Resource  File (ARF), which is maintained by HRSA. The ARF is a county-based  health resources database that contains data from many sources, including  the U.S. Census Bureau and the American Medical Association. To assess  the reliability of the ARF data elements that we used in our analysis, we  performed checks, such as examining the data for missing values, and  reviewed related documentation. In addition to the ARF data, we used  education and housing data maintained by the Greater New Orleans  Community Data Center, a nonprofit organization that compiles data from  sources such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) and the Louisiana Department of Education. We interviewed  knowledgeable Community Data Center officials about the steps they took  to ensure the quality of their data.

Although this was a decrease from the 49 percent  level during the 2005-06 school year screening, the rate of decline was  slower than experts had expected. The LSU Health Sciences Center lead  researcher we spoke with interpreted this slower-than-expected decline as  indicating that the mental health needs of children in the greater New  Orleans area continue to be significant. The effects of a traumatic event  can persist for years.

As of October 2008, HRSA\u2019s Bureau of  Clinician Recruitment and Service, which provides student loan repayment  and scholarships to providers serving in designated HPSAs, was  supporting 7 mental health professionals in the greater New Orleans  area\u20144 social workers, 2 psychologists, and 1 child psychiatrist.", "A few federal programs support training of children\u2019s mental health  providers, which helps address a lack of providers trained in children\u2019s  mental health, which was identified as a barrier in our structured  interviews. SAMHSA\u2019s National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative awarded  two grants in October 2008 to providers in the greater New Orleans area to  provide training on, implement, and evaluate trauma-focused treatment for  children. For example, providers in the greater New Orleans area were  trained on various trauma-related interventions, which included evidence- based practices that are delivered in schools. In addition, the Children\u2019s  Health Fund Community Support and Resiliency Program, whose funding  from SAMHSA expires in September 2009, provides comprehensive  training and technical assistance on the assessment and treatment of  trauma in children for medical, mental health, education, and child care  professionals in the greater New Orleans area.", "Lack of transportation. Although none of the federal programs included  in our review are designed solely to provide transportation for children  obtaining mental health services, officials we interviewed told us that  funding from several federal programs has been used in that way. For  example, Louisiana designated $150,000 in the fiscal year 2009 Community  Mental Health Services Block Grant state plan for transportation for  children in the greater New Orleans area, and funding from ACF\u2019s 2006  SSBG supplemental grant and SAMHSA\u2019s Child Mental Health Initiative  has also been used to supply transportation to mental health appointments  for children. Louisiana Medicaid officials told us that the Louisiana  Medicaid program provides reimbursement for nonemergency, previously  authorized transportation for enrolled children for any Medicaid-covered  service and for medical emergencies, including transportation to inpatient  mental health facilities. Louisiana Medicaid also provides reimbursement  to family or friends who provide medically necessary transportation for  Medicaid enrollees and provides reimbursement for home- or community- based treatment, which can reduce the need for transportation to provider  offices. SAMHSA\u2019s National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative has two  grantees in the greater New Orleans area that provide trauma-focused  mental health services to children in schools, which can also reduce the  need for transportation to provider offices. For example, an official from  one grantee told us they have provided mental health services to children  who live in the more rural sections of the greater New Orleans area, for  whom travel time to services could be a significant barrier to obtaining  care.", "Competing family priorities. Federal programs provide funding that is  used to alleviate conditions that create competing family priorities\u2014 including dealing with housing problems, unemployment, and financial  concerns\u2014to help families more easily obtain children\u2019s mental health  services. Federal programs address competing priorities, in part, by  providing case management, information, and referral services, which  can help families identify and obtain services such as health care, housing  assistance, and employment assistance. For example, the 2006 SSBG  supplemental funding supported over 25,000 case management services to  children in Louisiana from July 2006 through September 2008. In  addition, officials from a local organization that received funding from  ACF\u2019s Head Start told us that the program had provided families with  information and referrals for mental health services. HUD\u2019s and FEMA\u2019s  Disaster Housing Assistance Program provided case management services,  which included social services such as job training and referrals for mental  health services, in addition to rental assistance to certain families  displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The program ended on   March 1, 2009, but program clients in Louisiana will continue to receive  services through a transitional program through August 31, 2009.", "Federal programs also address competing family priorities by providing  direct financial assistance, which may help alleviate family stress and  make it easier for families to devote resources and effort to obtaining  mental health services for their children. For example, the Metropolitan  Human Services District uses federal funding from the Community Mental  Health Services Block Grant to give financial assistance for utilities, rent,  and school uniforms to families of children who have certain mental  health disorders, or to provide family stabilization services to help keep  these children in their homes. In addition, the Louisiana state program that  uses the SAMHSA Child Mental Health Initiative grant provides time- limited funding for tutoring, school uniforms, and other expenses when  they are a part of an individualized service plan for children with  diagnosed mental health disorders.", "Concern regarding stigma. An official from one of the National Child  Traumatic Stress Initiative grantees in the greater New Orleans area told  us that because school systems they have worked with have integrated the  delivery of mental health services into the schools, the stigma associated  with mental health services has decreased. In addition, some federal  programs support the provision of education services, which the  President\u2019s New Freedom Commission on Mental health reported can  reduce stigma associated with mental health services. For example, in  2008 FEMA\u2019s and SAMHSA\u2019s CCP program provided information about  counseling services through a media campaign that included billboards,  television commercials, and print and radio advertisements. SAMHSA\u2019s  State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention Grants provided suicide prevention  and education services through a 2007 media campaign that included  busboards, radio public service announcements, and print advertisements  throughout the greater New Orleans area.", "Sustainability of funding. Although most of the federal programs we  identified were not established as a direct result of Hurricane Katrina, the  programs that are hurricane-related have been an important source of  support for mental health services for children in the greater New Orleans  area. However, much of this funding is temporary. For example, three  hurricane-related grant programs\u2014CMS\u2019s PCASG and Professional  Workforce Supply Grant and ACF\u2019s 2006 SSBG supplemental funding\u2014 will no longer be available to grantees after 2010. Although the PCASG was  created with the expectation that providing short-term financial relief  would significantly increase the likelihood of the PCASG fund recipients\u2019  sustainability, and PCASG recipients were required to prepare  sustainability strategies as part of their application, it is too early to know  whether these organizations will achieve sustainability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Louisiana Has Used Federal Programs to Help Support School-Based Health Centers, Which Have Emerged as a Key Approach to Addressing Transportation and Other Barriers", "paragraphs": ["Since Hurricane Katrina, the number of SBHCs in the greater New Orleans  area has increased. At the start of the 2005-06 school year, there were  seven SBHCs providing mental health and other primary care services to  children in the greater New Orleans area. Most of these SBHCs were  closed as a result of damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the  ones that remained open had also sustained damage. During the 2007-08  school year, there were nine SBHCs in the greater New Orleans area, and  state officials told us in February 2009 that at least four more SBHCs were  in the planning stages for this area.", "Louisiana\u2019s SBHCs receive their funding from several sources. The LDHH  Office of Public Health, which oversees SBHCs in the state, provides some  state funding. There is no federal program whose specific purpose is to  support SBHCs, but LDHH and local providers have used funding from  various federal sources to support SBHCs. For example, a state official  told us that the Office of Public Health has used a small portion of LDHH\u2019s  annual Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant from HRSA to  support SBHCs. Some organizations that support SBHCs in the greater  New Orleans area have also received temporary funding, such as from the  PCASG and the hurricane-related SSBG supplemental funding. In addition,  the Jefferson Parish Human Services Authority, which provides mental  health services at SBHCs, has received funding allocated by LDHH\u2019s Office  of Mental Health from SAMHSA\u2019s Community Mental Health Services  Block Grant. Furthermore, providers at some SBHCs told us they could  receive Medicaid reimbursement for some mental health services,  including those related to psychiatric care. State officials told us that  although CMS permitted the reimbursement of social work services  provided at SBHCs, the Louisiana Medicaid program had not provided  reimbursement for social work services because of state funding  constraints. Some SBHCs may also obtain funding from nonprofit  organizations. For example, grant funding from the W.K. Kellogg  Foundation was significant in the rebuilding and expansion of SBHCs after  Hurricane Katrina.", "Because Louisiana requires SBHCs to have mental health staff on-site,  SBHCs can be an access point for children who need mental health  services in the greater New Orleans area. Furthermore, some SBHCs in the  area have a psychiatrist on staff on a part-time basis. During the 2007-08  school year, the need for mental health services was the primary reason  for almost one-quarter of students\u2019 visits to SBHCs in the greater New  Orleans area. In addition, SBHC health care providers told us that  students who visited the SBHCs for other reasons may have also received  mental health services.", "SBHCs in the greater New Orleans area have emerged as a key approach  to addressing the top three barriers to obtaining services identified in our  structured interviews\u2014a lack of transportation, competing family  priorities, and concern regarding stigma. SBHCs are generally located in  schools or on school grounds, which reduces students\u2019 need for  transportation to obtain care. The SBHCs in Jefferson Parish serve  students on multiple school campuses, and students in schools not  colocated with an SBHC can be transported when necessary. SBHC  services may be provided at low or no cost to the patient, which lessens  the financial burden on the family. The location of SBHCs in schools or on  school grounds also reduces the need for a parent to take time off from  work to accompany a child to appointments. In addition, colocation of  mental health and other primary care services may reduce concern  regarding stigma because the type of service the child is receiving at the  SBHC is generally not apparent to an observer. One SBHC provider told us  that offering mental health services in the same location as other primary  care services \u201cdemystifies\u201d mental health services and eliminates the  perception that they are separate from primary care services.", "Officials at SBHCs told us they were working to obtain additional funding  to help achieve long-term sustainability of the clinics. Officials from the  Metropolitan Human Services District told us that it would not be possible  for every school to have an SBHC, but that they were working on an  initiative with other local organizations and school districts to develop a  \u201chub\u201d system to deliver health care services, including mental health  services, to children in the greater New Orleans area. Under the planned  pilot program, individual SBHCs or other community clinics would  become hub clinics that would serve 10 feeder schools, 6 of which would  be served by 2 mental health providers funded by the Metropolitan Human  Services District, and 4 of which would be served by mental health  providers funded by other organizations. Children needing services  beyond those provided by their school mental health provider or nurse  could be referred to the hub clinic. Officials planned to begin hiring school  nurses and mental health providers for the feeder schools by July 2009."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS and Education for their review.  HHS provided comments on two key issues. HHS\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix IV and discussed below. In addition, both HHS and  Education provided technical comments. We incorporated HHS and  Education comments as appropriate.", "In its comments, HHS stated that our draft report focused too heavily on  SBHCs, to the exclusion of other models of care. HHS noted that the  school systems in the greater New Orleans area have been very receptive  to the direct provision of mental health services in schools, because of the  psychological difficulties experienced by school children due to distress  related to Hurricane Katrina. HHS supplied additional information on  SAMHSA\u2019s National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative\u2019s two grantees in the  greater New Orleans area, which provide mental health services in  schools. We highlighted SBHCs in our draft report because they have  emerged as a key approach to serving children in the greater New Orleans  area, due in part to the state\u2019s use of federal funds to support this model of  care. Our discussion of SBHCs in the greater New Orleans area is not  intended to imply that they are the only model for providing school-based  mental health services to children, and we have added additional  information to our report on the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative  grantees. HHS also commented that many SBHCs do not provide mental  health services, and that those that do provide them may not have staff  who can provide more intensive services. However, as our draft indicated,  all SBHCs in Louisiana are required to have a mental health provider on  staff and therefore can be a valuable resource for children seeking mental  health services. We have also added information to the report indicating  that some SBHCs in the greater New Orleans area have a psychiatrist on  staff on a part-time basis.", "HHS commented that our draft report minimized housing problems faced  by children and families in the greater New Orleans area in our discussion  of barriers to obtaining mental health services; HHS also stated that the  lack of stable housing in the area is one of the greatest barriers to  children\u2019s mental health recovery. We disagree that the draft report  minimized the role of housing problems. Our findings were based on  barriers identified by stakeholders, who described what they believed to  be the greatest barriers to families obtaining mental health services for  children. The draft report included information related to housing  problems in greater New Orleans in our discussion of competing family  priorities, which tied as the second most frequently identified barrier to  obtaining mental health services for children. However, we added  information to the report to emphasize that housing problems may affect  children\u2019s mental health.", "In its comments, HHS also provided additional information on SAMHSA\u2019s  Child Mental Health Initiative, which we have incorporated as appropriate.
