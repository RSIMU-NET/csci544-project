The Dark Web contains content that has been intentionally concealed and requires specific computer software to gain access. ATF created the Internet Investigations Center (Center) to investigate buyers and sellers who use the Internet to facilitate illegal firearms transactions. The Center uses several tools to provide investigative support to ATF, which has resulted in the arrests of individuals using the Internet to facilitate illegal firearm purchases.

The GCA requires that FFLs maintain records of all their gun  sales. These records are used, among other purposes, to trace a firearm  recovered by law-enforcement officials from its first sale by the  manufacturer or importer through the distribution chain to the first retail  purchaser, in order to provide law-enforcement agencies with  investigative leads.", "As amended by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, the GCA  generally requires FFLs to contact the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal  Background Check System (NICS) prior to transferring a firearm to a  nonlicensed individual. During a NICS background check, the buyer  provides the FFL with appropriate identification, such as a valid driver\u2019s  license. The FFL submits descriptive data, including the buyer\u2019s name  and date of birth, to NICS, which searches three national databases  containing criminal history and other relevant records to determine  whether federal or state law prohibits the person from receiving or  possessing a firearm. The transfer may proceed if NICS informs the FFL  that it has no information indicating that the transfer would be in violation  of law, or if 3 business days have elapsed without notification that the  transfer would violate the law. The GCA prohibits individuals from  knowingly making a false statement intended to deceive FFLs with  respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale, such as a  person claiming that he or she is the actual buyer of a firearm and not  acquiring the firearm on behalf of another person, when in fact he or she  is purchasing the firearm with the intent to transfer it to a prohibited  person. This type of transaction is often referred to as a \u201cstraw purchase.\u201d", "In addition, the GCA establishes the categories of persons generally  prohibited from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms  and ammunition. Specifically, persons are prohibited from shipping,  transporting, receiving, or possessing a firearm if they (1) have been  convicted of a felony; (2) are a fugitive from justice; (3) are an unlawful  user of or addicted to any controlled substance; (4) have been committed  to a mental institution or judged to be mentally defective; (5) are aliens  illegally or unlawfully in the United States, or certain other aliens admitted  under a nonimmigrant visa; (6) have been dishonorably discharged from  the military; (7) have renounced their U.S. citizenship; (8) are under a  qualifying domestic violence restraining order; or (9) have been convicted  of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.

For example, a transaction between unlicensed  individuals would be illegal if the seller knows or has reasonable cause to  believe that the buyer is legally prohibited from possessing firearms or is  a resident of a different state than the seller. If the seller is not aware of  these circumstances, the seller may transfer the firearm to the buyer  without any record-keeping or background-check requirements.", "Nonprohibited, nonlicensed individuals may legally purchase firearms  through an FFL or through individual private sales with residents of the  same state. Regardless of whether an FFL is involved in an Internet- facilitated firearm purchase, if a seller knows or has a reasonable cause  to believe that the prospective recipient is prohibited from possessing  firearms, the seller must not transfer the firearm. See figure 1.", "As outlined in figure 1, the Internet can facilitate legal purchases either  through FFLs or through nonlicensed private sellers. For purchases  through an FFL, an individual orders a firearm online, and generally  completes the transaction process in person. The FFL submits the  required paperwork to ATF. A background check is processed directly by  NICS or through a state government that checks NICS. Unless denied by  the background check, the transaction is completed. If the individual is  purchasing the firearm from an FFL in another state, the original FFL will  transfer the firearm to an FFL in the state the buyer resides in to complete  the transaction. If both the buyer and seller are residents of the same  state, transfers between private nonlicensed parties facilitated by the  Internet without the involvement of an FFL may be lawful. The firearm  may be transferred in person between the buyer and the seller, or, if the  firearm is a shotgun or rifle, it may be mailed intrastate between the  individuals. The seller has no record-keeping obligations, and no NICS  background check is performed on the buyer. However, a nonlicensed  individual is usually prohibited from directly transferring a firearm to a  person who the transferor knows or had reasonable cause to believe is  residing in another state. In addition, it is usually illegal for any  nonlicensed individual to transport into or receive in the state where he  resides any firearm purchased or otherwise obtained outside that state.  Therefore, interstate transactions between two nonlicensed individuals  are likely to be illegal unless an FFL becomes a party to the transaction.  For a legal transaction between residents of different states, the seller  must send the firearm to an FFL in the buyer\u2019s state.

Major retailers with a federal firearms license enable customers  to browse available firearms on their websites but require transactions to  be made in person at the store. Online retailers with a federal firearms  license advertise firearms online and transfer the firearm to the purchaser  through either a storefront that qualifies as an FFL or another FFL in the  buyer\u2019s state. Online auction and marketplace websites, online  classifieds, and online forums also facilitate sales between buyers and  both licensed and nonlicensed sellers.

The Center has access to a  variety of tools to facilitate Internet investigations. Much of the Center\u2019s  software that is used to analyze online content for investigations is free  and open source. For example, according to ATF officials, using free  open-source software allows analysts to glean information from public  websites without violating users\u2019 privacy rights.", "ATF officials stated that the Center investigates buyers and sellers who  use the Internet to facilitate illegal firearms transactions. The officials with  the Center noted that these investigations are generally reactive, meaning  that the Center initiates them after receiving a tip or a request from a field  agent. For example, in November 2014 the Center received a tip from a  person who was selling firearms on an online firearms marketplace and  was suspicious of a prospective buyer attempting to obtain a pistol  without involving an FFL. The Center identified the prospective buyer and  engaged in an undercover operation in which the individual agreed to  provide the undercover agent with components designed to turn pistols  and rifles into fully automatic firearms in exchange for a pistol and cash.  The undercover agent and the buyer met in person and completed the  transaction. ATF agents arrested the buyer at the scene, and he was later  sentenced to 33 months in prison.", "ATF officials said the agency frequently receives tips about nonlicensed  sellers engaging in the business of firearms. For example, ATF  investigated a nonlicensed seller who posted more than 280 firearms for  sale on multiple online firearms marketplaces; purchased at least 54  firearms; and sold at least 51 firearms at a profit. The seller, who was also  found to have made straw purchases for other buyers, was sentenced in  August 2010 to 2 years in prison. For additional examples of ATF  enforcement actions involving sales facilitated by the Internet, please see  appendix II.", "According to ATF officials, the Center also performs investigative work on  the Dark Web, which requires knowledge of the Internet and investigative  techniques. For example, ATF analysts must understand virtual currency,  such as Bitcoin values. They must also know what sellers are charging for  their products, because prices on the Dark Web \u201cskyrocket\u201d due to the  criminal nature of the merchandise. In addition, the analysts learn  common terms associated with firearm culture, in order to communicate  with users engaged in criminal activity.", "ATF officials with the Center also noted that investigations might involve  both the Surface Web and the Dark Web. For example, to identify an  anonymous user on the Dark Web, the Center works to establish the  user\u2019s \u201cdigital footprint\u201d on the Surface Web. In some cases, users might  conduct illegal activity on the Dark Web but might then go to the Surface  Web, such as a social-networking website with chat forums on a wide  variety of topics, and discuss their illegal activity. From there, analysts  can link the user to other social-media accounts, where the user may post  a photo showing a street sign or other characteristics to help investigators  narrow the user\u2019s location.

For example, in one attempt, the agent conducted investigative  research on the seller and found evidence suggesting that the seller may  be involved in online fraud. As a result, the agent did not follow through  with the purchase attempt. ATF does not have jurisdiction over fraud  cases so, when it encounters such circumstances, the agency may refer  the case to the Joint Support and Operations Center or to local or state  law-enforcement agencies or may encourage the victim to file a police  report.

In both Dark Web and Surface Web  testing, the agents contacted sellers that posted ads online, and  attempted to complete firearm purchases. For our testing, we did not  proactively attempt to purchase firearms from Federal Firearm Licensees  (FFL), focusing our efforts on private sellers. We counted an attempt as  successful if we received a firearm. We counted an attempt as a failure if  we contacted the seller and expressed interest in purchasing the  advertised firearm and the seller refused to complete the purchase, or if  the seller failed to respond after initial contact was made. In some  instances on the Surface Web, after we contacted a seller and described  our prohibited status, we were \u201cbanned,\u201d or prohibited from accessing the  gun forum or classified ad website. Additionally, in two instances, our  agents were apparently \u201cscammed\u201d in that we remitted payment for a  firearm we did not receive, or our agents otherwise identified indicators  that the firearm would not be shipped.

The scenarios  involved overtly explaining why our agent was prohibited from possessing  a firearm. The scenarios based on the GCA covered the following: a felon avoiding a background check, an individual with a domestic-violence background or a restraining  order against him or her, an individual who unlawfully uses controlled substances (or is an an individual who was dishonorably discharged from the military, and an individual who has renounced his or her citizenship or is otherwise  an unlawful alien.", "Before we began testing, we determined that we would run each scenario  iteratively until we successfully completed a purchase, we exhausted the  number of applicable ads, or we capped out our predetermined cap of 15  purchase attempts, with a total of 75 attempts to be made in total.

The Center identified the  prospective buyer as a convicted felon. The individual agreed to  provide the undercover agent with a Glock auto sear\u2014which, when  attached to a firearm makes it a fully automatic weapon\u2014and firearm  components that could be used to transform an M-16 style rifle into a  machine gun. In exchange, the undercover agent would provide the  individual with a Glock pistol and $300 cash. The individual and an  undercover agent completed the transaction and the individual was  immediately arrested.

He posted at least 280 firearms for sale on a  legitimate firearm website, some of which were multiple listings of the  same item in the event that interested bidders did not meet his target  price. During this period, he purchased at least 54 firearms and sold  at least 51 firearms. He profited from all the sales, collecting more  than $118,000 in gross receipts. The individual was also indicted on  four counts of causing a firearms dealer to maintain false records,  which related to his purchasing firearms for third parties (straw  purchases). In addition, the individual was indicted on one count of  providing ATF with a false document listing the firearms he bought  and sold; agents recovered a more-extensive and more-descriptive  list.
