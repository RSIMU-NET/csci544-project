During this delay, based on data in the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), 42 sole-source 8(a) contracts with reported values over $20 million, totaling over $2.3 billion, were awarded without being subject to a justification.

Of the 14 sole-source 8(a) contracts awarded since the FAR was revised, only three included an 8(a) justification. The agencies awarding the remaining 11 contracts did not comply, either because contracting officials were not aware of the justification requirement or because they were confused about what the FAR required. For example, contracting officials were confused in one instance where another justification was already in place that covered multiple contracts. Further, the Small Business Administration (SBA) cannot accept a contract over $20 million for negotiation under the 8(a) program unless the procuring agency has completed a justification, but GAO found that SBA did not have a process in place to confirm the presence of a justification."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OFPP issue guidance to clarify the circumstances in which an 8(a) justification is required.

We used the Base  and All Options data element in FPDS-NG to identify relevant contracts  awarded during this period. We took several steps to assess data  reliability, including reviewing seven contracts identified as valued  between $19.5 million and $20 million to confirm that they were not  subject to the new justification requirement. We determined that the  federal procurement data for this period was sufficiently reliable to identify  contracts that exceeded the $20 million threshold. To assess agencies\u2019  implementation of the new justification requirements, we reviewed all 14  sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20 million awarded since the FAR  incorporated the new justification requirements in March 2011. Eleven of  these contracts were identified using the Base and All Options field in  FPDS-NG. To compensate for any errors in these data, we also  calculated cumulative obligations for all 8(a) sole-source contracts  awarded during this period and identified one additional contract that had  an anticipated value of over $20 million at the time of award. Two  additional contracts were identified in the course of our review. Eight of  the 14 contracts were awarded by the Department of Defense (DOD), and  the remaining six were awarded by the General Services Administration  and the Departments of the Interior, Justice, and State.

Likewise, a contracting officer at the Army Contracting Command,  realizing that 8(a) sole-source contracts now require a justification,  prepared a CICA justification instead of an 8(a) justification.

A  class justification generally covers multiple contracts within a program or  sets of programs. This contract was awarded by Interior on behalf of a  DOD program office that had a class CICA justification in place, which  permitted the award of sole-source contracts to support the program\u2019s  work. Contracting officials for this contract were unsure whether the class  justification would preclude the need for a separate 8(a) justification for  this sole-source contract award. The FAR only states that contracting  officers must ensure that each contract action taken under the authority of  the class justification is within its scope; it does not address whether a  separate 8(a) justification would be required in this situation.", "This contract illustrates another source of confusion\u2014how to proceed  when the anticipated value of a contract changes during negotiation,  which happens between SBA\u2019s acceptance of the procurement and  contract award. The FAR requires an 8(a) justification at two points: before SBA can accept the contract for negotiation under the 8(a) at time of contract award.", "The potential for confusion arises because a contract\u2019s value can change  during the negotiation process, and the FAR does not address scenarios  in which anticipated contract values rise above or fall below the $20  million threshold between SBA\u2019s acceptance of the procurement for  negotiation and the award of the contract. For the contract awarded by  the Department of the Interior, at the time SBA accepted the  procurement, the anticipated value was slightly under the $20 million  threshold. However, by the time the contract was awarded, estimated  costs had increased to $21.4 million. We also reviewed a DOD contract  that illustrates the opposite situation, but which was not required to have  an 8(a) justification because the offer letter was sent before the  requirement was implemented in the FAR.

Generally, agencies may not modify contracts to add  products or services not anticipated in the original scope without a  separate sole-source justification. In some cases, however, agencies  have determined that the flexibilities of 8(a) sole-source contracts  awarded to firms owned by ANCs or Indian tribes allowed them to make  such modifications without preparing a justification. For example, in our  2006 report on 8(a) contracting, we found that the Department of Energy  had added a number of new types of work to a contract, nearly tripling the  value, and the contracting officer cited the flexibilities of the 8(a) sole- source contract awarded to an ANC-owned firm as the reason he was  able to do so.   We did not identify any such modifications in our present  review; however, some contracting officials told us that it was not clear to  them if a justification would be required for modifications to 8(a) sole- source contracts.

Include instructions to confirm that procuring agencies have prepared  an 8(a) justification rather than a CICA justification.", "To help ensure that federal procurement data provides accurate and  complete information, we recommend that the Administrator of the  General Services Administration implement controls in FPDS-NG to  preclude agency officials from entering a value of zero dollars for the  Base and All Options data element when the initial award of a contract is  entered into the database."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SBA, OFPP, GSA, and the  departments of Defense, the Interior, Justice, and State. We received  written comments from SBA, which are reproduced in appendix III. SBA  did not fully address our recommendations. In email responses, OFPP  and GSA generally agreed with our recommendations, and OFPP also  included additional comments. DOD did not respond. The other agencies  responded with no comment.", "In its written response, SBA stated that the burden is on the procuring  agencies to prepare the appropriate sole-source justification and that SBA  would take actions to ensure that the agencies do so. For example, SBA  plans to modify its partnership agreements to incorporate a requirement  that the contracting officer certify that the justification has been  completed. While these actions may help increase awareness of the  justification requirement at the procuring agencies, they do not address  SBA\u2019s own responsibilities. As we discuss in the report, the FAR states  that SBA may not accept for negotiation sole source 8(a) contracts over  $20 million unless the appropriate justification has been completed. SBA  states that it is difficult to interpret the FAR as requiring SBA to verify the  existence of the justification. We disagree. Logically, to meet the FAR  requirement, SBA must confirm the existence of an 8(a) justification. Our  recommendations were intended to help SBA\u2019s business opportunity  specialists understand how to comply with the FAR requirement.", "In an email response, OFPP generally agreed with our recommendations  and asked that we reflect that the Administrator of OFPP should take the  recommended actions in consultation with the FAR Council. We agreed  and made that change. OFPP further noted that, when planning the tribal  consultations to implement the 8(a) justification requirement, the FAR  Council also considered the President\u2019s Memorandum of November 5,  2009, which underscores the Administration\u2019s commitment to regular and  meaningful consultation with tribal officials in policy decisions that have  tribal implications.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense, the  Interior, and State; the Attorney General; the Administrators of the Small  Business Administration, the General Services Administration, and the  Office of Federal Procurement Policy; and interested congressional  committees.

We also interviewed  officials from the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), as the  Administrator of OFPP serves as chair of the Federal Acquisition  Regulatory Council, which implements changes to the FAR. Additionally,  to confirm agency officials\u2019 statements to us that they did not include  justifications in 8(a) sole-source contracts awarded after the October 29,  2009, enactment of the law but before its March 16, 2011, implementation  in the FAR, we selected a judgmental sample of five such contracts. We  selected those with the highest reported values in the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) at agencies  already within the scope of our review, and verified the absence of  justifications with agency contracting officials. As stated in the report,  Section 811 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010 did not require agencies to  implement the new justification requirement until it was implemented in  the FAR.", "To determine the number of 8(a) sole-source contracts over $20 million  awarded in the last several years, we analyzed contract data from FPDS- NG for contracts awarded from October 1, 2007, through March 31, 2012.  We took several measures to assess the reliability of this FPDS-NG data:", "We selected nine additional contracts to review for data reliability  purposes. Among the 13 contracts identified in FPDS-NG as having  values between $19.5 million and $20 million, we selected a  judgmental sample of seven to review, including four contracts  awarded by one Army Corps of Engineers contracting office worth  exactly $20 million each. For these contracts, we reviewed information  in the contract files to determine the anticipated total value of the  contract at the time of award, and confirmed that all were equal to or  under $20 million and thus not subject to 8(a) justification  requirements.  In addition, we conducted a statistical analysis of 8(a) sole-source  contracts with a total value of less than $19.5 million, identifying  contracts with high levels of correlation with characteristics of high- value 8(a) sole-source contracts, such as contract type and the type  of service provided. Based on this analysis, we selected two  additional contracts at entities already included in our review and  reviewed relevant contract files to verify their value, and confirmed  that both were under the $20 million threshold.", "We also calculated total obligations as of March 31, 2012, on the  contracts in this data set as a further check against inaccuracies in the  Base and All Options data element in FPDS-NG.", "Finally, we checked the data reported in FPDS-NG against  information gathered in reviews of contract files for 14 contracts over  the $20 million threshold awarded after March 16, 2011, as discussed  below.", "We determined that the data for this period was sufficiently reliable to  identify contracts that were subject to the 8(a) justification requirements  and describe their characteristics.", "To determine the extent to which agencies have implemented the new  justification requirement, we identified and reviewed all 14 relevant  contracts that were awarded between the FAR implementation date of  March 16, 2011, and March 31, 2012. We took the following steps to  identify these contracts:", "Most of the relevant contracts were identified using the Base and All  Options data element in FPDS-NG. We initially identified 14 sole- source 8(a) contracts with values over $20 million.", "During reviews of the contract files, we determined that 3 of the 14  contracts identified in our FPDS-NG analysis did not meet criteria for  the justification requirement and eliminated them from our review.  One Army contract was eliminated because its reported value of $99  billion was erroneous, and its actual value was below $20 million. The  Army has taken steps to correct this information. We found that  another Army contract was not a new award, but rather an  administrative action taken for accounting purposes; the underlying  contract was awarded prior to implementation of the justification  requirement. We also eliminated an Office of Personnel Management  contract that was awarded competitively, despite being reported in  FPDS-NG as 8(a) sole-source.", "To compensate for any errors in the Base and All Options data  element, we also calculated cumulative obligations for all 8(a) sole- source contracts awarded during the same period. Based on this  analysis, we identified one additional DOD contract, awarded by the  Army. A review of the contract file confirmed that its value was over  $20 million.", "Finally, in the course of our review, we identified two additional  contracts through other means. One contract was identified by State  Department officials when we inquired about 8(a) sole-source  contracts over $20 million. The other, an Army contract, was identified  through references to it in a related contract file.", "Of the 14 contracts that we identified as meeting the criteria for the  justification requirement, 8 were awarded by DOD and the rest by the  General Services Administration and the Departments of the Interior,  Justice, and State. We reviewed these contract files to determine if  justification documents were present and assess whether the  justifications complied with FAR requirements. We also reviewed other  contract documents, including Small Business Administration (SBA)  coordination records, acquisition plans, price negotiation memorandums,  and award memorandums. We reviewed policy documents related to  implementation of the justification requirement. We also interviewed  contracting and policy officials at the relevant organizations regarding  acquisition histories of the contracts and policies and practices related to  the justification requirement.", "In addition, we also reviewed a contract awarded by DOD\u2019s Washington  Headquarters Service that was not subject to the justification requirement.  It was identified for review because it had obligations of more than $20  million. A review of the contract file revealed that the contract was valued  below $20 million at the time of award, thus it was not included among the  14 contracts discussed above.", "The organizations with contracts in our review, including those reviewed  for data reliability purposes, were as follows:", "Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren, Virginia", "Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado", "Redstone Arsenal Army Base, Alabama  Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska", "Robins Air Force Base, Georgia", "Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, Systems Center  Pacific, San Diego, California", "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Norfolk District", "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Sacramento District", "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Tulsa District", "U.S. Army Contracting Command, Natick, Massachusetts", "Washington Headquarters Service, Washington, D.C.", "General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Service Region  8, Denver, Colorado", "Department of the Interior, Acquisition Services Directorate, Reston,", "Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, Arlington,", "Department of State, Office of Acquisition Management, Arlington,  Additionally, we interviewed SBA officials regarding their interpretation of  the FAR rule implementing the 8(a) justification requirements and  measures the agency has taken or plans to take to comply with this  change.
