In November 2010, the Coast Guard updated its acquisition policy to further incorporate best practices and respond to prior GAO recommendations, such as aligning independent testing requirements with DHS policies and formalizing the Executive Oversight Council to review programs and provide oversight. Additionally, the Coast Guard reduced acquisition workforce vacancies from 20 to 13 percent from April to November 2010, but shortfalls persist in hiring staff for certain key areas such as systems engineers, and some programs continue to be affected by unfilled positions. While the Coast Guard has increased its acquisition management capabilities, most Coast Guard major acquisition programs have ongoing cost, schedule, or program execution risks. Additionally, unrealistic budget planning for the Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio exacerbates these challenges and will likely lead to more program cost and schedule issues. The Coast Guard has several actions under way to further improve acquisition policies and workforce shortfalls, as well as address budget planning issues, but it is too soon to tell whether the actions will be effective. The Coast Guard leveraged DOD contracts to purchase products and services or to gain expertise in support of major acquisition programs. The Coast Guard has entered into approximately 81 memorandums of agreement and other arrangements primarily with DOD, which has experience and technical expertise in purchasing major equipment such as ships and aircraft, to support its major acquisition programs. Examples range from acquiring products and services from established DOD contracts to obtaining engineering and testing expertise from the Navy. According to the Coast Guard, leveraging DOD contracts has led to cost savings for Coast Guard acquisition programs. For instance, the Coast Guard received price discounts for C-130J aircraft by coordinating contracting efforts with the Air Force rather than contracting directly with the aircraft manufacturer. In another example, Coast Guard officials used Navy cost estimators and contracting staff in the November 2010 production contract for the National Security Cutter. At this point, Coast Guard program managers rely on informal contacts to learn about the agreements in place to support program activities, thus potentially limiting staff knowledge of DOD resources available. Coast Guard contracting officials only recently recognized the need to make DOD agreements available to program staff, but due to limited attention to this issue, only about 5 of the 81 agreements are currently accessible to program managers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Coast Guard take steps to ensure program staff have access to interagency agreements with DOD.

Our prior work on the Deepwater  acquisition program identified problems in costs, management, and  oversight that have led to delivery delays and other operational challenges  for certain assets, but it also recognized several steps the Coast Guard has  taken to improve Deepwater management. For example, beginning in  2007, the Coast Guard assumed the role of lead systems integrator for the  Deepwater program. Another key step was to reorganize its acquisition  function and update its business practices.

To do so, we  reviewed key Coast Guard and DHS documentation such as the Major  Systems Acquisition Manual, the Strategic Plan or Blueprint for  Continuous Improvement, DHS Acquisition Management Directive102-01,  acquisition decision memorandums for Coast Guard programs, Quarterly  Progress Reports, and Quarterly Acquisition Reports to Congress and  analyzed changes issued since our previous report in July 2010. We  interviewed Coast Guard acquisition directorate officials, including  program managers and contracting staff about the cost, schedule, and  performance of Coast Guard programs as well as any instances in which  DOD or other agencies provide support. We also interviewed DHS officials  from the Acquisition Program Management Division concerning Coast  Guard management of its acquisition portfolio. Further, we reviewed  contract documents and identified the agencies Coast Guard most  commonly used to support its major acquisition programs. On the basis of  this analysis, we interviewed Coast Guard officials, as well as DOD, Navy,  and Air Force officials about resources provided to support Coast Guard  major acquisition programs.

The board also  supports the Acquisition Decision Authority in determining the  appropriate direction for an acquisition at key acquisition decision events.  At each Acquisition Decision Event, the Acquisition Decision Authority  approves acquisitions to proceed through the acquisition life-cycle phases  upon satisfaction of applicable criteria.

For example, the 2010 Inspector General report found  that by the end of fiscal year 2009, 23 percent of assigned action item  completion dates slipped without determining the effect on acquisition  improvements. In response to the Inspector General\u2019s report, the Coast  Guard has taken steps to prioritize its action items; however, it is too soon  to tell the outcome of these actions.", "These policies were updated to align with DHS guidance and reflect best  practices. Coast Guard officials also attribute acquisition reforms to the  Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to assume responsibilities for all major acquisition  programs. We previously reported in 2009 that the Coast Guard  acknowledged its need to define systems integrator functions and assign  them to Coast Guard stakeholders as it assumed the systems integrator  role. As a result, the Coast Guard established new relationships among  its directorates to assume control of key systems integrator roles and  responsibilities formerly carried out by the contractor. For example,  according to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard formally designated  certain directorates as technical authorities responsible for establishing,  monitoring, and approving technical standards for all assets related to  design, construction, maintenance, logistics, C4ISR, life-cycle staffing, and  training. In addition, the Coast Guard is developing a Commandant\u2019s  Instruction to further institutionalize the roles and responsibilities for  Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition management.", "Beyond updating its major acquisition policies and guidance, the Coast  Guard Acquisition Directorate also increased the involvement of its  Executive Oversight Council to facilitate its acquisition process. Coast  Guard officials stated that the council, initially established in 2009 with an  updated charter in November 2010, provides a structured way for flag-level  and senior executive officials in the requirements, acquisition, and  resources directorates, among others, to discuss programs and provide  oversight on a regular basis. As the Coast Guard began assuming the  system integrator function from the Deepwater contractor in 2007, it  believed it needed a forum to make trade-offs and other program decisions  especially in a constrained budget environment; according to officials, the  council was established in response to that need. Coast Guard officials  noted that major programs are now required to brief the formalized  council annually, prior to milestones, and on an ad hoc basis when major  risks are identified. According to Coast Guard documentation, from fiscal  year 2010 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the council met over  40 times to discuss major programs. For example, the council held more  than five meetings to discuss the Offshore Patrol Cutter\u2019s life-cycle costs  and system requirements, among other issues.

As of November 2010, the percentage of  vacancies dropped from about 20 percent to 13 percent or from 190 to 119  unfilled billets out of 951 total billets. Acquisition workforce vacancies  have decreased, but program managers have ongoing concerns about  staffing program offices. For example, the HH-65 program office has  funded and filled 10 positions out of an identified need for 33 positions.  Although the program has requested funding for an additional 8 billets for  fiscal year 2012, due to the timing of the request, the funding outcome is  unknown as of April 2011. Similarly, the Interagency Operations Center  program is another office affected by acquisition workforce shortages.  According to the Coast Guard, as of March 2011, the program office has  funded and filled 11 positions out of the 27 needed. For some of these  positions, the Interagency Operations Center program uses staff from the  Coast Guard\u2019s Command, Control, and Communications Engineering  Center for systems engineering support; however, workforce shortages  remain. Program officials may face additional challenges in hiring staff  depending on the location of the vacancies within the program\u2019s  management levels. For example, a program official stated that vacant  supervisory positions must be filled first before filling remaining positions  because lower-level positions would not have guidance for their activities.  Figure 1 shows the status of the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition workforce  vacancies as of November 2010.", "We reported in January 2010 that the Coast Guard faces difficulty in  identifying critical skills, defining staffing levels, and allocating staff to  accomplish its diverse missions. An official Coast Guard statement from  2009 partially attributed the challenge of attracting staff for certain  positions to hiring competition with other federal agencies. In February  2010, we reported on the Coast Guard\u2019s long-standing workforce  challenges and evaluated the agency\u2019s efforts to address these  challenges. For example, we reported that while the Coast Guard  developed specific plans to address its human capital challenges, the fell short of identifying gaps between mission areas and personn  plans  el needed.", "The Coast Guard has taken steps to outline specific areas of workforce  needs, including developing a human-capital strategic plan and  commissioning a human-capital staffing study published in August 2010,  but program managers continue to state concerns with the Coast Guard\u2019s  ability to satisfy certain skill areas. For example, the August 2010 human- capital staffing study stated that program managers reported concerns  with staffing adequacy in program management and technical areas. To  make up for shortfalls in hiring systems engineers and other acquisition  workforce positions for its major programs, the Coast Guard uses support  contractors. As of November 2010, support contractors constituted 25  percent of the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition workforce. While we have stated  the risks in using support contractors, we reported in July 2010 that the  Coast Guard acknowledged the risks of using support contractors and had  taken steps to address these risks by training its staff to identify potential  conflicts of interest and by releasing guidance regarding the role of the  government and appropriate oversight of contractors and the work that  they perform.", "The Coast Guard has also made progress ensuring that program  management staff received training and DHS certifications to manage  major programs. For example, according to Coast Guard officials, in  December 2010, the Coast Guard was 100 percent compliant with DHS  personnel certification requirements for program-management positions.

For  program execution, the Coast Guard reported in December 2010 that 12 of  its 17 major programs face moderate to significant risk in one or more  execution metrics such as technical maturity or logistics, which required  management attention. Of these, seven programs have carried these risks  for 1 year or more. For example, the HC-130J program has reported  logistics-assessment risks requiring management attention for 3 years.  Regarding schedule challenges, the Coast Guard reported in December  2010 that 10 of its 12 major programs with approved acquisition program  baselines exceeded schedule objective or threshold parameters. For  example, the Maritime Patrol Aircraft HC-144A program exceeded its  schedule because it delayed a production decision in order to complete  initial operational testing and evaluation per a DHS acquisition review  board decision. As this program was already 4 years behind schedule,  added schedule delays may require the Coast Guard to extend a legacy  aircraft\u2019s service life, which may incur additional costs to sustain it. Major  Coast Guard programs also face resource risks. As of December 2010, 12  of the Coast Guard\u2019s 17 major programs face moderate to significant risk  in project resource metrics such as budgeting and funding. For 9 of these  programs, risks have been reported for more than 1 year. In addition, four  Coast Guard programs, HC-130H aircraft, Nationwide Automatic  Identification System, C4ISR, and HH-60 helicopter, have notified DHS of  acquisition program baseline breaches.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s unrealistic acquisition budget planning also  exacerbates the challenges Coast Guard acquisition programs face. We  have previously reported that the Coast Guard faced risks from unrealistic  funding levels and that its reliance on sustained high funding levels in an  environment of budget constraints puts program outcomes at risk if  projected funds are not received. In December 2010, the Coast Guard  reported that 8 of the 17 major program offices were updating their  acquisition program baselines due in part to reduced funding in the fiscal  year 2011-2015 Capital Investment Plan. According to Coast Guard  acquisition officials, when a Capital Investment Plan has funding levels  that are lower than what a program planned to receive, then the program  is more likely to have schedule breaches and other problems. For  example, in November 2010 the HC-130H program reported a schedule  breach to DHS due in part to reduced Capital Investment Plan funding  projections for fiscal years 2011-2015 and had to revise its schedule  parameters to reflect the lower projected funding levels. This also  occurred in the Nationwide Automatic Identification System major  acquisition program. The program had an estimated cost growth of  approximately $32 million due to reduced out-year funding in the fiscal  year 2009-2013 plan, and after further funding reductions in the fiscal year  2011-2015 plan, the program subsequently deferred efforts to update the  program baseline. According to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard is  currently reevaluating the program\u2019s system requirements and associated  project cost, schedule, and performance objectives. In 2011, DHS  acquisition oversight officials informed the Coast Guard that future  breaches in other programs would be almost inevitable as funding  resources decrease.

According to Coast Guard acquisition officials, the  most important step is for Coast Guard leadership to establish a priority  list for the major programs based on actual acquisition budgets received in  prior years, and then to make trade-offs between programs to fit within  historical budget constraints. The Coast Guard developed an action item  to assess the percentage of program funding profiles that fit into the  Capital Investment Plan. Specifically, the Blueprint indicates that the  Coast Guard will establish and implement a process to compare and report  the extent to which each individual program\u2019s funding fits into the Capital  Investment Plan funding parameters. Further, the Coast Guard plans to  analyze and regularly report gaps in these funding profiles to the Coast  Guard\u2019s acquisition leadership. The Coast Guard also identified the need to  promote funding stability in the Capital Investment Plan and intends to  evaluate that effort by establishing a mechanism and baseline to measure  Capital Investment Plan stability by comparing project funding against  previous, current, and future 5-year Capital Investment Plans. However,  while the Coast Guard officials stated their intention to use these metrics  to elevate the priority and funding issues to leadership, it is too soon to tell  the outcome of these steps.

The  Coast Guard has leveraged DOD contracts to help support its major  acquisition programs, but reliance on informal contacts may also present  missed opportunities for greater cooperation and leveraging of DOD  resources to help save scarce resources, manage programs risks, and  support positive acquisition outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide Coast Guard program management staff with greater access to  updated information about agreements in place with DOD to facilitate  leveraging support for major acquisition programs, we recommend that  the Commandant of the Coast Guard take steps to ensure all interagency  agreements are captured in a database or other format and make this  information readily accessible to program staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Coast Guard, DHS, and DOD.

We  reviewed Coast Guard acquisition governance, policy, and process  documents such as the Coast Guard\u2019s Major Systems Acquisition Manual  and Blueprint for Continuous Improvement that have been issued,  implemented, or updated since July 2010.

Additionally, we obtained  and analyzed Coast Guard program staff information to determine specific  programs experiencing staffing shortfalls and conducted interviews to  supplement Coast Guard information and determine the extent to which  staffing shortfalls affect program execution.", "To evaluate the Coast Guard\u2019s execution of its major programs we  analyzed information on the status of those programs since July 2010  through reviews of general acquisition status reports (e.g., Quarterly  Acquisition Reports to Congress and Quarterly Performance Reports),  program briefings, and acquisition process documents (e.g., Acquisition  Program Baselines) to determine how many programs have cost, schedule,  or performance issues based on criteria in the Major Systems Acquisition  Manual. Further, we analyzed additional program performance, schedule,  cost, and funding information from the Capital Investment Plan, breach  memos, and acquisition decision memos to identify funding stability issues  and the extent to which funding issues were factors leading to breaches in  established program baselines. We also corroborated program information  with interviews of Coast Guard program staff and interviews with external  DHS stakeholders, such as acquisition oversight and cost analysis staff in  the acquisition program management directorate. Moreover, we examined  and identified best practices from prior GAO reporting on Coast Guard  funding stability as a factor in program continuity and successful  outcomes.", "To determine the extent to which the Coast Guard leverages DOD and  other agency contracts or expertise to support its major acquisition  programs, we examined the Coast Guard\u2019s interagency agreements and  identified the agencies the Coast Guard most commonly used to support  major acquisition programs. On the basis of this analysis, we interviewed  Coast Guard officials, as well as DOD, Navy, and Air Force officials about  resources provided to support Coast Guard major acquisition programs.  We also discussed with Coast Guard officials any current efforts to update  the agreements. Using this analysis, we identified examples of cost savings  and other benefits for selected Coast Guard acquisitions. Further, we  reviewed relevant GAO and DHS Inspector General reports. We  corroborated testimonial information from interviews with Coast Guard  acquisition and program staff by reviewing contracts, agreements, and  other documents that show the amount of resources expended by the  Coast Guard for DOD-provided goods and services and by interviewing  DOD officials at the Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems  Command, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Commands, and the  Department of the Air Force.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2011 to April 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
