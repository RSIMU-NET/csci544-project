The military services have revised many of their advertising campaigns and focused on complementing traditional advertising, such as by increasing the use of the Internet, and participating in more promotional activities, such as sports car racing events. DOD's total advertising funding increased 98 percent in constant dollars from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2003--from $299 million to $592 million. The advertising cost per enlisted recruit has nearly tripled and is now almost $1,900. The military services agree that the revised strategies and increased investments have energized their advertising campaigns and better positioned them to recruit in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Today, almost all of the active and reserve components are meeting their overall recruiting goals in terms of the quality and quantity of new recruits. DOD does not have clear program objectives and adequate outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its advertising as part of its overall recruiting effort. Thus, DOD cannot show that its increased advertising efforts have been a key reason for its overall recruiting success. Isolating the impact of advertising on recruiting efforts is inherently difficult because joining the military is a profound life decision. Moreover, DOD has not consistently tracked key information, such as public awareness of military recruiting advertising and the willingness of young adults to join the military. Such data could be used to help evaluate the effectiveness of advertising. Without sufficient information on advertising's effectiveness, DOD cannot determine the return on its advertising funding or make fact-based choices on how its overall recruiting investments should be allocated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To meet its human capital needs, the Department of Defense (DOD) must  convince about 200,000 people each year\u2014the majority of them recent  high school graduates\u2014to join the military.

To assess the adequacy of DOD\u2019s outcome measures, we  used established management guidance provided in the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and in Office of Management and  Budget guidance. Our scope included DOD\u2019s active duty services, reserve  components, and joint advertising program.

As a result, the services stepped up their recruiting to ensure that they  would have enough recruits to fill their ranks. Recruiting efforts focus on  three initiatives. First, a \u201csales force\u201d of more than 15,000 recruiters, who  are mostly located in the United States, recruit from the local population.  Second, these recruiters have financial and other incentives that they can  use to convince young adults to consider a military career. Such incentives  include enlistment bonuses and college benefits. Finally, the services use  advertising to raise the public\u2019s awareness of the military and help the  sales force of recruiters reach the target recruiting population and  generate potential leads for recruiters. This advertising can include  television and radio commercials, Internet and printed advertisements,  and special events.", "DOD believes that advertising is increasingly critical to its recruiting effort  because convincing young adults to join the military is becoming more  difficult. In 2001, over 70 percent of polled young adults said that they  probably or definitely would not join the military, compared with 57  percent in 1976. The number of veterans is declining, which means that  fewer young adults have influencers\u2014a relative, coach, or teacher\u2014who  have past military experience. Compounding these difficulties,  proportionally more high school graduates are attending college. Finally,  the perception that service in the military is arduous\u2014and possibly  dangerous\u2014can inhibit recruiting efforts. DOD believes that these factors  together make the military an increasingly harder sell as a career choice  and life-style option for young adults.", "The Office of the Secretary of Defense is responsible for establishing  policy and providing oversight for the military recruiting and advertising  programs of the active and reserve components. Within the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness is  responsible for developing, reviewing, and analyzing recruiting policy,  plans, and resource levels. The office provides policy oversight for  advertising programs and coordinates them through the Joint Marketing  and Advertising Committee. DOD\u2019s strategic plan for military personnel  human resources emphasizes the need to recruit, motivate, and retain  adequate and diverse numbers of quality recruits.", "DOD\u2019s recruiting and advertising programs are not centrally managed. All  of the active components and some of the reserve components manage  their separate advertising programs and work closely with their own  contracted advertising agencies. DOD and the services believe that this  decentralized approach better differentiates between the service \u201cbrands\u201d  (i.e., Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines). The Joint Advertising, Market  Research, and Studies program, which is funded separately by DOD, exists  to address common DOD requirements, such as conducting market  research and obtaining and distributing lists of potential leads.

The Army, Navy, and Air Force missed their  recruiting quantity goals, while some of the reserve components fell short  of both their quantity and quality goals. Following these recruiting  shortfalls, Congress asked the Secretary of Defense to review DOD\u2019s  advertising programs and make recommendations for improvements.  DOD has revamped its advertising programs. The active-duty services,  except for the Marine Corps, substantially revised their advertising  campaigns and selected new advertising agencies as their contractors.  They produced new advertising strategies and campaigns, complete with  new slogans and revised television, print, and radio advertisements, along  with new brand images defined by distinct logos, colors, and music. The  services, in conjunction with their advertising agencies, conducted new  research on young adults\u2014their primary target market. During this period,  the joint program developed an advertising campaign to target influencers  of prospective recruits, as recommended in DOD\u2019s review.", "In addition to their overall campaigns, all of the services have specialized  campaigns to target diverse segments of the young adult population. For  instance, the Navy created a Web site, called El Navy, which is designed to  better communicate with the Hispanic market, and the Army has  specifically tailored radio advertisements to reach the African American  market. The services also incorporated a greater variety of public relations  and promotional activities, such as participating in job fairs and  sponsoring sports car racing teams, as an integral part of their advertising  programs. As shown in table 1, there are essentially nine advertising  programs that are managed separately by the military services, reserve  components, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.", "The active services told us that they are pleased with their new advertising  campaigns and agencies, and they believe that the revised and better- funded campaigns have placed them in a more competitive position to  recruit young adults. The sluggish U.S. economy has also narrowed  employment options and is considered to be an important factor in easing  the recruiting challenge. Today, all of the active services are meeting or  exceeding their overall recruiting goals. Most of the reserve components  are also achieving their recruiting goals. As of June 2003, the Army  National Guard was falling short of its recruiting goals because of  extensive overseas deployments and the implementation of stop loss  (restrictions on leaving the military). Army National Guard officials stated  that they expect to meet their goals by the end of fiscal year 2003. Some  reserve officers expressed concerns about the negative impact of the  recent high deployment rates on future recruiting. The services, especially  the reserve components, continue to face challenges in recruiting  individuals with some types of specific training or skills, such as medical,  legal, and construction, and they have developed some specialized  advertising campaigns targeted to recruit them.", "Since fiscal year 1998, the services have changed how they allocate  advertising funding, according to the figures provided by DOD. Grouped  into three broad categories, advertising funding includes: (1) events  marketing, public affairs and public relations, Internet, and other; (2)  national media; and (3) direct mail and miscellaneous recruiting support.  One of the categories\u2014events marketing, public affairs and public  relations, Internet, and other\u2014has shown the greatest increase as a  percentage of the total budget, nearly tripling from around 10 percent in  fiscal year 1998 to 29 percent in fiscal year 2003. This increase was used  partly to create and produce new advertising campaigns and strategies.  Service officials told us that event marketing and public relations activities  provide recruiters with greater opportunities to interact with potential  recruits and supplement their national media campaigns and other  methods of advertising. One example is the Army\u2019s sponsorship of a sports  racing car.  (See fig. 1.) Internet and Web-site recruiting have also  increased significantly from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2003. All of  the active military services have increased the amount of advertising on  the Internet and have used interactive Web sites to complement their  traditional recruiting and advertising methods.", "The expenditures for the national media category, which includes paid  television, radio, and magazine advertisements, have remained relatively  constant. This means that this category\u2019s proportion of the growing total  advertising budgets has actually declined. Specifically, expenditures for  the national media in fiscal year 1998 were more than half of the  advertising budget; currently, it represents about 40 percent. Television  advertising\u2014which offers tremendous reach to target audiences\u2014 dominates this category. Television advertising has remained the single  largest advertising expenditure: paid television is still about a quarter of  the total advertising budget for all of the military components."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Significantly Increased Funding for Advertising", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s advertising funding has nearly doubled in the years since 1998 and  most of these increases occurred in the earlier years.

DOD officials cite media inflation as one reason for  increased advertising funding. Inflation for some types of media, especially  for television commercials, has been higher than general inflation.  However, this is not the reason for all of the increases in advertising  funding during this period because not all of the advertising funding is  used for media advertising. For example, only about a quarter of  advertising funds are currently spent to buy time to run television  commercials.", "Growing advertising costs are only part of a rapidly increasing total  investment in recruiting. The rising advertising and overall recruiting costs  can be seen in the investment per enlisted recruit\u2014an important bottom- line measure that shows the amount of money spent to enlist each recruit.  Today, the services are spending almost three times as much on  advertising per recruit than in fiscal year 1990. We examined data  collected by DOD from the services, and it showed that the total  advertising investment per enlisted recruit rose from approximately $640  to $1,900 between fiscal year 1990 and fiscal year 2003. As a proportion of  the total recruiting investment, advertising has increased from 8 percent in  fiscal year 1990 to 14 percent in fiscal year 2003. Bonuses and incentives to  enlist have also increased substantially during this same period. The total  recruiting investment per recruit increased almost 65 percent, from  approximately $8,100 in fiscal year 1990 to $13,300 in fiscal year 2003. Very  steep growth occurred between fiscal year 1998 and fiscal year 2002. This  is shown in figure 3.", "The increases are not evenly distributed across the services\u2019 advertising  programs.

The Marine Corps, at just  under $50 million, has the smallest advertising budget. The Air Force has  experienced the most significant increase in funding, in part owing to the  creation of its first national television campaign. The Navy\u2019s advertising  funding has also increased, but this is primarily due to the addition of  costs related to the Blue Angels and a program to test recruiting kiosks at  public locations.", "DOD\u2019s Joint Advertising, Market Research, and Studies Program is  responsible for (1) providing market research and studies for recruiting  and (2) developing an advertising campaign to target adult influencers,  such as parents, coaches, and career counselors.

Program  managers told us that the current funding level is insufficient to fully  implement the influencer advertising campaign they have developed. In  past years, DOD cut funding for the joint advertising program because of  concerns that the program office was not adequately executing its  advertising budget.

We recommended  that DOD and the services assess the relative success of their recruiting  strategies, including how the services can create the most cost-effective  mix of recruiters, enlistment bonuses, college incentives, advertising, and  other recruiting tools. In comments on that report, DOD stated that it  intended to develop a joint-service model that would allow trade-off  analyses to determine the relative cost-effectiveness of the various  recruiting resources.

The services continually adjust the mix of  funding between advertising and other recruiting resources to accomplish  their program goals. They have generally increased spending on  advertising, added recruiters, and increased or added bonuses at the same  time, making it impossible to determine the relative value of each of these  initiatives. Other studies have reached similar conclusions. In 2000, a  review of DOD\u2019s advertising programs resulted in a recommendation that  they be evaluated for program effectiveness. More recently, the National  Academy of Sciences also cited the need to evaluate advertising\u2019s direct  influence on actual enlistments.

Measuring  advertising\u2019s effectiveness is a challenge for all businesses, according to  advertising experts. Private-sector organizations cannot attribute  increases in sales directly to advertising because there are many other  factors influencing the sale of products, such as quality, price, and the  availability of similar products. Many factors impact recruiting as well,  such as employment and educational opportunities, making it especially  difficult to isolate and measure the effectiveness of advertising. Enlisting  in a military service is a profound life decision. Typically, an enlistment is  at least a 4-year commitment and can be the start of a long military career.", "Another complicating factor in measuring advertising\u2019s effectiveness is  that it consists of different types and is employed differently throughout  the recruiting process to attract and enlist potential recruits. Figure 4  displays the recruiting process and demonstrates the role of advertising  while a young adult may be considering enlisting in the military.", "As the figure shows, the use of multiple types of advertising at various  stages in the recruiting continuum makes it difficult to assess the  effectiveness of specific types of advertising. A single recruit may be  exposed to some or all of these advertising types. Traditional advertising  in the national media, such as television and magazines, is intended to  disseminate information designed to influence consumer activity in the  marketplace. The services typically use such national media to make  young people aware of a military service, the career options available in a  service, and other opportunities the services have to offer them. Direct  mail, special events, and the services\u2019 Web sites are utilized to provide  more detailed information about the services and the opportunities  available for persons who enlist.

Inconsistent  funding for the Joint Advertising, Market Research, and Studies program  has hampered consistent collection of this information. DOD has  sponsored an advertising tracking study designed to monitor the  awareness of individual service campaigns since 2001. However, officials  from the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps told us that they do not regularly  use the research provided by this study. According to program officials,  there were numerous problems with the advertising tracking study. DOD  is implementing changes to the study that are intended to improve its  usefulness to all of the active and reserve components. In the absence of  reliable and timely advertising tracking, the Army implemented its own  tracking study, and the Air Force is currently planning an experimental  study to assess the effectiveness of its national television advertising  campaign, according to program managers. To monitor the willingness to  join the military, DOD sponsors youth and adult polls, which are designed  to track changes in attitudes and young adults\u2019 aspirations. These polls  replaced the Youth Attitude Tracking Survey, which had been in place for  a number of years and provided long-term trend data about the propensity  of young adults to consider the military. The services expressed concern  that the current polls ask questions that are significantly different from  those asked in the prior survey, which makes the analysis of trends  difficult.", "DOD officials also pointed to research indicating that advertising is a cost- effective recruiting investment when compared with other recruiting  initiatives. For example, a report that was done for DOD found that it was  less expensive to enlist a recruit through increased investments in  advertising than through increased investments in military pay for new  recruits in the Army and Navy. Similarly, a study for DOD analyzed the  marginal cost of different recruiting initiatives and concluded that, under  certain conditions, it was more cost-effective to invest additional funds in  advertising than in military pay for recruits or recruiters. DOD officials  told us that these reports, which used data from the 1980s and early 1990s,  provide the best research available on the topic. However, the situation  has changed dramatically in recent years. DOD has altered its advertising  and recruiting strategies and is spending much more on advertising.  Advertising itself is also changing and is more fragmented with an  expanding array of television channels and other media.

Although the military services are now generally meeting their  overall recruiting goals, the question of whether the significant increases  in advertising budgets were a main contributor to the services\u2019 recruiting  successes remains open. During the same period, DOD also greatly  increased funding for bonuses and other incentives to enlist recruits. At  the same time, the U.S. economy slowed dramatically, narrowing the other  employment options available to young people. These factors make it  difficult to disentangle the effects of the internal DOD investments made  in recruiting from the changes in the external recruiting environment.  Even though the effect of advertising is inherently difficult to measure, this  issue needs to be addressed. This is crucial because DOD is now spending  nearly $592 million annually on recruiting advertising, or about $1,900 per  enlisted recruit.

Since our objective was to look at broad funding  trends, we did not reconcile these requested amounts with actual  obligations or expenditures by the active and reserve components. We  interviewed active and reserve component officials to understand program  changes since the late 1990s. We obtained recruiting mission goals and  actual accessions back to fiscal year 1990 from the Office of the Secretary  of Defense and the services. We obtained information on the quality of  accessions of each of the active and reserve components back to fiscal  year 1990, as well as the investment per active enlisted accession back to  fiscal year 1990. We reviewed information from the Defense Human  Resources Activity and the Joint Marketing and Advertising Committee for  discussions of advertising programs. The services provided additional  information regarding the types of advertising media they use.", "To assess the adequacy of the measures used by DOD to evaluate the  effectiveness of advertising, we reviewed information on outcome  measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising provided by  each of the active and reserve components; the advertising agencies that  are their contractors; and the DOD Joint Advertising, Market Research,  and Studies program. We spoke with the advertising contractors to learn  what measures of effectiveness they are aware of and use. We also  reviewed the requirements for establishing program objectives and  outcome measures in the Government Performance and Results Act and in  Office of Management and Budget guidance.", "We interviewed DOD and advertising officials from each of the active and  reserve components, as well as representatives from the services\u2019  advertising agencies.

We also  interviewed officials at the contracted advertising agencies for the joint  program, the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force. We  reviewed reports on recruiting and advertising from DOD, the  Congressional Research Service, the private sector, and others.
