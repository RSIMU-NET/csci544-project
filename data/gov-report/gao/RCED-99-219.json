For example, the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC)\u2014the largest supplier of airline ticket stock worldwide and the primary supplier for U.S. travel agents\u2014testified that the losses from stolen ticket stock are relatively minor, costing the multibillion-dollar airline industry only a few million dollars annually. Travel agency representatives disagreed, testifying that the thefts of ticket stock cost billions of dollars annually and result in the closure of travel agencies held liable for the losses. These representatives also testified that the use of tickets produced from stolen stock results in the loss of tax revenues to the federal government and raises concerns about who\u2014terrorists and others, such as illegal aliens\u2014may be using stolen ticket stock for travel. According to the travel agency representatives, the problem could be solved if airlines used an existing database to detect tickets produced from stolen ticket stock.", "Given these divergent views, you asked us to examine the following questions: (1) What is the number and value of the airline ticket stock stolen annually?

(3) What other issues are potentially associated with the use of stolen ticket stock? and (4) What technological interventions and other initiatives are available to detect the use of stolen ticket stock?", "To determine the overall number and value of airline ticket stock reported stolen, we obtained information from the industrywide database on stolen and other fraudulent ticket stock maintained by Aeronautical Radio, Inc. (ARINC). This database cannot be broken out by year and does not contain information about the value of reported stolen stock. Accordingly, we used ARC\u2019s status reports to determine the amount of ARC ticket stock that is stolen annually. We also used information provided by ARC to estimate the value of its stolen ticket stock for 1997 and 1998\u2014the years for which the most complete information is available. A detailed description of our scope and methodology appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["While the federal government is deeply involved in many aspects of air travel, it is not involved in the creation or distribution of airline tickets. Instead, such matters are left to the airline industry.", "There are a variety of sources and types of airline ticket stock. For example, when airlines issue tickets directly to passengers, they use individualized ticket stock bearing their corporate name. However, the vast majority of U.S. travel agencies obtain their ticket stock from ARC\u2014an airline-owned corporation created, among other things, to accredit U.S. agencies and to facilitate the distribution of airline ticket stock to the agencies. In 1998, there were 32,694 ARC-accredited retail travel agencies.", "In 1998, ARC issued 1.1 billion pieces of ticket stock to U.S. travel agencies. The ticket stock is blank except for the inscription of a unique identifying number and has no value until it is made into a ticket. Over 90 percent of the ticket stock ARC issued in 1998 was in automated form. Travel agents imprint this stock by computer with data\u2014such as flight dates, flight numbers, and fares\u2014generated from the airlines\u2019 computer reservation systems. According to ARC, a typical ticket is composed of six to seven pieces of ticket stock\u2014the airline auditor\u2019s record, an agent\u2019s record, several flight coupons (one for each segment of a traveler\u2019s journey), a charge form, and the passenger\u2019s receipt. When combined together, these pieces of stock form an airline ticket. International suppliers, including the International Air Transport Association, issue similar ticket stock.

However, from 1989 through 1998, subscribing airlines and other worldwide suppliers of ticket stock reported 11.3 million pieces of stolen ticket stock for inclusion in ARINC\u2019s database\u2014an annual average of about 1.1 million. ARC reported the majority of these losses\u20148.2 million pieces (72 percent). Although the amount of stolen ARC ticket stock is sizeable, it represents less than one-hundredth of 1 percent of the over 9.2 billion pieces of ticket stock that ARC issued to travel agencies during the period. International ticket stock suppliers, including the International Air Transport Association, were the second largest source of the reported losses. They reported 2.8 million pieces of stolen ticket stock (25 percent). Eleven U.S. airlines reported the remaining 350,000 pieces of stolen ticket stock (3 percent).", "ARINC\u2019s database cannot be analyzed by year, and given the predominance of ARC ticket stock losses and the absence of other information sources, we relied on the data supplied by ARC for annual information. However, ARC\u2019s database only tracks 27 percent of the stolen stock it reported to ARINC. During 1989 through 1998, ARC\u2019s annual status reports identified 2.2 million pieces of stolen ARC ticket stock\u2014an annual average of about 220,000. After peaking in 1995, as shown in figure 2, the amount of ARC ticket stock reported stolen has declined considerably. ARC attributes the decline to (1) the more stringent security rules that it established in April 1996, (2) its increased fraud prevention activities, (3) increased awareness by travel agency personnel of the problem, and related to this, (4) the agents\u2019 increased compliance with ARC\u2019s required security measures.", "In 1997 and 1998, about 97 airlines voluntarily reported to ARC that 8,330 tickets were created from stolen ARC ticket stock and used for travel on their airlines. The tickets had a total face value of about $10.5 million and an average value of about $1,260. Using this average, we estimate that the 447,000 pieces of ARC ticket stock identified as stolen in ARC\u2019s status reports for 1997 and 1998 could be valued at as much as $302 million\u2014$186 million for the stock stolen in 1997 and $116 million for 1998. The $302 million represents the \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario and therefore is likely to overstate the potential loss from stolen ARC ticket stock. This is because, while travel agents normally use six to seven pieces of ticket stock to create an airline ticket, we assumed that individuals creating fraudulent tickets would, wherever possible, try to minimize the amount of stock used for each ticket so as to maximize the number of tickets they could create. For example, according to ARC, individuals creating tickets with stolen stock could use\u2014for a direct, one-way trip\u2014as few as two pieces of stock (one for the flight and one for the passenger\u2019s receipt) to create an airline ticket. As a result, rather than using six to seven pieces of ticket stock to create an airline ticket\u2014as in the case of a typical ticket\u2014we assumed that only two pieces would be needed and used.Likewise, we assumed that all of the stolen ticket stock would be used. This is extremely unlikely because, during 1997 and 1998, officials from the four airlines we contacted said that their airlines had confiscated over 1,900 pieces of stolen ARC ticket stock before the stock could be used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Implications Associated With Use of Stolen Ticket Stock", "paragraphs": ["The airlines bear the financial risk for most situations involving stolen ticket stock, but their losses are small relative to their total annual revenue and represent only a small portion of their total losses from all airline-related fraud. In contrast, losses incurred by travel agencies held liable for not adequately safeguarding ARC ticket stock can result in serious financial hardships. Of the 447,000 pieces of ticket stock stolen in 1997 and 1998, we estimate that the potential financial risk to the airlines and travel agencies would be about $151 million each. In actual practice, however, travel agencies would likely incur significantly smaller losses because airlines frequently settle for far less than the amounts that travel agencies owe. U.S. tax officials believe that the financial consequences to the federal government from the use of stolen ticket stock are minor and of limited interest for auditing purposes compared with higher-risk tax issues, such as the depreciation of airline assets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Airline Losses Are Small Compared With Their Annual Revenues and Their Losses From Other Types of Airline Fraud", "paragraphs": ["Airlines incur the financial burden for stolen ticket stock under a wide range of scenarios.

From 1989 through 1998, 11 U.S. airlines reported the loss of 350,000 pieces of their own blank ticket stock to ARINC\u2019s database. The actual value of the airlines\u2019 losses is not known because the database does not include information on the value of used ticket stock.", "In addition to losses from the use of their own stolen ticket stock, airlines bear the financial burden for much of the ARC stock that is reported stolen. For example, airlines bear the cost of crimes committed by travel agencies against the airline industry, including missing stock from terminated agencies and travel agency \u201cbust-outs.\u201d Bust-outs involve the fraudulent acquisition or retention of ARC ticket stock by a travel agency. For example, according to ARC officials, because it is relatively easy to obtain ARC\u2019s accreditation as a travel agency, some persons set up agencies solely to acquire and flee with ARC ticket stock. Moreover, according to ARC officials, travel agencies sometimes file for bankruptcy or otherwise discontinue their operations without paying for the tickets they have sold and without returning their remaining inventory of ARC ticket stock. In 1997 and 1998, ARC reported 33 travel agency terminations and bust-outs involving 150,000 pieces of ARC ticket stock. These losses represent about 34 percent of ARC\u2019s total ticket stock losses during this period.", "In many cases, airlines also suffer losses from crimes perpetrated against travel agencies. For example, ARC holds travel agencies harmless for the use of ARC ticket stock that is stolen during an armed robbery. In 1997 and 1998, about 23,000 pieces of ARC ticket stock were stolen in 29 armed robberies of travel agencies. In addition, if the agency followed ARC\u2019s ticket security procedures, ARC holds travel agencies harmless for ticket stock that is (1) stolen in burglaries, daytime thefts, and other thefts or (2) reported missing. In 1997 and 1998, 232 travel agencies reported the loss of about 274,000 pieces of ARC ticket stock from these types of crimes. ARC determined that 81 of these agencies, which had reported a total of about 45,000 pieces of stolen ticket stock, had followed ARC\u2019s security procedures, and thus the airlines were responsible.", "Taken together, the airlines are responsible for the use of 217,000 pieces of ARC ticket stock stolen in 1997 and 1998. In the unlikely event that all of this stock is used, we estimate that the airline industry could incur about $151.3 million in losses\u2014$94.7 million for ticket stock losses in 1997 and $56.6 million for losses in 1998. Figure 3 summarizes, by year and type of incident, the airlines\u2019 potential losses resulting from this stolen ticket stock.", "In addition to the losses for which they are responsible under ARC\u2019s policy, airlines frequently assume a large portion of a travel agency\u2019s financial liability. For example, according to representatives of 15 travel agencies held liable for ARC stock stolen in burglaries in 1997, their agencies were able to negotiate 33 settlements with 12 airlines. Ten of the 12 airlines agreed to forgive 90 percent of the amount owed by the agencies in 21 of the 33 settlements. For 10 of the 12 other settlements, airlines agreed to forgive 67 percent to 85 percent of the total amount owed by the agencies.", "The remaining two settlements were for 50 percent and 25 percent of the amounts owed.

Furthermore, according to surveys of the airline industry, the losses are minor compared with the airlines\u2019 total losses from other types of airline fraud. Specifically, according to a survey of 31 airlines in 1995, the losses from stolen ticket stock accounted for about 15 percent of all external fraud losses. The largest source of fraud (28 percent) resulted from abuses of the airlines\u2019 frequent flyer programs. Another survey, conducted in 1996, identified tariff abuse as the primary source of airline-related fraud. Other types of airline fraud included mail fraud; cargo theft; and internal airline fraud, such as expense account abuses and inventory fraud."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Travel Agency Losses Cause Serious Financial Hardship", "paragraphs": ["ARC determined that travel agencies had not adequately protected ARC ticket stock in 151 of the 232 incidents involving travel agency burglaries, daytime thefts, other thefts, and situations involving missing ticket stock in 1997 and 1998. As a result, ARC deemed the agencies liable for the use of about 230,000 pieces of ARC ticket stock. In the unlikely event that all of this ticket stock is used, we estimate that\u2014absent settlement agreements\u2014it could cost the travel agency industry as much as $151.1 million\u2014$91.6 million for losses in 1997 and $59.5 million for the 1998 losses. Figure 4 summarizes, by year and type of incident, the travel agencies\u2019 potential losses resulting from the losses of ARC ticket stock in 1997 and 1998.", "Potential losses of this magnitude create serious financial hardship for travel agencies even when airlines forgive the majority of the travel agencies\u2019 existing debt as well as the agencies\u2019 liability for the future use of outstanding stolen ARC stock. As of the end of December 1998, 33 of the 232 travel agencies victimized by thefts or otherwise missing ARC ticket stock in 1997 and 1998 were no longer in business. Of those found liable for the loss, 24 of 151 were no longer in business, including 3 of the 15 travel agencies we contacted. We could not determine the extent to which the theft of ARC ticket stock was a factor in the agencies\u2019 failure.However, the owners of the three agencies told us that their actual and potential liability for the loss of ARC ticket stock was the primary factor in closing their businesses. These owners were held liable for the use of over 15,000 pieces of ticket stock stolen in burglaries in 1997, and they closed their businesses without attempting to negotiate lesser payments with the airlines. One of the three former owners owed 12 airlines between $100,000 and $500,000, and the other two each owed more than $500,000 to numerous airlines.", "Representatives of 7 of the 12 remaining travel agencies told us that their airline debts could force them out of business. While some airlines settle for less than they are owed and waive liability for the future use of stolen ARC ticket stock, representatives of four of the seven agencies noted that other airlines refuse to (1) negotiate at all or (2) waive a travel agency\u2019s future liability for the use of stolen ARC ticket stock. As a result, travel agencies often owe thousands of dollars. For example, one travel agency we contacted owed nine airlines between $100,000 and $500,000. While the agency settled with seven of the nine airlines, paying them between $10,000 and $50,000, two airlines refused to settle for less than the total amount owed. Furthermore, only two of the seven airlines agreed to waive the agency\u2019s future liability. Consequently, the travel agency is liable for the future use of stolen ARC ticket stock on the other five airlines. According to the travel agency owner, a potentially huge financial burden continues that could eventually force the agency out of business.", "While still in business at the end of March 1999, five agencies we contacted told us that they had incurred a variety of economic hardships, including having to sell or mortgage their assets, downsize their operations, lay off staff, and forgo their salaries to pay their airline debts. For example, one agency owner told us that she had sold her home and her car and used her retirement savings to pay $50,000 to $100,000 in settlements to seven airlines. Two of the other three airlines she owed, however, refused to settle and instead turned the debts over to collection agencies. Many of the other travel agencies reported similar experiences. For example, while generally successful in negotiating greatly reduced payments, seven agencies that had been billed by the airlines reported that at least two airlines refused to negotiate reduced payments, and five agencies indicated that at least one airline refused to waive the agencies\u2019 future liability. Moreover, all 14 agencies that had been billed by the airlines reported that the airlines turned their debts over to a collection agency. Similarly, 12 of the 14 agencies that had been billed for the use of stolen ARC ticket stock told us that at least one airline either temporarily or permanently terminated business with them\u2014a factor that, depending on an airline\u2019s dominance in an agency\u2019s market, can greatly diminish an agency\u2019s financial viability. Seven of these 12 agencies in operation as of March 31, 1999, expressed serious concerns about the future viability of their businesses.", "Representatives from 12 of the 14 travel agencies that had been billed by the airlines also expressed concern about the accuracy of the airlines\u2019 bills. This is because airlines typically bill travel agencies for the face amount shown on the ticket, regardless of whether (1) the fare is accurate or (2) the traveler actually completed the entire trip. At our request, one airline compared its actual fares on the day each ticket was issued with the fares printed on 66 tickets that were created from stolen stock and used on the airline from July 1998 through September 1998. The fares shown on 61 of the 66 tickets were correct. The fares shown on the remaining five tickets were underpriced by $19 to $130. According to airline officials, the airlines do not adjust their bills to travel agencies to reflect overpriced tickets or portions of tickets that were not used. Such adjustments are not necessary, according to one airline official, because airlines routinely consider the possibility of overpriced and underused tickets in arriving at their settlement decisions with travel agencies.", "Several efforts have been undertaken to increase travel agencies\u2019 awareness of the need for adequately securing ARC ticket stock to reduce the likelihood and impact of losses from thefts. For example, owing to the prevalence of travel agency burglaries in the Chicago area, ARC initiated a crime prevention program for agents in and around Illinois. Specifically, between July 1998 and December 1998, ARC hired a retired law enforcement officer to assess the adequacy of the travel agencies\u2019 compliance with ARC\u2019s ticket security requirements and, where warranted, provide advice about needed improvements. In April 1998, ARC also began (1) sending travel agencies information about recent crimes, including photographic images of suspected thieves, and (2) increasing its interactions with local and federal law enforcement agencies. More recently, ARC has begun advocating that travel agencies reduce their exposure to crime by minimizing the amount of ticket stock they maintain on their premises. According to ARC, this can be accomplished by using less ticket stock when an agent creates an airline ticket. For their part, the Association of Retail Travel Agents and the American Society of Travel Agents\u2014both of which helped develop ARC\u2019s ticket security requirements\u2014are encouraging travel agencies to adhere to ARC\u2019s requirements because doing so ensures that the agencies will not be held accountable for any losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internal Revenue Service Believes Tax Consequences Are Not Material Compared With Higher-Risk Issues", "paragraphs": ["Federal tax law allows airlines, travel agencies, and other taxpayers to deduct (write-off) from their taxes a variety of losses, including losses from bad debt.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is aware of these concerns. However, its knowledge of airline accounting practices,including the airlines\u2019 treatment of bad debt, has led it to conclude that the tax consequences to the government are \u201cnot material\u201d compared with higher-risk tax issues, such as the depreciation of airline assets.

The officials stressed that terrorists are unlikely to knowingly use tickets created from stolen stock because doing so is likely to increase their risk of detection. Moreover, they pointed out that organized terrorist groups have sufficient financial backing and access to falsified personal identification to purchase legitimate tickets. Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration agreed with this assessment. While no terrorists are known to have used stolen ticket stock for travel, the Customs Service identified a passenger with stolen stock in his possession. The individual was attempting to enter the United States through Miami and had links to two terrorist groups.

However, they could not provide definitive evidence that this is the case. Their view, according to airline industry officials, is supported by analyses of the usage of stolen ticket stock, including the prevalence of specific (1) types of surnames (Hispanic and Middle Eastern) and (2) combinations of origin and destination locations within the United States. For example, of the 8,330 tickets created with stolen ARC ticket stock that airlines reported to ARC as used in 1997 and 1998, about 54 percent (4,476 tickets) were for flights originating from one of three U.S. locations\u2014Los Angeles, California; Phoenix, Arizona; or San Diego, California. Similarly, about 28 percent (2,342 tickets) were for flights destined for one of five U.S. locations\u2014Los Angeles, California; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago, Illinois; Atlanta, Georgia; or the New York/New Jersey area. ARC and other industry officials believe that the illegal aliens are unknowingly sold tickets created from stolen stock as part of a package deal that includes fraudulent personal identification and the promise of a job.", "Only INS can determine if an individual is an illegal alien. INS inspectors must interview the suspected passengers and scrutinize their identification to determine if they are in the country illegally. Likewise, only the airlines can definitively establish whether a ticket has been created from stolen ticket stock. As a result, while illegal aliens have used tickets created from stolen ticket stock, the extent of their travel by this means is not known because INS and the airlines have not routinely worked together to identify illegal aliens using stolen ticket stock.", "Consistent with its mission to prevent individuals from illegally entering the United States, INS does not typically scrutinize domestic travelers. Instead, INS concentrates its resources at U.S. ports of entry, such as the five destination locations discussed above. As a result, unless requested to intervene by an airline, INS would not normally come into contact with illegal aliens using stolen ticket stock for domestic travel. One exception was in February 1999 when INS inspectors apprehended 162 illegal aliens on three domestic flights at the Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. INS confiscated the illegal aliens\u2019 tickets and returned them to the airlines so that they could cancel the seat reservations. However, while one of the two airlines had the capacity to determine whether the tickets were produced from stolen ticket stock, it did not do so. Instead, it\u2014like the other airline\u2014returned the tickets to INS, which, in turn, gave them to the illegal aliens before deporting them. As a result, no one knows whether, or to what extent, the 162 illegal aliens were traveling domestically on stolen ticket stock.", "Given the airlines\u2019 and INS\u2019 separate capabilities, airlines sometimes request INS\u2019 assistance in determining whether individuals they suspect of traveling on stolen ticket stock are illegal aliens. For example, in 1997, one airline determined that 22 percent of its passengers using tickets created from stolen stock were destined for, or passing through, the Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport. The airline requested INS\u2019 assistance, and between January and February 1998, INS responded to five flights involving passengers who the airline suspected were illegal aliens. Twelve passengers were detained, all of whom were using tickets created from stolen stock. INS found that 11 of the 12 passengers were illegal aliens. None of the passengers had a criminal history, so local law enforcement officials declined to prosecute them. Instead, the illegal aliens were turned over to INS for deportation.", "While INS and the airline industry have not routinely worked together to identify illegal aliens using stolen ticket stock, cooperation in this area is increasing. For example, in 1996, INS initiated a program for detecting stolen ticket stock at the Miami International Airport in Florida and the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. While INS could not provide details on the program\u2019s success, an INS inspector told us that, in cooperation with airlines at the Miami International Airport, he had identified about 100 illegal aliens using tickets created from stolen stock between July 1996 and February 1998. Moreover, in April 1999, INS\u2014with ARC\u2019s assistance\u2014began training its inspectors in manual methods for detecting stolen ticket stock as an additional tool in interdicting illegal aliens. According to INS officials, INS is also interested in securing access to the airline industry\u2019s database on stolen and other fraudulent ticket stock and, as a result, intends to request the airline industry\u2019s cooperation in this area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Law Enforcement Efforts to Combat the Theft of Ticket Stock", "paragraphs": ["Efforts to combat the theft of ticket stock have focused on passengers who use tickets created from stolen stock. Recognizing that this is only part of the problem, airline and travel agency representatives told us that additional efforts to identify and arrest those responsible for stealing and distributing the ticket stock would significantly reduce the supply of stolen ticket stock. Typically, the theft and distribution of stolen ticket stock involves federal crimes, such as the interstate transportation of stolen goods and mail and wire fraud, which fall under the purview of the FBI. While ARC believes it has made substantial progress in reducing ARC ticket stock thefts from travel agencies, according to ARC officials, additional FBI assistance is needed to achieve more dramatic results.", "According to ARC, it has been unable to enlist sufficient investigative support from the FBI. FBI and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office officials told us that the theft of airline ticket stock is a \u201cproperty crime\u201d that competes with higher-priority investigations, such as crimes involving narcotics, counterterrorism, and violent crimes. In addition, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s typical threshold for prosecuting stolen property cases exceeds $50,000. This threshold is difficult to establish for stolen airline ticket stock because it is considered valueless until used. Notwithstanding these difficulties, as of August 1998, the FBI had about 20 pending cases involving stolen airline ticket stock, 17 of which were classified as violations involving the interstate transportation of stolen property. Four of the 20 cases have since been closed for various reasons. More recently, according to FBI officials, crimes involving stolen airline ticket stock have received increased FBI scrutiny. For example, the FBI said that, in December 1998, it held a training conference for its agents in Chicago and has been devoting additional resources to address these crimes.", "The Miami-Dade Police Department has linked a criminal group to the theft of airline ticket stock. According to individuals involved in this case, the group is composed of the thieves who steal the stock; \u201cfences\u201d who buy and store the stock; salespeople who sell the tickets; and individuals who print the tickets. The salespeople are located throughout the United States and solicit buyers for the tickets through unaccredited travel agencies, newspaper advertisements, and word-of-mouth. They transmit their sales by telephone or fax to the individuals who print the tickets. These individuals imprint the passenger\u2019s itinerary on the blank stock using home computers and send it to the applicable salesperson for delivery to the passenger.

Access to the database (1) is limited to participating airlines and (2) varies depending on the type of subscription each airline purchases. According to an ARINC official, the organization had 140 subscribers to its ticket stock listing and on-line detection services in 1998, including 26 airlines that had integrated ARINC\u2019s database into their computer systems. On-line airline subscribers can query the database for stolen ticket stock by manually entering the ticket stock\u2019s unique identification number. If the inputted number matches the number on ticket stock that has already been reported as stolen, the database indicates a match.", "Officials of the four subscribing airlines we contacted stated that the ARINC database is generally effective in detecting the use of stolen ticket stock. In fact, most of the 1,900 pieces of stolen ticket stock that these airlines confiscated in 1997 and 1998 were identified using this database. Nevertheless, the officials cited several disadvantages that preclude routinely using the database. The primary drawback was the time required to query the database, which delays the processing of passengers. We observed the database in operation at two different airline ticket counters at Washington Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C., and recorded a total query time per ticket of between 6 seconds to 10 seconds. While each search takes only seconds, according to one airline official, the cumulative time required to check every ticket on a flight\u2014as has been recommended by some in the travel agency industry\u2014makes the idea impractical because, in his view, flights would never leave on time. Moreover, airline ticket agents sometimes enter the number incorrectly, thereby producing a false result. Conversely, airlines fear that they might detain a passenger using a legitimate ticket because suppliers, such as ARC, periodically re-use their stock control numbers. As a result, purchasers of legitimate tickets could find themselves with the same ticket number as stock that was previously reported stolen. Finally, the database cannot be used to detect altered ticket stock, which, according to one major U.S. airline, represents a significant portion\u201440 percent\u2014of the fraudulent ticket stock it unknowingly accepted in 1997.", "Some airlines are experimenting with other types of technology that, in conjunction with the airlines\u2019 computer reservation systems and ARINC\u2019s centralized database, can help detect stolen ticket stock. For example, the four airlines we contacted had all tested or planned to test optical scanners, bar code readers, or magnetic strip readers that can quickly capture a wide range of passenger information without increasing passengers\u2019 check-in times. The latest generation of these devices is capable of reading ticket information, including the ticket\u2019s identification number; credit cards; frequent flyer cards; and machine-readable passports, visas, and other passenger identification.", "The scanner and reader devices address some of the problems associated with using ARINC\u2019s database. For example, the devices reduce the time needed to query the database because airline ticket agents need not manually enter each ticket\u2019s identification number. This eliminates keystroke errors and allows the number to be read and compared with the database with only one swipe of the ticket. In addition, the devices can be programmed to determine whether the ticket stock has been altered. We observed demonstrations of two of these technologies. Each technology was capable of reading and displaying information from a variety of documents, including airline tickets. According to the manufacturers\u2019 representatives, when interfaced with the airlines\u2019 computer systems and ARINC\u2019s database, the devices can (1) read and compare airline ticket numbers with ARINC\u2019s database and (2) display the results of the search within 2 seconds.", "Without other proven benefits, however, airline officials said that the use of scanner and reader devices solely to detect stolen ticket stock would be unduly expensive. Each of the devices costs between $2,000 and $3,000\u2014a considerable amount when multiplied by all of the airlines\u2019 ticket counters. Moreover, airlines would still have to pay about $14,000 annually to subscribe to ARINC\u2019s database on fraudulent ticket stock.", "While these devices are being tested, we know of only one airline that is using them. This international airline initially used a device for reading passports and, in 1997, contracted with the manufacturer to develop an enhanced device capable of also reading ticket stock. In June 1998, the airline purchased 300 of the devices at a cost of about $660,000 for use at its U.S. locations. According to officials of this airline, the device is about 99-percent accurate, and as a result, the airline paid for its investment through reduced losses from stolen ticket stock within the first 5 months of its use, even though the device was not introduced for this purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Major Detection Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["ARC and the four airlines we contacted analyze information about the use of stolen ticket stock to profile common characteristics and identify patterns for use in targeting their detection efforts. These analyses produce statistical profiles that the airline industry uses to set priorities for their detection efforts, including the targeting of specific geographic locations. Moreover, to enhance their detection initiatives, many airlines offer rewards to employees who detect and confiscate fraudulent ticket stock. In 1998, for example, the International Air Transport Association found that 14 of the 20 airlines it randomly surveyed had programs for rewarding employees who detect fraudulent tickets. The rewards included $25 to $50 for each ticket confiscated, first-class travel anywhere the airline flew, and 5 percent of the value of the confiscated ticket.

However, many officials commented that the steady increase in electronic ticketing may soon resolve the problem because, with paperless tickets, travel agencies and other ticket distributors will have less need to retain large inventories of airline ticket stock. According to ARC, reducing the amount of stock that a travel agency keeps on hand has two potential benefits. It reduces the agency\u2019s potential losses should a theft occur, and it lessens the agency\u2019s attractiveness as a target of crime.

(2) What financial implications are associated with the use of stolen ticket stock? (3) What other issues are potentially associated with the use of stolen ticket stock? and (4) What technological interventions and other initiatives are available to detect the use of stolen ticket stock?", "To determine the number and value of stolen airline ticket stock, we obtained information from Aeronautical Radio, Inc. (ARINC)\u2014an airline-owned company in Annapolis, Maryland\u2014that since 1989 has maintained a centralized, proprietary database of stolen, lost, missing, and other fraudulent airline ticket stock worldwide. ARINC provided an aggregate listing spanning 10 years, from 1989 through 1998. We used this information to determine the total amount of ticket stock reported stolen to ARINC by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) (on behalf of ARC-accredited travel agencies) and other domestic and international suppliers of ticket stock over the 10-year period. We could not use ARINC\u2019s information to estimate the value of this ticket stock because ARINC\u2019s database does not contain information about the use and value of the ticket stock.", "Given ARINC\u2019s data limitations, the predominance of ARC\u2019s ticket stock losses (ARC accounted for 72 percent of all stolen stock reported to ARINC), and the absence of other data sources, we compared the ARINC data with information in ARC\u2019s annual status reports over the 10-year period.Because the amount of stolen ticket stock reflected in these reports totaled only 27 percent of the amount ARC reported to ARINC, we took additional steps to ensure the accuracy of selected ARC data. Specifically, for 1997 and 1998\u2014the only years we could use to estimate the ticket stock\u2019s potential value\u2014we examined all (294) of ARC\u2019s Fraud Prevention Bulletins for 1997 and 1998 and compared our results with ARC\u2019s annual status reports and, on an incident-by-incident basis, reconciled differences with ARC officials.", "Over 80 percent of the difference between ARINC and ARC\u2019s data related to ARC\u2019s treatment of stock associated with terminated travel agencies. As a precautionary measure, according to ARC officials, ARC reports to ARINC\u2019s database, the unique identifying numbers of all unaccounted for ARC ticket stock previously provided to the agencies it has subsequently terminated even though some portion of this stock has probably been issued by these agencies. However, in compiling its status reports, ARC includes only the ticket stock that has been used or is likely to be used. For example, according to ARC officials, ARC\u2019s status reports do not include unreported ticket stock of terminated agencies if the stock is over 5 years old and has not yet been used. Likewise, according to ARC officials, ARC reports to ARINC all subsequent adjustments to the initial amount of ticket stock reported stolen by the travel agencies but does not adjust its annual status reports. As reflected in this report, the amount of ARC ticket stock reported stolen in 1997 and 1998 represents the amounts agreed to by ARC and us through this reconciliation process.", "To determine the value of airline ticket stock stolen annually, we used ARC\u2019s Field Investigation and Fraud Prevention Department\u2019s informal database of information provided voluntarily by the airlines about the number and value of stolen ARC ticket stock used for travel on their airlines. ARC supplied us with a copy of its database, which contained 15,542 records (each record represented a ticket). After eliminating (1) duplicate records according to criteria supplied by ARC and (2) ARC\u2019s incomplete listing of losses earlier than 1997, we had 8,330 records in our database. Using the average cost per ticket derived from these records, we computed the estimated value of the ARC ticket stock reported stolen in 1997 and 1998. While six to seven pieces of ticket stock are normally used to create a legitimate airline ticket, as discussed in the report, we assumed that only two pieces would be used. Likewise, contrary to industry experience, we assumed that all of the stolen ARC ticket stock eventually would be used for travel. Thus, our estimate provides a \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario and, consequently, is likely to overstate the potential loss from the use of stolen ARC ticket stock.", "We performed a reliability assessment on the data elements we used from the ARINC and ARC databases and found that the data were reliable enough for our uses in this report. We performed limited reasonableness tests on the data, conducted extensive interviews with ARINC and ARC officials regarding the creation and control of the data, and reviewed information about their data quality factors.", "To identify the financial implications associated with the use of stolen ARC ticket stock, we first determined the extent to which airlines and travel agencies were held liable for the use of the ARC ticket stock reported stolen in 1997 and 1998. Then, using the average cost per ticket that the airlines\u2019 reported to ARC, we computed the potential losses for the airlines and travel agencies if all of the ARC ticket stock reported stolen in 1997 and 1998 were used for travel. We also collected information about the number, value, and impact of losses from stolen ARC ticket stock from American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines. These four airlines accounted for 37 percent of the revenue passenger miles flown by all U.S. airlines during the 12-month period ending March 1998 and 35 percent of the ticket stock reported stolen to ARINC by U.S. airlines as of December 31, 1998. Moreover, officials from these airlines expressed a willingness to cooperate in our review even though much of the information we obtained is considered proprietary and confidential by the airline industry. To evaluate the impact on travel agencies held liable for the theft of ARC ticket stock, we conducted a telephone survey of 24 agencies that ARC identified as being liable for ARC stock stolen in burglaries in 1997. Representatives of three of these travel agencies told us that they were not held liable for their ARC ticket stock losses so we deleted them from our survey. Between February 12, 1999, and February 22, 1999, we were able to contact 15 of the remaining 21 travel agencies, which agreed that they had been burglarized and held liable for the use of the ARC ticket stock stolen in 1997. We interviewed representatives of these 15 travel agencies to, among other things, verify the amount of ARC ticket stock stolen and to discuss the airlines\u2019 billing practices for the stolen stock and the impact of the burglaries on their agencies. We also reviewed and discussed travel agency complaints filed with the Travel Agent Arbiter. Finally, we interviewed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials to identify the tax and reporting requirements for airline carriers and travel agencies that have experienced losses arising from the use of stolen ticket stock and to determine the extent to which IRS has examined their compliance with tax requirements.", "To identify other potential issues, we focused on possible safety concerns related to the use of stolen ticket stock by terrorists and illegal aliens.
