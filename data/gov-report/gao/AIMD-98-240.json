These are (1) increase awareness and continually educate VHA CIOs, VISNs, and health care facilities on biomedical issues, (2) establish an expert working group to provide guidance, (3) develop a database of biomedical equipment manufacturers that supply equipment to VHA, (4) survey these manufacturers to identify the compliance status of biomedical equipment and solutions for noncompliance, and (5) communicate survey results to the field for use in determining the compliance status of biomedical equipment at the medical facilities. Each month, these facilities are expected to report to the VHA Year 2000 Project Office their strategies for dealing with noncompliant and conditional-compliant equipment in their inventories and the cost to accomplish this.", "To increase awareness, VHA has established an intranet web site containing compliance information from the manufacturers. This web site is also used to educate VHA CIOs, VISNs, and health care facilities on biomedical issues. VHA has also established an expert working group to assist the Year 2000 Project Office in identifying, assessing, and evaluating biomedical equipment at risk from the Year 2000 problem.", "VHA developed a database of biomedical equipment manufacturers by using an existing database, which tracks service manuals of both medical devices and scientific and research instruments purchased by its medical facilities. The expert working group reviewed the database to ensure that key manufacturers in specialty areas were included.", "To survey biomedical equipment manufacturers, the VHA Year 2000 Project Office sent a series of letters to them requesting information on the Year 2000 compliance status of their products. The first letter was sent to approximately 1,600 manufacturers on September 9, 1997. Two follow-up letters were sent to those that did not respond on October 6, 1997, and November 12, 1997. Upon receipt of responses to these letters, VHA categorized the compliance status provided by the manufacturers for the equipment, as illustrated in table 1.", "Of the nearly 1,600 manufacturers in VHA\u2019s initial mailing, VHA determined that about 100 were no longer in business. Accordingly, VHA revised its list of manufacturers to 1,504 as of June 1, 1998, and reported that it received compliance information from 1,070, or 71 percent, of these manufacturers. Just under half of the 1,504 manufacturers reported that all of their devices are Year 2000 compliant.", "As shown in table 2, the manufacturers have provided VHA with compliance information on a wide range of biomedical equipment. VHA\u2019s data, as of June 1, 1998, indicated that for those manufacturers that reported, at least 80 percent of the equipment types are compliant. According to VHA\u2019s Year 2000 Project Manager, the expert working group reviews the information provided by the manufacturers for reasonableness. The Year 2000 Project Office has provided this information to its medical facilities through VHA\u2019s intranet web site, and the facilities are to use the information to assess the compliance status of their equipment.", "According to VHA officials, most of the manufacturers that reported one or more of their biomedical equipment products as noncompliant cited incorrect display of date and/or time as problems. For example, a noncompliant electrocardiograph machine, used to monitor heart signals, would print charts with two-digit dates, showing the year 2000 as \u201c00.\u201d According to the Diagnostic Services Chief of VHA\u2019s Technology Division, these cases do not generally lead to the equipment failing to operate and do not present a risk to patient safety because health care providers, such as physicians and nurses, are able to work around this problem. For example, a physician or technician would note the correct year on the printout from the electrocardiograph machine when the equipment imprints \u201c1900\u201d on the printout.", "However, VHA recognizes that incorrect date-time representation or use could pose a risk when the date is used in a calculation or when records generated by the equipment is sorted automatically to present a patient\u2019s condition, over a period of time, to a physician for diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, when records are sorted by date of recording, the accuracy of such dates can be critical to a physician\u2019s monitoring of patient progress in, for example, the case of blood sugar readings. If readings were taken on December 25, 27, and 30, 1999, and again on January 1, 2000, for example, the ordering might appear with the last entry first, if it were abbreviated as \u201c00\u201d and read as January 1, 1900. If the physician or other clinician did not pay close attention, a faulty diagnosis or treatment decision could be made based on a misreading of the data.", "VHA also recognizes that an equipment function that depends on a calculation involving a date and that is performed incorrectly as a result of a date problem, could present a risk to the patient. One example reported by a manufacturer is a product used for planning the delivery of radiation treatment using a radioactive isotope as the source. An error in the calculation of the radiation source\u2019s strength could result in inappropriate treatment\u2014either too low or too high a dosage\u2014and could have an adverse effect on the patient on or after January 1, 2000. This noncompliant equipment is currently in the inventory of several VHA medical facilities. In commenting on a draft of this report, VA noted that VHA has identified three facilities that use this specific equipment, and the noncompliant equipment will be taken out of service.", "Given the above case scenarios, it is crucial that biomedical equipment manufacturers provide VHA with information on the compliance status of their equipment. This information is necessary for VHA medical facilities to formulate safe and effective solutions to address Year 2000 problems.", "Between November 1997 and January 1998, VHA\u2019s medical facilities completed inventories of their biomedical equipment and reported the results to the Year 2000 Project Office. Using data on the facility\u2019s biomedical equipment inventory from VHA\u2019s equipment database, each facility was to conduct a physical inventory of its biomedical equipment and check this inventory against compliance information submitted by the manufacturers, which the Year 2000 Project Office had posted on the VHA intranet web site.", "According to VHA\u2019s January 30, 1998, Year 2000 Assessment Phase Report, the medical facilities noted that based on the information from the manufacturers, some of the noncompliant biomedical equipment at VHA sites included defibrillator monitors, noninvasive blood pressure machines, vital signs monitors, and cardiology monitors. VHA officials have stressed that noncompliant equipment of one type reported by certain manufacturers does not indicate that all equipment of the same type in use at its medical facilities is noncompliant. VHA officials told us that there are other manufacturers of this equipment type that have reported that their equipment is compliant.", "The VHA Year 2000 Project Office has directed VHA medical facilities to regularly check the web site for updates on the compliance status of biomedical equipment reported by manufacturers. This is important for the medical facilities because, in some cases, the manufacturers have subsequently changed the compliance status of their equipment after their initial reports to VHA. The changes have ranged from some equipment previously reported as conditional-compliant that is now being reported as compliant to equipment previously reported as compliant that is now considered noncompliant. According to VHA\u2019s Year 2000 Project Manager, the project office monitors the medical facilities\u2019 Year 2000 activities through periodic reports and site visits.", "VHA officials have informed us that they will be relying on the biomedical equipment manufacturers to validate, test, and certify that replacement equipment is Year 2000 compliant. This is because some manufacturers have informed them that VHA should not attempt to conduct in-depth testing by manipulating the software embedded inside the equipment. According to the Diagnostic Services Chief of VHA\u2019s Technology Division, such testing may void the manufacturer\u2019s certification to FDA that the equipment is safe for use on patients, thereby exposing VHA to legal liability in the event that a patient\u2019s health is harmed by equipment that malfunctions following VHA testing. VHA\u2019s Year 2000 Project Manager told us that the medical facilities will perform limited functional testing of replacement equipment and of manufacturer modifications to conditional-compliant equipment.

The Director said that no manufacturers have yet submitted any reports under this new reporting requirement."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA Plans to Make Compliance Information Available to the Public", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to FDA, VHA had not been making information obtained from biomedical equipment manufacturers on the Year 2000 compliance status of their products available to the public through an Internet World Wide Web site. VHA has not yet done so because (1) when VHA requested this information from the manufacturers, VHA did not tell them that it intended to release the information outside the federal government and (2) VHA said that it had concerns regarding whether it would be proper for it to release some of the information provided by the manufacturers because the information may be proprietary. The VHA Year 2000 Project Manager told us that VHA believed it would need the manufacturers\u2019 permission before it could share this information. He said that VHA is concerned about the proprietary nature of the products, potential legal issues, and manufacturers\u2019 price structure for Year 2000 compliant products. VHA had shared some of Year 2000 compliance status information provided by manufacturers with federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with the caveat that it was for federal use only. NIH then shared this information with FDA.", "VHA, on the advice of the VA Acting General Counsel, has recently informed the manufacturers of its plans to make this information available to the public through an Internet World Wide Web site. Specifically, on June 17, 1998, VHA mailed letters to manufacturers that had responded to VHA\u2019s previous requests for compliance information. It informed the manufacturers that it intended to place information they provided to VHA on a publicly-available World Wide Web site unless the manufacturers informed it otherwise. VHA included similar language in a June 24, 1998, letter to manufacturers that had not yet provided compliance data. The VHA Year 2000 Project Manager said the response from the manufacturers as of June 30, 1998, has been positive. He added that two manufacturers objected to disclosing this information to the public, citing proprietary reasons. These responses have been referred to VA\u2019s legal department.", "VA has not yet decided how and when a clearinghouse of compliance information provided to VHA from manufacturers will be made available to the public. According to VHA\u2019s Year 2000 Project Manager, the FDA web site is one of the options being considered for the clearinghouse. The Director of FDA\u2019s Division of Electronics and Computer Science informed us that FDA and VHA have discussed using FDA\u2019s web site as such a clearinghouse.", "VA\u2019s Under Secretary of Health recognizes the importance of gathering compliance data and sharing them publicly. Specifically, in a July 9, 1998, press conference sponsored by the National Patient Safety Partnership,he called on biomedical equipment manufacturers to identify and address potential patient safety problems resulting from the Year 2000 problem. On behalf of the partnership, he called for (1) all health care practitioners and medical treatment facilities to survey their equipment and seek information from their relevant biomedical equipment manufacturers about their products\u2019 Year 2000 compatibility, (2) all health care consumers who use biomedical equipment at home to check with their health care providers about the products\u2019 Year 2000 compatibility, (3) the medical equipment manufacturers to take immediate action to determine the compliance status of their equipment, and (4) the establishment of a single, national clearinghouse from which compliance information from manufacturers can be readily accessed by the public. The Under Secretary reiterated these four items in a July 23, 1998, hearing before the Senate Special Committee on Year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Prompt correction of the Year 2000 problem for biomedical equipment is critical to VHA\u2019s role as a health care provider. Although VHA has made progress in assessing its biomedical equipment, it does not yet know the full extent of the Year 2000 problem with this equipment and the associated costs to address this problem because it has not received compliance information from many of the manufacturers. This information is important because VHA relies on the manufacturers to validate, test, and certify that their equipment, including replacement equipment, is compliant. Despite these uncertainties, VHA medical facilities have not yet completed business continuity and contingency plans on actions they must take to address Year 2000-related failures. The Year 2000 Project Office also has not yet completed a Year 2000 contingency guidebook for biomedical equipment to assist the VISNs and medical facilities in their business continuity and contingency planning and other activities. Until these issues are resolved, VHA lacks adequate assurance that its delivery of medical care through the use of biomedical equipment will not be adversely affected by the Year 2000 problem.", "FDA\u2019s goal is to provide a comprehensive, centralized source of information on the Year 2000 compliance status of biomedical equipment used in the United States, and make this information publicly available on an Internet World Wide Web site. FDA, like VHA, relies on the manufacturers to validate, test, and certify that the equipment is Year 2000 compliant. However, FDA has no assurance that the manufacturers have adequately addressed the Year 2000 problem for noncompliant equipment because it does not require manufacturers to submit test results to FDA certifying compliance. Also, FDA does not have as much information in its database on the compliance status of biomedical equipment as VHA.", "Finally, VHA, which currently does not make compliance information obtained from the manufacturers available to the public, now plans to do this through an Internet World Wide Web site. The sharing of this information could greatly assist all health care providers and other users of biomedical equipment in identifying noncompliant and conditional-compliant equipment in their inventories and taking prompt action to make them compliant. Sharing also could provide users with a mechanism to overcome the deficiencies in the FDA database, such as the lack of detailed information on the make and model of compliant equipment and the disappointing response rate from manufacturers to FDA\u2019s request for compliance information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under Secretary for Health to take prompt action to:", "Ensure that the VISNs and medical facilities use the new reporting system to provide the VHA Year 2000 Project Office with up-to-date and more complete information on the cost to replace and/or repair noncompliant and conditional-compliant biomedical equipment.", "Complete and issue as soon as possible to the VISNs and medical facilities a Year 2000 guidebook on how to address contingency planning and other related issues for biomedical equipment for incorporation in their individual Year 2000 plans.", "Require that each VISN director ensure that medical facilities within the VISN complete development of a Year 2000 business continuity and contingency plan for biomedical equipment in its inventory.

At a minimum, the clearinghouse should contain (1) information on the compliance status of all biomedical equipment by make and model, (2) the identity of manufacturers that are no longer in business, including the types of equipment, makes, and models produced by these manufacturers, (3) the identity of manufacturers that have and have not provided VHA and/or FDA with test results certifying that their equipment is Year 2000 compliant, and (4) the identity of manufacturers that have not provided compliance information to VHA and/or FDA.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in conjunction with VA\u2019s Under Secretary for Health and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, determine what actions, if any, should be taken regarding biomedical equipment manufacturers that have not provided VHA and/or FDA with compliance information; determine what actions, if any, are needed to address biomedical equipment produced by manufacturers no longer in business; take prudent steps to review the test results for critical care/life support biomedical equipment, especially equipment once determined to be noncompliant but now deemed compliant, and that for which there are concerns about the determination of compliance, and make the results of these reviews publicly available through the single data clearinghouse; and determine what legislative, regulatory, or other changes are necessary to obtain assurances that the manufacturers\u2019 equipment is compliant, including performing independent verification and validation of the manufacturers\u2019 certification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, VA generally concurred with our recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the first of two joint recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a single data clearinghouse. VA stated that VHA is working closely with other federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense and FDA, to address common problems with biomedical, clinical, and laboratory equipment and facilities. VA also noted that it has joined with the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, and the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations in calling for a joint effort to create a national clearinghouse for Year 2000 information.", "VA stated that the percentage of manufacturers not responding to VHA\u2019s inquiries is now 14 percent, meaning an 86 percent response rate. However, VHA counted letters returned to VHA by the U.S. Postal Service marked with no forwarding address as responses. Because these manufacturers did not provide VHA with information on the compliance status of their products, the response rate from manufacturers, based on updated information provided to us by VA as of July 29, 1998, is 73 percent, only slightly above the 71 percent rate cited in our draft report.", "VA also described actions taken and planned to implement our recommendations, as well as a number of suggested changes to this report. These comments have been incorporated into the report as appropriate and are reprinted in appendix I.", "Regarding our second joint recommendation to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, VA stated that it has no legislative or regulatory authority to implement this recommendation and defers to HHS. VA, however, stated that it will provide consultation or other appropriate assistance to HHS in implementing this recommendation.", "HHS, in commenting on a draft of this report, also concurred with the joint recommendation to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a single data clearinghouse. It stated that HHS and VA are merging their efforts to provide complete information to the health care community and the general public regarding the Year 2000 compliance of biomedical equipment. It also stated that FDA will post on the web site the names of manufacturers that have not provided compliance certification. However, HHS did not believe that it is necessary or cost-effective to list all compliant products. It believed that information at the individual model level is only needed for noncompliant products. We disagree with HHS. The make and model information will provide users with detailed data on the reported compliance status of their products, especially for those 195 manufacturers that VA has determined to have merged or been bought out by other manufacturers as of July 29, 1998.", "In addition, HHS concurred with two of the three components of the second joint recommendation. Specifically, it concurred with the component of the recommendation to determine the actions that should be taken regarding manufacturers who fail to respond to requests for compliance information. HHS also stated that under current regulations, FDA does not have the authority to require all device manufacturers to submit reports on whether their devices are Year 2000 compliant.", "HHS also concurred that the identity of defunct manufacturers, along with the known types, makes, and models of devices they manufactured should be included in the clearinghouse database. It further stated that it would explore possible approaches to acquiring additional information regarding defunct manufacturers\u2019 products.", "HHS did not concur with the component of the recommendation to review test results supporting the medical device equipment manufacturers\u2019 certifications that their equipment is compliant. It believed that the submission of appropriate certifications of compliance is sufficient to ensure that the certifying manufacturers are in compliance. We disagree that this is sufficient. Through independent reviews of the manufacturers\u2019 test results, users of the medical devices are provided with a level of confidence that the devices are Year 2000 compliant. HHS also stated that it did not have the resources to undertake such a review, and there is insufficient time to complete a review of this nature. In this regard, if HHS lacks sufficient resources to review the manufacturers\u2019 test results, it may want to solicit those of federal health care providers and professional associations, such as VA and the National Patient Safety Partnership. Additionally, to make effective use of limited resources, FDA and the health care community, at a minimum, should focus their review efforts on critical care/life support biomedical equipment that was determined to be noncompliant but is now deemed compliant and that for which there are concerns about the determination of compliance.", "Regarding our recommendation on legislative or regulatory changes necessary to obtain assurances that manufacturers\u2019 biomedical equipment is compliant, HHS believed that the solutions to the Year 2000 problems can be reached through approaches such as the clearinghouse.
