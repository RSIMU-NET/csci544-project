The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has raised fair housing concerns about this practice, saying that local support requirements (such as letters) could have a discriminatory influence on the location of affordable housing.", "Allocating agencies can increase (boost) the eligible basis used to determine allocation amounts for certain buildings at their discretion. However, they are not required to document the justification for the increases. The criteria used to award boosts varied, with some allocating agencies allowing boosts for specific types of projects and one allowing boosts for all projects in its state.", "In a July 2015 report, GAO found that Internal Revenue Service (IRS) oversight of allocating agencies was minimal and recommended joint administration with HUD to more efficiently address oversight challenges. GAO's work for this review continues to show that IRS oversight remains minimal (particularly in reviewing allocation plans and practices for awarding discretionary basis boosts) and that action is still warranted to address GAO's prior recommendation. In this report, GAO also identified the following issues related to managing noncompliance information from allocating agencies:", "IRS provides discretion to allocating agencies for reporting noncompliance data, and has not provided feedback about data submissions. Consequently, allocating agencies have been inconsistently reporting these data to IRS.", "IRS has not used the information that it receives from allocating agencies to identify trends in noncompliance. GAO's analysis shows that IRS had recorded only about 2 percent of the noncompliance information it received since 2009 in its database.", "IRS has not used key information when determining whether to initiate an audit, potentially missing opportunities to initiate LIHTC-related audits.", "In contrast, HUD collects and analyzes housing data, and through a Rental Policy Working Group initiative, now adds LIHTC inspection results to its database.

The program encourages private-equity  investment in low-income housing through tax credits and is administered  by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and allocating agencies. The  allocating agencies typically are state or local housing finance agencies,  which are state-chartered authorities established to meet the affordable  housing needs of the residents of their states or local housing agencies  established for large cities, such as New York or Chicago. Each state  receives an annual allocation of LIHTCs, determined by statutory formula  according to its population. Allocating agencies then competitively award  the tax credits to owners of qualified rental housing projects that reserve  all or a portion of their units for low-income tenants.", "In July 2015, we reported on how the LIHTC program is administered;  processes for overseeing the program; and how the administration of  other tax credit programs compares with LIHTC. We found that IRS  oversight of the LIHTC program had been minimal, particularly in  monitoring the allocating agencies and assessing their compliance.  Moreover, we found that IRS had neither set goals nor assessed the  performance of the program and its data were not sufficiently reliable to  assess compliance with basic program requirements. We concluded that  IRS\u2019s oversight to identify and address compliance issues had been  minimal because LIHTC has been viewed as a peripheral program for  IRS in terms of mission and priorities for resources. Furthermore, we  concluded that joint administration with the Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD) could better align program responsibilities  with each agency\u2019s mission and more efficiently address existing  oversight challenges. Under joint administration, IRS would retain  responsibilities consistent with its mission to enforce tax laws and HUD\u2019s  role could include oversight responsibilities to help address deficiencies  we identified. We suggested that Congress consider designating HUD as  a joint administrator of the program based on its experience in  administering affordable housing programs and working with state and  local allocating agencies.", "You asked us to review how the allocating agencies administer the  program and identify any remaining oversight issues. In this report, we  describe how allocating agencies implement federal requirements for (1)  awarding LIHTCs, (2) assessing the reasonableness of LIHTC properties\u2019  development costs and financial feasibility, and (3) monitoring LIHTC  properties\u2019 compliance with program requirements.

We also interviewed  officials from IRS, Treasury, HUD, and the National Council of State  Housing Agencies (NCSHA) to discuss the role of allocating agencies in  administering the LIHTC program. We conducted a structured analysis of  58 Qualified Allocation Plans (QAP) from 2013, which outline processes  for awarding LIHTCs and compliance monitoring responsibilities. We  analyzed plans from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,  American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin  Islands, and the cities of Chicago and New York. We used a  standardized data collection instrument to gather and analyze information  from the plans on specific selection criteria, established cost limits,  compliance monitoring practices, and other topics.

Our selected agencies were in California; Chicago, Illinois;  Illinois; Massachusetts; Michigan; Nevada; Rhode Island; Virginia; and  Washington, D.C. During our visits, we interviewed agency officials and  reviewed files for randomly selected housing developments to determine  how each agency addressed federal requirements for awarding LIHTCs,  assessing the reasonableness of development costs, and monitoring  properties\u2019 compliance with program requirements. While the results of  these site visits cannot be generalized to all states, they provided insight  into the ways in which agencies implemented these requirements.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2014 to May 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Section 42 requires that QAPs give preference to certain  projects; specifically, those that  serve the lowest-income tenants, are obligated to serve qualified tenants for the longest periods, and are located in qualified census tracts and the development of which  contributes to a concerted community revitalization plan.", "QAPs also must incorporate certain \u201cselection criteria\u201d (but are not limited  to these criteria).

Specifically, allocating agencies must allocate at least 10 percent of the state housing credit ceiling to  projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations; execute an extended low-income housing commitment of at least 30  years (of which the first 15 years is the compliance period) before a  building can receive credits;  require developers to hire an agency-approved third party to conduct  a comprehensive market study of the housing needs of low-income  individuals in the area to be served by the project before the credit  allocation is made; provide a written explanation to the general public if the agency  makes an allocation that is not in accordance with established  priorities and selection criteria; and notify the chief executive officer (or the equivalent) of the local  jurisdiction where the building is located, and provide the official a  reasonable opportunity to comment on the project.", "To select projects for tax credits, allocating agencies receive and evaluate  detailed proposals that developers submit to develop new housing or  acquire and rehabilitate existing housing. The project owners agree to  set aside a certain percentage of the units with rents affordable to  qualifying low-income households for at least 30 years. In return, tax  credit investors can earn a tax credit over a 15-year period (the  compliance period) if they meet the affordability requirements, but can  claim the credit over an accelerated time frame (the 10-year credit  period), beginning in the year in which the property is placed in service  (ready for occupancy) or, if the investor chooses, the succeeding tax  year.

To determine financial feasibility,  Section 42 requires that allocating agencies consider the reasonableness  of developmental and operational costs, any proceeds or receipts  expected to be generated through the tax benefit, and the percentage of  credit amounts used for project costs other than the cost of intermediaries  (such as syndicators). Section 42 also requires an allocating agency to  evaluate available private financing and other federal, state, and local  subsidies a developer plans to use and adjust the award accordingly.", "Allocating agencies must review costs to determine the credit amount at  three points in time: application (when the proposal is submitted),  allocation (when the agency commits to providing credits to a specific  project), and placed-in-service (when the project is ready for occupancy  under state and local laws).

Subsequent inspections must take place at least once  every 3 years, starting from the initial inspection.

For  example, allocating agencies must notify IRS of any noncompliance found  during inspections and ensure that owners of LIHTC properties annually  certify that they met certain requirements for the preceding 12-month  period. If a property is not in compliance with the provisions of Section 42,  allocating agencies must provide written notice to owners and file an IRS  Form 8823 (report of noncompliance or building disposition) no later than  45 days after the end of the correction period, whether or not the  noncompliance or failure to certify has been corrected.

Specifically, 23  of 58 QAPs we analyzed contained references to all required preferences  and selection criteria. Of the 35 QAPs that did not contain references to  all required preferences and selection criteria, 5 were from the selected  agencies that we visited. All five of these agencies provided us with  documentation that demonstrated that these requirements were being  implemented. For example, Michigan\u2019s scoring criteria attachment to their  LIHTC application included several requirements that were not found in  their QAP. As another example, although Nevada\u2019s QAP did not include  selection criteria related to public housing waiting lists, officials from the  agency illustrated how they met this requirement by including an  attachment to their application package that requires the developer to  certify that it will notify public housing agencies of the project\u2019s availability  for tenants on public housing waiting lists. The remaining 30 agencies  (which we did not visit) also may have documented the information  elsewhere. For example, for several plans with missing Section 42  requirements, we were able to find evidence that these required items  were listed or referenced in other publicly available sources.", "Consistent with our previous report, IRS officials stated that they did not  regard a regular review of QAPs as part of their responsibilities as  outlined in Section 42 and therefore, did not regularly review the plans.  IRS officials said that allocating agencies have primary responsibility to  ensure that the plans meet Section 42 preferences and selection criteria.  According to Section 42, allocating agencies must use a QAP that has  been approved by the governmental unit of which the agency is a part but  the Code does not specify that the unit must check for all required  preferences and selection criteria. IRS officials noted that review of a  QAP to determine if the plan incorporated the elements specified in  Section 42 could occur if an allocating agency were to be audited. IRS  has conducted seven audits of allocating agencies since the inception of  the program and found issues related to QAPs, including missing  preferences and selection criteria, lack of an updated plan, and incorrect  paraphrasing of Section 42 requirements. For these audits, IRS  recommended that the agencies update their QAPs to address the  identified deficiencies. As a result of IRS\u2019s lack of regular oversight of the  allocating agencies, we concluded in July 2015 that IRS is not well  positioned to provide this type of oversight because of its tax compliance  mission and recommended that Congress consider designating HUD as a  joint administrator of the program to better align program responsibilities  with each agency\u2019s mission and more efficiently address existing  oversight challenges, including a lack of regular review of QAPs.

Nearly all  the QAPs we reviewed referenced scoring criteria for the qualifications of  the development team. For example, allocating agencies can award  points based on the team\u2019s demonstrated successful experience in  developing tax credit projects, as well as the physical and financial  condition of other properties they developed. Agencies also commonly  used energy efficiency as a criterion. This category encompassed green  building practices, including the design of buildings in accordance with  green standards, as well as use of energy- and water-efficient fixtures.  Additionally, over one-third of the QAPs reviewed cited letters of support  from local governments. (We discuss letters of support in more detail in  the next section.)", "Allocating agencies typically ranked applications and reserved credits  based on the needs of the state after scoring applications. Several  allocating agencies with which we met said they have established  allocation pools based on the geographic area of the project or  development characteristics to help ensure that affordable housing needs  are met in those areas. If applications receive the same score, these  allocating agencies have established different kinds of tiebreakers to  decide which applicant would receive the tax credits. For example, one of  California\u2019s tiebreakers is a ratio that compares funds from federal or local  government subsidies a developer expects to finance the project with  total development costs.", "Allocating agencies also can implement a qualitative evaluation system  that uses rankings and recommendations to evaluate applications. For  example, the allocating agency from Chicago reviews submitted  applications using internal guidelines based on the agency\u2019s underwriting  standards and project feasibility criteria, and chooses which  developments to recommend for LIHTC awards. Two of the nine agencies  we visited that used a qualitative ranking or recommendation-based  system in 2013 noted that they were considering (Chicago) or had  already switched (Rhode Island) to a point-based scoring system.", "Some allocating agencies we visited evaluate applications with the goal of  selecting projects for which to reserve future years\u2019 credits, a practice  termed \u201cforward reserving.\u201d While Section 42 and Treasury regulations  allow such reserving, credits only can be allocated to projects in the  calendar year in which the projects are placed in service. Officials from  California noted that forward reserving helped ensure the agency would  be eligible for the national pool of tax credits. Other agencies noted that  they reserved credits for planning purposes. For example, Chicago\u2019s  allocating agency has decided to reserve 5 years\u2019 worth of credits to build  a pipeline of projects with which to work. Chicago officials stated that a  multiple-year queue allows them to better plan their allocations based on  affordable housing needs in their jurisdiction. Because of this practice,  Chicago does not hold competitive funding rounds every year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Addition to Notifying Affected Officials of Planned Projects, Some Agencies Required Local Letters of Support Raising Fair Housing Concerns That Are Being Litigated", "paragraphs": ["According to Section 42, allocating agencies must notify the chief  executive officer (or the equivalent) of the local jurisdiction in which the  project is to be located, and provide the official with a reasonable  opportunity to comment on the proposed project. Some agencies also  imposed an additional requirement of local letters of support that have  raised fair housing and other concerns. For example, some allocating  agencies give points to developers that have letters of local government  support as part of their application. These agencies require a signed letter  of support (from a chief elected or administrative official of the community  in which the project would be sited) that specifically endorses the  proposed project.", "Based on our review of 58 QAPs, we found that 12 agencies noted that  their review or approval of applications was contingent on letters of  support from local officials. Another 10 agencies awarded points for  letters of local support. Six of the nine agencies we visited had selection  criteria in their 2013 QAPs that stated that letters of local support would  affect the agency\u2019s review of the application or result in point awards or  deductions. According to officials from these six agencies, there are  various advantages to using this criterion. For example, officials from  Massachusetts told us the letters indicate a project will move more quickly  through the development process, which includes local zoning and  permitting, than a project without local support. However, the officials also  said that an applicant could be awarded credits without a letter if all other  threshold and scoring requirements were met. Furthermore, officials from  Chicago\u2019s allocating agency noted that the letters were evidence of  support for the proposed development from the surrounding community  and they continued to use the letters as a threshold item upon which tax  credit awards were based.", "Four of the allocating agencies we visited that used letters of support as  scoring criteria in 2013 (Nevada, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington,  D.C.) had concerns with this additional requirement and took steps or  were planning to change how the letters were used for LIHTC projects.  For example, officials from Virginia\u2019s allocating agency noted that they  stopped awarding points for the letters after being notified that local  officials were choosing developments they wanted to support based on  personal preferences. As of 2014, Virginia stopped awarding points for  local letters of support but began deducting up to 25 points for negative  letters if, after further analysis, the state determined the claims of  negative effect were valid. Additionally, officials from Nevada said that  they changed their requirements because they became aware of the  difficulties developers in rural areas faced in receiving letters of support  (due to local officials\u2019 fear of losing elections if affordable housing were  built in their districts). As of 2015, Nevada no longer required letters of  local support; instead the agency notifies local jurisdictions and provides  them with an opportunity for comment.", "In Texas, concerns also have been raised about the requirement, but its  allocating agency continues to require letters of support. Specifically, in  2013, the state\u2019s Sunset Advisory Commission recommended eliminating  letters of support from state senators and representatives because the  commission believed the letters gave too much power to officials far  removed from the process. In 2010, a Texas developer was convicted  on corruption charges, which included supplying a below market-rate  apartment to a state representative in exchange for the representative\u2019s  support for the developer\u2019s projects.", "There is also ongoing litigation about the requirement for letters of local  support that alleges that Treasury did not issue any regulations to prevent  state actions that contribute to perpetuating racial segregation of LIHTC  units and that this is a violation of its obligation to affirmatively further fair  housing under the Fair Housing Act. The litigation specifically alleges  that in 2013 the Texas legislature enacted two statutes that give  substantial control over the location of LIHTC projects to local municipal  and county government, one of which requires the allocating agency to  provide a high number of points to developers that receive the explicit  approval of the relevant municipal or local government. According to the  lawsuit, Section 42 gives Treasury the authority to regulate such local  government restrictions, but the agency has not issued regulations or  otherwise prevented states from enacting such policies. Officials from  Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Policy said they could not comment on ongoing  litigation.", "Moreover, research conducted by HUD and others has analyzed how  scoring criteria (like letters of local support) can influence project location  and HUD officials have expressed fair housing concerns about these  letters. Specifically, officials from HUD\u2019s Office of Fair Housing and Equal  Opportunity and Office of General Counsel have cited fair housing  concerns in relation to any preferences or requirements for local approval  or support because of the discriminatory influence these factors could  have on where affordable housing is built. In 2013, HUD and other  participants in the Rental Policy Working Group\u2014which was established  by the White House to better align the operation of federal rental policies  across the administration\u2014shared these concerns with Treasury. These  HUD officials suggested that eliminating local approval or support  requirements or preferences from QAPs should be top priorities for  Treasury and IRS, based on fair housing concerns. As of January 2016,  neither Treasury nor IRS had issued any guidance about letters of local  support, and Treasury\u2019s Priority Guidance Plan does not include any  plans to address HUD\u2019s recommendation. Treasury officials said they  could not comment or take action on matters related to the ongoing  litigation. In addition, research from HUD\u2019s Office of Policy Development  and Research has explored the relationship between tax credit allocation  priorities as outlined in QAPs (such as local letters of support or approval)  and the location of LIHTC units. For example, one HUD report found  that certain state QAP prioritization of local approval exhibited increases  in the overall exposure to poverty of LIHTC units. Furthermore, a report  by the Poverty and Race Research Action Council found that local  approval requirements beyond the required Section 42 notification  provide municipalities with an opportunity to \u201copt out\u201d of developing  LIHTC projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Implemented Other LIHTC Requirements in Varying Ways", "paragraphs": ["Allocating agencies we visited had processes in place to meet other  Section 42 requirements relating to awarding credits, long-term  affordability of projects, project viability (market studies), and written  explanation to the public."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nonprofit Set-Aside", "paragraphs": ["Allocating agencies must allocate at least 10 percent of the state housing  credit ceiling to projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations.

One allocating agency we visited requires  developers to sign agreements for longer extended-use periods, while  some agencies award points to applications whose developers elect  longer periods. For example, California\u2019s allocating agency has a  minimum affordability period of 55 years, 25 years longer than the 30- year requirement. Other allocating agencies, including those from  Massachusetts, Virginia, Nevada, and California, award extra points to  developers that elect affordability periods beyond the 30-year minimum.", "Nevada\u2019s allocating agency noted that it was challenging to preserve the  affordability of LIHTC units due to the qualified contract process outlined  in Section 42. Under the process, owners of properties subject to an  extended-use restriction may seek to remove the restriction for  maintaining affordability after the first 15 years (compliance period) by  requesting that the allocating agency find an eligible buyer for the  property. The agency has 1 year to find a potential buyer that will  maintain the property\u2019s affordability and present an offer in accord with  qualified contract provisions. If the allocating agency cannot find a buyer  that will offer a qualified contract, then the current owner is entitled to be  relieved of LIHTC affordability restrictions (which phase out over 3 years  after the 15-year compliance period ends). Officials from Nevada  mentioned that their larger projects (more than 200 units) were at risk of  losing affordability because of the qualified contract process. Specifically,  when the qualified contract price exceeds a development\u2019s market value,  it is difficult for the agency to find a buyer for the above-market price. The  officials suggested that in such cases, the development should be priced  according to the market or fair value price to attract more buyers willing to  preserve the affordability of the properties. One way we observed that  allocating agencies can maintain LIHTC properties\u2019 affordability is to  restrict owners from using the qualified contract process.

One  agency (Rhode Island) requires the study to be submitted after credits are  reserved, but evaluates it before allocation.

For example, Michigan  chooses a firm on behalf of the applicant and has the developer pay for  the study. Agency officials noted that this process increases the  independence of the market analysis and lessens any potential conflicts  of interest.

Section 42 does not provide a definition or offer guidance on determining  how to calculate these amounts.", "All nine allocating agencies we visited require applicants to submit  detailed cost and funding estimates, an explanation of sources and uses,  and expected revenues as part of their applications. These costs are then  evaluated to determine a project\u2019s eligible basis (total allowable costs  associated with depreciable costs in the project), which in turn determines  the qualified basis and ultimately the amount of tax credits to be  awarded.", "More specifically, the agencies we visited used different methods for  determining the amount of LIHTCs to award.", "Six agencies (California, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, Virginia, and  Washington, D.C.) determined credit amounts explicitly in their  application reviews by comparing the award amount calculated from  the qualified basis with the amount calculated based on the project\u2019s  existing equity gap and awarding the lesser of the two. In other words,  agencies reviewed cost information to determine the annual amount  of tax credits needed to fill the gap in financing. These six agencies  documented their calculations and award amounts in the project  application and review files.", "The other three agencies (Chicago, Massachusetts, and Rhode  Island) determined credit amounts similarly by reviewing financial  information from developers, but did not explicitly compare the equity  gap and qualified basis to determine award credit amounts. Instead,  officials told us that underwriters reviewed this information and  assessed if the amounts were reasonable based on their internal  underwriting criteria to make award decisions.", "Section 42 also does not provide a definition of reasonableness of costs,  giving allocating agencies discretion on how best to determine what costs  are appropriate for their respective localities. In addition, Section 42 does  not require criteria for assessing costs to be documented in QAPs. To  update its best practices in light of the Housing and Economic Recovery  Act (HERA) of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009, NCSHA provided allocating agencies with recommended practices,  including recommendations on cost limits, credit award amounts, and on  fees associated with construction in allocating housing credit and  underwriting projects in 2010. However, allocating agencies have  different ways for determining the reasonableness of project costs. More  specifically, based on our analysis of 58 QAPs and our site visits,  agencies have established various limits against which to evaluate the  reasonableness of submitted costs, such as applying limits on  development costs, total credit awards, developer fees, and builder\u2019s  fees.", "Limits to development costs. NCSHA recommends that each  allocating agency develop a per-unit cost limit standard based on total  development costs. Fourteen of the 58 QAPs we reviewed stated  that total development costs, development costs per unit, or  development costs per square foot were assessed against limits the  agencies established for these cost categories. Of the nine agencies  we visited, four noted that their limits for development costs were  benchmarks determined by costs of similar projects, historical pricing,  and other factors. For instance, the Massachusetts QAP contains  recommended per unit costs using cost information from the agency\u2019s  portfolio. The Illinois QAP contains per square foot and per unit cost  limits, set on the basis of historical data and adjusted for inflation  annually.", "Limits to total credit award. Similarly, agencies placed limits on the  tax credit award amounts that taxpayers can claim per project. While  NCSHA recommends that credit awards be limited to the amount  needed to fill any financing gap for the project, several agencies had  specific limits in their QAPs. According to our QAP analysis, 39 of the  58 noted such limits either as a specific dollar amount or as a  percentage of the total amount of credits available for a given year.  Officials from one agency told us they do not mention the award limit  in the QAP because they did not want to encourage applicants to  seek the maximum award amount. However, agency officials stated  that they evaluate applications against a general maximum award  amount that they do not publicize. At the nine agencies we visited, the  maximum amount taxpayers can claim over the 10-year credit period  ranged from $1 million to $2.5 million per project.", "Limits to fees for developers. The developer fee\u2014payment made to  the developer for its services\u2014is included in the eligible basis.  Because the developer fee is included in the eligible basis from which  the credit award is ultimately calculated, limits on the fee can help  maintain reasonable costs. NCSHA guidance states that the fee  should not exceed 15 percent of total development costs, except for  developments meeting specified criteria (for size, characteristics, or  location) that could cause fees to be higher. Based on our analysis of  2013 QAPs, 40 of 58 agencies specified limits on the value and  calculation of developer fees. Some allocating agencies cited limits as  the lesser of a specific dollar value or a percentage based on the  number of units in a development. For example, the Michigan QAP  notes that developer fees can be no higher than the lesser of 15  percent of total development costs or $2.5 million for buildings with 50  or more units; higher limits (20 percent) may be used for buildings  with 49 units or fewer to create incentives for developers. Other  agencies calculate the fee limit differently, using a percentage of total  development cost minus costs such as acquisition, reserves, or  syndication. Three of the agencies we visited had no developer fee  limits in their QAPs, but two had limits in supplemental documentation  that is publicly available.", "Limits to fees for builders. Agencies also may elect to place limits  on builder\u2019s fees. A builder\u2019s fee is a payment made to the builder and  is included in eligible basis from which the credit award is ultimately  calculated. Similar to the limits on the developer fees, limits on  builder\u2019s fees can help maintain costs. Builder\u2019s profit, builder\u2019s  overhead, or general requirements are common components of  builder\u2019s fees. NCSHA recommends that builder\u2019s profit not exceed 6  percent of construction costs, builder\u2019s overhead not exceed 2 percent  of construction costs, and general requirements not exceed 6 percent  of construction costs. NCSHA notes that the limits should not be  exceeded except for developments with characteristics that may  justify higher fees (such as small size or location in difficult  development areas). Based on our QAP analysis, we found that 34 of  58 noted limits on builder\u2019s fees, but the value and calculations varied.  Some agencies elected to aggregate the fee components into one fee  limit and others set limits for each component of the fees.", "We also found that few QAPs (4 of 58) cited specific circumstances under  which developments could exceed cost or credit award limits, such as the  developer demonstrating need. However, we found that eight of the nine  allocating agencies we visited had policies where applicants could exceed  limits that were specified in their QAPs or internal documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Have Different Processes to Meet Regulatory Requirements for Reviewing Costs at Application, Allocation, and Placed-in-Service", "paragraphs": ["Section 42 requires allocating agencies to review cost information and  determine the credit amount at three different points of time: application,  allocation, and placed-in-service and agencies we visited had different  practices for meeting Treasury requirements at each stage.", "With regard to reviewing costs at the time of application, as we previously  discussed, all nine agencies we visited require applicants to submit  detailed cost and funding estimates, an explanation of sources and uses,  and expected revenues as part of their applications. The allocating  agencies then evaluate the submitted cost estimates based on their  established limits and benchmarks for reasonableness, and the total tax  credit award amount is calculated.  \u201cAllocation\u201d occurs when a project is selected for a tax credit award and  credits are set aside for that specific developer as work on the project  begins. Based on our site visits and project file reviews, the nine agencies  we visited told us that they would respond in different ways if costs  previously reported in a developer\u2019s application increased.", "Five agencies explicitly stated that award amounts would not increase  beyond the amount determined at application, although awards could  decrease if costs were lower than initially estimated.", "Four others stated that award amounts could rise after application due  to cost increases.", "The \u201cplaced-in-service\u201d date is when the first unit of the building is ready  and available for occupancy under state and local laws. Section 42  states that a project must be placed-in-service by the end of the calendar  year in which the tax credits were allocated. A few allocating agencies  require in their QAP that developers submit periodic progress reports to  better ensure that the development will be placed-in-service on time.  According to our QAP analysis, 7 of 58 plans required developers or  owners to submit reports at regular intervals during construction to  monitor progress. Five agencies we visited stated that they monitored  construction progress, and one explicitly described requirements in its  QAP. In addition to progress reports, the others cited practices such as  scheduled meetings with construction staff and visits to project sites as  ways to monitor construction progress to ensure that the placed-in- service deadlines would be met.", "If the project cannot be placed-in-service by that deadline, developers can  apply for a \u201ccarryover allocation\u201d which, if approved, extends the deadline  to be placed in service. Specifically, the project will have to be placed in  service no later than the end of the second calendar year after the agency  approves the carryover request. Section 42 requires proof that at least 10  percent of reasonably expected basis in the project was spent in the 12  months after the execution of a carryover allocation. Treasury  regulations state that allocating agencies may verify this in several ways,  including having a requirement that projects requesting a carryover  allocation must submit an independent report on the progress of  construction spending to the allocating agency. The procedures we  observed at all nine agencies we visited were consistent with the  requirements and all required a report to document the expenditures.  However, we observed that three agencies required report submission in  fewer than 12 months following allocation, a more stringent time frame  than currently in Section 42. Two of these agencies said their deadlines  were more stringent in order to give them enough time to review costs  and provide developers an incentive to start construction earlier."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Does Not Review Agencies\u2019 Criteria for Awarding Discretionary Increases, Which Could Result in Oversubsidizing Projects", "paragraphs": ["Section 42 notes that an increase or \u201cboost\u201d of up to 130 percent in the  eligible basis can be awarded by an allocating agency to a housing  development in a qualified census tract or difficult development area.  Although the boost is applied to the total eligible basis (as opposed to the  total credit amount), the credit amount awarded increases. In addition,  HERA amended Section 42 in 2008 and gave allocating agencies the  discretion to designate any building, regardless of location, as eligible for  a boost of up to 130 percent of the eligible basis. Section 42 requires  allocating agencies to find that \u201cdiscretionary basis boosts\u201d were  necessary for buildings to be financially feasible before granting them to  developers. Section 42 does not require allocating agencies to  document their analysis for financial feasibility (with or without the basis  boost). However, HERA\u2019s legislative history included expectations that  allocating agencies would set standards in their QAPs for which projects  would be allocated additional credits, communicate the reasons for  designating such criteria, and publicly express the basis for allocating  additional credits to a project. In addition, NCSHA recommends that  allocating agencies set standards in their QAPs to determine eligibility  requirements for discretionary basis boosts (those outside of qualified  census tracts and difficult development areas) and make the  determinations available to the public.", "According to our QAP analysis, 44 of 58 plans we reviewed included  criteria for awarding discretionary basis boosts, with 16 plans explicitly  specifying the use of basis boosts for projects that need them for financial  or economic feasibility. Additionally, of the 53 project files we reviewed for  cost information during our site visits, 7 received a discretionary basis  boost. The discretionary boosts were applied to different types of  projects (for example, historic preservation projects, projects in high- foreclosure areas, or projects with enhanced environmental standards)  and on different scales (for example, statewide or citywide).", "In some cases, discretionary boosts were applied more broadly. For  example, during our file review in Virginia, we found one development  that received a boost to the eligible basis for having received certain  green building certifications, although the applicant did not demonstrate  financial need or request the boost. The allocating agency told us that all  projects that earned the specified green building certifications received  the boost automatically, as laid out in its QAP. As mentioned previously,  Virginia compares (1) the award amount calculated from the qualified  basis with (2) the amount calculated based on the project\u2019s existing equity  gap, and subsequently awards the lesser of the two. In this case,  because the application showed that the project\u2019s equity gap was still less  than the credit amount with the basis boost, the allocating agency  awarded a credit amount equal to the equity gap. In response to our  findings during the file review, officials from Virginia\u2019s allocating agency  said that the agency has since changed its practices to prevent automatic  basis boosts from being applied and now requires additional checks for  financial need for boosts.", "Furthermore, one 2013 QAP we reviewed (Arizona) described an  automatic 130 percent statewide boost for all LIHTC developments.  Agency officials told us they first applied the boost in 2009, when credit  pricing was low. According to the officials, the automatic statewide basis  boost remains in effect because officials have made the determination  that nearly all projects will need it for financial feasibility due to limited gap  financing resources. More specifically, resources decreased when the  state legislature decided to use part of the housing trust fund for other  uses. The agency\u2019s 2015 QAP outlines goals for providing low-income  housing in areas with high market demand where the land is frequently  more expensive. All the projects in the most recent competitive funding  round (2015) are expected to receive the 130 percent boost.", "Consistent with our previous report, IRS does not review the criteria  allocating agencies use to award the boosts (most of which are found in  their QAPs). IRS also has not provided guidance to agencies on how to  determine the need for the additional basis to make the project financially  feasible. IRS officials stated that Section 42 gives allocating agencies the  discretion to determine if projects receive a basis boost and does not  require documentation of financial feasibility. Additionally, IRS officials  explained that because the overall amount of subsidies allocated to a  state is limited, the inherent structure of the program discourages states  from oversubsidizing projects, since doing so would reduce the amount of  the remaining allocable subsidies and yield fewer LIHTC projects overall  within a state. However, we observed a range of practices for awarding  discretionary basis boosts, including a blanket basis boost that could  result in fewer projects being subsidized and provide more credits than  are necessary for financial feasibility. In addition, because IRS does not  regularly review QAPs, many of which list criteria for discretionary basis  boosts, IRS is unable to determine the extent to which agency policies  could result in oversubsidizing of projects. In our previous report, we  concluded that IRS\u2019s oversight of allocating agencies and the program  was minimal and recommended that Congress consider designating HUD  as joint administrator of the program based partly on its experience in  administering other affordable housing programs. We continue to believe  that if the program were jointly administered, HUD would be in a better  position (given its housing mission) to provide guidance on discretionary  basis boosts and regularly review allocating agencies\u2019 criteria for  awarding them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Had Processes to Monitor Compliance but IRS Collects Inconsistent Information and Uses Little of It to Assess Extent of Noncompliance in the Program", "paragraphs": ["Allocating agencies are responsible for monitoring the compliance of  LIHTC properties and agencies we visited had processes consistent with  Section 42 and Treasury regulation requirements.

Officials from Nevada noted that inspecting  properties annually helped to detect possible issues in properties earlier.  In addition, officials from Chicago, Michigan, and Rhode Island said they  inspect properties more frequently due to monitoring requirements  associated with other public subsidies that funded the development. For  example, projects funded by HUD\u2019s HOME Investment Partnerships  Program (HOME) can require inspections every 1, 2, or 3 years,  depending on the size of the project. Because HOME is often used as  another financing source within an LIHTC development, these agencies  said they chose to inspect projects every year to satisfy both HOME and  LIHTC requirements.", "Treasury regulations also allow agencies to delegate compliance  monitoring functions to a private contractor as long as the allocating  agency retains the responsibility for notifying IRS about noncompliance.  Two agencies, Michigan and Massachusetts, contracted monitoring to  third-party firms due to agency preference to use contractors and  resource constraints. In addition, Treasury regulations require that the  allocating agency ensure that its authorized delegate (third-party  contractor) properly performs the delegated functions. Both agencies\u2019  contracts with the third parties outlined responsibilities, time frames, and  performance reports to the allocating agency. For instance,  Massachusetts receives quarterly and annual performance reports for all  inspections and Michigan has contractors upload inspection findings to an  electronic database for review.", "Agencies we visited generally used electronic databases to track the  frequency of inspections, file reviews, and certifications, although most  agencies documented these reviews (such as inspection checklists and  file review worksheets) on paper.

The  remaining two agencies kept and updated spreadsheets that included  similar information. In addition, agencies we visited generally had  processes to help ensure and improve the reliability, accuracy, and  completeness of database information. For example, officials from  Virginia noted that they have started combining databases that contain  information on compliance with databases that contain application  information to make their datasets more complete.", "All agencies we visited had inspection and review processes in place to  monitor projects following the 15-year compliance period, as required  under Section 42. As we previously mentioned, allocating agencies must  execute an extended low-income housing commitment to remain  affordable for a minimum of 30 years before a tax credit project can  receive credits. After the compliance period is over, the obligation for  allocating agencies to report to IRS on compliance issues ends and  investors are no longer at risk for tax credit recapture. Four agencies  (California; Michigan; Nevada; and Washington, D.C.) also chose to  reduce various requirements for compliance monitoring in this time frame,  such as the percentage of units sampled or the frequency of review. For  example, during the extended-use period, Michigan officials stated that  they will conduct physical inspections once every 5 years rather than  once every 3 years.", "Although investors are not at risk for tax credit recapture after the 15-year  compliance period, agencies we visited have implemented policies to  encourage compliance during the extended-use period. Specifically, all  nine agencies established criteria that deduct points from or affect a  developer\u2019s future application if prior LIHTC developments had  noncompliance issues during and beyond the 15-year compliance period.

Treasury regulations also state that agencies must report any  noncompliance issues of which they become aware, including through  physical inspections and tenant file reviews. The regulations also require  that an allocating agency submit a form regardless of whether the owner  remedied the noncompliance. That is, allocating agencies must send IRS  forms with information on both uncorrected and corrected noncompliance  issues. As of April 2016, IRS had received approximately 214,000 Form  8823s since calendar year 2009 (an average of nearly 27,000 forms a  year).", "As shown in figure 2, the form includes information on the number of  LIHTC units in the building, dates of noncompliance, and a list of  categories to describe the type of noncompliance.

The guide notes that the benefits of consistency included enhanced  program administration by IRS. In addition, according to Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, information should be  recorded and communicated to management and others who need it in a  form that enables them to carry out internal control and other  responsibilities. Management also should ensure there are adequate  means of communicating with, and obtaining information from, external  stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving  its goals.", "However, agencies we visited had various practices for submitting Form  8823 to IRS, including different timing of submissions and amounts of  additional detail provided. For example, California, Virginia, and Rhode  Island will not send a Form 8823 for minor violations of the Uniform  Physical Conditions Standards (UPCS)\u2014such as peeling paint or missing  lightbulbs\u2014if the violations were corrected during the inspection.  Officials from these agencies stated they chose not to send forms for  such minor findings because of the administrative burden this creates for  the agency, developers, and IRS. In contrast, Michigan, Nevada, and  Washington, D.C., will send a form (following notification to the owner) for  all instances of reportable noncompliance, whether or not the issue was  resolved during the inspection or the correction period. Partly because of  these different practices, the number of forms the nine agencies told us  they sent to IRS in 2013 varied from 1 to more than 1,700 (see table 2).", "Agencies we visited also submitted different amounts of information to  accompany the Form 8823s. According to the IRS guide, agencies do not  have to describe the noncompliance, but if they submit information with  the form, IRS suggests that it is helpful to identify the unit number, the  date out of compliance and the date corrected, and summarize the  problems with a brief description. A majority of the agencies we visited  send attachments when submitting Form 8823. For instance, Virginia  submits the form with an attachment that includes inspection dates, types  of credits, units reviewed, annual amount of allocation, and explanation of  noncompliance. In contrast, Michigan sends its forms with an attachment  that specifies the unit number but not the specific noncompliance issue,  and Washington, D.C. does not send attachments.", "The timing of actual submission of forms to IRS also varied among  agencies we visited. Treasury regulations require agencies to file a form  no later than 45 days after the end of the correction period. Six agencies  (Virginia, Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Nevada)  followed this time frame and sent forms to IRS on a rolling basis. The  remainder waited until certain points in time to submit the forms. For  example, California, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., sent forms on a  monthly, annual, and biannual basis, respectively. For one of our selected  agencies (Illinois), the timing of submissions to IRS was affected by staff  turnover and the implementation of a new software program. Because of  these changes, officials from this agency noted they had a backlog of  tenant file reviews from 2013 and 2014 to assess for noncompliance and  estimated that they would send Form 8823s to IRS for any previously  identified issues by June 2016.", "Once the allocating agencies submit noncompliance information on Form  8823 to IRS, this federal tax information is protected by law. IRS cannot  share the outcomes of the reported issues with the allocating agencies or  any federal agency without taxpayer consent. All allocating agencies  with which we met confirmed that IRS does not provide them with  information about recapture or resolution of issues after a Form 8823 has  been submitted.", "Factors that contributed to the variety of agency submission practices  include conflicting guidance, different interpretations of the guidance, and  lack of IRS feedback about agency submissions. For example, although  Treasury regulations require allocating agencies to submit a form for any  violation and regardless of whether the owner remedied the  noncompliance, the IRS Guide for Completing Form 8823 notes that  professional judgment should be used by allocating agency officials to  identify \u201csignificant noncompliance issues.\u201d IRS officials told us they are  not communicating with agencies regarding form submission practices or  the application of the IRS guide. Moreover, IRS officials were aware that  agencies might interpret the guidance differently, but were not aware of  the varying interpretations and submission rates among agencies  because, as we describe in more detail in the following section, IRS uses  and analyzes little of the information collected on the Form 8823. Without  IRS clarification of when to send in the Form 8823, allocating agencies  will continue to submit inconsistent noncompliance data to IRS, which will  make it difficult for IRS to efficiently distinguish between minor violations  and severe noncompliance, such as properties with health and safety  issues.

IRS\u2019s Compliance Unit  captures little information from the Form 8823 submissions in its database  and has not tracked the resolution of noncompliance issues or analyzed  trends in noncompliance.

Tax examiners with whom we  spoke noted that they have observed inconsistencies with submissions  from the allocating agencies.

Specifically, IRS has been considering  moving the database to a new and updated server, which will provide  program managers the ability to more easily review noncompliance  issues.

Furthermore, if these types of noncompliance findings on the  Form 8823 were forwarded to the analyst, it could lead to the recapture of  credits. Although the Form 8823 is not the only way IRS can identify and  initiate audits of taxpayers who claim LIHTCs, according to IRS officials,  the majority of LIHTC-related audits of taxpayers that IRS conducted  stemmed from these forms.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  information should be recorded and communicated to management and  others within the entity who need it and in a form and within a time frame  that enables them to carry out their responsibilities. While IRS officials  were aware that they were not reviewing forms with certain  noncompliance issues for audit potential, they noted that IRS lacks the  resources for the one Small Business/Self-Employed Division analyst to  review each form it receives and therefore, decisions were made about  which noncompliance issues should be focused on when determining  audit potential and forwarded to the analyst. IRS does not plan on  updating the categories of noncompliance that have to be forwarded to  the analyst in the Small Business/Self-Employed Division, but officials  stated that IRS continuously evaluates how to most effectively apply its  resources and staff to evaluating forms. However, due to inconsistencies  in form submission by allocating agencies, as previously discussed, IRS  practices for forwarding certain forms, and a lack of database entries for  certain categories of findings, the reviews to determine audit potential are  based on incomplete information. Without a better process to gather  consistent noncompliance information from agencies and regularly review  compliance trends, there is a significant risk that ongoing noncompliance  issues in LIHTC properties may not be detected and that appropriate  actions, including recapture of tax credits, will not be taken."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Expects to Augment Its Databases with LIHTC Information through the Inspection Alignment Initiative, but IRS Was Not Involved in This Effort", "paragraphs": ["While IRS is limited in its ability to identify continuing noncompliance  issues and potential recapture events because it captures and analyzes  little information it collects, HUD is building data on affordable housing  that includes information about LlHTC projects.

Although  the Rental Policy Working Group is working to address 10 areas for  improving collaboration and aligning federal rental policy, the physical  inspection alignment initiative has been one of the most active efforts.  Because properties that have multiple federal funding sources may be  subject to several physical inspections with different standards, the  working group has an initiative to align inspection standards, reporting of  results, frequency, and sample size of units to reduce the number of  duplicative federal physical inspections for these properties. In particular,  the initiative focuses on reducing the number of duplicative inspections for  HUD, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the LIHTC program  properties. In 2011, the working group launched a pilot program for  aligning inspections of such properties, including those subsidized with  LIHTCs. As of April 2016, HUD noted that 31 states were participating in  the physical inspection pilot and that the REAC physical inspection  database has been used to capture the inspection information from these  states. Further, HUD officials expect participation in the pilot to eventually  include all states.", "To bolster its data collection effort, HUD officials also said they plan to  collect physical inspection data from the pilot states for properties solely  subsidized by LIHTC.

IRS oversight of allocating  agencies continues to be minimal, particularly in reviewing QAPs and  allocating agencies\u2019 practices for awarding discretionary basis boosts. As  we concluded in our July 2015 report, although LIHTC is the largest  federal program for increasing the supply of affordable rental housing, it is  a peripheral program for IRS in terms of resources and mission. Without  regular monitoring of allocating agencies, IRS cannot determine the  extent to which agencies comply with program requirements. As a result,  we continue to believe, as we suggested in 2015, that Congress should  consider designating HUD as a joint administrator of the program  responsible for oversight due to its experience and expertise as an  agency with a housing mission. For example, applying HUD\u2019s experience  in administering affordable housing programs to address areas such as  QAP review, federal fair housing goals, and tenant income and rent  issues would provide information, analysis, and potentially guidance on  issues that apply across all allocating agencies.", "Our work for this review highlights the need for clarification to guidelines  on submitting noncompliance information as well as further collaboration  with HUD and other federal agencies to help IRS improve functions  related to tax enforcement. The reasons for inconsistent reporting of  noncompliance on Form 8823 include conflicting guidance, different  interpretations of the guidance, and lack of IRS feedback about agency  submissions. Clarifying what to submit and when\u2014in collaboration with  the allocating agencies and Treasury\u2014could help IRS improve the quality  of the noncompliance information it receives and help ensure that any  new guidance is consistent with Treasury regulations. In addition, IRS has  not taken advantage of the important progress HUD has made through  the Rental Policy Working Group to augment its databases with LIHTC  property inspection data. This data collection effort has created  opportunities for HUD to share inspection data with IRS that could  improve the effectiveness of reviews for LIHTC noncompliance. However,  the IRS division managing the LlHTC program is not involved in the  Rental Policy Working Group. Such involvement would allow IRS to  leverage existing resources, augment its information on noncompliance,  and better understand the prevalence of noncompliance. Specifically, IRS  is missing an opportunity to identify pertinent information on LIHTC  properties in REAC databases that could help IRS reevaluate how the  Form 8823 can be revised to better capture the most significant  information from allocating agencies. The information also could help IRS  reevaluate which categories of noncompliance should be further reviewed  for audit potential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making the following three recommendations:  To receive more consistent information on LIHTC noncompliance, the IRS  Commissioner should collaborate with the allocating agencies to clarify  when allocating agencies should report such information on the Form  8823 (report of noncompliance or building disposition).

IRS and HUD provided written comments that are  reprinted in appendixes II and III. Treasury did not provide any comments  on the findings or recommendations. All three agencies provided  technical comments that were incorporated, as appropriate. We also  provided a draft to the National Council of State Housing Agencies  (NCSHA), a nonprofit organization that represents the allocating  agencies, for its review and comment. NCSHA provided written  comments that are reprinted in appendix IV.", "IRS agreed that it should improve noncompliance reporting and data  collection, but added that it would have to consider whether it has the  resources to implement the recommendations. For example, IRS wrote  that it would commit staff time to attend a few of the Rental Policy  Working Group meetings to ascertain whether participation would be  cost-effective. IRS noted that the working group was established to  address fair housing concerns and cannot address tax matters. The  Rental Policy Working Group is addressing 10 areas of concern, including  fair housing compliance, for improving collaboration and aligning federal  rental policy. However, the pilot to reduce the costs and increase the  efficiency of physical inspections has been one of the most active efforts  undertaken by the Rental Policy Working Group to date. Moreover, as  noted in this report, the physical condition of projects is a component of  program compliance, which affects taxpayers\u2019 eligibility to claim the tax  credit. IRS also stated that the REAC information is limited because not  all the states are involved with the data collection effort and the REAC  database contains properties that are not LIHTC properties. Although not  all states are involved in the pilot to align physical inspections, the  number of participating states has grown from 6 in 2011 to 31 in 2016.  HUD officials expect participation in the physical inspection pilot to further  expand and eventually include all states. HUD also plans to expand the  electronic collection of inspection reports of properties solely subsidized  by LIHTC. As we state in the report, IRS could have a better  understanding of the prevalence of noncompliance by using REAC\u2019s  computerized data on and analysis of the physical condition of  properties\u2014a capability that IRS does not currently have. It could also  help IRS evaluate how the Form 8823 can be revised to better capture  noncompliance information from allocating agencies and help IRS  determine which categories of noncompliance should be further reviewed  for audit potential.", "While we understand that IRS has limited resources, leveraging HUD\u2019s  work with the Rental Policy Working Group pilot and accessing REAC\u2019s  computerized system could result in cost savings. IRS noted that it  provides extensive information to allocating agencies through its audit  technique guide, but, as we noted in the report, allocating agencies have  been interpreting the guide differently, which results in the agencies  inconsistently reporting the data to IRS. Additionally, allocating agencies  send thousands of Form 8823s to IRS\u2019s Low-Income Housing Credit  Compliance Unit in Philadelphia that are not entered into a database or  considered for audit each year. Instead, as we note in our report, many of  these files are held for 3 years at the Compliance Unit and then moved to  the Federal Records Center for another 15 years before being destroyed.", "Using REAC\u2019s database with assistance from HUD could allow IRS to  analyze noncompliance information over time, by state, by property, or by  developer, which are capabilities currently unavailable to IRS.", "In HUD\u2019s comments, it stated that with regard to our July 2015  recommendation calling for enhanced interagency coordination, it  remains supportive of mechanisms to use its expertise and experience  administering housing programs to enhance the effectiveness of LIHTC.  HUD stated that it will continue its work in areas such as fair housing and  physical inspection protocols in order to help the LIHTC program perform  more effectively. As our report noted, applying HUD\u2019s experience in  administering affordable housing programs to address areas such as  QAP review, federal fair housing goals, and tenant income and rent  issues could provide information, analysis, and potentially guidance on  issues that apply across all allocating agencies.", "In its comments, NCSHA reiterated its disagreement with our previous  recommendation to Congress, noting that introducing HUD as a co- administrator would reduce program effectiveness or potentially result in  HUD micromanaging allocating agency decisions. We disagree because  the findings from this report highlight specific areas in which HUD would  enhance the administrative support and oversight of the program from a  federal level. For example, this report shows that HUD could apply its  experience in administering affordable housing programs\u2014including  collecting physical inspection data, analyzing noncompliance trends, and  reviewing fair housing issues\u2014that could result in guidance to support the  work done at the allocating agencies. IRS would still retain all  responsibilities related to tax law enforcement. Further, while we did not  make recommendations directly to the allocating agencies, our  recommendations to IRS reflect concerns about some state practices that  we observed, including the missing QAP items and the use of an  automatic basis boost.", "NCSHA also noted that it encourages GAO and others to view the QAPs  broadly as a collection of documents that also include other related  publicly available documents and allocation practices by the agencies.  We recognize that the details of each required preference and selection  criterion may be described in more detail in other documents. However,  the QAP is the sole document required by Section 42, and we maintain  that the plans should be consistent in meeting federal requirements and  transparent about an allocating agency\u2019s practices for awarding credits to  projects. Additionally, we note in our report that IRS does not regularly  review QAPs, but in the few audits it has conducted of allocating  agencies, IRS has identified findings related to the QAPs, such as  missing preferences and selection criteria. For those audits, IRS  recommended that the QAP document\u2014not auxiliary documents\u2014  should be updated to address the identified deficiencies. Leveraging HUD  in the oversight process could help ensure that QAPs are reviewed  regularly and meet minimal federal requirements.", "Finally, NCSHA states that GAO seems to confuse the financial feasibility  analysis with standards states may set for eligibility for the discretionary  basis boost. We acknowledge in our report that allocating agencies  conduct financial feasibility and other analyses to determine the  appropriate amount of LIHTCs to award and describe the different  methods we observed in the nine selected agencies. However, as noted  in the report, we observed a range of practices for awarding discretionary  basis boosts, including an automatic basis boost that is applicable to all  LIHTC projects and could lead to fewer projects being subsidized.  Further, because IRS does not regularly review QAPs that list criteria for  discretionary basis boosts, IRS is unable to determine the prevalence of  these types of policies among allocating agencies that could result in  oversubsidizing projects. Furthermore, continuance of such policies could  establish a precedent for other states to adopt. NCSHA wrote that nothing  in Section 42 directs IRS to provide guidance about discretionary basis  boosts. Although not explicit in Section 42, we maintain that federal  agencies and state allocating agencies\u2014acting as stewards of federal  resources\u2014have the responsibility to efficiently use such resources to the  best of their ability, particularly in what NCSHA has accurately noted as a  resource-constrained environment.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

For our analysis, which primarily focused on  information in the QAPs themselves, we developed a Data Collection  Instrument (DCI). To help determine what questions to include, we  reviewed a small sample of plans to ascertain what types of information  were available in QAPs and interviewed housing groups, academics, the  National Council of State Housing Agencies (NCSHA), and officials from  IRS and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

We assessed the reliability of the  databases that contained the information at each allocating agency by  reviewing documentation (such as data dictionaries and database  manuals) and interviewing the relevant officials responsible for  administering and overseeing the databases. We determined the data  were reliable for the purpose of selecting files for our review. For the file  review, we also used a checklist to help ensure that we were capturing  consistent and pertinent information from each file.
