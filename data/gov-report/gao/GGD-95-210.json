At the end of 1984, mutual funds managed assets totaling about $371 billion. By 1990 managed assets had grown to over $1 trillion, and by December 1994 this figure had doubled to about $2.2 trillion, second only to the $2.4 trillion in total deposits held in U.S. commercial banks.", "According to the Investment Company Institute (ICI), the national trade association of the mutual fund industry, there are a number of reasons for the industry\u2019s growth. These include appreciation in the value of assets held by the mutual funds; additional purchases by existing shareholders; the introduction of new types of products and services; the growth of the retirement plan market; increased investment by institutional investors; the introduction of new distribution channels\u2014such as banks; and a shift by individual investors from direct investments in stocks, bonds, and other securities to investment in securities through mutual funds. Also, in recent years investors have shifted to mutual funds in an attempt to obtain a better investment return than has been available through alternative investments, such as certificates of deposit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A mutual fund, formally known as an open-end investment company, pools the money of many investors. These investors, which can be either individuals or institutions, have similar investment objectives, such as maximizing income or having their investment capital appreciate in value. Their money is invested by a professional manager in a variety of securities to help the investors in the fund reach their objectives. By investing in a mutual fund, investors are able to obtain the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of securities rather than a limited number of securities. This can lessen the risks of ownership. In addition, investors gain access to professional money managers, whose services they might otherwise be unable to obtain or afford.", "Each dollar that an investor puts into a mutual fund represents some portion of ownership in that fund. Funds must calculate their share price on days on which purchase or redemption requests have been made based on the market value of the assets in the fund\u2019s portfolio, after expenses, divided by the number of shares outstanding. This leads to a figure known as the net asset value (NAV). Per-share values change as the value of the assets in the fund\u2019s portfolio changes. Investors can sell their shares back to the fund at any time at the current NAV. Many newspapers carry the purchase and redemption prices for mutual funds on a daily basis.", "A mutual fund is owned by its hundreds or thousands of shareholders. A board of directors is responsible for overseeing the fund\u2019s investment policies and objectives. The board generally does not do the work of the fund itself, but instead contracts with third parties to provide the necessary services. The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that at least 40 percent of the board of directors be independent of the fund, its adviser, and underwriter. One of the functions of the board is to approve the mutual fund\u2019s contracts with its investment adviser. The investment adviser plays a key role in the operation of a mutual fund. The investment adviser manages the fund\u2019s investment portfolio by deciding what securities to buy and sell in accordance with the fund\u2019s stated investment objectives. Other functions of the board include choosing the administrator, who generally acts as the fund\u2019s manager by keeping the books and records, filing necessary reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and calculating NAV; the distributor or \u201cunderwriter,\u201d who either sells the fund\u2019s shares directly to the public or enters into agreements with broker-dealers or banks that will in turn sell them to retail customers; the transfer agent, who keeps track of fund shareholders and maintains information about the number of shares owned by investors; and the custodian, who is responsible for safeguarding the cash and securities assets of the fund, paying for securities when they are purchased by the fund, and collecting the income due when securities are sold.", "Mutual funds are sold to the public in two basic ways: directly to the public or through a sales force, such as a broker. With direct marketing, funds often solicit customers through newspaper, television, and magazine advertising or direct mail. These funds typically have low or no sales fees, or \u201cloads.\u201d Funds that are marketed primarily through a sales force are usually available through a variety of channels, including brokers, financial planners, banks, and insurance agents.

The Advisers Act also imposes reporting requirements on registered investment advisers and subjects them to restrictions against fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices.", "The Securities Act of 1933 requires that all publicly offered shares of any issuer, including mutual funds, be registered with SEC.

SEC reviews disclosure documents, such as prospectuses, and inspects mutual fund operations. It also registers and inspects investment advisers. Broker-dealers who sell mutual funds are regulated and examined by SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). NASD was established pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a self-regulatory organization for brokerage firms, including those that engage in mutual fund distribution, and is itself subject to SEC\u2019s oversight. SEC and NASD regulate broker-dealers by regularly examining broker-dealer operations on-site and investigating customer complaints. NASD has also established Rules of Fair Practice, which govern standards for advertising and sales literature, including filing requirements, review procedures, approval and recordkeeping obligations, and general standards.

One such law is the Glass-Steagall Act, which was enacted in 1933. The Glass-Steagall Act was designed to curb perceived securities abuses and speculative investments by banks that were thought to have contributed to the collapse of commercial banking in the early 1930s. The act prohibits certain securities activities by banks and their affiliates. For example, the act generally prohibits all banks from underwriting (publicly distributing new issues of securities) and dealing (trading for its own account) in certain securities directly. It also prohibits Federal Reserve System member banks from purchasing certain securities for the bank\u2019s own account and from having interlocking management relationships with firms that are engaged primarily or principally in underwriting securities.Until the early 1980s, Glass-Steagall was viewed as prohibiting banks from engaging in most mutual fund activities. Since then, a series of federal banking agency decisions and court rulings have eroded the Glass-Steagall restrictions and allowed banks to engage in a wide variety of mutual fund activities that had not been permitted previously. These include serving as the investment adviser to a mutual fund, selling mutual funds to retail and institutional customers, and offering various administrative services, such as recordkeeping and custodial functions. Essentially, banks can now do everything but underwrite a mutual fund.", "While the Glass-Steagall Act restricts banks\u2019 mutual fund activities, the actual powers granted banks to engage in these activities and the framework for their regulation and oversight are found in other laws. The powers of national banks to engage in mutual fund activities are contained in the National Bank Act, which is administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). State-chartered banks derive their powers from the state laws under which they are chartered, subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act if they are members of the Federal Reserve System. State-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System are supervised by the Federal Reserve Board as well as by state-level banking authorities. Federally insured state-chartered banks that are not Federal Reserve members are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and state banking authorities. The powers of bank holding companies are found in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which is administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The authority for thrifts and their affiliates to engage in mutual fund activities is contained in federal and state laws applicable to savings and loan associations, particularly the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

Our objectives were to (1) determine the extent and nature of bank and thrift involvement in mutual fund sales, (2) assess whether the sales practices followed by banks and thrifts provide bank customers adequate disclosures of the risks of investing in mutual funds, and (3) analyze whether the existing framework for regulation and oversight of bank and thrift mutual fund sales practices and proprietary fund operations adequately protects investors.", "To determine the extent and nature of bank and thrift involvement in mutual fund sales, we gathered and analyzed information on the size of the mutual fund market, the level of bank and thrift participation in it, and the methods by which banks and thrifts market mutual funds to their customers. To do this, we obtained data from Lipper Analytical Services, Incorporated, a well-known source of data on the mutual fund industry. Lipper maintains a database of information on bank-related mutual funds and publishes a semiannual report, \u201cLipper Bank-Related Fund Analysis,\u201d which we used as a source for some of the information in this report. We also used other information accumulated by Lipper on the mutual fund industry as a whole. We did not verify the data we obtained from Lipper; however, we asked Lipper to provide us a detailed description of the methods it uses to accumulate data and the internal controls it employs to ensure its accuracy. We used the description to determine that these methods and controls would provide reasonable assurance that the information supplied by Lipper was accurate. In addition, we determined that Lipper\u2019s mutual fund data are widely used in the financial services industry and are considered reliable by those who use it. Because Lipper\u2019s database does not cover the extent to which nonproprietary funds are sold through banks, we also surveyed a random sample of 2,610 banks and 850 thrifts to obtain comprehensive data on which of these institutions offer mutual funds for sale, the types of funds they sold, and their recent sales data. In addition, to obtain additional information on the characteristics of mutual fund sales through banks and thrifts, we reviewed pertinent regulatory and industry studies, particularly a survey of mutual funds that was released by ICI in November 1994.", "To determine whether the sales practices followed by banks and thrifts provide bank customers adequate disclosures of the risks of investing in mutual funds, we developed and mailed a questionnaire to a random sample of banks and thrifts asking these institutions to provide information concerning how and by whom mutual funds are sold to retail customers, how sales personnel are compensated, whether written policies and procedures have been established, and the types of disclosures that are made to retail customers. Posing as bank customers interested in a mutual fund investment, we also visited a randomly selected sample of 89 central offices of banks and thrifts in 12 cities. The purpose of these visits was to observe and document the sales practices of institutions selling mutual funds and to test whether salespersons were following the federal banking regulators\u2019 guidance concerning mutual fund sales programs. A detailed explanation of the methodology we used in our survey questionnaire and in our visits to banks and thrifts is contained in appendix I.", "To gain an understanding of how the existing regulatory framework for overseeing bank sales of mutual funds protects investors, we (1) interviewed selected bank and thrift regulators, securities regulators, bank and thrift officials, and industry representatives in Washington, D.C.; New York, New York; Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Francisco, California; and Chicago, Illinois; (2) reviewed relevant literature, congressional testimony, studies, regulations, and laws; and (3) reviewed and analyzed financial regulators\u2019 examination policies, procedures, reports, and workpapers.", "We did our work between May 1993 and December 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We provided a draft of this report to FDIC, the Federal Reserve, NASD, OCC, OTS, and SEC for comment.

Many institutions have established their own families of mutual funds, called proprietary funds, and the sales of these funds as a percentage of total industry sales have grown sharply. Banks and thrifts have also become major sales outlets for nonproprietary mutual funds. Institutions with assets greater than $1 billion are more likely to sell mutual funds than are those with less assets, but most of the institutions that have begun selling mutual funds since the end of 1991 are the smaller ones.

Although banks greatly increased their sales of mutual funds to retail customers during the 5 years, the increase in their sales to institutional customers was even greater. Retail sales grew by 324 percent, and institutional sales grew by 443 percent. Nearly $119 billion of the $219 billion (54 percent) of the assets in bank proprietary funds at year-end 1993 were in funds marketed primarily to institutional customers.

In addition, ICI found that about 55 percent of banks\u2019 sales of fixed-income and equity funds in 1991 was attributable to sales of nonproprietary funds. This figure rose to 59 percent in 1992, then dropped to 51 percent in 1993. An ICI official told us that the increase in bank sales of nonproprietary funds in 1992 was caused by a strong demand for equity funds\u2014a segment of the market in which bank proprietary funds were not as well represented as were nonproprietary funds. In 1993, there was a surge in demand for fixed-income funds, a segment in which bank funds were well represented. Also, by 1993 banks had introduced more equity funds.

In breaking down the total between money market funds and long-term funds (fixed-income and equity funds), ICI found that in 1993, nearly 29 percent of all money market fund assets were attributable to bank and thrift sales. Less than 9 percent of long-term fund assets were attributable to bank and thrift sales, indicating the relatively strong presence of banking institutions in the money market fund area.

The bank now offers a full line of investment products and recognizes this as a key customer service and revenue-generator. A July 1994 survey by Dalbar Financial Services, Inc., of Boston, Massachusetts, a mutual funds research and consulting firm, confirmed that fee income becomes more important as a mutual fund sales program matures. Dalbar\u2019s survey of over 200 bank executives indicated that while almost half of the respondents said they got into the business to retain customers, only 36 percent said that was still their top priority.

According to SEC, because investors who purchase securities on the premises of a financial institution may not be aware that the securities are not guaranteed by that institution or by the federal government, the payment of referral fees creates an inappropriate incentive for unqualified bank employees to offer unauthorized investment advice to their customers. In addition, in December 1994, NASD issued a notice requesting comment on proposed amendments to its rules governing broker-dealers operating on the premises of financial institutions. Under these proposed rules changes, broker-dealers would be prohibited from making any payments, including referral fees, to individuals employed with the financial institution who are not registered representatives of the broker-dealer.

Money market funds, in particular, must disclose prominently that their shares are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, and that there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share. In addition, SEC requires disclosure by bank-sold and bank-advised funds that their shares are not deposits or guaranteed by the bank or insured by any U.S. government agency. Mutual fund advertisements and sales literature are required to be filed with NASD (if the fund\u2019s shares are sold by an NASD member) or with SEC. According to SEC, as a practical matter, most fund ads and sales literature are filed with NASD rather than with SEC. NASD\u2019s advertising department is to review advertisements and sales literature for compliance with both SEC\u2019s rules and the NASD Rules of Fair Practice.", "In addition to the requirements of the securities regulators, the banking regulators\u2019 guidance states that advertisements and other promotional and sales material about nondeposit investment products sold to retail customers of depository institutions should conspicuously disclose that these products are not insured by FDIC; are not a deposit or other obligation of, or guaranteed by, the institution; and are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of principal. When we visited banks, we obtained sales literature for proprietary funds, which we analyzed to determine if it contained the required disclosures. In total, we analyzed 26 documents that we obtained at 15 banks. All of the documents we reviewed stated that the funds are not insured by FDIC and not guaranteed by the bank. All but three documents cautioned that mutual fund investments are subject to investment risks, including loss of principal, and all but four disclosed that mutual fund investments are not bank deposits.", "We also reviewed the literature to determine whether it complied with the interagency guidance instructions that the risks be presented in a conspicuous, clear, and concise manner. We did this by looking at the placement of the disclosures, the size of the print used, the segregation of information in the literature as it pertains to FDIC-insured and noninsured products, and by making judgments about whether any obviously misleading or confusing information was presented. We were particularly concerned with whether any of the sales or marketing brochures suggested or conveyed any inaccurate or misleading impressions that the mutual funds were insured products or guaranteed. In our subjective evaluation, nearly half of the sales literature had disclosures that were conspicuous and readable to a great or very great extent. However, we characterized about 15 percent of the literature as having little or no success in achieving this objective. None of the advertising and sales brochures describing mutual fund products that we reviewed had the FDIC-insured logo or \u201cMember FDIC\u201d imprinted on them. \u201cThe disclosure information on risks is located at the bottom of the back page in very small print. It is very difficult to locate and read. In general, I do not believe the brochure gives proper emphasis to the fact that these funds are not insured by FDIC and may mislead someone into thinking that these funds are backed or guaranteed by the bank. All four brochures have the disclosure statement in small print on the back cover. There is no further discussion of those points in the literature and, in my opinion, the point could be easily overlooked.\u201d \u201cThe brochure we received on behalf of the bank itself was an introductory booklet with application materials. This material all contained the required disclosures basically, although the disclosures do not state lack of FDIC insurance specifically, and disclosures are very small and are placed at the very back, bottom of the page. Very poor job of disclosing risks and uninsured nature. Also, much information is given in the brochure that would give the impression of a very safe, almost guaranteed investment, and very high returns. \u201c \u201cOne possible misleading or confusing statement is that the bank\u2019s name is used on the cover  without clearly identifying it as an investment instrument of the securities firm, and not the bank. Another piece of literature in the packet states that the funds are managed by investment professionals at the bank. Finally, the one page disclosure form is covered by other material and is the last item on the right-hand side. However, the disclosure form does have a section for the investor\u2019s signature. The disclosure form is very effective, but it was the last item placed in the information packet. Nowhere in the first five plus pages was there any mention of the four required elements.

For example, one bank told us that both proprietary and nonproprietary funds pay a commission of 3.2 percent, but an extra 15 percent is added to the amount of the commission for a proprietary fund. We also asked the banks and thrifts that received our questionnaire to indicate whether or not sales personnel were expected to meet quotas or targets for the sale of proprietary funds. Eighteen percent of the banks that sold proprietary funds responded that sales personnel were expected to meet sales quotas or targets for proprietary fund sales.

However, the guidance states that the institution\u2019s written policies and procedures should include the permissible uses of customer information, but the guidance does not suggest what would or would not be permissible uses. Whether banking institutions should be allowed to share financial information on their customers with broker-dealers is a controversial issue. In March 1994, the North American Securities Administrators Association testified in favor of placing a prohibition on banks\u2019 sharing confidential customer information with any affiliated securities operations. Also, NASD\u2019s December 1994 proposed rule governing broker-dealers operating on bank premises included a provision that would prohibit its members from using confidential financial information maintained by the financial institution to solicit customers for its broker-dealer services. As of March 1995, NASD was still evaluating comments on its proposal. However, reports in banking industry journals indicated that many banks and banking regulators were strongly opposed to the rule. They characterize the rule as being unfair because (1) nonbank brokerages are permitted to supply their brokers with information about their customers\u2019 use of bank-like services, such as certificates of deposit; and (2) the rule does not clearly define what is meant by confidential customer information. The latter issue could prove to be particularly difficult to resolve. For example, in commenting on a draft of this report, FDIC stated that it knows of no reliable definition of what customer information is confidential and what information is public.

OCC officials told us that these examination procedures are being used during the scheduled safety and soundness examination for each bank, which is either once every 12 months for large national banks, or once every 18 months for smaller national banks.

The questionnaire includes a variety of questions on whether the bank is complying with various provisions of the interagency guidance. Copies of the completed questionnaires are to be forwarded to the responsible FDIC regional office, and significant deficiencies found during examinations are to be commented on in the examination report together with the recommended corrective action. An FDIC official told us that as of May 1995 FDIC had not taken enforcement actions against any bank with regard to the operation of the bank\u2019s mutual fund sales program. However, FDIC examiners have found that written agreements between banks and third-party broker-dealers have, in some cases, not been complete. In addition, the examiners have found instances in which banks\u2019 written policies governing their mutual fund programs needed to be more precise.

According to Federal Reserve officials, the examination procedures were being used during annual safety and soundness examinations. All state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System are to be examined using the new procedures by the end of 1995. Federal Reserve officials said that no material abuses have been found, but in some cases better recordkeeping and training of employees were needed. With regard to training of bank employees, Federal Reserve examiners have found some instances in which untrained bank employees were performing duties, such as gathering detailed financial information from customers, that are reserved to either licensed broker-dealers or to bank employees with training equivalent to licensed broker-dealers.

OCC believed that our conclusion that disclosure was inadequate appears to refer to the oral disclosure requirements, and the description of banks\u2019 written disclosure efforts did not support a conclusion of inadequate overall compliance.", "The Federal Reserve commented that since May 1994 its examiners have been confirming that state member banks are aware of, and making efforts to ensure that their sales programs are in conformance with, the guidelines. According to the Federal Reserve in those few cases where its examiners have discovered deficiencies, the banks in question have taken voluntary corrective action to address the problems.", "Our visits to banks were made in March and April 1994. The timing of these visits was dictated by our desire to respond promptly to the Committees\u2019 requests for information on the actual practices being followed by banks and thrifts in the sale of mutual funds. As noted in the report, these requests were driven by concern that customers of banking institutions were confused about how mutual funds differ from insured deposit products. Although our visits occurred shortly after the interagency guidance was issued, each regulator had issued guidance in 1993 that banking institutions should have been following. This guidance largely paralleled the February 1994 interagency guidance. For example, on July 19, 1993, OCC released guidance to national banks that covered many of the same areas that were included, and strengthened, in the February 1994 guidance. The July 1993 OCC guidance called for banks to take steps to separate, as much as possible, retail deposit-taking and retail nondeposit sales functions. It noted that disclosure of the differences between investment products and insured bank deposits needs to be made conspicuously in all written or oral sales presentations, advertising and promotional materials, and statements that included information on both deposit and nondeposit products. Further, it recommended that banks ensure that their sales personnel are properly qualified and adequately trained to sell investment products. Similar guidelines were issued by the Federal Reserve in June 1993, by OTS in September 1993, and by FDIC in October 1993.", "While we believe that the results of our shoppers visits to banks and thrifts accurately portray those banks\u2019 mutual fund sales activities at the time of our visits, we also realize that the institutions\u2019 activities may change over time as the regulators implement their new examination procedures to ensure that the institutions comply with the interagency guidelines. We also believe that compliance with the guidelines is essential to ensure that investors obtain accurate and complete information about mutual fund risks. Thus, we believe that Congress may find it useful in exercising its oversight responsibilities to receive information on the banks\u2019 compliance with the interagency guidelines after the banks and banking regulators have had sufficient time to fully implement their changes. Accordingly, we added a matter for congressional consideration suggesting that once the interagency guidelines have been in place long enough to provide sufficient data for trend analysis, Congress may wish to consider requesting the regulators to provide status reports on the results of their examination efforts. Such reports, for example, could be made a part of congressional oversight hearings.", "We disagree with OCC\u2019s comment that the report captions do not clearly distinguish between oral and written risk disclosures. (See pp. 29 and 37, for example). Further, we tested the extent of oral disclosures because of the importance placed on these disclosures by the interagency guidance. We believe that this is an appropriate emphasis because customers are highly influenced by what they hear during sales presentations. Further, although we found that most sales literature contained the required disclosures, the disclosures were not always clear and conspicuous. This paralleled OCC\u2019s own findings in its September 1994 review of national banks that sold mutual funds. (See pp. 39 and 40.)", "SEC commented that our testing of compliance with the interagency guidelines and discussion of the banking agencies examination procedures, as opposed to compliance with the federal securities laws and rules, appeared to place undue emphasis on the guidelines as a source of consumer protection in this area. SEC summarized the various means by which it and NASD regulate and oversee mutual fund sales practices of broker-dealers, including those operating on bank premises. SEC also outlined the ways in which it and NASD regulate and oversee mutual fund disclosure documents, including registrations, prospectuses, advertising, and sales literature. SEC stated that although the banking regulators\u2019 guidelines are useful, the federal securities laws remain the most important set of investor protection criteria applicable to mutual funds and sales practices of broker-dealers. NASD made similar comments, noting that although the interagency guidelines are directly enforceable over banks and bank employees, they do not provide the bank regulators with direct and equal regulatory authority over SEC-registered NASD member broker-dealers, including the authority to bring enforcement actions for serious violations.", "By using the interagency guidance as criteria to assess the sales practices being followed by banks and thrifts, we did not intend to minimize the importance of securities laws and regulations. Rather, we used the interagency guidance because it provided guidelines that applied to all mutual fund sales on bank premises, including indirectly to broker-dealers working under a contractual arrangement with a bank, and it contained bank-specific requirements that we wanted to test.

Because banks were already subject to federal banking regulation, the securities laws exempted banks from the regulatory scheme provided for brokers and dealers and for investment advisers. However, over the last 2 decades the federal banking regulators and the courts have interpreted the Glass-Steagall Act in ways that allow banks to provide a wide range of brokerage, advisory, and other securities activities comparable to services offered by SEC-registered broker-dealers and investment advisers. Consequently, banks have rapidly expanded their presence in the mutual funds industry.", "Because of the rapid increase in banks\u2019 mutual fund activities, some Members of Congress and the securities regulators have expressed concern that the current regulatory framework and oversight and enforcement mechanisms have not kept up with changes in the market and may no longer be adequate to protect the interests of investors who purchase mutual funds through a bank. SEC has testified that eliminating the banks\u2019 exemptions from registering as broker-dealers and investment advisers would result in better investor protection and allow uniform regulation of securities activities regardless of industry classifications. SEC contends that when banks sell mutual funds directly using their own employees, customers are not afforded the same level of protection as customers who make their purchases through a broker-dealer. Specifically, SEC makes the following arguments:", "Guidelines issued by the banking regulators concerning retail sales of mutual funds are not regulations. Therefore, SEC believes they are not legally enforceable by the bank regulators or customers; are too general; do not contain sufficient provisions for training bank personnel, especially with regard to making suitability determinations; and raise potential problems of regulatory overlap and conflict with respect to registered broker-dealers that assist banks in the sale of securities products.", "The banking regulators\u2019 primary focus is not investor protection, but the safety and soundness of the institution. As a result, SEC believes bank regulators minimize their disclosure of enforcement actions to protect the bank from adverse customer reactions in contrast to securities regulators, who make their enforcement actions a matter of public record to get maximum deterrent effect. SEC also argues that the securities regulators are better trained and have more expertise in assessing suitability determinations; that is, ensuring that customers make investments that are compatible with their income, assets, and investment goals.", "SEC also testified that banks\u2019 exemption from the Investment Advisers Act should be repealed for banks that advise mutual funds and that SEC should have the authority to regulate and inspect the mutual fund advisory and sales activities of banks. In addition, SEC has testified that when banks manage proprietary funds, there may be potential conflicts of interest between the funds and the bank\u2019s other clients\u2014conflicts that SEC may be unable to detect because of its lack of jurisdiction over bank investment advisers.", "In response to criticisms that their guidelines are inadequate, the banking regulators have argued that, in some cases, their guidance exceeds SEC and NASD requirements for nonbank mutual fund companies. For example, they say the guidance requires banks to disclose orally and in writing to potential customers that their mutual fund investments are not FDIC-insured and are subject to market fluctuations in value. Banks are required to ensure that customers sign written statements acknowledging that they understand the risks associated with mutual fund investments. By contrast, nonbank mutual fund customers are not required to sign written statements acknowledging the risks associated with mutual funds.", "Bank regulatory officials also reject the argument that the guidelines represent a less enforceable standard than SEC regulations. The bank regulators have informed banks that the adequacy of their mutual fund operations will be assessed on the basis of the new guidelines during the next scheduled safety and soundness exam. According to the regulators, they will bring any identified deficiencies in bank mutual fund operations to the attention of senior bank managers and directors. The managers and directors will be required to correct these deficiencies within a specified period of time.

If the salesperson is an employee of a broker or is a dual employee, he or she must be registered with NASD and is subject to SEC and NASD oversight.

These employees may do so without registering with NASD or being subject to SEC and NASD rules and oversight.", "Banks that use their own employees to broker securities are not subject to SEC regulation and oversight.

On the basis of these responses, we estimate that about 180 of the 2,300 banking institutions that were selling mutual funds to their retail customers at the end of 1993 did so directly using only their own employees. About 43 percent reported sales by \u201cdual employees\u201d of the bank or thrift (or its affiliate or subsidiary) and a registered broker-dealer, 29 percent through an affiliated or subsidiary broker-dealer organization, and 38 percent through a networking or leasing arrangement with a registered third-party broker-dealer. When we analyzed these results by bank size, we found that small banks were least likely to sell mutual funds directly with their own employees. Only 7 percent of banks with assets less than $150 million reported selling mutual funds exclusively with their own employees. In contrast, about 14 percent of banks with assets between $250 million and $1 billion responded that their own employees, rather than broker-dealers, sold funds at their banks.", "According to the American Bankers Association, banks that choose to offer brokerage services directly through the bank do so because they do not yet have sufficient business to justify the expense of employing a registered broker-dealer. As a result, some in the banking industry have asserted that eliminating banks\u2019 exemption from registering as broker-dealers would unfairly penalize banks that had a small volume of brokerage transactions. To gather information on this issue, we contacted about 80 percent of the banks that reported selling mutual funds through their own employees to find out why they sold funds directly, rather than through a broker-dealer. They cited three reasons for selling funds directly through their own employees: (1) they wanted to maintain control over their relationship with their customers, rather than turn it over to a broker-dealer; (2) they did not do enough business to justify establishing an arrangement with a broker-dealer or setting up their own affiliate; and (3) they sold funds mainly as a convenience to their customers.

This can cause conflict over what rules these broker-dealers are to follow in conducting their mutual fund sales programs and can also cause duplication of effort and an unnecessary burden on the broker-dealer when the regulators carry out examinations of these activities.", "For example, in December 1994, NASD released for comment proposed rules governing broker-dealers operating on the premises of banking institutions. According to NASD, these rules are designed to fill a regulatory void by specifically governing the activities of NASD member bank broker-dealers who conduct a securities business on the premises of a financial institution. They differ from the banking regulators\u2019 interagency guidance in several respects. First, the proposed NASD rules prohibit the payment of referral fees by the broker-dealer to employees of the financial institution. The interagency guidance permits payment of these fees. Second, the proposed rules place restrictions on brokers\u2019 use of the bank\u2019s or thrift\u2019s customer lists that are stricter than the interagency guidance. Specifically, the proposed NASD rules state that confidential financial information maintained by the financial institution can not be used to solicit customers for the brokerage. This appears to rule out the use of information such as certificate of deposit maturity dates and balances. The interagency guidance requires only that the banking institution\u2019s policies and procedures include procedures for the use of information regarding the institution\u2019s customers in connection with the retail sale of nondeposit investment products. Third, the proposed NASD rules appear to place limits on the use of bank or thrift logos in advertising materials. For example, the proposed rules state that advertising and other sales materials that are issued by the broker-dealer must indicate prominently that the broker-dealer services are being provided by the broker-dealer, not the banking institution. Further, the financial institution may only be referenced in a nonprominent manner in advertising or promotional materials solely for the purpose of identifying the location where broker-dealer services are available. In contrast, the interagency guidance requires only that advertising or promotional material clearly identify the company selling the nondeposit investment product and not suggest that the banking institution is the seller.", "NASD\u2019s proposal has generated controversy in the banking industry. According to the financial press, some bankers have complained that the proposed NASD rules hold bank brokerages to standards that are higher than for nonbank brokerages. They point out, for example, that, unlike bank brokerages, nonbank brokerages are not required to disclose that mutual funds are not federally insured. In response, an NASD official said that when a customer deals with a brokerage in a bank, that brokerage has a higher responsibility to ensure that the customer understands the risk involved in investing in securities as compared to savings accounts or certificates of deposit.", "Another area of concern is the potential for overlapping examinations or examinations that may result in conflicting guidance. Under the current regulatory framework, a broker-dealer in a bank could be examined periodically by NASD to determine if it is in compliance with securities rules, by SEC if it is doing an oversight inspection of NASD or is doing an inspection for \u201ccause,\u201d and also by the banking regulators to determine if the bank is complying with the interagency guidance. Although we found that a number of steps have been taken to avoid overlapping and conflicting activities, some problems have not been resolved.", "For example, SEC is concerned that the banking regulators, particularly OCC, have begun to examine registered broker-dealers that sell securities in banks and has plans to examine mutual funds advised by banks. SEC testified that because registered broker-dealers and mutual funds are already subject to regulation by SEC and NASD under the federal securities laws, imposing an additional layer of banking regulator examination and oversight is unnecessary and may result in firms receiving inconsistent guidance on compliance issues.", "Because of SEC\u2019s concern, we reviewed examination guidelines issued by OCC, the Federal Reserve, and FDIC to determine the degree to which they required examiners to review broker-dealer records, especially third-party broker-dealers. OCC\u2019s February 1994 guidelines for examination of retail nondeposit investment sales require that contracts between banks and broker-dealers provide bank examiners access to the records of third-party vendors (broker-dealers). However, the emphasis of the guidelines is on determining whether the bank has exercised the proper management control over the third-party vendor, rather than on a specific examination of the vendor\u2019s operations. For example, the guidelines state that when (1) preliminary examination findings clearly show that bank management has properly discharged its responsibility to oversee the third party\u2019s operations, (2) only a few complaints have been filed against the vendor, and (3) the vendor\u2019s reports to the bank are timely and properly prepared, examiner access to third-party records should generally be limited to reports furnished to bank management by the vendor. The guidelines are not clear, however, as to what actions examiners are to take if these conditions are not met, stating only that \u201cAfter making a judgment about the effectiveness of the oversight of third party vendor sales, complete any other examination procedures that appear appropriate.\u201d", "According to an OCC official, before OCC examiners do a bank inspection, they typically ask the bank to provide the results of the broker-dealer\u2019s last NASD inspection. The NASD inspection report is to be reviewed to determine if it addresses any concerns about the bank\u2019s mutual fund program. If the OCC examiners have concerns about the bank\u2019s mutual fund program, they may do a limited inspection of the broker-dealer\u2019s books and records. OCC may also direct the bank to hire an accounting firm to audit the broker-dealer if the limited OCC inspection identifies problems. This official said that OCC\u2019s inspection approach is designed to avoid duplication by placing on the bank the responsibility for controlling and overseeing the broker-dealer\u2019s operations. During its inspections, OCC is to check the adequacy of these controls and the bank\u2019s oversight of broker-dealer compliance. According to the OCC official, OCC inspections of the broker-dealer should be a rare event if the bank exercises adequate oversight. In commenting on a draft of this report, OCC reiterated that any inspections of third-party broker-dealers would be limited to pertinent books and records and would not be complete examinations.", "The Federal Reserve\u2019s examination guidelines do not contain provisions that imply its examiners will review the operations of a third party in detail. The guidelines state that the examination procedures have been tailored to avoid duplication of examination efforts by relying on the most recent examination results or sales practice review conducted by NASD and provided to the third party. For example, the guidelines state that in making determinations about suitability and sales practices involving registered broker dealers, Federal Reserve examiners should rely on NASD\u2019s review of sales practices or its examination to assess the organization\u2019s compliance with suitability requirements.", "The emphasis of FDIC\u2019s examination guidelines is similar to the Federal Reserve\u2019s. The guidelines state that examinations of banks that have contracts with a third party should focus on the agreement with the third party and the bank\u2019s methods for determining the vendor\u2019s compliance with bank policies and with provisions of the interagency statement.", "Banking and securities regulators have begun to take steps to better coordinate their efforts. In January 1995, NASD and the four banking regulators signed an agreement in principle to coordinate their examinations of broker-dealers selling mutual funds and other nondeposit investment products on bank premises. The agreement calls for the agencies to share examination schedules, NASD to share its examination findings with the banking regulators, referral of any violations of banking or securities laws to the appropriate agencies, and other matters. Also in January 1995, NASD agreed to establish a new committee for bank-affiliated brokerages.

If, for example, the bank serves as the investment adviser to a mutual fund, a pension fund, and private trust funds, SEC can look at the bank\u2019s activities only with respect to the mutual fund.

These examinations are carried out regardless of whether the investment advisory function is also subject to inspection by SEC. While the banking regulators\u2019 examinations have traditionally focused on safety and soundness issues, rather than enforcement of securities laws, OCC is drafting guidelines for examination of mutual fund activities that indicate OCC examiners may attempt to determine whether bank and fund practices comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940. This concerns SEC because it believes such guidelines raise potential problems of conflict and overlap among the regulators.", "OCC officials told us that although the agency has been doing examinations of investment advisers for years as part of the trust examination process, the new examination guidelines will focus examiners\u2019 attention more directly on potential conflicts of interest that can arise when banks advise mutual funds. These potential conflicts of interest may violate securities laws and could enrich fund advisers at the expense of fund investors.", "The Federal Reserve also examines investment advisers in state-chartered member banks and in subsidiaries of bank holding companies. If the investment adviser is the trust department of a state member bank, the examination is to be carried out as part of its examination of trust activities. If the investment adviser is a subsidiary of a bank holding company, on-site inspections are to be conducted as an integral part of bank holding company inspections. Although investment advisory subsidiaries of bank holding companies are required to register with SEC and are subject to SEC supervision and examination, the Federal Reserve\u2019s guidelines note that such examinations are infrequent. Therefore, examinations by Federal Reserve Bank examiners are to be undertaken whenever they consider the investment adviser activities to be significant. Among the factors Federal Reserve examiners are to consider in deciding whether to schedule an examination of an investment advisory subsidiary of a bank holding company are volume and type of activity, date and results of previous Federal Reserve Bank and/or SEC inspections, and the extent of services provided to affiliated banks or trust companies.", "The Federal Reserve\u2019s guidelines for inspections of investment advisory subsidiaries of bank holding companies state that these inspections are primarily focused on safety and soundness considerations and not on compliance with securities laws. The objectives of these inspections are to (1) determine whether the adviser\u2019s organizational structure and management qualifications are satisfactory; (2) evaluate the adequacy of the adviser\u2019s financial condition and internal controls; (3) review the appropriateness of the adviser\u2019s investment practices; (4) determine whether the institution has adequate policies and procedures to prevent self-dealing and similar improper conflicts; and (5) evaluate compliance with bank holding company laws, regulations, and interpretations.", "According to an FDIC official, if an FDIC-regulated bank has an affiliate that provides investment advisory services to a proprietary mutual fund, that entity would be supervised and inspected by the Federal Reserve under the holding company inspection system. In addition, a small number of state nonmember banks provide investment advisory services to mutual funds through their trust departments. FDIC examiners are to inspect these advisers as part of FDIC\u2019s overall trust and compliance examination program.

A similar situation exists in the regulation of investment advisers. We noted, for example, that even when the bank conducts its mutual fund advisory functions in a separate subsidiary, the Federal Reserve continues to conduct its own inspections of these subsidiaries.

SEC reported that as a result of the shift to inspections of smaller, higher risk investment advisers, the assets under management of inspected advisers decreased from $1.7 trillion in 1993 to $520 billion in 1994.

For example, in November 1993 SEC testified that despite efforts to use its resources more effectively, such as by obtaining data in electronic format and beginning development of a risk assessment program for investment companies, it needed more and better trained people to deal with the mutual fund industry. An SEC official told us that SEC needs a total of 300 examiners to inspect investment companies and 210 examiners to inspect investment advisers. At the end of fiscal year 1994, SEC had about 200 staff assigned to inspections of investment companies and about 50 to inspections of investment advisers.", "In December 1993, the Office of Management and Budget approved the hiring of 150 additional investment company examiners (50 each year beginning in fiscal year 1994 through 1996). With the additional staff, SEC plans to perform comprehensive inspections of the 50 largest mutual fund families over a 2-year period. Funds in the other families would be inspected comprehensively about once every 4 years. With respect to investment adviser examiners, in its fiscal year 1996 budget SEC is requesting an additional 193 staff years for the investment adviser inspection activity. If it receives the additional staff, SEC estimates that it will be able to inspect advisers much more frequently than it has in the past. Currently, about 21,000 investment advisers are registered with SEC, but only about 7,000 to 8,000 actually exercise discretion over client assets. According to SEC, it allocates more of its inspection resources to the advisers with discretionary authority and expects to examine these advisers every 6 to 8 years. An SEC official told us that if SEC were required to oversee bank-related investment advisers that are not currently registered with the Commission, it would have little or no effect on their resources because this would add relatively few (fewer than 100) advisers to their total inventory of advisers. Further, SEC staff already examine the activities of many of these advisers during their inspections of the related investment companies.", "Even if SEC acquires additional inspection staff, it will face major challenges in adhering to its planned inspection schedule. There have been time lags in hiring new examiners, and they need to be trained over a period of several months.

The 1940 act requires a mutual fund to place and maintain its securities and similar investments in the custody of a bank with aggregate capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than $500,000; a company that is a member of a national securities exchange; or the fund itself. In practice, the fund custodian is almost always a bank.", "Although the 1940 act does not prohibit a bank from acting as both adviser and custodian for a mutual fund, SEC\u2019s position is that such banks are subject to its self-custody rule. That rule requires that securities and investments of a mutual fund maintained in the custody of the fund must be verified by actual examination by an independent public accountant at least three times a year, two of which must be without prior notice. These requirements, among others, must be satisfied when a bank acts as adviser (or is affiliated with the adviser) and as custodian or subcustodian of a fund. In addition, SEC has advocated changing the 1940 act to subject affiliated bank custodianships to specific SEC rule-making authority.", "Our analysis of the data provided by Lipper showed that as of September 30, 1993, 53 of 114 banks that advised funds also acted as custodians of those funds. According to the SEC official in charge of SEC\u2019s inspections of mutual funds, auditors must file a certificate reflecting securities verification, which SEC examiners typically review when examining the mutual funds. This official noted, however, that the SEC rule requiring verifications three times a year was written when securities were issued in physical form, such as stock certificates. Today, securities are issued in book-entry form rather than in physical form, requiring more elaborate verification procedures. Independent auditors now evaluate the process and controls used by the custodian to make a daily reconciliation of statements of securities held by the mutual fund with the Depository Trust Company (DTC). However, physical examination of pertinent records is still required to review the custodian\u2019s reconciliations.

In addition, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which prohibit banks from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates, do not impose restrictions on the ability of proprietary funds to purchase the securities of companies that are borrowers from an affiliated bank. As a result, securities regulators believe that there is a risk that a bank may use its affiliated mutual fund to purchase securities of a financially troubled borrower of the bank. The indebtedness to the bank would be repaid, but the mutual fund may be left with risky or potentially overvalued assets.", "A Federal Reserve Board attorney told us that while Sections 23A and 23B do not specifically prohibit proprietary funds from purchasing securities from a borrower of the affiliated bank, such activities are generally violations of state conflict-of-interest laws if the participants intend to prop up a weak bank borrower. This official said that the Federal Reserve enforces these laws as part of its examination and compliance process as do state regulators. This official also told us that bank commercial lending departments are prohibited from sharing sensitive loan information with trust departments. However, if a fund purchases the securities of a bank borrower, such an action would not necessarily be considered a violation of the restrictions. Illegality would depend upon the intent of the participants, that is, an intent to rescue a failing corporate borrower. Similarly, a bank intentionally causing an affiliated fund to acquire the securities of a troubled borrower to shore up the borrower\u2019s finances may be in violation of the affiliated transaction provision of the 1940 act, and the bank would be violating its fiduciary obligations as an adviser to the fund.", "Officials of two very large banks that we visited told us that it was possible, even likely, that their proprietary funds would make investments in entities to which the bank had loaned money. For example, a bank official told us that if one were to examine his bank\u2019s loan portfolio, it would not be inconceivable to find IBM as a borrower and, likewise, IBM would probably turn up as one of the stocks held by that bank\u2019s mutual fund family. Even so, this would be coincidental rather than the result of any planned activity, as many of the Fortune 500 companies are likely to be customers of his bank and others like it.

The Board has applied Section 32 to bank holding companies; consequently, a bank holding company with member bank subsidiaries may not have an interlock with a mutual fund.

Therefore, a nonbanking subsidiary of a holding company could have an interlock with a mutual fund.", "Section 32 does not apply to banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve.

In his opinion, the original (1933) concern about a bank exposing itself to risk by acting as principal in the underwriting of securities does not apply to the issue of bank sales of mutual funds because the bank sells mutual funds on an agency basis; since it does not act as principal, it does not expose its capital to risk.", "The major cost of the Glass-Steagall restrictions to banks is that they must contract with unaffiliated distributors that perform underwriting functions in return for fees. One banker told us that the elimination of the Glass-Steagall provisions that prevent commercial banks from underwriting securities would eliminate the banks\u2019 need to hire such organizations and pay such fees.

Banks that sell mutual funds directly through their own employees rather than a broker-dealer generally do so either because they want to maintain control of their customer relationship or they do not have a sufficient volume of business to justify establishing a relationship with a broker-dealer. Eliminating the exemption would allow SEC and self-regulatory organizations, such as NASD, to enforce the securities laws uniformly in connection with the sale of mutual funds. However, the fact that SEC does not now have oversight of direct retail sales by bank employees does not mean that these banks are free to conduct these sales without any supervision. The bank regulators\u2019 interagency guidance applies to all sales activities on the premises of the banking institution, regardless of whether they are done through a broker-dealer or directly by a bank employee, and the banking regulators have taken steps in their examinations to increase their scrutiny of banks\u2019 compliance with the guidance.", "Similarly, removing the exemption from the definition of investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 for banks that advise funds, as suggested by SEC, would allow SEC to more fully inspect previously unregistered advisers to determine that the adviser is carrying out securities transactions in a way that is fair to all of its clients, including the mutual fund. However, removing the exemption may also permit SEC to make limited inspections of bank activities that have been solely within the domain of the banking regulators, such as transactions involving trust accounts. These activities are regularly examined by the banking regulators. The banking regulators\u2019 examinations, however, focus principally on safety and soundness considerations, rather than on compliance with the securities laws.", "Although removing the exemptions would allow the securities regulators to extend their oversight of banks\u2019 mutual fund activities, this action would not, by itself, resolve conflict and overlap among the regulators. This is because the banking regulators in their role of overseeing the safety and soundness of banks would continue to be involved in conducting examinations and issuing rules and guidance on banks\u2019 securities activities. Although the regulators have taken some actions to work more closely together, as in the January 1995 agreement between NASD and the banking regulators on coordinating their examinations, there are areas in which additional coordination would be desirable. For example, although NASD\u2019s December 1994 proposed rules governing securities broker-dealers operating on bank premises paralleled the interagency guidance in many respects, they have caused controversy because they contain provisions that differ from the banking regulators\u2019 interagency guidance. NASD officials commenting on this report said these differences are purposeful and provide a more explicit, well-defined, and enforceable approach to regulating these NASD members. In addition, the banking regulators and SEC do not currently have an agreement to coordinate their oversight of investment advisers similar to the one between NASD and the banking regulators for sales practice examinations.
