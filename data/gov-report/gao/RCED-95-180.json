This information is provided in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to EPA\u2019s most recent estimate, in 1991 about 435,000 facilities used one or more aboveground tanks to store petroleum, refined petroleum products, and nonpetroleum oils. According to a trade group survey, about 83 percent of the tanks that store petroleum and petroleum products had a capacity of 500 barrels or less, while about 5 percent of the tanks had a capacity of 10,000 barrels or more.", "On occasion, these tanks may collapse suddenly or leak gradually over a period of years. For example, two major collapses in 1988 (releasing about 750,000 gallons in Pennsylvania and about 400,000 gallons in California, respectively) contaminated drinking water, damaged private property, killed wildlife, and disrupted businesses. Also, at a facility in Fairfax, Virginia, 100,000 or more gallons leaked into groundwater over a period of years, affecting an area of about 21 acres. Since the leak was discovered in 1990, EPA and others have undertaken extensive actions to monitor it and clean up the affected area.", "EPA regulates ASTs primarily under the authority of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of oil into navigable waters and authorizes the issuance of rules establishing procedures, methods, equipment, and other requirements to prevent the discharge of oil from storage facilities. To implement these provisions, EPA promulgated the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation in 1973. A facility is covered by this regulation if it (1) has an aboveground storage capacity of more than 660 gallons in any single tank, an aggregate aboveground storage capacity of more than 1,320 gallons, or a total underground storage capacity of more than 42,000 gallons; (2) could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into the navigable waters of the United States; and (3) is not transportation-related.", "The regulation requires each AST owner or operator to prepare a spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (SPCC) plan. The plan is required to address (1) the design, operation, and maintenance procedures to prevent spills from occurring and (2) countermeasures to control, contain, clean up, and mitigate the effects of an oil spill that affects navigable water. The facility must arrange for a registered professional engineer to certify the plan and any significant changes to it.", "Following the issuance of our 1989 report, the Congress enacted the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Among other things, the act expanded activities to prevent and prepare for oil spills and to improve facilities\u2019 capability to respond to spills.", "As a result of major oil spills, such as the Pennsylvania spill discussed above, along with our 1989 report and similar findings by EPA itself, the agency proposed revisions to its Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation in October 1991 and February 1993. In February 1993, it also proposed rules to implement the 1990 act\u2019s requirement that owners and operators of certain facilities submit \u201cfacility response plans.\u201d These plans are required of facilities that, because of their location, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging oil into navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.", "In July 1994, EPA completed the portions of the 1993 rules governing facility response plans. However, EPA has not completed the 1991 proposed rulemaking and portions of the 1993 proposed rulemaking dealing with storage tank construction and testing, other portions of the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation, and efforts to collect data for a national inventory of regulated facilities. In its entry in the May 8, 1995, Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations (a compilation of upcoming regulatory actions), EPA indicated that it did not expect to complete the rules before the end of March 1996.", "EPA inspects facilities to help ensure that they comply with the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation. In our 1989 report, we stated that in fiscal year 1988, EPA inspected approximately 1,000 facilities. In fiscal year 1994, EPA\u2019s 10 regional offices inspected 1,852 facilities. The four regions with the most inspections were Region 9 (San Francisco) with 350, Region 6 (Dallas) with 321, Region 10 (Seattle) with 300, and Region 3 (Philadelphia) with 257.", "In its 1990 response to our 1989 report, EPA generally said that it was considering or taking action to implement our seven recommendations on the regulation and inspection of ASTs.

EPA officials said that further action on two of these recommendations is planned but that the timing is uncertain.", "EPA officials told us that the implementation of our recommendations to strengthen these regulations was delayed primarily because of the requirements imposed by the 1990 act and subsequently delegated to EPA. Among other things, the act mandated the issuance of rules requiring the preparation of facility response plans, required the development of area contingency plans, and required a study of the need for liners under ASTs; a report on the results of the study was due within 1 year. The officials said that implementation was also delayed by the difficulties that EPA encountered in obtaining OMB\u2019s approval for a national inventory of regulated facilities. (The inventory is related to EPA\u2019s inspection program, as explained in the next section.) An EPA official said that the agency prefers to complete the proposed rules on tank construction and contingency plan regulations together with the proposed rule relating to inspections.", "Mandating standards for tank construction and testing. In 1989, we reported that EPA\u2019s rules did not incorporate specific standards for constructing and testing ASTs. Therefore, to decrease the chances of damaging oil spills in the future, we recommended that EPA require that ASTs be built and tested in accordance with the industry\u2019s or other specified standards.", "The rules that EPA proposed in 1991 would strengthen the provisions dealing with tank construction but would not require adherence to the industry\u2019s or other standards, a criterion specified in our recommendation. Specifically, the proposed rules would add a new recommendation that the construction, materials, installation, and use of tanks conform with the relevant portions of the industry\u2019s standards but would not convert this recommendation into a requirement.", "In connection with the testing of ASTs, the proposed rules would considerably strengthen current provisions, which is consistent with our 1989 recommendation. The current Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation provides that ASTs \u201cshould\u201d be subject to \u201cperiodic\u201d integrity testing and \u201cshould\u201d be \u201cfrequently\u201d observed for leaks. By contrast, the proposed rules would \u201crequire\u201d integrity testing every 5 years, unless the facility incorporates secondary containment features; in such cases, integrity testing would be required every 10 years and when major repairs are made. In addition, the proposed rules would require the facilities without secondary containment to conduct integrity and leak testing of their valves and piping at least annually.", "Minimizing damage from spilled oil. In 1989, we reported that EPA\u2019s rules addressed containing spilled oil within tank facilities but did not require that tank owners and operators develop plans to deal with oil escaping in large quantities beyond the facilities\u2019 boundaries. Therefore, we recommended that owners and operators be required to develop such response plans. Moreover, because spilled oil could be spread very rapidly through storm water drainage systems, we recommended that the rules require, not merely recommend, that such systems be designed and operated to prevent oil from passing through them.", "The rules issued pursuant to the 1990 act partially implement our recommendation on response plans. These rules, which became effective in August 1994, require that certain oil storage facility owners and operators prepare facility response plans for responding to \u201cworst case\u201d oil discharges or a substantial threat of such a discharge.", "According to an EPA official, EPA expected to receive such plans from about 6,000 facilities\u2014roughly 1 percent of all covered facilities\u2014that pose the greatest risk to the environment. (We were told that approximately 4,500 facilities had submitted plans as of April 1995.) The official said that EPA had no plans to expand the overall rules to cover additional facilities. However, he also noted that the current rules permit EPA\u2019s regional administrators to require the submission of a response plan by certain other facilities that have been determined on a case-by-case basis to present an unusual risk. He estimated that about 1,000 such facilities might be required to submit a response plan.", "The 1991 proposed rules address our recommendation on storm water drainage systems by replacing the guidelines in the current rules with requirements. Generally, the rules would require that drainage from diked storage areas must be restrained by valves or other means to prevent a spill or other excessive leakage of oil into the drainage system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Actions to Strengthen the Inspection Program", "paragraphs": ["EPA is taking steps to implement all four of our recommendations to strengthen the inspection program. However, according to EPA officials, three recommendations will not be fully implemented until 1996, and they are uncertain when the fourth recommendation will be implemented.

EPA could not develop effective inspection priorities because it had little information on the number of facilities or tanks or on their size, age, location, or quality of construction. It needed this type of information to target for inspection those facilities that posed the greatest environmental risk. Accordingly, we recommended that EPA develop a system of inspection priorities on the basis of a national inventory of tanks.", "We found that EPA is working to develop a national inventory of tanks and to develop inspection priorities. In 1991, EPA sought OMB\u2019s approval to collect data from all facilities that might be covered by the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation. However, OMB stated that EPA had not adequately justified the proposed reporting requirements and did not approve the request.", "EPA is undertaking a more limited survey of about 30,000 facilities that are considered most likely to be covered by the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation. After a pilot survey in 1994, the survey instrument was mailed out in April 1995, and the results of the survey are expected in late 1995. The survey requests information on the facilities\u2019 characteristics and operations, the oil tanks\u2019 storage capacity and the product stored, and recent oil spills. Depending on the results of this survey, EPA may seek OMB\u2019s approval to collect limited data from all facilities.", "EPA also expects to use this survey to provide information on regulated facilities. For example, the information could be used to provide a basis for developing inspection priorities. Such targeting is still needed because only a small fraction of the total number of facilities is inspected each year. As previously noted, the number of facilities inspected by EPA nearly doubled between fiscal years 1988 and 1994. Despite the increase, however, EPA inspected less than one-half of 1 percent of all facilities.", "Although EPA has not established overall inspection priorities, it has identified one national priority. It established an expectation that each region will, between fiscal years 1995 and 1997, inspect all of the facilities located in that region that are required to prepare a facility response plan.", "Meanwhile, we were told that EPA has taken other steps to help its regional offices identify the facilities that are likely to be covered by the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation. For example, EPA obtained Dun & Bradstreet data on the facilities in those industries that are considered likely to be regulated and provided this information, for the individual states in each region, to its regional offices.", "According to officials in Regions 3 and 6, which we visited for this review, neither region has a complete inventory of the facilities in the states it covers. Region 3\u2019s SPCC coordinator told us that the region drafted its own targeting strategy in December 1994. She said that various criteria are used to select the facilities to be inspected. These criteria include a facility\u2019s spill history, the facility\u2019s potential to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment, and referrals from federal, state, or local government officials or the public.", "Similarly, according to a Region 6 official, the region targets inspections in the five states it covers by using data on such factors as spill histories, water supplies, and sensitive ecosystems.

Regional officials told us that they relied on the experience and knowledge of individual inspectors rather than on written procedures. To help ensure that inspections are performed thoroughly, establish a record of facilities\u2019 compliance with the rules, and help pinpoint overall problem areas in the industry, we recommended that EPA develop instructions for performing and documenting inspections.", "We found that EPA headquarters still has not developed such instructions, although work to develop uniform procedures has begun. Headquarters officials collected the various regions\u2019 instructions, circulated them to officials in other regions in May, and asked for their comments. The cognizant headquarters official said that he hopes to complete the development of uniform procedures by late 1995.", "We found both similarities and differences in the inspection procedures and documentation developed by the two regions we visited. For example, staff in both regions collect information about a facility before inspecting it. Region 3 staff said that they check whether the facility has had any reported oil spills and may check with the state\u2019s environmental agency for relevant information. Region 6 staff said that they typically visit a facility known to contain ASTs. During this visit, they take photographs and record their observations of the facility\u2019s general condition.", "We noted a difference in regional practices with respect to advance notification. Region 3 staff told us that they usually do not contact a facility before arriving to inspect it. Region 6 staff told us they do notify the facility in advance that they intend to conduct an SPCC inspection.", "Both regions developed inspection checklists, which list items to be checked and also provide a standard format for documenting the inspection results.

We concluded that while some regional differences in the oil storage industry may justify some differences in the training of inspectors, because the Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation is national in scope, inspectors should possess a common body of knowledge and a minimum level of skills to implement the regulation. We recommended that EPA define and implement minimum training needs for inspectors.", "We found that EPA still has no national guidance on the training of SPCC inspectors. However, headquarters officials told us that a work group has begun developing such guidance and should complete it in early 1996.", "Meanwhile, EPA has funded some training-related activities in the regions.

In response to proposed October 1991 revisions to the agency\u2019s Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation, EPA refined its estimate of the number of facilities covered by the SPCC program\u2019s requirements by excluding certain facilities with underground tanks that were covered under other EPA regulations. In August 1994, EPA\u2019s Aboveground Oil Storage Facilities Workgroup produced a draft study of the problem of soil and groundwater contamination due to oil spills and leaks from facilities with ASTs. In December 1994, the agency produced a draft study required by section 4113(a) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 that assessed the technical and economic feasibility of using liners and related systems to detect leaking oil and to prevent it from contaminating soil and navigable waters.", "API has also been active in studying ASTs and publishing AST standards for its members.

The survey report stated that pressurized buried piping has been the most predominant source of contamination in all three sectors over the past 5 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Amount of Product Discharged Because of These Leaks and the Threat to the Environment and Human Health Posed by the Leaks", "paragraphs": ["EPA estimated oil leaks for 75,000 tanks in the petroleum industry with a storage capacity in excess of 42,000 gallons. On the basis of the age of ASTs, the likelihood of developing corrosion leaks, and leak detection thresholds, EPA\u2019s preliminary estimates show that ASTs could be leaking between 43 million and 54 million gallons of oil annually.", "Regarding threat, EPA has found that oil discharge incidents have the potential to cause widespread damage, including contamination of soil, groundwater, and surface water supplies and loss of property. Because several hundred thousand onshore facilities with ASTs are located throughout the United States\u2014many are near sensitive environments, including groundwater and surface water\u2014discharges from ASTs represent a potentially significant environmental hazard. In addition, EPA has stated that oil spill incidents can pose risks to human health.", "According to EPA, although the extent of injuries is unknown, most known injuries to human beings from exposure to oil have occurred as a result of their inhaling its vapors. Effects on humans from exposure to oil include generalized weakness, lethargy, dizziness, convulsions, coma, and death from acute exposure to volatilized constituents by inhalation; cancers of various organs; blood cancers such as leukemia; and generalized suppression of the immune system from chronic exposure by inhalation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Piping for Tank Systems", "paragraphs": ["API\u2019s July 1994 member survey found that 78 percent of refining and 54 percent of marketing facilities have 75 percent or more of their AST-associated piping aboveground. In contrast, most transportation facilities leave the AST-associated piping below ground. According to the report, there are several reasons why the AST-associated piping is buried at transportation facilities. For example, these facilities are frequently remotely located, and as a result, piping is buried to prevent vandalism. The report noted that in certain situations, piping can be moved aboveground. However, safety and operational considerations may require that piping be buried. Inspections, emergency access, repair, exposure to radiant heat, expected settlement, earthquakes, thermal expansion/contraction, tank drainage, and susceptibility to vandalism are all considered when deciding to install piping above or below ground. The survey report stated that where operational and safety considerations allow, the relocation of older buried piping aboveground has been an ongoing practice at facilities in the refining, marketing, and transportation sectors for a number of years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Secondary Containment Structures Being Used Under Tanks", "paragraphs": ["Secondary containment structures are typically designed to contain the entire contents of the tank or tank battery within the structure and serve to contain any spilled oil or product in the event of a leak or sudden discharge. EPA found that secondary containment structures vary greatly, depending on the size of the tanks and the physical characteristics of the facility, and may be constructed of compacted soil, clay, concrete, or other synthetic material. Each of the different types of liners, such as impervious soil, coated or uncoated concrete, and geomembrane liners, can be effective in preventing groundwater contamination and in detecting leaks if properly installed and maintained. Poor maintenance can significantly reduce the effectiveness of certain types of liners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Leak Detection Devices Being Used", "paragraphs": ["According to EPA, current technology has produced a variety of leak detection systems, including alarms, inventory control, acoustic emissions testing, and volumetric measurement, and industry is aggressively developing technology to make leak detection more reliable.", "Leak detection methods are either continuous or periodic. Continuous methods provide uninterrupted monitoring and, consequently, instant notification of tank failure or an oil discharge. Examples of continuous systems are overfill alarms and overfill sumps.", "Periodic leak detection involves checks or tests at regular intervals to determine the occurrence of oil discharges or tank bottom failure.
