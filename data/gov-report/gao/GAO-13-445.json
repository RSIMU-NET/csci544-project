Similarly, the growth rate of expenditures for self-referred anatomic pathology services was higher than for non-self-referred services. Three provider specialties--dermatology, gastroenterology, and urology--accounted for 90 percent of referrals for self-referred anatomic pathology services in 2010.", "Referrals for anatomic pathology services by dermatologists, gastroenterologists, and urologists substantially increased the year after they began to self-refer. Providers that began self-referring in 2009--referred to as switchers--had increases in anatomic pathology services that ranged on average from 14.0 percent to 58.5 percent in 2010 compared to 2008, the year before they began self-referring, across these provider specialties. In comparison, increases in anatomic pathology referrals for providers who continued to self-refer or never self-referred services during this period were much lower. Thus, the increase in anatomic pathology referrals for switchers was not due to a general increase in use of these services among all providers. GAO's examination of all providers that referred an anatomic pathology service in 2010 showed that self-referring providers of the specialties we examined referred more services on average than non-self referring providers. Differences in referral for these services generally persisted after accounting for geography and patient characteristics such as health status and diagnosis. These analyses suggest that financial incentives for self-referring providers were likely a major factor driving the increase in referrals.", "GAO estimates that in 2010, self-referring providers likely referred over 918,000 more anatomic pathology services than if they had performed biopsy procedures at the same rate as and referred the same number of services per biopsy procedure as non-self-referring providers. These additional referrals for anatomic pathology services cost Medicare about $69 million. To the extent that these additional referrals were unnecessary, avoiding them could result in savings to Medicare and beneficiaries, as they share in the cost of services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["CMS should identify self-referred anatomic pathology services and address their higher use.

We focused our review of  anatomic pathology services and service components to services with a  Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code 88305,  which is the code for anatomic pathology services related to the  examination of tissue samples taken through biopsy procedures.

See app. I for our analysis  related to special stains.) We limited the universe for this portion of our  analysis to those anatomic pathology services performed in a provider\u2019s  office or in an independent clinical laboratory. We focused on these  settings because the financial incentive for providers to self-refer is most  direct when the service is performed in a physician office.

Providers differ on  whether or to what extent tissue samples can be combined in creating a  specimen or if each tissue sample must become a specimen. For  example, urologists differ on whether it is clinically appropriate to combine  tissue samples obtained through a prostate biopsy procedure or whether  each tissue sample must became a specimen. The resultant number of  specimens has implications for payment as each specimen submitted for  analysis can be billed to Medicare separately as an anatomic pathology  service. CMS policy states that specimens submitted for individual  examination should be medically reasonable and necessary for diagnosis.

This specific biopsy procedure involves taking  numerous tissue samples\u2014typically 30 to 60\u2014to increase the likelihood  of detecting prostate cancer in a subgroup of high-risk individuals in  whom previous conventional prostate biopsies had been negative.

This additional spending can be attributed  to the fact that self-referring providers in the 3 provider specialties we  examined referred about 918,000 more anatomic pathology services in  2010. In 2013, CMS reduced its payment of anatomic pathology services  because it determined that fewer resources\u2014equipment, supplies, and  non-physician staff\u2014were required to prepare anatomic pathology  services. If the lower 2013 Medicare reimbursement rates for anatomic  pathology services were in effect in 2010, Medicare would have spent  approximately $48 million more than it would have if self-referring  providers performed biopsy procedures at the same rate as and referred  the same number of services per biopsy procedure as non-self-referring  providers of the same provider size and specialty.", "This calculation likely underestimates the total amount of additional  Medicare spending that can be attributed to self-referring providers  because we did not include all Medicare providers in our analysis.

Proponents of self-referral contend that the ability of providers to self-refer  anatomic pathology services has the potential benefit of more rapid  diagnoses and better coordination of care. Our review indicates that  across the major provider specialties that refer beneficiaries for anatomic  pathology services, self-referring providers generally referred more  anatomic pathology services on average than other providers of the same  specialty treating similar numbers of Medicare patients. This increase is  due to a greater number of specimens submitted for examination from  each biopsy procedure, and in certain cases a greater number of biopsy  procedures performed. This increase raises concerns, in part because  biopsy procedures, although generally safe, can result in serious  complications for Medicare beneficiaries. Further, our analysis shows that  across these provider specialties, providers\u2019 referrals for anatomic  pathology services substantially increased the year after they began to  self-refer.", "The relatively higher rate of anatomic pathology services among self- referring providers cannot be explained by patient diagnosis, patient  health status, or geographic location. Taken together, this suggests that  financial incentives for self-referring providers were likely a major factor  driving the increase in anatomic pathology referrals. In 2010, providers  who self-referred made an estimated 918,000 more referrals for anatomic  pathology services than they likely would have if they were not self- referring. Notably, these additional referrals cost CMS about $69 million in  2010 alone. To the extent that these additional services are unnecessary,  avoiding them could result in savings to Medicare and to beneficiaries.", "Despite the potential safety and financial implications of unnecessary  anatomic pathology services, CMS does not have policies to address the  effect of how self-referral affects the utilization of and expenditures for  anatomic pathology services. CMS does not currently have the ability to  identify anatomic pathology services that are self-referred so that the  agency can track the extent to which anatomic pathology services are  self-referred and identify services that may be unnecessary. Specifically,  Medicare claims do not include an indicator or \u201cflag\u201d that identifies  whether services are self-referred or non-self-referred. Thus, CMS does  not currently have a method for easily identifying such services and  cannot determine the effect of self-referral on utilization and expenditures  for anatomic pathology services. Including a self-referral flag on Medicare  Part B claims submitted by providers who bill for anatomic pathology  services is likely the easiest and most cost-effective approach.", "If CMS could readily identify self-referred anatomic pathology services,  the agency may be better positioned to identify potentially inappropriate  utilization of biopsy procedures. CMS could, for example, consider  performing targeted audits of providers who perform a higher average  number of biopsy procedures, compared to providers of the same  specialty treating a similar number of Medicare beneficiaries. Given our  report findings, CMS may want to initially focus its efforts on self-referring  dermatologists who treated a larger number of Medicare beneficiaries.", "While providers have discretion in determining the number of tissue  samples that become specimens, CMS\u2019s current payment system  provides a financial incentive for providers to refer a higher number of  specimens\u2014or anatomic pathology services\u2014per biopsy procedure.  Providers can double their payment for anatomic pathology services, for  example, by submitting four specimens from four tissue samples instead  of combining the four tissue samples into two specimens. However,  providers differ on whether or to what extent tissue samples can be  combined in creating a specimen or if each tissue sample must become a  specimen. CMS has already implemented a payment approach for one  specific biopsy procedure\u2014prostate saturation biopsy\u2014that pays  providers through a single payment rather than paying for each specimen  individually within a given range of anatomic pathology services, such as  1 to 20 specimens.

They also raised the possibility that providers in the switcher group  became further specialized, resulting in a change in the number and type  of diagnoses for their patients.

We then  calculated the change in the number of anatomic pathology referrals  made from 2008 (i.e., the year before the switchers began self-referring)  to 2010 (i.e., the year after they began self-referring). We compared the  change in the number of referrals made by these providers to the change  in the number of referrals made over the same time period by providers  who did not change whether or not they self-referred anatomic pathology  services. Specifically, we compared the change in the number of referrals  made by switchers to those made by (1) self-referring providers\u2014 providers that self-referred in years 2007 through 2010, and (2) non-self- referring providers\u2014providers that did not self-refer in years 2007 through  2010. For each provider, we also identified the most common TIN to  which they referred anatomic pathology services. If the TIN was the same  for all 4 years, we assumed that they remained part of the same practice  for all 4 years. We calculated the number of referrals in 2008 and 2010  separately for providers that met this criterion.", "To determine the implications of self-referral for Medicare spending on  anatomic pathology services, we summed the number of and  expenditures for all anatomic pathology services performed in 2010  across the three provider specialties we reviewed. We then calculated the  number of and expenditures for anatomic pathology services if self- referring providers performed biopsy procedures at the same rate as and  referred the same number of services per biopsy procedure as non-self- referring providers of the same provider size and specialty. We repeated  this analysis incorporating an approximation of the payment reduction for  anatomic pathology services that became effective in 2013.", "We took several steps to ensure that the data used to produce this report  were sufficiently reliable. Specifically, we assessed the reliability of the  CMS data we used by interviewing officials responsible for overseeing  these data sources, including CMS and Medicare contractor officials. We  also reviewed relevant documentation, and examined the data for obvious  errors, such as missing values and values outside of expected ranges.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our study, as they are used by the Medicare program as a record of  payments to health care providers. As such, they are subject to routine  CMS scrutiny.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2012 through June  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Average Number of Medicare Anatomic Pathology Services per Biopsy Procedure for Most Common Diagnoses", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Age and Sex of Medicare Beneficiaries for Select Provider Specialties by Practice Size in 2010", "paragraphs": ["Appendix IV: Age and Sex of Medicare  Beneficiaries for Select Provider Specialties by  Practice Size in 2010 Provider specialty and number of  unique Medicare FFS beneficiaries Dermatology  The number of unique Medicare FFS beneficiaries refers to the number of unique beneficiaries that  received at least one service from a provider.", "The number of unique Medicare FFS beneficiaries refers to the number of unique beneficiaries that  received at least one service from a provider."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Average Number of Medicare Anatomic Pathology Referrals by Provider Self-Referral and Urban-Rural Status in 2010", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Geographic designation Urban", "paragraphs": ["The number of unique Medicare FFS beneficiaries refers to the number of unique beneficiaries that  received at least one service from a provider."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Thomas Walke, Assistant  Director; Todd D.
