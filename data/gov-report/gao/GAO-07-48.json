Under TRICARE, beneficiaries may obtain care through a managed care option that requires enrollment and the use of civilian provider networks, which are developed and managed by contractors. Beneficiaries who do not enroll may receive care through TRICARE Standard, a fee-for-service option, using nonnetwork civilian providers or through TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider organization option, using network civilian providers. Nonenrolled beneficiaries in some locations have reported difficulties finding civilian providers who will accept them as patients. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2004 directed GAO to provide information on access to care for nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries. This report describes (1) how DOD and its contractors evaluate nonenrolled beneficiaries' access to care and the results of these evaluations; (2) impediments to civilian provider acceptance of nonenrolled beneficiaries, and how they are being addressed; and (3) how DOD has implemented the NDAA fiscal year 2004 requirements to take actions to ensure nonenrolled beneficiaries' access to care. To address these objectives, GAO examined DOD's survey results and DOD and contractor documents and interviewed DOD and contractor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD and contractor officials use various methods to evaluate access to care, and according to these officials, their methods indicate that access is generally sufficient for nonenrolled beneficiaries. For example, in its 2005 survey of civilian providers DOD found that 14 percent of civilian providers surveyed in 20 states were not accepting new patients from any health plan. Of those accepting new patients, about 80 percent would accept nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries as new patients. DOD's contractors use various methods to monitor access to care. While these methods were not designed specifically to evaluate access for nonenrolled beneficiaries, they provide information that allows contractors to monitor the availability of both network and nonnetwork civilian providers for this population. According to contractor officials, their measures indicate that nonenrolled beneficiaries' access to care is sufficient overall. DOD, its contractors, and beneficiary and provider representatives cited various factors as impediments to network and nonnetwork civilian providers' acceptance of nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries and ways to address them. These impediments include concerns specific to TRICARE, including reimbursement rates and administrative issues, as well as issues not specific to TRICARE, such as providers without sufficient practice capacity for additional patients. DOD and its contractors have specific ways to address impediments related to reimbursement rates and administrative issues, but issues that are not specific to TRICARE are more difficult to resolve. For example, DOD has authority to increase reimbursement rates for network and nonnetwork civilian providers in areas where access to care has been impaired. Furthermore, other impediments not specific to TRICARE, such as provider practices at capacity and few providers in geographically remote locations, cannot be readily resolved and create access difficulties for all local residents, including TRICARE beneficiaries. Various DOD offices as well as DOD's contractors are already carrying out the responsibilities outlined by the NDAA for fiscal year 2004--such as educating civilian providers and recommending reimbursement rate adjustments--actions that help ensure nonenrolled beneficiaries' access. However, a senior official was not formally designated to have responsibility for these mandated actions. DOD commented on the report, stating that GAO's approach was insightful, but disagreeing with GAO's finding that a senior official was not formally designated to be responsible for taking actions to ensure TRICARE beneficiaries' access to care as outlined in the NDAA. DOD said that an existing directive designating a senior official to serve as program manager for TRICARE met this requirement. However, the directive does not specifically designate an official responsible for ensuring access as specified in the NDAA. Nor did DOD take other actions to designate that a senior official have such responsibilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) offers health care to almost 10 million  beneficiaries, including active duty personnel, retirees, and their  dependents, through its regionally structured TRICARE program, which is  expected to cost about $37 billion in fiscal year 2006. Under TRICARE,  health care is available through the military services\u2019 system of military  hospitals and clinics, referred to as military treatment facilities (MTFs)  and through civilian providers. Although DOD and the military services  strive to maximize the use of MTFs, TRICARE beneficiaries have received  an increasing amount of care through civilian providers. Between fiscal  years 2000 and 2005, the percent of inpatient care delivered to TRICARE  beneficiaries by civilian providers increased from about 50 percent to an  estimated 75 percent. During the same time frame, the percent of  outpatient care delivered by civilian providers increased from 39 percent  to an estimated 65 percent.", "TRICARE has three options for its beneficiaries: Prime, Standard, or  Extra. These options vary according to enrollment requirements, the  choices beneficiaries have in selecting civilian and MTF providers, and the  amount they must contribute towards the cost of their care. Prime, a  program in which beneficiaries receive care in a managed care provider  network similar to a health maintenance organization, is the only option  requiring enrollment and has the lowest copayments. Beneficiaries who  enroll in Prime usually obtain health care from the MTF, but they may also  obtain care from a network civilian provider when MTF care is not  available. Beneficiaries do not need to enroll to receive care under  Standard, a fee-for-service option, or Extra, a preferred provider  organization option. Under Standard, nonenrolled beneficiaries can obtain  health care from civilian providers who do not belong to the TRICARE  network but agree to accept TRICARE beneficiaries as patients.  Beneficiaries have the highest copayments under Standard. Under Extra,  nonenrolled beneficiaries may obtain health care from network civilian  providers. Nonenrolled beneficiaries cannot be categorized as belonging to  an Extra or Standard group because each time they seek care, they can  choose to see either a network or nonnetwork civilian provider, and this  choice determines whether they receive coverage under Extra or  Standard. Under any option, TRICARE beneficiaries may receive care at  an MTF when space is available. Priority for MTF usage is given first to  active duty personnel and then to beneficiaries enrolled in Prime.", "DOD\u2019s TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) uses managed care support  contractors (MCSC) to develop networks of civilian providers and perform  other customer service functions, such as claims processing, and to ensure  that all beneficiaries\u2014including nonenrolled beneficiaries\u2014receive  satisfactory service under TRICARE, such as assistance with finding  providers. Currently, there is one MCSC for each of TRICARE\u2019s three  regions\u2014North, South, and West. For each region, TMA has established a  TRICARE Regional Office (TRO) and has designated the TRO directors as  the health plan managers for their regions with responsibilities such as  monitoring provider network quality and adequacy, overseeing the MCSCs,  and monitoring customer satisfaction.", "Since TRICARE began in 1995, nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries in  some locations have complained about difficulties finding nonnetwork  civilian providers who will accept them as patients. In addition, TRICARE  beneficiaries have cited concerns that TMA has focused more attention on  the Prime option, which allows TMA to manage beneficiaries\u2019 care, and  has given less attention to the options available for nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries. In response to these concerns, the National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2004 directed DOD to monitor  nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to care through a survey of  civilian providers. In addition, the NDAA required DOD to designate a  senior official to take actions to ensure access to care for nonenrolled  TRICARE beneficiaries.", "The NDAA for fiscal year 2004 also directed GAO to review the processes,  procedures, and analysis used by DOD to determine the adequacy of the  number of network and nonnetwork civilian providers and the actions  taken to ensure access to care for nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries.  Specifically, as discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, this report  describes (1) how TMA and its MCSCs evaluate nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries\u2019 access to care and the results of these evaluations; (2) the  impediments to civilian provider acceptance of nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries, and how they are being addressed; and (3) how DOD has  implemented the fiscal year 2004 NDAA requirements to take actions to  ensure nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to care.", "To determine how TMA evaluates nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019  access to care, we interviewed and obtained documentation from TMA  officials about the civilian provider survey, which included a random,  representative sample of civilian providers in selected geographic  locations and therefore included both network and nonnetwork civilian  providers. We also reviewed information from TMA\u2019s annual beneficiary  health care survey, which includes information on beneficiaries\u2019 access to  care. In addition, we met with TRO and MCSC officials for each of the  three regions, TMA officials, and representatives from each of the services\u2019  Surgeons General to identify and evaluate the tools used for monitoring  access to care. To identify the impediments to network and nonnetwork  civilian providers\u2019 acceptance of nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries and  how these impediments are being addressed, we obtained information  from TMA, TRO, and MCSC officials. We also met with representatives of  TRICARE beneficiaries and the American Medical Association to discuss  their concerns about impediments to health care access for nonenrolled  TRICARE beneficiaries. In addition, we obtained and analyzed data related  to TMA\u2019s implementation of reimbursement rate increases in specific  locations for the purpose of improving access to care. However, we did  not evaluate the extent to which the rate increases improved civilian  providers\u2019 acceptance of TRICARE beneficiaries as patients. To examine  how DOD has implemented the fiscal year 2004 NDAA requirements to  take actions to ensure nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to care,  we obtained information from TMA, TRO, and MCSC officials. Through  our review of the relevant documentation and our discussions with TMA,  TRO, and MCSC officials, we determined that the data presented in this  report were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

Individual TRICARE- authorized civilian providers can include attending physicians, certified  nurse-practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, dentists, clinical  psychologists, physician assistants, podiatrists, and optometrists, among  others. There are two types of authorized civilian providers\u2014network and  nonnetwork providers. Network civilian providers are TRICARE- authorized providers who enter a contractual agreement with the regional  MCSC to provide health care to TRICARE beneficiaries. By law, TRICARE  maximum allowable reimbursement rates must generally mirror Medicare  rates, but network providers may agree to accept lower reimbursements  as a condition of network membership. In some cases, they agree to  accept negotiated reimbursement rates, which are usually discounts off of  the TRICARE reimbursement rates, as payment in full for medical care or  services. Network civilian providers are reimbursed at their negotiated  rate regardless of whether they are providing care to enrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries under the Prime option or nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries under the Extra option. Network civilian providers file claim  forms for TRICARE beneficiaries and follow other contractually required  processes, such as those for obtaining referrals.

Prime enrollees receive most of their care from providers at MTFs,  augmented by network civilian providers who have agreed to meet  specific access standards for appointment wait times among other  requirements.

According to survey results from 2003 through 2005, about   77 percent of nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries who obtained care  reported that \u201cgetting needed care\u201d was not a problem for them. Similarly,  over 80 percent of these TRICARE beneficiaries reported that they could  \u201cget care quickly.\u201d For the same time period, TMA compared its survey  results with the results of a civilian health plan survey, the Consumer  Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS\u00ae), which  asked participants the same questions on access to care under their plans.  From this comparative analysis, TMA found that a similar percentage of  civilian health plan participants\u2014about 80 percent\u2014responded that  \u201cgetting needed care\u201d was not a problem and that they could \u201cget care  quickly.\u201d TMA uses this survey as a benchmark to compare TRICARE  against civilian plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Beneficiary Feedback", "paragraphs": ["Anecdotal information about access to care is available through TMA\u2019s  centralized Beneficiary and Provider Services office, which collects and  monitors information on TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 complaints and general  inquiries, including issues about access to care. TRICARE beneficiaries  may contact this office by telephone, e-mail, written correspondence, or  through their congressional representatives. TMA officials broadly  categorize each contact by issue and use this information to monitor  trends in the feedback they receive through these contacts. A TMA official  stated that if the number of contacts they receive related to an issue rises,  the appropriate program officials\u2014such as the TROs\u2014are notified and  encouraged to investigate the issue. Furthermore, TMA maintains a record  of TRICARE beneficiary and provider contacts that have been addressed  and those that remain open and continue to require attention. Although  the Beneficiary and Provider Services office does not specifically track  access-to-care issues as a separate issue, one of the TMA officials  responsible for tracking the contacts told us that TRICARE beneficiary  complaints and inquiries relating to access issues have been minimal.  Overall, concerns and inquiries for the \u201ccontractor service complaint\u201d  category, which could include access-to-care issues for both enrolled and  nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries, represented about 1 percent of about  6,900 total contacts about the MCSCs for 2005.", "In addition, on a regional level, the TROs collect and monitor TRICARE  beneficiary feedback gathered from e-mails and phone calls, as well as  correspondence they receive from TRICARE beneficiary groups. However,  the TROs told us that detailed information on each of these contacts is not  routinely maintained. For example, one TRO told us that when a TRICARE  beneficiary contacts them for assistance in locating a provider, they track  the general reason for the call, but do not document the specific concerns.  TRO officials told us that they receive only a small number of contacts  from nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries who are unable to obtain care  from nonnetwork civilian providers. For example, one TRO told us that  they received approximately 34 requests for assistance locating a provider  in calendar year 2005 from the over 600,000 nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries in this region. TRO officials indicated that sometimes these  requests are due to TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 inability to obtain care from a  specific provider at a specific time and are not necessarily indicative of  access problems because that provider may be available at another time or  other providers may be available. The TROs told us that they also monitor  nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to care retrospectively by  evaluating claims data as a record of health care usage. For example, the  TROs use these data to identify how many network and nonnetwork  providers have accepted nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries as patients  and to evaluate the use of the different TRICARE options.", "Finally, the TROs and military services are in the process of implementing  a new method of monitoring TRICARE beneficiary feedback. The  Assistance Reporting Tool (ART) is a computer database that when fully  operational will be used to archive and manage TRICARE beneficiary  feedback on all aspects of health care. Currently each of the three TROs,  all Army MTFs, and a portion of Navy and Air Force MTFs use this system  as either their primary or one of several tools for managing and archiving  TRICARE beneficiary feedback. Because ART is not mandatory for all  MTFs, the TROs also rely on other feedback mechanisms to capture the  most complete record of TRICARE beneficiary concerns and questions.  These other mechanisms include e-mails from TRICARE beneficiaries to  MTFs and data requests that the TROs periodically make to MTFs. In  addition, while the MCSCs are not required to use ART because it was  introduced after TRICARE\u2019s current health care delivery contracts were  awarded, one of the MCSCs is currently using it. In the next cycle of  TRICARE contracts, TMA officials told us that they plan to require that all  MCSCs use this system.

According to the MCSCs, while their methods for evaluating access to care  were not designed to evaluate access specifically for nonenrolled  TRICARE beneficiaries, they do provide some information that they use to  monitor the availability of both network and nonnetwork civilian  providers for this population, which is one component of access to care.", "The MCSCs also monitor access to care through beneficiary inquiries.  Each maintains a data system to archive and tabulate anecdotal TRICARE  beneficiary feedback received through some or all of the following  methods: telephone, e-mail, congressional correspondence, or walk-in  visits to a TRICARE Service Center. The MCSCs organize TRICARE  beneficiary feedback into subject categories and then monitor changes in  the frequency of contacts in these categories to identify trends and  important issues. At our request, each of the MCSCs reviewed their most  recent TRICARE beneficiary complaint data and found very small numbers  of comments pertaining to health care access. The MCSCs told us this was  an indication that TRICARE beneficiaries\u2014both enrolled and  nonenrolled\u2014were not experiencing any widespread problems with  access to care. For example, one MCSC identified fewer than 40  complaints related to access out of one million contacts with TRICARE  beneficiaries in a 1-month period. The second MCSC reported that for the  last two quarters of 2005 they received an average of 355 inquiries and  complaints each month about access to care. Officials from this MCSC told  us that while their TRICARE beneficiary feedback system could not  quantify the total number of inquiries received, these 355 inquiries  represented a small percentage of all contacts. The third MCSC reported  that out of more than 250,000 phone calls and walk-in visits to TRICARE  Service Centers during the month of December 2005, 71 contacts, or less  than 1 percent of the total contacts, were related to access.", "The MCSCs also determine how many civilian providers have accepted at  least one TRICARE beneficiary by analyzing claims data to examine the  extent to which both network and nonnetwork civilian providers are  accepting TRICARE beneficiaries as patients. Each MCSC has concluded  that more than half of all licensed civilian providers\u2014both network and  nonnetwork\u2014in their respective regions have accepted at least one  TRICARE beneficiary, regardless of enrollment status, as a patient in the  last year. According to MCSCs, access to care appears to be generally  sufficient because the percentage of all licensed civilian providers in each  region who have submitted at least one TRICARE claim during the past  year are as follows: 90 percent in the South region, where TRICARE  beneficiaries represent 3.7 percent of the entire region\u2019s population;   56 percent in the West region, where TRICARE beneficiaries represent   3.1 percent of the region\u2019s population; and 52 percent in the North region,  where all TRICARE beneficiaries represent an estimated 2.1 percent of the  region\u2019s population.", "Each MCSC told us that one of the primary ways they ensure sufficient  access to care for both enrolled and nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries is  by monitoring whether their civilian provider networks have the capacity  to provide care to all beneficiaries in their Prime Service Areas.  Throughout the three regions, the majority of nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries\u201484 percent\u2014live within Prime Service Areas, making the  choice of using a civilian network provider through Extra a readily  available option for them. In the South region, all TRICARE beneficiaries  reside in Prime Services Areas. In this region, the MCSC monitors access  to care through geographic analyses of provider and TRICARE beneficiary  locations to determine whether its networks meet the needs of both  enrolled and nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries using TRICARE\u2019s access  standards. In another region, where not all TRICARE beneficiaries live in  Prime Service Areas, the MCSC will assist nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries in finding nonnetwork civilian providers on an as-needed  basis. In the third region where the Prime Service Areas also do not  encompass all TRICARE beneficiaries, the MCSC recruits and contracts  with providers outside of Prime Service Areas who are available and  willing to deliver care to nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries living there.

TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates generally mirror  reimbursement rates paid by the Medicare program. Beginning in fiscal  year 1991, in an effort to control escalating health care costs, Congress  instructed DOD to gradually lower its reimbursement rates for individual  civilian providers to mirror those paid by Medicare\u2014an adjustment that  has saved hundreds of millions of dollars since the conversion. As of  January 2006, the transition to Medicare rates was nearly complete, and  reimbursement rates for only 48 services remain higher than Medicare  reimbursement rates. (See app. V for a list of these services.)", "According to TMA and MCSC officials, civilian providers, including both  network and nonnetwork, generally seek to develop a practice that  includes patients with higher-paying private insurers to compensate for  the acceptance of patients with lower-paying health plans, including  Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. However, according to TMA and  MCSC officials, TRICARE generally has little leverage to encourage  network and nonnetwork civilian provider acceptance of its patients  because the TRICARE population is small and transient. Further, in  locations where the demand for providers\u2019 services exceeds the supply\u2014 such as in Alaska\u2014providers can be selective about who they accept as  patients.", "TMA and MCSC officials have also cited providers\u2019 concerns that  TRICARE\u2019s pediatric and obstetric rates are lower than Medicaid rates for  these services. To investigate these concerns, TMA conducted a  comparative analysis that found TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates for  selected pediatric and obstetric procedures were generally higher than  Medicaid\u2019s rates in many states for March 2006. TMA compared the  TRICARE reimbursement rate for the service most commonly billed by  pediatricians\u2014an office visit for an established patient\u2014with Medicaid  rates for this service and found that in 41 of the 45 states for which  Medicaid data were available, the TRICARE reimbursement rate exceeded  Medicaid\u2019s rate for this service. In addition, TMA compared its  reimbursement rates for 14 commonly used maternity and delivery  services with Medicaid rates and found that in 35 of the 45 states for which  Medicaid data were available, TRICARE reimbursement rates for these  services exceeded the Medicaid payment rates.", "TMA also analyzed reimbursement rates for pediatric immunizations based  on MCSCs\u2019 concerns that providers viewed these rates as too low.  However, when TMA compared TRICARE\u2019s reimbursement rates with the  cost of the vaccine for the 10 most frequently used pediatric vaccines and  for the hepatitis A vaccine, TMA\u2019s analysts concluded that the TRICARE  reimbursement rates were generally reasonable and not undervalued in  relation to what a provider might actually pay to obtain them. Only one  vaccine\u2014the pediatric hepatitis A vaccine\u2014appeared to be priced lower  than the reasonable cost of obtaining the vaccine. In this instance, the  TRICARE reimbursement rate was $22.64, while pediatricians were paying  between $27.41 and $30.37 for the vaccine. As a result of this discrepancy,  TMA used its general authority to deviate from Medicare rates, and  starting May 1, 2006, TMA instructed the MCSCs to reimburse pediatric  hepatitis A vaccines nationally at a new reimbursement rate of $30.40."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TMA Has Authority to Use Waivers to Adjust Reimbursement Rates", "paragraphs": ["TMA has the authority to increase TRICARE reimbursement rates for  network and nonnetwork civilian providers to ensure that all beneficiaries,  including nonenrolled beneficiaries, have adequate access to care.

In 2000, TMA used this waiver authority to uniformly increase  reimbursement rates for network and nonnetwork civilian providers in  rural Alaska, and in 2002 TMA implemented this same waiver for network  and nonnetwork civilian providers in Anchorage. The use of these waivers  resulted in an average reimbursement rate increase of 28 percent for all of  Alaska.

Reimbursement rate increases for this type of waiver can be established in  one of three ways: by adding a percentage factor to the existing TRICARE  reimbursement rate, by calculating a prevailing charge, or by using  another government reimbursement rate, such as rates used by the  Department of Veterans Affairs to purchase health care from civilian  providers. The resulting rate increase would be applied to both network  and nonnetwork civilian providers for the medical services identified in  the areas where access is severely impaired. A total of nine applications  for locality-based waivers have been submitted to TMA between January  2003 and August 2006. (See table 4.)

According to a TMA official, the contracting officers  work with TMA analysts to review the submitted requests and verify  whether there is an insufficient number of providers in the area and  conduct a cost-benefit analysis before making a recommendation to the  Director of TMA that the waiver be accepted or denied. Each analysis is  tailored to the specific concerns outlined in the waiver requests.  According to this official, TMA conducts these additional analyses to  ensure that an increase in reimbursement rates would actually alleviate  access problems and that access was not impaired due to such things as  administrative problems or providers\u2019 unhappiness with claims payment  timeliness or accuracy.", "Once a waiver is granted, there is no mechanism that automatically  terminates it. According to a TMA official, there was an expectation within  TMA that the continued need for existing waivers would be evaluated on  an annual basis. However, waivers have been reviewed on a periodic, ad  hoc basis rather than on an annual basis as expected. When TMA  implemented new MCSC contracts in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, TMA and  the MCSCs discussed existing waivers and mutually agreed to extend all of  them because they continued to believe that these waivers were necessary  to ensure access to care.

TMA and MCSC officials stated that  because TRICARE beneficiaries usually represent only a small percentage  of a provider\u2019s practice, both network and nonnetwork civilian providers  may not be as knowledgeable about the program and its unique  administration requirements. Adding to the potential for confusion, while  some administrative requirements apply to all TRICARE beneficiaries, the  TRICARE program also has separate and distinct administrative  requirements for enrolled and nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries. For  example, network providers must meet specific time frame and  documentation requirements when referring enrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries for specialty care or when delivering specialty care to  enrolled TRICARE beneficiaries. However, referral standards usually do  not apply to nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries. Additionally, according  to the initial round of TMA\u2019s civilian provider survey, 15 percent of  network respondents and 7 percent of nonnetwork respondents who gave  explanations for why they were not accepting nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries as new patients cited administrative inconveniences as a  reason.

For  example, according to MCSCs and TMA officials, some providers perceive  that previously identified claims processing problems persist and cite  problems with timeliness and claims payment decisions as reasons for not  accepting TRICARE patients. While claims processing problems plagued  the TRICARE program in its early years, we reported in 2003 that efforts  had been made to improve claims processing efficiency, and as a result,  claims were being processed in a more timely manner, though some  inefficiencies remained. In addition, some TRO officials and providers  said that TRICARE claims payment decisions sometimes are not always  clear to providers and, as a result, they may believe problems with claims  processing exist. This is due in part to the fact that TRICARE\u2019s claims  processing outcomes may differ from Medicare\u2019s\u2014despite the programs\u2019  similarities in reimbursement rates\u2014due to different benefit structures  and different claims processing tools that are used to prevent  overpayment.

Problems may also occur because providers and TRICARE beneficiaries  may make mistakes when filing their claims.", "In efforts to address problems related to administrative issues, MCSCs  conduct a variety of outreach efforts to educate nonnetwork civilian  providers on TRICARE requirements and assist with both actual and  perceived administrative concerns. For example, MCSCs provide on-line  tools and toll-free telephone support to mitigate administrative issues.  Also, one MCSC works with state medical associations to address provider  concerns and to ensure that information about TRICARE requirements is  included in medical association newsletters. Each of the MCSCs has  provider relations representatives located in areas throughout the region  outside of their central office. These provider relations representatives  schedule opportunities to meet with nonnetwork civilian providers that  include booths or speaking engagements at health fairs, conferences, and  other provider events and, when necessary, work one-on-one with  network and nonnetwork civilian providers to provide instructions on  ways to respond to TRICARE\u2019s administrative requirements and to help  eliminate the burden of unnecessary paperwork.

For example, the initial round of TMA\u2019s civilian  provider survey found that 14 percent of providers in the 20 states  surveyed were not available to accept any new patients, including  TRICARE patients, privately insured patients, or patients who were paying  for their own care. According to the MCSCs, access problems related to  practice capacity are more likely to occur in geographically remote areas  that have few providers than in more densely populated areas with more  providers.

Also, in January 2005, TMA followed  Medicare in initiating payment of a 5 percent bonus for services rendered  by primary care providers in geographic areas designated by the  Department of Health and Human Services as Physician Scarcity Areas, a  program that is only operational through 2007. Providers who are eligible  for and wish to receive either of these bonus payments must include a  specific code on every claim they submit to obtain these additional  payments.

In August 2004, the  ASD for Health Affairs wrote a letter to providers appealing to their  patriotism and asking them to accept TRICARE beneficiaries as patients.  One MCSC official claimed that this letter has resulted in additional  providers accepting both enrolled and nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries  as patients.

As a result, MCSCs strive to ensure adequate  numbers of network civilian providers who could also provide care to  nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries. In addition, when nonenrolled  TRICARE beneficiaries request assistance with finding providers, MCSCs  work to encourage civilian providers, who could be either network or  nonnetwork, to accept these TRICARE beneficiaries as patients. In some  instances when a provider cannot be easily identified for a TRICARE  beneficiary, MCSCs told us their provider relations representatives, who  are knowledgeable about providers in their regions, will call on individual  providers to encourage them to accept these TRICARE beneficiaries as  patients. Nonetheless, as contractually required, MCSCs are focused on  recruiting civilian providers for their networks and do not proactively  recruit nonnetwork civilian providers to accept TRICARE beneficiaries as  patients.

A central  TMA office maintains an online directory of both network and nonnetwork  civilian providers who have accepted TRICARE beneficiaries as patients in  the last 2 years. MCSCs\u2019 Web sites provide a link to this TMA directory and  also provide a directory of network civilian providers in their regions.  Also, the TROs provide services, including assistance with locating civilian  providers, to any TRICARE beneficiary who contacts them. Among other  services they provide, Beneficiary Service Representatives at MCSC- operated TRICARE Service Centers assist \u201cwalk-in\u201d TRICARE  beneficiaries\u2014regardless of their enrollment status\u2014to locate providers.  In addition, all MCSCs are contractually required to have representatives  available by phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist with locating a  network provider. One MCSC told us that if a network provider is not  available, the phone representatives will help locate nonnetwork providers  in the area.", "Finally, the TROs currently are responsible for recommending  reimbursement rate adjustments\u2014that have been initiated by their offices,  MCSCs, providers, and TRICARE beneficiaries\u2014to increase provider  reimbursement rates in areas where access to care is impaired for both  enrolled and nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries. Since the TROs were  established in 2004, two of the three TROs have recommended such  increases to provider reimbursement rates in their regions.", "Nonetheless, TMA has not formally designated a senior official to take  responsibilities for nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries and nonnetwork  civilian providers as outlined in the NDAA for fiscal year 2004. According  to TMA officials, this role was assumed by the ASD for Health Affairs, who  is responsible for overseeing DOD\u2019s health programs and resources,  because these responsibilities are included in the official directive for this  position. According to senior TMA officials, the ASD for Health Affairs  intended to delegate these responsibilities to the TRO directors. However,  while this intent was communicated verbally, the delegation was never  formalized in writing. TRO officials told us that while they were aware of  the ASD for Health Affairs\u2019 intent, they never received official notification  or designation outlining these responsibilities and expectations. As a  result, at the time of our site visits, the TROs had not undertaken any  efforts beyond the level of assistance they were already providing to  nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries and nonnetwork civilian providers.  Nonetheless, during the time of our review, each TRO was in the process  of assigning responsibilities for nonenrolled beneficiaries to a specific  staff member in accordance with the staffing plan TMA established for the  TROs. Additionally, officials at each of the TROs told us that they provide  services and assistance to all TRICARE beneficiaries regardless of  enrollment status.", "To more directly assign responsibilities for nonenrolled beneficiaries\u2019  access to care to the TROs, the NDAA for fiscal year 2006 specifically  instructs the TROs to (1) identify nonnetwork providers who will accept  nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries as patients; (2) communicate with  nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries; (3) conduct outreach to nonnetwork  providers, encouraging their acceptance of TRICARE beneficiaries as  patients; and (4) publicize which nonnetwork providers in each region  accept nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries as patients.

However,  DOD disagreed with our finding that it had not formally designated a  senior official to ensure nonenrolled beneficiaries\u2019 access to care,  including adequate participation by nonnetwork providers, as required by  the NDAA for fiscal year 2004. DOD stated that DOD directive 5136.12  assigned these duties to the TMA director and the TROs by designating the  TMA Director as the program manager for TRICARE health and medical  resources and other responsibilities. DOD stated that this responsibility  clearly encompasses provision of care to nonenrolled beneficiaries and  therefore meets the NDAA requirement.", "We continue to believe that DOD has not adequately addressed the  requirement in the mandate. First, in multiple interviews and e-mail  exchanges during our audit work, senior DOD officials told us that no  specific actions had been taken to designate a senior official and that, by  default, the duties fell to the ASD for Health Affairs who is responsible for  overseeing DOD\u2019s health programs and resources. Further, during our site  visits, TRO officials told us they had never been officially notified of their  responsibilities and expectations for nonenrolled beneficiaries and  nonnetwork providers. As a result, at the time of our site visits the TROs  told us they had not undertaken any efforts beyond the level of assistance  they had already been providing to nonenrolled beneficiaries and  nonnetwork civilian providers. Second, we do not agree with DOD that the  terms of the pre-existing directive satisfy the requirements of the mandate.  Contrary to the requirement in the law that one official be designated, the  directive generally assigns responsibilities to TMA, as well as to multiple  TROs on a geographic basis. While part of the TROs\u2019 responsibilities  include developing a plan for the delivery of healthcare within the  geographic region, the mandate contemplated a more global approach to  addressing provider participation, specifically requiring one senior official  to ensure provider participation in each market area.", "DOD also provided technical comments that we incorporated where  appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense,  appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties.

Although DOD was required to conduct a survey to  assess nonenrolled beneficiaries\u2019 access to care under the Standard  option, the survey was administered to both network and nonnetwork  civilian providers since nonenrolled beneficiaries can receive care from  these providers under both the Extra and Standard options. We reviewed  the survey methodology, including the methods for selecting respondents,  the survey\u2019s response rate, the designation of TRICARE market areas, and  the survey instrument itself. We also reviewed TMA\u2019s methods for  randomly sampling market areas and providers and their administration of  the survey instrument and found these decisions methodologically sound  and statistically valid. In addition, we reviewed the survey results,  including the published results and analysis. While we did not  independently validate the survey data, we did assess the reliability of the  data by reviewing survey documentation and internal controls and by  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials and found that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To obtain information on how the  civilian provider survey was developed, we interviewed officials at the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) because the Paperwork  Reduction Act required OMB approval before it could administered. We  also interviewed TRICARE beneficiary group representatives who had  recommended sites for inclusion in the survey where nonenrolled  TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access to health care may be impaired. To identify  how the civilian provider survey results would be used to evaluate access  to care, we met with officials of TMA\u2019s Office of Health Plan Operations,  the director of TMA\u2019s Standard Programs Division, and officials from the  three TRICARE Regional Offices (TROs).", "We also reviewed TMA\u2019s annual Health Care Survey of Defense  Beneficiaries and compared it with a survey conducted by the Department  of Health and Human Services\u2019 Consumer Assessment of Health Care  Providers and System of individuals who received health care through  civilian health insurers. These surveys include identical questions on  access-to-care issues that allowed for comparative analysis of the opinions  expressed by TRICARE beneficiaries and civilian health plan users. Using  data from the 2003-2005 surveys we analyzed nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries\u2019 responses to access to care and compared them with results  from the Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems.

The TROs and military  services provided information on the Assistance Reporting Tool, a system  that is being developed to monitor and archive TRICARE beneficiary  feedback. The MCSCs also shared information about their independent  systems for maintaining TRICARE beneficiary feedback. TMA, MCSC, and  military service officials provided us with examples of TRICARE  beneficiary feedback reports and health care claims data for nonenrolled  TRICARE beneficiaries that TMA uses to evaluate access to care for this  population.

The NDAA did not stipulate how TMA  should define a market area but specified that 20 market areas should be  completed each fiscal year until all market areas in the United States have  been surveyed. Although the mandate focused on Standard, TMA officials  designed the survey to monitor access to care from both network and  nonnetwork providers since nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries can  receive care through both the Standard and Extra options.", "Before TMA could begin administering the civilian provider survey, it  required review and clearance from the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Subsequent to this review,  OMB approved a four-item questionnaire for the study administered in  fiscal year 2005. (See app. III for the approved questionnaire.)", "In designing the Survey on Continued Viability of TRICARE Standard (the  civilian provider survey), TMA defined the individual states and the  District of Columbia as 51 market areas\u2014a definition that will allow TMA  to complete the survey of all markets within a 3-year period and to develop  estimates of access to health care at both the state and national levels.  However, in order to provide information on smaller geographic areas  where nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries may be having problems  finding either network or nonnetwork providers, TMA supplemented the  statewide samples by oversampling from submarkets within each state  called Hospital Service Areas (HSA). The HSA geographic designation is  derived from a Dartmouth University study that groups zip codes into  distinct sets based on the analysis of patient travel patterns to the hospital  or hospitals they use most often. TMA endorsed the HSA submarket  methodology because these areas are nonoverlapping and encompass all  of the United States. In addition, nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries  reside in almost all of the 3,436 HSAs. TMA\u2019s methodology asks for  oversamples from HSAs in the 24 states where 80 percent of nonenrolled  TRICARE beneficiaries reside. When the study is complete in fiscal year  2007, TMA will have survey data from 2 HSAs selected randomly from  each of the 24 states where the majority of nonenrolled TRICARE  beneficiaries live, as well as information from HSAs purposively selected  because TRICARE beneficiaries or TROs were concerned with access in  these areas.", "To select the market areas that would be surveyed in fiscal year 2005, TMA  randomly selected sites from the individual states and the District of  Columbia and randomly selected 12 submarket HSAs within the 20 market  areas. In addition, in order to be able to respond to TRICARE beneficiary  concerns that access in some locations was impaired, TMA selected 17  additional submarket HSAs that TRICARE beneficiaries had identified as  problem areas in terms of access to health care. Four of these 17 sites  were outside the 20 selected state-wide market areas because TRICARE  beneficiaries had raised concerns about access issues in these locations.", "TMA selected its sample for the civilian provider survey from the  American Medical Association Masterfile, a data set of U.S. providers that  includes data on all providers who have the necessary educational and  credentialing requirements. This Masterfile did not differentiate between  TRICARE\u2019s network and nonnetwork civilian providers. However, TMA  selected this file because it is widely recognized as one the best  commercially available lists of providers in the United States and contains  over 600,000 active providers along with their addresses, phone numbers,  and information on practice characteristics, such as their specialty.  Although the Masterfile is considered to contain most providers,  deficiencies in coverage and inaccuracies in detail remain. Therefore, TMA  attempted to update providers\u2019 addresses and phone numbers and to  ensure that providers were eligible for the survey.", "From this Masterfile, TMA expected to randomly sample about 1,000  providers from each market and submarket area\u2014a sample size that  would achieve TMA\u2019s desired margin of error. However, in some  instances, a sample of 1,000 exceeded the number of providers in the  market or submarket area, in which case TMA attempted to contact all  providers in that area. Overall, TMA initially sampled about 41,000  providers, including both network and nonnetwork civilian providers.  After verifying phone numbers and eliminating ineligible providers, TMA  attempted to contact about 33,000 office-based providers in the 20 states  and 29 HSAs evaluated in fiscal year 2005. When analyzing provider  responses, TMA weighted each response so that the sampled providers  represented the population from which they were selected.", "To administer the civilian provider survey TMA hired a contractor, who  conducted the fieldwork for this project. The contractor mailed a  combined cover letter and questionnaire to the billing managers for all  providers in their sample. If the provider did not respond to the mailed  questionnaire, TMA followed up with a second mailing 3 weeks later and  conducted a telephone interview within 30 days of the first mailing for  those who did not respond to the mailed survey. During the survey period,  telephone interviewers called each provider\u2019s office up to 10 times in an  attempt to obtain a completed survey.", "Because the overall response rate to the survey was 55 percent, TMA  conducted an analysis of their findings to determine whether the results  were biased by a high percentage of providers not responding. Although  TMA officials told us that OMB\u2019s approval for the fiscal year 2005 survey  did not specify a required response rate, OMB\u2019s public guidance specifies  that if response rates are lower than 80 percent, agencies need to conduct  a nonresponse analysis. Such an analysis is used to verify that  nonrespondents to the survey would not answer differently from those  who did respond and that the respondents are representative of the target  population, thus ensuring that the data are statistically valid. When  conducting this analysis, TMA interviewed a sample of providers who did  not respond to the original survey and compared their responses and  demographics with the original survey respondents. TMA also compared  nonrespondents\u2019 demographics with those of the target population of  health care providers. The results of TMA\u2019s nonresponse analysis indicate  that the survey respondents are representative of the target population of  providers.", "The nonresponse analysis provided additional useful information for TMA.  First, it did not show a difference in the rate that responding and  nonresponding network civilian providers were aware of the TRICARE  program. However, it did show a statistically significant difference in the  rate of awareness between responding and nonresponding nonnetwork  civilian providers. These results indicate that having a familiarity with  TRICARE increases a provider\u2019s incentive to respond to the survey. In  order to adjust for this bias, TMA could have calculated an adjustment to  the sampling weights\u2014an adjustment that has not been applied to the  survey results. As a result, the unweighted survey results tend to overstate  civilian providers\u2019 awareness and acceptance of TRICARE. Nonetheless,  TMA\u2019s survey contractor noted that the survey results are not problematic  if the survey is used to compare changes in awareness and acceptance  from year to year. Further, TMA\u2019s use of the unadjusted results of the  initial survey phase as indicators of areas in which to focus marketing and  outreach efforts is appropriate because TMA is using it to make relative  comparisons of the areas surveyed.", "TMA\u2019s survey of civilian providers continues, and their analysts expect to  complete data collection for the nation over a 3-year period ending in  fiscal year 2007. Although TMA\u2019s efforts meet the mandate\u2019s requirement  of surveying 20 market areas each fiscal year until all market areas were  surveyed, collecting survey results over this period may limit TMA\u2019s stated  goal of deriving an overall national estimate because the national estimate  will combine data collected over several years rather than during one  relatively short time period, as well as the likelihood different instruments  will be used over time. For example, four additional questions may be  added to the fiscal year 2006 survey. TMA officials told us that the time lag  could potentially impact the results used to derive a national estimate, but  that their limited resources for this study prevent them from conducting a  nationwide survey under a shorter time frame."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Civilian Provider Survey Instrument", "paragraphs": ["The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2004 directed the  Department of Defense (DOD) to monitor nonenrolled TRICARE beneficiaries\u2019 access  to care under the TRICARE Standard option.
