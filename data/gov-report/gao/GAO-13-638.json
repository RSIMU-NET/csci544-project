In addition, the Air Force is considering using this pilot program to inform funding changes for other sections of its civilian workforce. GAO's prior work has identified the following practices for implementing and evaluating pilot programs: (1) develop objectives that link to the goals of the pilot; (2) develop processes for monitoring the pilot; (3) develop and implement a data collection and analysis plan for evaluating the pilot; and (4) communicate evaluation results to stakeholders. When implementing the pilot program, the Air Force did not follow these practices, and primarily focused on ensuring that administrative changes were made accurately such as ensuring employees received pay on time. For example, while a variety of potential goals were identified for the pilot program by the Air Force in various documents; they were not clear or consistent. As a result, anecdotal opinions on the advantages or disadvantages of the pilot varied significantly. Air Force acquisition officials stated that the pilot program could protect the funding from general reductions, while conversely, Air Force financial management officials said that the pilot would not necessarily mean that space acquisition personnel would be excluded from general reductions to civilian personnel funding. Further, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) officials stated that they are relying on the Air Force to report to them on the pilot's outcomes, but the Air Force has not completed a data collection plan to evaluate the pilot program and has not developed processes for monitoring the pilot program and communicating evaluation results to stakeholders. Without systematically evaluating the pilot program, the Air Force cannot determine if there is an advantage to expanding the pilot to other sections of the civilian workforce.", "The Air Force used existing approval processes identified by DOD to realign funds appropriated for acquisition civilian personnel to other purposes. Following the move of SMC acquisition civilian personnel funding to its RDT&E appropriation, the Air Force determined that $29.5 million of the $187.1 million appropriated for SMC acquisition civilian personnel in fiscal year 2012 was unneeded due to the civilian hiring controls the Air Force began implementing in May 2011. The Air Force realigned these funds to other requirements. Specifically, the Air Force realigned $6.7 million to other programs within its RDT&E appropriation--including $5.7 million to the Small Business Innovative Research fund--and obtained prior approval from Congress to realign $22.8 million out of the RDT&E appropriation as part of an Omnibus Reprogramming request.

According to a Navy official, funding for more  than half of Navy acquisition civilian personnel is managed through its  working capital fund, with others funded through a mix of its O&M and  RDT&E appropriations. Funding for other DOD civilian personnel is  generally located in the O&M appropriation.", "In the Air Force prior to fiscal year 1988, acquisition civilian personnel,  including space acquisitions civilian personnel, were funded through its  RDT&E appropriation. According to Air Force officials, in fiscal year 1988,  the funding was moved to its O&M appropriation to add stability to the  annual funding cycle; to achieve more consistent treatment across the Air  Force; resolve reprogramming issues; and provide flexibility to move  funding in the year of budget execution. However, the officials stated that  around 2008, the Air Force began considering requesting congressional  approval to move the funding back to its RDT&E appropriation.  Concurrent with these discussions, in 2009, an assessment of the Air  Force acquisition process recommended the Air Force seek to move the  funding for acquisition civilian personnel to RDT&E to \u201creduce personnel  turbulence.\u201d Also in 2009, the Air Force created an Acquisition  Improvement Plan, which outlined an effort to rebuild an Air Force  acquisition culture that delivers products and services as promised\u2014on  time, within budget, and in compliance with all laws, policies and  regulations. The plan listed five initiatives and associated actions, with the  goal of addressing longstanding acquisition issues the Air Force  identified: (1) revitalize the acquisition workforce; (2) improve the  requirements generation process; (3) instill budget and financial  discipline; (4) improve Air Force major systems source selections; and (5)  establish clear lines of authority and accountability within acquisition  organizations.", "Following the implementation of the Acquisition Improvement Plan, as  part of the budget process for fiscal year 2012 the Air Force requested  that Congress approve a pilot program to move funding for SMC  acquisition civilian personnel to its RDT&E appropriation.

Specifically, the DOD FMR  directs statutory and regulatory financial management requirements,  systems, and functions for all activities within DOD.", "Congress recognizes that unforeseen requirements occur during the year  of budget execution, and permits the realignment of funds within certain  guidelines. Both statutory and regulatory rules govern realignment of  funds, and Congress typically provides DOD with authority to realign  funds between programs to manage resources when circumstances  change during the fiscal year through both transfers and  reprogrammings. A transfer of funds is shifting of all or part of the  budget authority in one appropriation or fund account to another, and  requires specific statutory authority.shifting of funds within an appropriation account for purposes other than   Reprogramming, by contrast, is the  those contemplated at the time of appropriation.guidance, all uses of DOD\u2019s general transfer authority require prior  congressional approval, and the oversight of reprogramming actions  varies depending on the amount of funding realigned and the relevant  appropriations involved (see Figure 1).", "DOD\u2019s FMR specifies when prior approval must be obtained from the  congressional defense committees for reprogrammings or transfers.  Specifically, the FMR requires that prior approval must generally be  obtained when the realignment (1) increases the procurement quantity of  a major end item, (2) affects a congressional special interest item, (3)  involves the use of general transfer authority, (4) exceeds the monetary  thresholds established for each appropriation, (5) establishes new  programs, or (6) terminates appropriated programs. For reprogramming  of funds appropriated in the O&M budget, prior approval by the  congressional defense committees is required if there is a cumulative  increase or decrease greater than $15 million in a given budget activity.  For reprogramming of funds appropriated in the RDT&E budget, prior  approval by the congressional defense committees is required if there is a  cumulative increase or decrease greater than $10 million or more than 20  percent of the program base amount (i.e., the program element amount)\u2013 whichever is less.

Yet other officials stated the goal of the pilot program was to  ensure that any future expansion of the effort to additional workforce  communities would be approved by the Office of the Secretary of Defense  and the Congress.", "Further, the Air Force has not made plans to evaluate the outcome of the  pilot program. As a result, it remains unclear if the potential impacts cited  by Air Force officials during our review can be characterized as  advantages or disadvantages. For example, although the Air Force  internal briefing identified a goal to decrease general Air Force and  congressional reductions to acquisition civilian personnel funding, officials  did not develop a plan to evaluate whether or not moving this funding to  its RDT&E appropriation achieved this goal. Officials responsible for  managing the acquisition workforce believe that moving funding to its  RDT&E appropriation could prevent acquisition civilian personnel from  being subject to any general O&M reductions, thus allowing the  acquisition workforce to have more stable funding. However, Air Force  financial management officials told us that moving funding to its RDT&E  appropriation would not necessarily mean that space acquisition  personnel would be excluded from any general reductions to civilian  personnel funding, and SMC officials confirmed that SMC acquisition  civilian personnel funding has continued to be impacted by general  reductions following the pilot program. In another example, Air Force  officials told us that moving acquisition civilian personnel funding to a  specific program element in its RDT&E appropriation would increase the  visibility of both the funding and any decisions to realign the funding to  other purposes. Officials responsible for the acquisition workforce told us  that the additional visibility would improve their ability to manage funding  for the acquisition workforce, because the funding would be located in a  single program element in the RDT&E appropriation, and hence funding  decisions would be more informed. In contrast, Space Command officials  told us that the move of SMC acquisition personnel funding to RDT&E  has caused challenges for Space Command. Specifically, according to  agency officials, Space Command faced funding shortfalls in fiscal year  2012, but officials could not simply realign unobligated funds from the  SMC acquisition civilian personnel program element to alleviate these  shortfalls because such a realignment requires the prior approval of the  congressional defense committees.", "Moreover, Air Force officials told us that RDT&E funding is generally  considered less flexible than O&M funding because of different  requirements for realigning the funding. For example, Air Force officials  stated that when SMC acquisition civilian personnel funding was located  in O&M, unobligated funds were generally available to be used for other  purposes within the same O&M activity\u2014such as utilities and base  operations\u2014subject to the required approval. The officials stated that  when the funding is located in RDT&E, it is more difficult to realign  unobligated funds because of the rules governing the realignment of  RDT&E funds, which are more likely to require additional steps and  authorizations prior to being able to use unobligated funds for other  purposes compared with when the funding is in O&M. The officials added  that the loss of flexibility in O&M funding may be a disadvantage for the  management of O&M budgets. However, moving funding to the RDT&E  appropriation may be an advantage for the acquisition community, who  might be able to use the unobligated funds for other RDT&E acquisition  priorities, if appropriate approvals are obtained.", "As previously mentioned, the Air Force has expressed interest in  expanding the program to other civilian acquisition workforce  communities, such as the acquisition civilian personnel at Air Force  Materiel Command. Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) officials told us that\u2014while they do not have an opinion of  the pilot program\u2014they are relying on the Air Force to report to them on  the pilot\u2019s outcomes. However, because the Air Force did not establish  clear and consistent program objectives or a data collection plan to  evaluate the benefits of its pilot program, they were unable to evaluate  whether potential impacts resulting from the pilot were advantages or  disadvantages. Without establishing goals and completing a data  collection plan to evaluate the pilot program, the Air Force also has not  applied the remaining two established practices\u2014developing processes  for approving, reporting, and monitoring the pilot program as well as  communicating evaluation results to stakeholders.
