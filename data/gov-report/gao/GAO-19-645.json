The program's authorizing statute requires states to meet an MOE requirement. MOE requirements in federal programs generally require grantees to maintain a certain level of spending to ensure grantee dollars are not replaced with federal dollars. To demonstrate their compliance with the MIECHV program's MOE requirement, states report in their annual grant applications their MOE spending for the prior fiscal year.", "HHS determined that states generally met the MIECHV program's MOE requirement because states did not replace state funds with federal funds, including states that reported no MOE spending or decreased MOE spending. States may be permitted to report $0 in MOE spending in certain circumstances; for example, if a state's only home visiting spending was on programs that did not meet MIECHV program criteria. According to HHS officials, state-reported decreases in MOE spending were due to errors in calculations that were subsequently corrected, clarifications to HHS's MOE guidance, or because of circumstances outside of the state agency's control.", "HHS uses multiple methods to monitor state compliance with the MOE requirement, according to GAO's review of HHS documentation and interviews with HHS officials. The agency's monitoring strategy includes reviews of grant applications, reviews of state single audits, and operational site visits, among other techniques. According to HHS officials, grant application reviews are the primary mechanism used to monitor state compliance, through which HHS compares state-reported MOE spending in grant applications across two fiscal years to determine if states maintained their level of spending. In addition, HHS identifies and resolves issues with state-reported MOE spending through its operational site visits and the agency's review of state single audits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the  Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program  to support evidence-based home visiting services for at-risk pregnant  women and parents with young children. Families volunteer to participate  in the MIECHV program and are provided regular home visits and support  services from a nurse, social worker, or other professional. The MIECHV  program\u2019s statute requires the use of high-quality home visiting program  models that have been shown by research to have positive outcomes.  The program, administered by the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA),  authorizes grants to states to provide home visiting services intended to  improve maternal and child health, prevent child abuse and neglect,  encourage positive parenting, and promote child development and school  readiness. According to HHS, the program also provides an opportunity  for increased collaboration at the federal, state, tribal, and community  levels to improve health and developmental outcomes for children.", "In fiscal year 2018, the MIECHV program served nearly 77,000 families  and provided more than 930,000 home visits. The Bipartisan Budget Act  of 2018 appropriated $400 million per year to HHS to carry out the  MIECHV program for fiscal years 2018 through 2022. States began  receiving federal MIECHV program funds in fiscal year 2010. However,  many states provided home visiting services prior to the MIECHV  program, using state or other funds.", "The MIECHV program\u2019s authorizing statute requires states to meet a  maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement. In general, MOE requirements  in federal programs require grantees to maintain a certain level of  spending to ensure grantee dollars are not replaced with federal dollars,  and are intended to ensure that federal funding results in an increased  level of program activity. For the MIECHV program, for example, this  could mean that federal funds result in an increased number of home  visits provided or families served, compared to before the receipt of  federal funds.", "You asked us to examine the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE requirement. This  report examines (1) what is known about the MOE spending reported by  states that receive federal MIECHV program funds and (2) how HHS  monitors states to ensure the MOE requirement is met.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant documentation and  interviewed HRSA officials. Specifically, we reviewed notices of funding  opportunity (NOFO) for MIECHV program formula grants from federal  fiscal years 2013 through 2018 to examine the MOE guidance that HRSA  provided to states on how to demonstrate compliance with the MOE  requirement. We also compiled and analyzed data on state-reported  MOE spending in MIECHV program formula grant applications for the  three most recent fiscal years, 2016 through 2018. To assess the  reliability of the data, we spoke with knowledgeable HRSA officials and  confirmed the data we compiled with the agency. We found the reported  MOE spending data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Although  MIECHV program funds are provided to states as both formula and  competitive grants, we focused our review on formula grant NOFOs and  applications because in recent years HRSA provided the majority of its  MIECHV grant funding through formula grants. In addition, our review  focused on state MIECHV programs and did not include territories or  tribal MIECHV programs.", "We also reviewed relevant HHS grants monitoring documentation to  determine the extent that MOE is included in these documents, including  its Grants Policy and Administration Manual and monitoring reports. We  also interviewed relevant HRSA officials to obtain a better understanding  of the MOE instructions in the NOFOs, state-reported MOE spending,  types of monitoring conducted, and officials\u2019 experiences assessing  compliance and addressing potential non-compliance with the MIECHV  program\u2019s MOE requirement.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2018 to September  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In fiscal year 2018, states received an  average of $6.9 million in MIECHV program formula grant funding,  ranging from $1.2 million provided to North Dakota to $21.4 million to  California (see appendix I for a list of all states and their fiscal year 2016  through 2018 funding). Generally, the state\u2019s public health or social  services department is the lead agency that receives and administers the  funds.", "States target MIECHV program resources to at-risk communities and  have the flexibility to tailor the program to serve the specific needs of their  communities. States are generally required to provide home visiting  services using an HHS-approved evidence-based program model.  Currently, HHS has determined through its Home Visiting Evidence of  Effectiveness review that 18 evidence-based home visiting models meet  HHS-established criteria for evidence of effectiveness, and are therefore  eligible for MIECHV funding. States may select programs to implement  from the models that have been approved by HHS, or states may choose  to implement a home visiting service delivery model that qualifies as a  promising approach, as defined in the statute. In MIECHV-funded home  visiting programs, professionals meet regularly with families and provide  services tailored to the families\u2019 specific needs, such as teaching  parenting skills, promoting early learning in the home, or conducting  screenings and providing referrals to address caregiver depression,  substance abuse, and family violence. According to HHS, the MIECHV  program builds upon decades of scientific research showing that home  visits by a nurse, social worker, or early childhood educator during  pregnancy and early childhood have the potential to improve the lives of  children and families. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, the number of  families served and number of home visits conducted nearly doubled (see  table 1).", "The MIECHV program is the primary federal program focusing exclusively  on evidence-based home visiting, according to HHS. However, in addition  to administering the MIECHV program, states may have other home  visiting programs that may be supported by funds from other federal  programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the  Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant. These home visiting  programs may provide services that differ from those provided under the  MIECHV program. For example, states may provide home visiting  services through these programs that use program models that are  different from the MIECHV program models approved by HHS.", "The MOE requirement in the MIECHV program\u2019s authorizing statute  provides that funds provided to an eligible entity receiving a MIECHV  grant \u201cshall supplement, and not supplant, funds from other sources for  early childhood home visitation programs or initiatives.\u201d To demonstrate  their compliance with this statutory requirement, states are required by  HRSA to report in their annual grant applications their MOE spending for  the prior fiscal year. HRSA provides guidance to states on how to report  their MOE spending in the annual NOFOs. For example, since fiscal year  2013, the MOE guidance in the NOFOs generally has directed states to  only report spending that meets the following criteria: paid for with state general funds,  spent in the prior fiscal year on HHS approved evidence-based  programs that include home visiting as a primary service delivery  strategy,  implemented in response to findings from the most current statewide  needs assessment, and offered on a voluntary basis to pregnant women or caregivers of  children from birth to kindergarten entry.", "Over time, HRSA has clarified the MOE guidance provided in the NOFOs  to help address questions received from states, according to HRSA  officials.", "We previously reported that certain grant design features affect the  likelihood that states will use federal funds to supplement, rather than  supplant (or replace), their own spending. One such design feature  requires grant recipients to contribute their own funds in order to obtain  grant funds. Requiring grant recipients to contribute their own funds can  take the form of a match or MOE requirement. According to our prior  report, matching grants typically contain either a single rate (e.g., 50  percent) or a range of rates (e.g., 50 to 80 percent) at which the federal  government will match state spending on a particular program. An MOE  requirement, in contrast, requires states to maintain existing levels of  state spending on a particular program as a condition of receiving federal  funds. Depending on the specific program and its MOE requirement, if a  state did not previously spend any state funds on covered activities, then  the state could be allowed to maintain MOE spending of $0.", "The MOE requirement is one of many MIECHV program requirements  that HRSA is responsible for monitoring. HRSA also monitors MIECHV\u2019s  programmatic and technical requirements, such as evidence-based  model implementation, policies and procedures, data collection, and  organizational structure and capacity. HRSA also monitors fiscal and  administrative requirements, such as those related to accounts payable  and cash flow, accounting systems, and cost allocations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State-Reported Maintenance of Effort Spending Varied and HRSA Determined States Generally Met the Requirement", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2016 through 2018, state-reported MOE spending  varied from $0 to more than $25 million, according to our review of  MIECHV program grant applications (see fig. 1). For example, 28 states  reported MOE spending of $0 in fiscal year 2018. Most of the 23 states  that reported MOE spending greater than $0 in fiscal year 2018 reported  spending less than $3 million, while three states reported spending more  than $9 million. See appendix II for each state\u2019s reported MOE spending  for fiscal years 2016 through 2018.", "State-reported MOE spending does not necessarily reflect all state  spending on all home visiting services. When states report their prior  year\u2019s MOE spending on their MIECHV grant applications, they are only  required to include home visiting spending if it meets the criteria specified  by HRSA in the NOFO. In addition to reporting their MOE spending in  grant applications, some states also noted that they spent funds on home  visiting services that did not meet those criteria. In fiscal year 2017, for  example, one state reported that it had spent funds on home visiting  services for a non-evidence-based model (i.e., a model not approved by  HHS), and the state also funded an evidence-based program with funds  other than state general funds. However, the state did not include either  in its reported MOE spending because that spending did not meet the  criteria for MOE spending in the NOFO.", "An update to the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE guidance in the NOFO for  fiscal year 2018 further impacted some state reported MOE spending.  The update clarified the MOE guidance, stating that states should only  report MOE spending by the recipient entity administering the MIECHV  grant, and not report spending by other state agencies. According to  HRSA officials\u2014because the states were now directed to exclude some  previously reported home visiting spending\u2014five states decreased their  reported MOE spending to $0. In addition, three other states reported a  decrease in their MOE spending ranging from about $1.2 million to about  $9.3 million because of this change (see table 2).", "HRSA determined that states generally met the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE  requirement because there was no supplantation of federal funds,  including in states that reported no MOE spending and those that  reported decreased MOE spending from the prior fiscal year. States  may be permitted to report $0 in MOE spending if the non-federal  spending on home visiting does not meet the criteria in the MOE  guidance in the NOFO. For example, if the state had not previously  funded home visiting programs that met HRSA\u2019s MOE criteria for the  MIECHV program, then the state could maintain state spending of $0,  according to HRSA officials. States may report MOE spending of $0 if  state general funds were spent on a home visiting model that was not  approved by HRSA, if the state supports an evidence-based home visiting  program with funds other than state general funds, or if the state did not  support a home visiting program prior to implementation of MIECHV.", "HRSA determined that state-reported year-to-year decreases in MOE  spending did not constitute supplantation (or replacement) of state funds  with federal funds, because as described more fully below, HRSA  determined there were valid reasons for the decreased MOE spending,  according to agency officials. Based on our analysis of grant  applications, 15 states reported decreases in MOE spending from fiscal  years 2016 through 2018 (see table 3). These decreases ranged from  $75,000 to $71,539 in one state, and $25,207,294 to $0 in another state.", "According to HRSA officials, there were three different reasons why  states might have reported a decrease in MOE spending compared to the  prior year:  1.  The state made a technical error in its MOE calculation that  subsequently was corrected. For example, some states reported a  decrease in MOE spending compared to the prior year because the  state previously included erroneous funding sources, such as funding  for a home visiting program that did not meet the MIECHV program\u2019s  MOE criteria.  2.  Circumstances outside of the state agency\u2019s control contributed to the  state reporting decreased funding, such as when a state legislature  authorized budget cuts that affected home visiting funding or failed to  pass a budget. For example, according to HRSA officials, one state  experienced state budget challenges in fiscal years 2016 and 2017,  which resulted in decreased funding for some home visiting services.  The officials said this funding would have been included in the state\u2019s  reported MOE spending and these budget reductions resulted in a  reduction to the reported MOE spending from the prior year.  3.  The clarification to the MOE guidance that HRSA made in the fiscal  year 2018 NOFO limited the spending states should report, as  previously discussed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HRSA Employs Several Methods to Monitor State Compliance with the MOE Requirement", "paragraphs": ["HRSA uses several methods to monitor the MIECHV program and the  program\u2019s MOE requirement is addressed to some extent as part of each,  according to our review of HRSA grants monitoring documentation and  interviews with HRSA officials. These monitoring methods include grant  application reviews, site visits, and financial assessments, among others.  The monitoring methods vary in terms of the extent to which the MOE  requirement is specifically examined, who conducts the monitoring, and  the frequency of monitoring (see table 4).", "The primary mechanism for monitoring the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE  requirement is the review of grant applications, according to HRSA  officials. HRSA project officers review the MOE chart in states\u2019 grant  applications for 2 fiscal years to compare state reported MOE spending\u2014 actual non-federal expenditures\u2014and determine if states maintained their  level of spending (see table 5). If there is a missing MOE chart or  potentially inaccurate MOE spending information, project officers work  with states to resolve the issue.", "While HRSA primarily relies on its review of grant applications to monitor  state compliance with the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE requirement, the  agency supplements these reviews with other monitoring techniques, and  some of these techniques have identified issues with state-reported MOE  spending. For example, operational site visits provide HRSA an  opportunity to ask detailed questions about state-reported MOE spending  and obtain supporting documentation. As a result of operational site visits,  HRSA identified inaccurate state-reported MOE spending in some states.  We reviewed four completed site visit reports from 2017\u2014the most  recently completed reports at the time of our review\u2014and two of these  reports had findings related to inaccurate state-reported MOE spending.  For example, one site visit report noted that the state incorrectly included  home visiting spending that did not use an evidence-based model in its  reported MOE spending.", "HRSA also found some deficiencies with states\u2019 reported MOE spending  through the agency\u2019s review of state single audits. According to HRSA  officials, there were five state single audits with MIECHV MOE findings  from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. We found that four of these audits  identified deficiencies with how states monitored and accounted for their  MOE spending. For example, one audit found that the state did not have  internal controls in place to ensure that state spending met the minimum  MOE requirement. In three of the four single audits that identified  deficiencies, the state agencies concurred with the findings and prepared  corrective action plans to address the deficiencies.", "As of June 2019, HRSA officials said they have taken steps, or are  planning steps, to modify or provide additional guidance related to how  the agency monitors the MOE requirement for the MIECHV program.  Specifically:", "HRSA officials told us that beginning with the formula grant NOFO for  fiscal year 2019, HRSA added an additional column to the MOE chart  for states to provide the expenditures for the 2 years prior to the  current fiscal year of the application.
