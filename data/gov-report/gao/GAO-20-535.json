Industry and federal investments have made broadband available to the vast majority of Americans. For example, FCC's high-cost program provides funding to broadband providers to deploy broadband in rural, insular, and high-cost areas. However, some rural areas continue to lack access due, in part, to challenges with providing service to areas where deployment costs are high and returns on investment are low.", "GAO was asked to examine the current state of broadband investment and deployment. This report examines (1) industry and federal investments to deploy broadband in the United States since 2009, and (2) efforts federal agencies are making to address deployment challenges.", "GAO analyzed industry and federal government data from 2009 through 2017 or 2018 (the most recent year of available data) on broadband investments and deployment; reviewed statutes and regulations, rulemaking proceedings, and FCC, RUS, and NTIA program information; interviewed federal officials; and obtained information about deployment challenges from interviews with 32 industry, academic, and consumer stakeholders, including 16 broadband providers selected to represent a range of provider sizes and types of technologies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Telecommunications industry and federal government investments have expanded access to broadband in the United States. From 2009 through 2017, the industry made capital investments of about $795 billion, including investments in broadband infrastructure, according to U.S. Census Bureau survey data. Federal investments totaled about $47.3 billion to target broadband infrastructure for rural areas over the same time, according to data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). FCC's Universal Service Fund high-cost program expanded service to about 2.3 million residential and small business locations, mostly from 2015 through 2017, according to data FCC collects from providers. FCC reported that fixed broadband service was available to 94.4 percent of the U.S. population in 2018, up from 81.2 percent in 2012, although affordability and digital literacy remain barriers to adoption and use. While service availability for people in rural areas increased from 45.7 percent in 2012 to 77.7 percent in 2018, service in rural areas continues to lag behind urban areas, according to FCC's broadband availability report (see figure).", "FCC and RUS have taken actions to address deployment challenges, such as taking steps to improve their ability to pinpoint where gaps in broadband deployment still exist. In August 2019, FCC proposed an initiative to change how it collects broadband deployment data, with the goal of using a new methodology to improve data accuracy and FCC's ability to target funds to locations that lack access. FCC and RUS have also coordinated on broadband deployment issues. For example, to avoid funding areas where broadband service is already deployed, agency officials regularly communicate on information about where their broadband deployment programs are funding new deployments. Continued communication and coordination on topics such as collecting and using improved data will be especially important in assuring that federal dollars are effectively targeted as agencies' efforts to improve mapping and target resources progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In prior work, GAO recommended that FCC improve its mapping data and RUS better manage its broadband programs.

Many health care  systems, government entities, businesses, educational institutions,  restaurants, and other merchants have transitioned some or all  operations online to minimize interpersonal contact and help slow the  spread of the disease. Lack of access to broadband poses challenges to  accessing telemedicine, telework, remote instruction, and resources for  home schooling, as well as e-commerce. Because broadband has  become increasingly critical to economic opportunity, jobs, education, and  civic engagement, those without access are unable to enjoy the social  and economic benefits of broadband. As we have reported\u2014and media  reports continue to highlight\u2014people in unserved and underserved areas,  low income families, some minority groups, and tribal communities are  disproportionately affected by this lack of broadband access, often  referred to as \u201cthe digital divide.\u201d The pandemic, in particular, highlights  this divide between those who have access to broadband to more readily  access essential goods and services and those who do not have such  access.", "Over the years, the federal government has invested resources to  increase broadband access. The American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) provided funding through grants and loans for  broadband infrastructure in order to expand access to broadband internet  service, among other things. Since the passage of the Recovery Act,  private industry has made significant investments in broadband  infrastructure in order to expand broadband services in unserved and  underserved urban and rural areas. The federal government administers  programs to invest federal funds that target rural unserved and  underserved areas through the Federal Communications Commission  (FCC), the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS), and  the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Telecommunications and  Information Administration (NTIA). Among these agencies\u2019 programs, the  largest is FCC\u2019s Universal Service Fund high-cost program that supports  broadband deployment in rural, insular, and high-cost areas and collects  data to track where broadband is available. In the past 10 years, we have  reported on these agencies\u2019 programs and other aspects of broadband  deployment.

We also analyzed disbursement data for FCC\u2019s high-cost program, grants  and loans awarded by RUS, and grants awarded by NTIA for broadband  infrastructure over the same time. Throughout this report, investment  estimates are inflation-adjusted to 2018 dollars using gross domestic  price indices. We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing  supporting documentation; interviewing knowledgeable Census Bureau,  FCC, RUS, and NTIA officials; and comparing data against other  analyses. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  estimating industry and federal investments over time. We also reviewed  our prior reports calling on agencies to improve the information used in  measuring the impact of federal broadband programs; examined steps  that agencies took to improve such information; and reviewed information  from agencies showing the impact of federal spending.", "To determine broadband deployment in urban and rural areas, we  reviewed FCC\u2019s Broadband Deployment Reports showing broadband  availability, beginning in 2012.

We also reviewed our prior reports on  broadband availability data to understand the difficulties in measuring  actual deployment using such data. We acknowledge that FCC\u2019s  broadband data overstate fixed broadband availability by counting an  entire census block as served by providers that serve some, but not  necessarily all, of that block. This limitation could be particularly  problematic in areas with large census blocks. Despite this limitation, we  believe these data represent the best snapshot of fixed broadband  availability. In response to our July 2014 report, FCC began collecting  additional deployment data on new broadband service locations funded  by the high-cost program, data that we analyzed to provide information on  how that investment supports deployment. We reviewed the reliability of  the FCC broadband deployment and high-cost deployment data by  reviewing documentation about the collection and interviewing FCC  officials.

For instance,  low population density, low broadband adoption rates, or mountainous or  rugged terrain can make it especially costly for fixed and mobile providers  to deploy infrastructure to rural areas with an expectation of getting a  return on their investment. The Communications Act of 1934, as  amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, specifies that consumers in \u201crural, insular, and high-cost areas\u201d should have access to  telecommunications and information services at rates that are  \u201creasonably comparable\u201d to rates charged for similar services in urban  areas.

We  recommended that FCC analyze how it uses its high-cost program  funding and make that analysis publicly available at least annually.  FCC has taken action to implement our recommendation to address  the lack of transparency and accountability of spending. In 2018, we  reviewed data that FCC collected from providers to describe the  locations of existing broadband infrastructure and help federal  programs identify unserved and underserved areas to target for  federal funding.

Satellite and mobile broadband may  be able to overcome some impediments to access faced by other  services, such as high deployment costs and geographical barriers that  pose challenges for deploying broadband over fixed networks using fiber  or cable. In turn, this expansion of eligibility corresponds with the  shrinking gap in broadband deployment discussed previously.", "In the case of FCC, the agency has taken action since the 1990s to  address technological changes related to broadband deployment. For  example, changes in communications technology and competition in the  communications marketplace led FCC to reform the high-cost program for  purposes beyond maintaining telephone service, including supporting  broadband deployment. In 2011, FCC adopted new rules that  fundamentally changed the high-cost program and expanded the program  to support broadband capable networks. Under these rules, FCC  established new funding streams within the high-cost program, such as  the Connect America Fund, which addresses fixed broadband availability  gaps in underserved and unserved areas, and the Mobility Fund, which  supports deployment of wireless networks to provide mobile broadband.", "FCC also updated its regulatory framework to recognize changes in  existing technology and potential technologies in delivery of broadband.  For example, in 2016, FCC deemed geostationary satellites eligible to  participate in the second phase of the Connect America Fund.  Additionally, since 2017, FCC also recognized low and medium earth  orbiting satellites as broadband-capable technologies that may be eligible  to participate in programs after deployment. According to FCC officials,  prior to these changes, they did not consider satellite as broadband- capable due to its high signal latency and internet speeds that were  below the FCC benchmark speed, issues that recent technological  advances have improved. Similar to FCC, RUS funding programs used  to focus funding on telephone service but over time, RUS has reformed  them to provide funding for broadband infrastructure and deployment. For  example, according to RUS officials, since 1995 the RUS  Telecommunications program has only funded systems that were capable  of providing high-speed internet and now supports broadband services.", "In addition to past program transformation efforts, both FCC and RUS  have proposed actions to further reform or expand their programs that  provide funding for broadband deployment. For example, in August 2019,  FCC started the rulemaking process for the new Rural Digital Opportunity  Fund. In January 2020, FCC adopted a Report and Order establishing a  framework for the fund, providing up to $20.4 billion through two funding  rounds, each providing support over overlapping 10-year periods. This  fund is the next iteration of the high-cost program, and it continues the  overarching goals of prior high-cost programs to expand service into rural  areas. The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund will focus its first round of  funding on census blocks that FCC deployment data have marked as  completely unserved, and per the FCC order will incentivize parties  participating in the program to serve tribal census blocks. Similarly, in  April 2020, FCC initiated a rulemaking to establish the 5G Fund\u2014which  would replace the Universal Service Mobility Fund Phase II\u2014and make  up to $9 billion available to carriers to aid in deployment of advanced 5G  mobile wireless services in rural America. In addition to FCC\u2019s actions,  RUS officials said they are planning for future funding rounds for the  ReConnect Program after they have awarded the initial phase of funding.  As of April 15, 2020, RUS had closed the application phase for a second  round of funding under the program.", "Despite federal efforts to address broadband gaps, there are still limits on  participation in some programs. For example, RUS\u2019s ReConnect Program  offers a mix of grants and loans to incentivize broadband infrastructure in  areas not currently served by existing service providers. However, the  ReConnect Program limits eligibility to fixed and satellite broadband  providers, with mobile wireless networks ineligible for funding. In order to  participate in FCC\u2019s high-cost program, a provider must meet FCC\u2019s  definition of an eligible telecommunication carrier (ETC). However, our  prior work and stakeholders we interviewed for this review identified  barriers to attaining ETC status. As we previously reported, tribal entities  cited the statutory requirements applicable to ETC designation as a  primary barrier to accessing federal funds. Additionally, cable providers  we spoke with for this review also said they viewed the ETC designation  as a potential barrier to entry into the high-cost program. At present, FCC  and states have complementary authority to make ETC designation  decisions. During our 2018 review of barriers that tribes face in  supporting broadband investment, FCC officials said that most of the  carriers that were eligible for ETC designation at that time were the  telephone companies that were in existence when the 1996 Act was  enacted into law. Further, FCC officials said they determined that the  statute is clear that only ETCs may receive program support, and  therefore the agency does not have the authority to allow non-ETCs to  receive high-cost support payments. More recently, greater numbers of  companies that are not traditional telephone companies have received  ETC designation, particularly in connection with the Connect America  Fund Phase II.", "In addition to the ETC designation matter described above, industry  stakeholders highlighted several other issues that can affect access to  federal support, noting that these issues may require further action by  relevant federal agencies or possible legislative action. The issues cited  included:", "Technology Neutral Federal Programs: Most federal broadband  programs focused on fixed technology over other technologies, but as  described above, there have been reforms to broaden eligibility to  other providers. Even with those reforms, industry stakeholders  representing satellite and mobile service providers noted that there  are program requirements that affect one technology more than  another technology. For example, satellite providers that sought  funding through FCC\u2019s Connect America Fund said that, after they  sought funding in 2018, FCC changed how it planned to measure  latency, a change affecting only satellite providers.", "Spectrum Availability: Availability of adequate spectrum was cited  by a range of stakeholder groups we spoke with as an issue that  could affect providers\u2019 ability to deploy services. Spectrum availability  affects many broadband services. For example, in addition to satellite  and mobile providers, fixed-wireless\u2014a point-to-point or point-to- multipoint broadband service delivery option\u2014is a type of fixed  broadband service often utilized in rural areas that needs spectrum to  deliver service. In its comments, FCC noted that the changes it made  to the exact testing conditions were in response to requests by satellite  providers and that the agency balanced changing expectations with the  benefits of minimizing unnecessary burdens on carriers and their  customers imposed by the testing regime.", "Federal Funding Mechanisms: Some industry stakeholders we  spoke with noted that the programs\u2019 funding requirements and the  type of federal funding mechanism utilized\u2014such as grants, loans, or  hybrids of grants and loans\u2014could affect a provider\u2019s ability to access  federal funds. For example, RUS awards its Reconnect Program  funding through grants, loans, or both. Providers we spoke with noted  that for all of the funding options, the Reconnect Program requires a  lien on the funded assets. For some providers, allowing a lien against  an asset would violate stockholder agreements or other aspects of  their business. Additionally, representatives from an association  representing state public service commissions we spoke with also  stated that the FCC high-cost fund and its various funding programs  should be reviewed periodically to ensure that both the contributions  and funding outcomes are in the best interests of consumers and  providers.", "Although agencies have modified their broadband funding programs to  keep up with changes in broadband services, other changes that could be  beneficial to the public would require statutory changes. The last major  overhaul to telecommunications law occurred under the 1996 Act, which  established many of the telecommunications programs that now fund  broadband deployment and established statutory constructs like ETCs,  which, as discussed above, can affect provider eligibility. Given the  significant and ongoing changes in how Americans use the internet and  the technologies that provide access to it, members of Congress have  proposed legislative actions in recent years to sustain progress in closing  the broadband deployment gap. Among the proposals were a range of  federal funding and incentives aimed at improving funding to rural areas  and addressing issues related to deployment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Has Proposed Mapping Data Reforms Aimed at Improving Federal Broadband Program Administration", "paragraphs": ["As we previously reported, FCC\u2019s definition of broadband availability can  lead to overstatements of fixed broadband availability. For instance, in  2013 FCC began collecting broadband availability data by census blocks.  The agency counts an entire census block as served if a provider reports  that it does offer\u2014or could offer without an extraordinary commitment of  resources\u2014service some, but not necessarily all, of the locations in the  census block. FCC has recognized that by measuring availability at the  census block level, not every person may have access to broadband in a  block that the data show as served. FCC has noted that census blocks in  rural areas tend to cover larger geographic areas than in urban areas and  providers may only deploy service to a portion of the census block.  Deployment reporting in this manner does not allow FCC to answer with  certainty questions like how many Americans have broadband available  to their homes or where it needs to target its resources. Several selected  providers and industry associations we contacted also expressed  concerns about how deployment is measured, and said the measurement  approach could make it difficult for them to make informed investment  and deployment decisions. In 2013, FCC declined to gather fixed  broadband data at a level more granular than the census block\u2014such as  address-level data\u2014because the agency concluded that the complexity  and filing burden on the industry would outweigh the benefit. In 2018,  we recommended, among other things, that FCC develop and implement  methods\u2014such as a targeted data collection\u2014for collecting and reporting  accurate and complete data on broadband access specific to tribal  lands. Subsequently in 2019, FCC began to address this  recommendation by establishing the Digital Opportunity Data Collection\u2014 a more granular, nationwide data broadband deployment collection  effort.", "FCC issued a Report and Order, and Second Further Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking, on this new initiative to improve the accuracy of broadband  deployment mapping data in August 2019. This new initiative requires  fixed broadband providers to identify their service areas using free-form  geographic shapes called polygons. The polygons would identify the  presence of service with more geographic precision than the current  census-block method affords. Officials from FCC and USTelecom stated  this new mapping effort was informed in part by a 2019 USTelecom  mapping and data-collection pilot project. According to USTelecom  officials, this pilot project combined several data sources to determine  \u201cserviceable locations,\u201d which refers to specific locations or structures that  could need broadband. With these serviceable locations, USTelecom\u2019s  pilot project sought to distinguish between buildings not typically needing  broadband service\u2014such as a barn or storage shed\u2014from a primary  residence or small business. According to USTelecom representatives, a  combination of polygons and serviceable locations data would yield a  better picture of where to target new investments in deployment to  achieve the greatest increase in access to broadband. FCC officials noted  that the impact of the polygon approach may vary depending on the  service features of each census block. Figure 4 below shows an example  of how the new polygon approach may result in improved data compared  to the census block approach currently used by FCC.", "As part of the rulemaking, FCC has requested comments on several  issues, including how providers should define their polygons, and the  procedures that fixed providers should follow if their polygons are  disputed. At the time it issued the report and order, FCC had ongoing  investigations into the coverage maps of some wireless providers, and  therefore limited the new data collection obligations to fixed broadband  providers while seeking comment on how best to incorporate mobile  wireless coverage data into the effort in the future. FCC also proposed  the use of public input to help verify the accuracy of the polygons and  sought comment on whether it should discontinue the collection of census  block data if the polygon-based deployment data prove to be gathering  better deployment data once it is established. Additionally, on March 23,  2020, the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological  Availability Act was enacted. The act directs FCC to issue final rules on  data collection for both fixed and wireless deployment within 180 days.  In commenting on a draft of this report, FCC noted that it is in the process  of implementing the statute, and that the statute largely affirms rules that  FCC adopted in August 2019 but differs in some respects. FCC also noted  that, while it is working to implement the requirements of the act, it is  unable to comply with all of the requirements without a further  appropriation.", "This change has the potential to improve how both FCC and RUS target  deployment gaps by providing more accurate and granular information  that could better identify truly unserved areas and results in better  targeting of federal funds to those areas. As we discussed above, our  prior work has found that FCC\u2019s current deployment data lack accuracy in  a manner that overstates where consumers have access to broadband,  which, in turn, limits federal agencies\u2019 efforts to effectively target their  broadband funds. Specifically, our 2018 report noted that overstating  access increases the risk that unserved areas remain unserved, since  areas that deployment data show as served are not eligible for funding.  Although that report specifically looked at this risk for tribal areas, it is  potentially a concern for other unserved areas. FCC officials noted that  improved data would help inform future funding under the high-cost  program by more accurately targeting unserved areas. RUS officials told  us that they use FCC deployment data as a source for RUS mapping and  program eligibility requirements for the ReConnect Program. RUS officials  also believe that their program would benefit from more accurate  deployment data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC and RUS Continue to Provide Funding while Coordinating to Avoid Overlap", "paragraphs": ["While efforts are under way to improve deployment data and mapping  efforts, both FCC and RUS are continuing to move forward with their  programs for funding broadband infrastructure in underserved and  unserved areas. The lack of accurate data regarding locations that are  not served by broadband may affect the ability of these agencies\u2019  programs to target federal funds. In particular, providers and industry  associations noted there was a risk of federal programs subsidizing  deployment into areas that already have service, at the expense of an  unserved area that does not have any service. Given this risk, FCC and  RUS each have \u201celigible area\u201d validation processes that they use to  determine if areas are already being served and therefore ineligible for  federal support. Additionally, FCC and RUS have engaged in interagency  coordination efforts to keep each agency\u2019s program staff apprised of key  dates and issues in an effort to avoid overlap between the programs.", "Officials from both FCC and RUS have stated that their programs are  complementary and noted that their eligibility validation processes  reduced the likelihood of service overlaps. The agencies use different  processes to determine which geographic areas are eligible for funding,  and they share information about the results of these processes as they  are able. According to FCC officials, the agency has used a process for  validating unserved areas in connection with its support of the Universal  Service high-cost program. This validation process primarily relies on  providers verifying the Form 477 data they self-report, and then using that  data to create and publish a list of unserved census blocks prior to  awarding funding. Results from this process have informed how FCC  establishes eligible areas, such as those eligible to receive funds in the  Connect America Fund\u2019s second phase of awards.  A similar process is  under way in connection with the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. In an  additional step to address concerns regarding program overlap, FCC  officials noted that the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund would exclude  census blocks that have been awarded funding through the RUS  ReConnect Program.", "RUS\u2019s process to verify eligible areas includes provider participation in  the verification, as well as onsite testing and research by field staff, to  independently verify eligibility of the geographic areas in each ReConnect  grant or loan application. RUS officials said they use the publicly  available FCC data on unserved areas as a key factor in eligibility  decisions. Specifically, RUS officials said that they focus ReConnect  eligibility on areas FCC reported as unserved as of 2015 when the first  round of FCC\u2019s Connect America Fund program was started. They also  noted that throughout the application and funding process, they seek  input from providers through public notices and emails to solicit feedback  on whether areas selected for proposed funding are already served. After  receiving provider feedback on eligible areas, RUS then deploys field staff to conduct on-location tests and other reviews as necessary to determine  if the area was unserved prior to funding.", "In addition to their eligibility validation steps, FCC and RUS officials told  us they share information about where their broadband deployment  programs are funding new deployments, as well as other relevant  information related to program activity, such as the timing of program  applications and awards. FCC and RUS officials told us that they share  program information through participation in interagency meetings and  working groups that focus on broadband deployment issues and through  posting relevant program information\u2014such as funding decisions\u2014online.  For example, the Chief of the FCC\u2019s Wireline Competition Bureau and the  RUS Administrator, along with other FCC and RUS staff, met in July  2019, January 2020, and February 2020 to discuss issues related to their  respective broadband funding programs, including the roll out of the Rural  Digital Opportunity Fund and second round of the ReConnect Program.  FCC officials told us that at these meetings agency representatives  discussed the anticipated timing of elements of their respective programs  and ways in which to maximize coordination and avoid overlap. Officials  from both agencies also noted there has been ongoing communication  between FCC and RUS at the staff level concerning program status and  developments through phone calls and meetings. In addition to this  ongoing coordination between RUS and FCC, representatives of FCC  and RUS also said they participate in relevant working groups through the  American Broadband Initiative, such as the Initiative\u2019s Federal Funding  Workstream, which meets bi-weekly to discuss broadband funding and  deployment.", "The range of collaboration activities undertaken by RUS and FCC staff is  especially important because both agencies have similar goals but  different timelines for moving forward with their programs. For example,  as of March 2020, FCC had the eligible area validation process under  way for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. Although some timelines are  still to be determined, FCC plans to start bidding on the program\u2019s auction  phase in October 2020. At the same time, RUS was in the midst of  announcing approved projects for the first funding round of the  ReConnect Program, and it had applications open for the second round  with applications due by April 15, 2020. FCC officials noted that they plan  to maintain close coordination with RUS to reduce the likelihood of  overlap with any areas that may be deemed eligible to receive ReConnect  funding in the program\u2019s second round. Through prior reforms of their  respective broadband programs, FCC and RUS have taken steps to try  and effectively target federal dollars to support broadband deployment  while avoiding the potential to duplicate funding in an area.
