Law enforcement and bank regulatory officials have also raised concerns about offshore private banking activities and their potential to be the private banking \u201csoft spot\u201d for money laundering. To assist with your continuing deliberations on money laundering, you asked that we review the regulatory oversight of offshore private banking activities and that we specifically address the following areas: regulatory oversight procedures to ensure that offshore private banking activities are covered by banks\u2019 anti-money-laundering efforts, deficiencies identified by banking regulators regarding offshore private banking activities and corrective actions taken by banks, barriers hindering regulatory oversight of offshore private banking activities and efforts to overcome them, and banking industry views regarding regulatory access to documentation pertaining to offshore private banking activities.", "To address these areas, we reviewed examination manuals, relevant agency documents, and examination reports that addressed banks\u2019 anti-money-laundering efforts relative to their private banking activities.

Such products and services may include deposit-taking, lending, mutual funds investing, personal trust and estate administration, funds transfer services, and establishing payable through accounts or offshore trusts. For purposes of this review, we defined offshore private banking as including (1) private banking activities carried out by domestic and foreign banks operating in the United States that involve financial secrecy jurisdictions, including the establishment of accounts for offshore entities, such as private investment companies (PIC)and offshore trusts; and (2) private banking activities conducted by foreign branches of U.S. banks located in these jurisdictions. Offshore entities that maintain private banking accounts provide customers with a high degree of confidentiality and anonymity while offering such other benefits as tax advantages, limited legal liability, and ease of transfer. Sometimes documentation identifying the beneficial owners of offshore entities and their U.S. private banking accounts is maintained in the offshore jurisdiction rather than in the United States. Although banking regulators believe that offshore private banking activities are generally used for legitimate reasons, there is some concern that they may also serve to camouflage money laundering and other illegal acts.", "The government\u2019s reliance on financial institutions as the first line of defense against money laundering activities has increased with the adoption of enhanced suspicious activity reporting rules for banks issued jointly by Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the federal depository institution regulators. The revised rules, which became effective April 1, 1996, require a bank to file a suspicious activity report pertaining to money laundering when a transaction at or above $5,000 (1) involves funds derived from illegal activities or efforts to disguise the nature of such funds, (2) is intended to evade the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements, or (3) is not a normally expected transaction for a particular customer and appears to have no lawful business purpose.", "Federal banking regulators consider \u201cknow your customer\u201d (KYC) policies one of the most important components of an institution\u2019s measures for understanding with whom it is doing business, recognizing unusual transactions, and detecting illegal or suspicious activities. These policies are intended to enable the institution to identify account owners and to recognize the kinds of transactions that a particular customer is likely to engage in. Although such policies are not currently required by regulation or statute, federal banking regulators expect institutions to incorporate KYC policies in their operations, and they have developed examination procedures for determining whether institutions have implemented such policies and related procedures. Federal banking regulators are currently in the process of developing a joint regulation and accompanying guidance intended to formally require banks to establish KYC policies.", "The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are responsible for reviewing banks\u2019 anti-money-laundering efforts, including their KYC policies and procedures. The Federal Reserve and OCC have primary responsibility for examining and supervising the overseas branches of U.S. banks to ascertain the adequacy of their anti-money-laundering efforts.During the past 2 years, the Federal Reserve and OCC have focused attention on banks\u2019 private banking activities in an attempt to ensure that they are not used for money laundering and are not a potential source of reputational or legal risk to banks. In 1996, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) undertook a focused review of banks\u2019 private banking activities in its district that included coverage of related offshore activities as well as a review of banks\u2019 anti-money-laundering programs and KYC policies. This initiative reflected a heightened supervisory interest in the area arising from the growing market for private banking, banks\u2019 increased reliance on private banking as a source of income, and a related increase in competition. Because of the concentration of private banking activities in the New York district and its focused efforts in the area, FRBNY assumed a key role within the Federal Reserve for the oversight of private banking activities. FRBNY, on behalf of the Federal Reserve Board, recently issued a paper on sound practices for private banking activities. At the time of our review, the Federal Reserve Board was also in the process of issuing a private banking examination manual and coordinating training for Federal Reserve examiners in the area of private banking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine how regulators oversee offshore private banking activities, we reviewed BSA examination manuals and other agency documents pertaining to the oversight of private banking and offshore banking activities.

We also reviewed 21 OCC examination reports for 6 banks identified as actively involved in offshore private banking activities. The banks reviewed do not represent all banks that may be involved in offshore private banking activities. They are a subset of banks with a significant level of offshore assets in certain jurisdictions identified to be particularly susceptible to money laundering. (See app. I for more information on the methodology we used to identify banks actively involved in offshore private banking.) For the most part, examinations reviewed were conducted during 1996 and 1997. We interviewed FRBNY and OCC examiners to determine the extent to which general private banking deficiencies identified during examinations applied to the banks\u2019 offshore private banking activities or to obtain their perspectives on the adequacy of corrective actions taken by banks. In addition, we followed up with selected banks to obtain an update on the status of corrective actions that were planned or in process during the last examination.", "To identify barriers associated with overseeing offshore private banking activities, we interviewed federal banking regulators and officials from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF), the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, and the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors. We also interviewed officials of the Central Bank of the Bahamas, Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, and International Monetary Fund. In addition, we reviewed reports issued by FATF, CFATF, and the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors. We also conducted literature searches on the laws of nine offshore jurisdictions selected for review and on their KYC policies and policies for reporting suspicious activity. The nine jurisdictions are the Bahamas, Bahrain, Cayman Islands, Channel Islands, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Panama, Singapore, and Switzerland. (See app. I for more information on how we selected the nine offshore jurisdictions for review.) The information on foreign laws and policies in this report does not reflect our independent legal analysis but is based on interviews and secondary sources.", "To obtain industry views about regulatory access to beneficial owner documentation, we conducted a survey of 15 banks examined by FRBNY during its recent private banking initiative. We inquired about actions the banks had taken or planned to take to comply with FRBNY\u2019s request for access to beneficial owner documentation, the impact of this request on the banks\u2019 private banking business, and the potential impact on them if regulatory access to beneficial owner documentation became a requirement.", "Our work was done primarily in New York, NY; San Francisco, CA; and Washington, D.C., between December 1997 and April 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Efforts to Oversee Offshore Private Banking Activities", "paragraphs": ["Federal banking regulators may review banks\u2019 efforts to prevent or detect money laundering in their offshore private banking activities during overall compliance or BSA examinations; safety and soundness examinations; or, more recently, during targeted examinations of their private banking activities.

OCC\u2019s BSA Manual, for example, cites transactions involving private banking and those involving offshore secrecy jurisdictions as warranting particular attention during examinations. The Federal Reserve also identifies private banking activities, including the establishment of offshore shell companies, as warranting supervisory attention; and it provides specific guidance to banks on sound practices for documenting and exercising due diligence in their conduct of such private banking activities.

In the course of examinations, examiners may test the adequacy of beneficial owner documentation maintained in the United States. However, with the recent exception of FRBNY, we found no evidence that examiners have attempted to examine the documentation that banks maintain in offshore secrecy jurisdictions.", "Examiners we contacted expressed varying views about accessing such documentation for examination purposes. Some examiners said that they do not see a need to examine documents maintained offshore if they are confident about the bank\u2019s commitment to combatting money laundering and to exercising due diligence when establishing offshore entities through private banking accounts. A few examiners expressed reservations about their ability to compel banks, without the leverage of a KYC regulation, to obtain documents maintained in offshore jurisdictions. Others were uncertain about whether a request to export documents from certain offshore jurisdictions could violate their secrecy laws.", "During examinations conducted under its private banking initiative, FRBNY took a different supervisory approach that involved examiners seeking to review beneficial owner documentation regardless of where it was maintained. Because this was the Federal Reserve\u2019s first focused review of private banking activities, verifying whether banks had the ability to identify and profile the beneficial owners of offshore entities that maintained U.S. private banking accounts was viewed as particularly important, according to officials.

Instead, U.S. banking regulators attempt to identify the branches\u2019 anti-money-laundering efforts and to determine whether the banks\u2019 corporate KYC policies are being applied to activities, such as private banking activities, that these U.S. offshore branches may engage in.", "Although examiners are able to review the written policies and procedures being used in these branches, they must rely primarily on the banks\u2019 internal audit functions to verify that the procedures are actually being implemented in offshore branches where U.S. regulators may be precluded from conducting on-site examinations or have restricted access to individual customer information. They may also rely on external audits, but they are apparently less prone to do so, because external audits tend to focus on financial rather than KYC issues. In our review of 56 examinations, we noted only 1 instance in which examiners relied on the work of an external auditor for a review of KYC procedures at a bank\u2019s offshore branches.

Of the remaining two banks, one provided examiners with the identity of the beneficial owners of several PICs that maintained accounts with the bank. The other bank, which offered services to offshore mutual funds, provided examiners with documentation certifying that the administrator of these funds had applied KYC policies to the shareholders (i.e., beneficial owners) of the funds.", "The two banks with inadequate KYC policies at their offshore locations were at different stages of correcting the deficiency. One of the banks had made changes to its KYC policies for its Switzerland branch to make them consistent with its corporate policies. The other bank had developed a corporate KYC policy and dedicated resources towards bringing its KYC policies at the Switzerland branch into compliance with its corporate policy, but both regulators and bank officials we spoke with indicated that greater progress was needed. Regulators told us that they were going to continue monitoring the situation.", "Most of the banks with inadequate client profiles were making progress on improving these profiles, but some shortfalls remained. Some of the banks were developing strategies to improve the documentation on their client profiles. For example, a few banks prioritized the process for updating their client base by focusing first on high-risk accounts such as those associated with PICs. We found that despite these efforts, regulators noted that some banks\u2019 client profiles were still inadequate, and other banks were not updating their clients\u2019 profiles in a timely manner. One bank official we spoke with explained that updating thousands of client profiles was much more time intensive than the bank had initially anticipated.", "We noted that most of the banks identified by examiners as having weak management information systems were either reviewing their systems or in the process of installing software to monitor unusual or suspicious transactions.

These efforts could not cover similar accounts or other private banking activities conducted on behalf of customers who deal directly with offshore branches of U.S. banks that are considered to be outside the purview of U.S. regulators. Finally, during 1998, U.S. regulators visited U.S. bank branches located in Hong Kong and Uruguay, also viewed as a financial secrecy jurisdiction.

The first approach would be for banks to routinely retain records in the United States on the beneficial owners of offshore entities that maintain U.S. private banking accounts. The second approach would be for banks to bring records on the beneficial owners of these offshore entities into the United States only if requested during an examination. We found that both approaches caused a similar level of concern, with some bank officials stating that the bank would need to make the same changes to how it maintains documentation on the beneficial owners of offshore entities in either case. Bank officials believed that for the most part, under both approaches, their banks would be at a competitive disadvantage with other financial institutions (e.g., securities broker/dealers, foreign banks) not subject to the same requirement.

We also found that the most recent information identified on private banking in the United States was a general overview of the area, which did not consistently identify the providers that were engaged in international, specifically offshore, activities.

Our methodology is described in greater detail below.", "We identified 16 banks that were actively involved in offshore private banking activities. We supplemented this group of banks with information from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) on banks in its district involved in private banking activities.

The first approach would be for banks to routinely retain records in the United States on the beneficial owners of offshore entities that maintain U.S. private banking accounts. The second approach would be for banks to bring records on the beneficial owners of these offshore entities into the United States only if requested during an examination.
