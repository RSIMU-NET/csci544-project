A greater proportion of very high-income school districts had dispute resolution activity as well as higher rates of dispute activity than very low-income districts in most of the five states GAO reviewed. GAO also found that in most of these states, a smaller proportion of predominately Black and/or Hispanic districts had dispute resolution activity compared to districts with fewer minority students; however, predominately Black and/or Hispanic districts generally had higher rates of such activity.

Under IDEA, states must ensure that school districts make a free  appropriate public education (FAPE) available to all children with  disabilities who qualify for special education services. At times, parents  and school districts disagree over whether the school district is meeting  this obligation. IDEA requires states to make several dispute resolution  options available through which districts and parents may resolve any  disputes that arise about a child\u2019s eligibility for or receipt of special  education services. These options include mediation, due process  complaints, and state complaints filed with the state educational agency  (SEA).", "There is a well-established link between racial and ethnic minorities and  poverty, and studies have noted concerns about this segment of the  population that falls at the intersection of poverty and minority status in  schools and how this affects their access to quality education. Our prior  work has also discussed the association between poverty and race or  ethnicity. We have found that high schools with a relatively large  proportion of students in poverty also tend to have a higher proportion of  minority students, students with disabilities, and English learners.

We collected dispute data at the school district-  level from five states\u2014Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and  Pennsylvania. We selected these states based on a combination of  factors, including the level of dispute activity within the state (that is, the  number of mediations, due process complaints, and state complaints), the  number of school districts in the state with highly homogenous student  populations (to allow us to compare across school districts with different  student populations), and states\u2019 ability to provide reliable school district-  level data on disputes. To compare these homogeneous student  populations we focused our analyses on school district income and  race/ethnicity. We describe districts as \u201cvery low-income\u201d if at least 90  percent of students were eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch  and as \u201cvery high-income\u201d if no more than 10 percent of students were  eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch.

A due process complaint is a request for a  formal due process hearing. A due process hearing is conducted  before a qualified and impartial hearing officer and involves  presentation of evidence, sworn testimony, and cross-examination. It  often involves attorneys and expert witnesses, and thus may be more  costly than other dispute resolution options for all parties involved.  Because a due process hearing is a formal proceeding, it may be  more adversarial in nature than other dispute resolution options.  Either party can appeal a hearing officer\u2019s decision by bringing a civil  action in any state court of competent jurisdiction or in a U.S. district  court. Not all due process complaints result in a due process  hearing. For example, some due process complaints may be  withdrawn by the parents or not meet the requirements for a filing a  complaint under IDEA regulations. In addition, in some cases, the  parents and school district may resolve the complaint through  alternative means, such as mediation.", "The 2004 IDEA reauthorization added the requirement for a resolution  meeting to the due process complaint process to try to resolve the issues  in a parent\u2019s due process complaint collaboratively before the parties may  proceed to the formal and often costly due process complaint hearing  procedure. A resolution meeting must take place within 15 days of a  parent filing a due process complaint and before any due process hearing  involving a hearing officer, unless both parties agree in writing to waive  the meeting or agree to use the IDEA\u2019s mediation process.

Once the SEA receives such a complaint,  it must engage in specified procedures to resolve the complaint,  including conducting an on-site investigation, if the SEA determines  that it is necessary. Generally, the SEA must issue a written  decision within 60 calendar days unless exceptional circumstances  warrant an extension or the parties agree to extend the timeline to  engage in an alternative dispute resolution procedure. The SEA\u2019s  written decision must include findings of fact and conclusions and the  reasons for the SEA\u2019s final decision.

When resolution meetings did occur, they resulted in resolution  agreements less than 30 percent of the time in 10 of these 12 years.", "Mediation. According to CADRE, mediation is viewed as less  adversarial than due process hearings, in part, because parties work  together to try to reach an agreement. CADRE also reports that  mediation is generally believed to be less costly than due process  hearings because it typically requires less time and may require less  involvement from attorneys and other experts. The number of  mediation requests increased from school year 2004-05 to 2016-17 as  Education and the states encouraged dispute resolution options that  stakeholders told us were less costly and confrontational. In school  year 2016-17, there were 11,413 mediations requested, the largest  number of requests from school year 2004-05 to 2016-17. In  addition, mediation requests resulted in mediation meetings at least  60 percent of the time in each of these school years. Those meetings  resulted in agreements at least two-thirds of the time in every year but  one (see fig. 2).

For example, a dispute related  to placement may arise if a parent wants their child to spend more time in  a regular education classroom as opposed to a self-contained classroom  with only special education students. A parent might also object if a  school district wants to place their child in an alternative school. On the  other hand, some parents may seek an out-of-district placement for their  child if they feel that more services will be available. A dispute over  services may center on a parent asking for services for their child that the  school district refuses to provide, or a parent believing that the school  district is not providing services that are included in their child\u2019s  individualized education program. Research we reviewed generally  supported what stakeholders told us were the main causes of disputes,  although discipline issues were not reported as frequently.", "Other issues that led to disputes less frequently, according to those we  spoke with, included, lack of progress on the part of the student, parental  participation in decision making, transition services, and other  accommodations for students."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dispute Resolution Activity Varied Based on the Income Level and Racial/Ethnic Characteristics of Districts in Selected States", "paragraphs": ["When we analyzed five states\u2019 dispute resolution data we found that  dispute resolution activity varied based on districts\u2019 income levels.

According to stakeholders we  interviewed, in some cases, Protection and Advocacy agencies (P&A)\u2014 which are funded by the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS)\u2014provide legal services to parents at no cost, or refer clients to  other attorneys. In general, however, very few attorneys will work on a pro-bono basis to handle IDEA dispute cases, according to stakeholders.  Further, under IDEA, a court may award parents reasonable attorney\u2019s  fees and costs if they prevail in a due process hearing; however, parents  cannot recoup expert witness costs regardless of the outcome. Also, if  parents do not prevail at a due process hearing, they may be responsible  for the school district\u2019s legal costs in addition to their own, which can be a  disincentive to going through a hearing. Education regulations allow  parents to be accompanied and advised in due process hearings by  individuals with special knowledge about children with disabilities, and  according to IDEA regulations, whether those individuals can legally  represent them is determined by state law. According to Education  officials, bringing non-attorneys to support them may help reduce costs.  However, the school district is likely to still have legal representation.", "The amount of direct legal services P&As provide varies across, and even  within, states. P&A staff we interviewed in one state told us that their  attorneys in one city spend most of their time assessing parents\u2019 cases,  reviewing documentation, giving advice, answering questions, and  conducting training for parents, but little time participating in actual  hearings.

According to  stakeholders we interviewed, some areas, particularly rural ones, may  have fewer available attorneys.

Furthermore, these families may have no other educational options in the  area to turn to if the dispute becomes too contentious. In some cultures,  according to stakeholders, it is less common to challenge an authority  figure, such as a school district official or teacher. In addition, according  to stakeholders, parents may fear the school district will retaliate against  their children or them if the parents initiate a dispute, such as by  threatening to stop providing services. Stakeholders also told us that they  are aware of cases in which the school district has called the state\u2019s child  protective services agency in what they believe was retaliation for parents  bringing a dispute against the district, and that parents who are  undocumented may fear that raising a dispute might result in unwanted  attention from immigration officials. Further, according to stakeholders,  some parents face other challenges, such as language barriers, difficulty  obtaining time off from work, transportation, or internet access that could  affect their use of IDEA dispute resolution and their ability to take  advantage of resources, such as IDEA dispute resolution training,  workshops, and online information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Education Funds Technical Assistance Providers That Explain Dispute Resolution Processes to Parents", "paragraphs": ["Education and SEAs provide technical assistance to support parents\u2019  understanding of their rights under IDEA and to facilitate their use of  dispute resolution options.

Regarding the cost of due process hearings  discussed earlier, one state we contacted provides information about free  and low-cost services along with the state\u2019s parents\u2019 rights booklet, and  several states include contact information for the PTIs and sometimes  P&As in their booklet.", "State officials we interviewed also said their states offer telephone  helplines that parents can call with questions about their dispute  resolution options and the processes involved. Some state officials told us  they have staff available by phone to explain the dispute options to  parents, including to parents who do not speak English or have lower  levels of formal education. One state has a phone line that connects  parents to an early resolution specialist who will try to help parents  resolve the dispute before a formal complaint becomes necessary.  Officials in one state told us that the state has installed voice  interpretation technology for its helpline so that parents who need  assistance with hearing or speaking can communicate with staff. Some  states also employ staff who can serve as interpreters to better assist  non-English speaking parents. Officials in some states told us that staff  answering the helpline are available to answer questions about dispute  resolution documents for parents who have difficulty reading. In addition,  some of the states we contacted said they made requesting mediation  and/or filing state complaints easier by posting the required initiation  forms on their websites. According to staff from one state, after the state  posted its state complaint form online, the number of complaints doubled  in 5 years.", "Further, some of our selected states provide training and technical  assistance to school districts, parent advocate groups, and parents  related to accessing IDEA dispute options. One of our selected states  uses 16 regional support teams to provide training and technical  assistance to school districts. Another state conducts parent training  jointly with the Education-funded PTI in the state. We have previously  reported on other efforts some states have taken to help parents  understand their dispute rights and reduce the need for parents to initiate  formal disputes. For example, some states have offered conflict resolution  skills training to school district staff and parents, and support facilitated  IEP meetings, among other initiatives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to the Department of Education for  review and comment.

In particular, this  report examines (1) how often IDEA dispute resolution options are used,  and whether use in selected states varies across school district-level  socioeconomic or demographic characteristics; and (2) what challenges  parents face in using IDEA dispute resolution options and how Education  and selected states help facilitate parents\u2019 use of these options.", "To address our first objective, we obtained publicly available dispute  resolution data at the national and state levels and collected and  analyzed data on the number and types of dispute resolution options  used from selected states at the school district level. To address how  often dispute resolution options are used, we reviewed and analyzed  publicly available data from the Center for Appropriate Dispute Resolution  in Special Education (CADRE) from school years 2004-05 to 2016-17, the  most recent data available when we conducted our analysis. We  assessed the reliability of these data by interviewing knowledgeable  CADRE staff and comparing CADRE data to other publicly available data.  In addition, we interviewed staff at Parent Training and Information  Centers (PTI) funded by the Department of Education (Education) and  Protection and Advocacy (P&A) agencies funded by the Department of  Health and Human Services, as well as state educational agency (SEA)  officials in our five selected states to determine the reasons parents use  dispute resolution. We also interviewed various national organizations  that advocate for parents and local educational agencies (LEA) and  SEAs.", "To determine whether the use of dispute resolution options varied by  socioeconomic or racial and/or ethnic characteristics, we analyzed  dispute resolution data we collected at the LEA level from five states for  school year 2017-18, the most recent data available at the time of our  analysis. We selected these states\u2014Massachusetts, Michigan, New  Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania\u2014based on a combination of criteria  including the amount of dispute activity within the state (that is, the  number of mediations, due process complaints, and state complaints); the  large number of LEAs in the state with highly homogenous student  populations to allow us to compare across LEAs with different student  populations; the large number of IDEA-eligible students in the state; and  the states\u2019 ability to provide reliable LEA level data on disputes. We used  Education\u2019s Common Core of Data (CCD) to categorize each LEA in our  selected states based on (1) income level, as measured by the  percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch; (2)  racial and/or ethnic makeup, as measured by the percentage of Black  and/or Hispanic students; and (3) population density, as categorized by  CCD. We used Education\u2019s school year 2016-17 CCD data, which was  the most recent data available at the time of our analysis. In some cases,  states had not reported 2016-17 free or reduced-price school lunch data  to CCD so we used CCD data from a previous year. We assessed the  reliability of the CCD data by (1) reviewing existing information about the  data and the system that produced them and (2) reviewing data reliability  assessments of the data from other recent GAO reports. We assessed  the reliability of dispute resolution data provided by the states by (1)  performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2) conducting  interviews with knowledgeable agency officials and reviewing written  responses to data reliability questions, and (3) reviewing existing  information about the data and systems that produced them, where  available. We determined that the CCD and data collected from the states  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We matched the LEA-level dispute data provided by our states to the  LEA-level socioeconomic, race/ethnicity, and population density data from  CCD to determine whether the frequency of use of dispute resolution  options or the types of options used varied across LEAs with different  characteristics. Because our analyses are at the LEA level, and not the  individual student or family level, it is impossible to know with certainty  whether the families using the dispute resolution options in our school  districts match the categorization of the districts themselves. To address  this concern to the greatest extent possible, we report on LEAs that are  highly homogenous. These districts are those in which:", "90 percent or more of the students were eligible for free or reduced- price school lunch (very low-income districts) compared to districts in  which 10 percent or fewer of the students were eligible (very high- income districts), and", "90 percent or more of the students were Black and/or Hispanic (very  high-minority districts) compared to districts in which 10 percent or  fewer of the students were Black and/or Hispanic (very low-minority  districts).", "We conducted two separate analyses on the combined data. We  analyzed and compared:  1.  the percentage of all the \u201cvery low\u201d districts in our data that had  dispute resolution activity to the percentage of all the \u201cvery high\u201d  districts in our data with dispute resolution activity, as measured by  whether the district had one or more mediation requests, due process  complaints, or state complaints. We also conducted this analysis to  compare the percentages of urban, suburban, and rural districts with  dispute resolution activity.  2.  the rate of dispute resolution activity in our \u201cvery low\u201d districts and our  \u201cvery high\u201d districts, as measured by the number of mediation  requests, due process complaints, and state complaints per 10,000  students served under IDEA. We also conducted this analysis for  urban, suburban, and rural districts.", "This first analysis compared the percentages of school districts with  different income and racial and/or ethnic characteristics that had at least  one mediation request, due process complaint, or state complaint. In  essence, it shows the differences in whether there is any dispute  resolution activity in districts with different income and racial and/or ethnic  characteristics, in our selected states. Because our analysis counts  districts in which a single dispute resolution was initiated in the same  manner as those with more activity, it is not potentially skewed by  individual districts that may have unusually high or low levels of dispute  resolution activity. To supplement this analysis, our second analysis  compares the rate of dispute activity in these types of districts, which  shows the magnitude of the various types of dispute resolution activity.", "Although we use this 90-10 threshold in the body of the report, we also  conducted these analyses for districts where 75 percent or more of  students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch and 25 percent or  fewer were not eligible. Similarly, we conducted our race/ethnicity  analyses at this same level as well. These additional analyses can be  found in appendix III. The results from our five states are not  generalizable to all states.", "To address both research objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws  and regulations. We also reviewed Education documents, including its  model Notice of Procedural Safeguards, PTI and CADRE documents, and  relevant literature related to challenges parents face using dispute  resolution.", "In addition, we interviewed Education officials about challenges families  face in using dispute resolution options and Education\u2019s efforts to assist  families.
