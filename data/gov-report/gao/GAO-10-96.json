However, DHS does not have the capability to fully verify the digital signatures because it has not deployed e-passport readers to all of its ports of entry and it has not implemented the system functionality necessary to perform the verification. Because the value of security features depends not only on their solid design, but also on an inspection process that uses them, the additional security against forgery and counterfeiting that could be provided by the inclusion of computer chips on e-passports issued by the United States and foreign countries, including those participating in the visa waiver program, is not fully realized. Protections designed into the U.S. e-passport computer chip limit the risks of malicious code being resident on the chip, a necessary precondition for a malicious code attack to occur from the chip against computer systems that read them. GPO and State have taken additional actions to decrease the likelihood that malicious code could be introduced onto the chip. While these steps do not provide complete assurance that the chips are free from malicious code, the limited communications between the e-passport chip and agency computers significantly lowers the risk that malicious code--if resident on an e-passport chip--could pose to agency computers.

For example, malicious code might be designed  to delete files on a system or repeatedly attempt access to a system service  and thus effectively shut it down. The effects of malicious code can range  from performance degradation to compromise of mission-critical  applications. Some common forms of malicious code include viruses,  worms, and Trojan horses. Viruses infect a system by attaching themselves  to host programs or data files. Worms are self-contained programs that can  self-replicate and do not require human interaction to spread through a  system or network. Trojan horses are nonreplicating programs that appear  benign but are designed with a malicious purpose.", "Malicious code often takes advantage of vulnerabilities in a system\u2019s  software to either spread or execute. For example, a common  vulnerability, known as a buffer overflow, redirects system control to a  malicious program through badly designed software. Inadequate controls  on a network\u2019s connections or services are another common vulnerability  that allows malicious code to spread. Common protections against  malicious code include input checking at the boundaries of a system, such  as at external interfaces to a system; network controls to lower the  possibility that malicious code could spread within a system; and patch  management to address vulnerabilities in the system\u2019s software that  malicious code can exploit.", "In general, a successful malicious code attack first requires that the  malicious code get into a system. This can occur, for example, by inserting  infected media into the computer or through incomplete controls on the  system\u2019s network connections. Second, the malicious code needs to  spread to those areas of a system to which it wants to cause damage.  Malicious code can spread in many ways, including various network  protocols and services and also in simple file transfers. Finally, malicious  code needs to be executed, often by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in  a system\u2019s software.", "Therefore, in the case of e-passports, a successful malicious code attack  from the chip would first require that malicious code get on the chip.

Second, the CBP workstation calculates the  hash values of the data groups read from the computer chip and compares  them with the hash values stored in the security data. If available, the CBP  workstation will also use the digital certificate to verify the digital  signature. The expiration date of the e-passport and the digital certificate  are also checked. Finally, if the e-passport has been previously read by  CBP, the hash value of the facial image is compared with the value stored  by CBP.

While DHS tested the functionality of  storing and using this information to verify the certificates included by  State and other nations on e-passports using the CBP workstation, the  functionality was not implemented for operations because the  infrastructure to collect and maintain the international certificate database  did not exist. According to DHS officials, this function was a US-VISIT  requirement, but did not get implemented, in part, because a DHS  component that would be responsible for operating the public key  database was never identified.

First, a database needs to be  established and populated with the digital certificates needed to fully  validate the digital signatures that can be accessed by CBP inspection  workstations at the ports of entry. An approach needs to be developed and  implemented to populate the database with the needed information,  including State Department data for U.S. e-passports, that can be used to  fully validate the digital signatures.

Second,  CBP needs to develop and implement functionality on its inspection  workstations to access the database when e-passport data are read to  verify that the legitimate passport-issuing authority signed the data being  relied upon.

For  example, after removing top layers of plastic or other coverings and  uncovering the electrical surfaces of the chip, attackers could probe into  the various chip layers in an attempt to understand its processing.  Common methods of physical attack are those related to (1) fault  introduction, (2) IC monitoring, and (3) reverse engineering. The purpose  of each of these attacks is ultimately to uncover secret information\u2014such  as cryptographic keys or passwords\u2014that would allow an attacker to  open the chip for read/write access via the contactless interface. In fault  introduction, attackers attempt to introduce faults randomly, at specific  times during the processing, or in specific locations on the IC circuitry, to  gain additional information about the chip processing during such faults,  which could provide clues to the memory location of secret keys.  Similarly, such clues can be uncovered using IC monitoring, where readers  or probes placed on the chip\u2019s internal circuitry are used to monitor  calculations or flows of data on the chip.

For example, protections against fault introduction include  implementing sensors that detect when parameters, such as light or  temperature, vary outside of expected values. If such variations are  sensed, the chip may automatically reset or even disable itself. Protections  against IC monitoring might include encrypting the traffic flowing along  the internal circuitry so that interpretation would be difficult. Protections  against physical analysis include encrypting information stored in memory  and scrambling the design of the logic contained in the operating system  when laid down in memory during IC creation.

A basic premise in cryptography is that good systems  depend only on the secrecy of the key used to perform the operations  rather than on any attempt to keep the algorithm secret. The algorithms  used to perform most cryptographic operations over the Internet are well  known; however, because the keys used by these algorithms are kept  secret, the process is considered secure.", "The basis of PKI\u2019s security assurances is a sophisticated cryptographic  technique known as public key cryptography, which employs algorithms  designed so that the key that is used to encrypt plaintext cannot be  calculated from the key that is used to decrypt the ciphertext. These two  keys complement each other in such a way that when one key is used for  encryption, only the other key can decrypt the ciphertext. One of these  keys is kept private and is known as the private key, while the other key is  widely published and is referred to as the public key. When used as shown  in figure 4, public key cryptography can help to assure data confidentiality  because only the private key can be used to decrypt the information  encrypted using the public key. When used as shown in figure 5, public key  cryptography can help provide authentication, nonrepudiation, and data  integrity because the public key will only work to decrypt the information  if it was encrypted using the private key.
