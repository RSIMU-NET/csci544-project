We previously reported that $39.4 billion (about 60 percent) of the Department\u2019s $65.8 billion secondary inventory as of September 30, 1997, exceeded operating requirements and that the Department\u2019s cost of operations could be reduced by disposing of inventories if it was economical to do so.Through disposal, the Department eliminates some storage costs and the government recoups a small fraction of an item\u2019s purchase price. However, if stock is disposed of before it is economical to do so, inadequate supplies of the item could reduce readiness and costly repurchases might be necessary.", "The Department divides secondary inventory into two broad categories. Supplies that are expected to be used within 2 years or that meet war reserve requirements are categorized as active inventory; amounts beyond that level are placed in inactive status. Components may retain inactive inventory if it is economical to do so; inventory retained for this reason is referred to as economic retention inventory. Department regulations state that the economic retention level for an item should be based on an analysis that balances the costs of retention and disposal.  In doing the analysis, the Department\u2019s regulations state that components should consider factors such as storage costs, potential long-term demand, potential repurchase costs, and the expected life of the weapon system the item is to support.

The Air Force did not develop an economic retention model; rather it employed a model based on historical usage patterns.  Most recently, all the components lowered their maximum levels (referred to as ceilings) for items in economic retention during the 1990s to help them meet inventory reduction targets.", "The Department requires that an economic model calculating whether to retain an inventory item or dispose of it should compare the cost of retention with the cost of disposal and select the option with the least cost.  As the amount of inactive stock increases, the cost of retention increases (more items cost more to hold) and the cost of disposal decreases (with greater amounts of an item on hand, the likelihood of having to repurchase it becomes less).  Equilibrium is reached when the additional cost of retention equals that of disposal.  This equilibrium level of inventory is the economic retention level\u2014the largest retention amount of an inactive item that can be justified by economic analysis.  Any amount of inventory over this level would become eligible for retention on a contingency basis or disposal.", "Management of the Department\u2019s secondary inventory is a complex process, and effectively implementing systemwide improved management approaches has been a long-standing challenge for the Department.However, following the end of the Cold War, the Department recognized that it had unnecessarily high inventories as a result of major reductions in its force structure, and it directed the components to take action to lower inventory levels, including economic retention inventory. In response to this directive, during 1994, the Army, Navy, and Defense Logistics Agency chose to lower economic retention inventory levels by placing a preset maximum retention level that generally fell below the levels calculated by the models.  The Air Force lowered its maximum level in 1996.", "The Department reported its economic retention inventory fell from about $13.8 billion to about $9.4 billion (about 32 percent) between fiscal year 1991 and 1999 (see fig. 1) and by 40 percent when adjusted for inflation. The latter part of this period covers the years when lower ceilings were put in place by the services and Defense Logistics Agency. Although all three services reported reductions in economic retention inventory levels during this time, the changes were uneven. The Air Force reported the smallest decrease in economic retention inventory\u2014from about $5.1 billion to about $4.5 billion (about 12 percent). In contrast, the Army reported a decrease from about $1.3 billion to about $600 million (about 54 percent) and the Navy from about $5.6 billion to about $1.6 billion (over 71 percent). On the other hand, the Defense Logistics Agency reported an increase in economic retention inventory from about $1.8 billion to about $2.7 billion (about 50 percent) as a result of a decision to consolidate management responsibility for all consumable items within the Agency. According to Department data, if it had not required the services to transfer management of large quantities of inventory to the Defense Logistics Agency during the 1990s, the Defense Logistics Agency inventory would have decreased by over a billion dollars. (See app. I for more details on how the composition of secondary and retention inventory changed between fiscal year 1991 and 1999.)", "It is also important to note that, in response to a congressional mandate, the Department is conducting an independent study of secondary inventory and parts shortages as required by section 362 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.

Instead, components lowered maximum levels of inventory that could be held (referred to as ceilings) to make economic retention determinations that would help achieve agency inventory reduction goals.

The Army, Navy, and Defense Logistics Agency developed models designed for making economic decisions that consider the costs of retention and the costs of disposal. The Air Force does not compare retention and disposal costs in determining economic retention inventories.  Instead, the Air Force employs historical usage levels to determine economic retention levels.", "The components developed their models in different ways and use different factors and assumptions in their models without detailed documentation. The amount of inventory to hold in economic retention varies by model depending on the factors and assumptions in the models. The economic retention models of the three components generally meet the Department\u2019s requirements to compare retention costs to disposal costs, but the factors and assumptions in them vary across the components. For example, the Army and Navy use a factor of obsolescence and the Defense Logistics Agency does not. In addition, the values for similar factors used in economic retention models varied among components. For example, the Army\u2019s value for loss rates (loss through theft or decay) is 1 percent, the Navy\u2019s value is 4 percent, and the Defense Logistics Agency does not use a loss rate.", "Furthermore, the components have not appropriately updated their model assumptions.  For example, prescribed discount rates, a key assumption in all economic retention models, vary across components\u2019 models. The Navy uses a 10-percent discount rate and the Army and the Defense Logistics Agency use a 7-percent rate for computing net present values.  Neither value matches discount rates recommended by the Office of Management and Budget for a cost-effectiveness analysis, which is the decision to retain or dispose of inventory. The rates are also inconsistent with our guidance on discount rates. For example, for the year 2000, the Office of Management and Budget discount rate for a cost-effectiveness analysis was 4.2 percent for a 30-year analysis; the rate was 2.9 percent in 1999.", "Further information about component economic models can be found in appendix II of this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Components\u2019 Ceilings Are Different and Judgmentally Based", "paragraphs": ["The use of a maximum level to manage economic retention stocks (commonly called ceilings by components) makes the Department vulnerable to retaining items when it is uneconomical to retain them or disposing of items that are economical to keep. The components judgmentally developed their ceilings for economic retention inventory, which differ and have yielded lower levels of economic retention inventory than the levels calculated by the economic retention models.", "During 1994-96, the components established different ceilings for items in economic retention. A ceiling imposes an upper constraint of years of demand\u2014the quantity needed on an annual basis to meet requirements\u2014 on how much inactive inventory can be retained. Prior to the 1990s, the components had set ceilings on retention inventory that varied but that generally exceeded higher levels determined by their economic retention models. While component ceilings varied in the span of years of demand, they also varied in the total years of inventory covered. The Army ceiling is applied to inventories above active inventory requirements. The Air Force, Navy, and Defense Logistics Agency ceilings apply to their entire inventory requirements, including active inventory. Table 1 summarizes the maximum levels used by each component during the 1990s.", "According to component officials the components now hold fewer items in economic retention status because the ceilings established in the 1990s replaced the levels calculated by economic retention models. The components\u2019 more stringent ceilings result in smaller inventory level determinations than would be calculated with economic retention models. Figure 2 illustrates the level a model might calculate and how a more constrained ceiling would override it. For example, a component\u2019s ceiling for economic retention stock is 6 years of demand above requirements. If the model computed an economic retention limit (e.g., 8 years of demand of 25 items a year\u2014200 items) that exceeded the maximum level (e.g., 6 years of demand\u2014150 items), the ceiling (150 items) would be selected as the retention level.

However, no studies had been conducted to determine if economic retention models could be used to establish appropriate Department inventory levels on an economic basis, rather than through the use of ceilings. There was little documentation available supporting the selection of the factors and assumptions used in economic retention models, such as obsolescence rates and discount rates. The various factors and assumptions might be appropriate, but in most cases the components lacked documentation describing why they were selected for use.", "Furthermore, the limited information that is available about the impact of ceilings indicates that they could be causing uneconomical disposals. For example, the Army Audit Agency produced a March 2000 study that suggested that, while the Agency found no instances in which an item was disposed of when it was more economical to retain it, it concluded, based on the statements of inventory managers, that maximum levels resulted in the disposal of items that were still economical to retain.

Components typically determine that the appropriate price to use in this calculation is the last price paid for an item. If an item needs repair, this cost is also added. The percentages for all the cost factors are then multiplied by an item's price and totaled to obtain the estimated cost of retention. The end result of these calculations is that the model's estimate of retention cost rises for each additional unit of an item held.", "Another consideration for determining retention cost is the possibility that an item may become obsolete. An item could be replaced by a new item or the weapon system the item supports could be discontinued. To address this possibility, the value of the item is reduced based on estimates by the managing component of the likelihood it would not be used. For example, if an item is valued at $100 and there is a 0.9 probability that the item would be needed in a future period, then the $100 value of the item would be multiplied by 0.9 to yield a future value of $90, based on the 10-percent possibility of obsolescence.", "Almost two-thirds of the Department\u2019s economic retention stock consists of reparable items.

Some components include estimates of administrative costs associated with procuring an item (such as contract costs) and the cost of starting up a production line to manufacture the item.  Estimated future prices can be higher than original purchase prices because additional costs could be incurred, such as the administrative costs involved in contracting with a manufacturer, and setup costs.

In December 1999 the Army revised the ceiling limits to 7 years of demand above requirements for serviceable reparables, 6 years of demand above requirements for unserviceable reparables, and 5 years of demand above requirements for all other items. At the same time the Army decided to let each inventory control point set its own ceilings. An Army official at one of its five inventory control points stated that his inventory control point is using the determinations of the economic retention model for setting retention inventory limits without the ceilings. Army officials at the other four inventory control points stated that they have not changed their ceilings.", "In 1994, the Navy chose to implement ceilings of years of demand depending on the expected future growth of the weapon system. The Navy computation system for inventory calculates a single inventory limit that includes active requirements and inactive inventory.  As a result, the demand ceiling (4, 8, or 12 years of total demand) applies to the entire computed demand limit\u2014not just economic retention limits. The ceiling is 12 years of total demand for items supporting new weapon systems. A ceiling of 8 years of total demand is applied to items supporting weapons systems in common use and 4 years of total demand is applied to items supporting weapons systems approaching obsolescence.", "The Defense Logistics Agency ceiling for items in economic retention, implemented in 1994, is 6 years of total demand.  The prior ceiling on years of demand for inactive inventory was 10 years of total demand.", "The Air Force ceiling for inventory in economic retention status was reduced from 20 years of total maximum demand to 13 years of total maximum demand in 1996, according to Air Force officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine component approaches to making economic retention decisions, we interviewed Department and component officials who managed economic retention models and ceilings in the Defense Logistics Agency, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force and reviewed documents they provided. Because the Marine Corps had less than 1 percent of the Department\u2019s total economic retention inventory, we did not include the Marine Corps in our analysis.  We did not independently test or validate the component models or inventory systems.", "We interviewed officials and gathered relevant documentation for our review at the following locations:  The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics), Washington, D.C.", "The Defense Logistics Agency, Ft.

Our analysis included data for fiscal year 1991 through 1999 for trends in economic retention.  We reviewed data from these time periods because the Department changed the way dollar estimates of inventory were calculated in 1990; inventory data was reported consistently in the Supply System Inventory Report from 1991 through 1999. Component officials stated that there were differences in the categories of inventory components reported in the Supply System Inventory Report. We did not adjust the Supply System Inventory Report data for this analysis.  We analyzed data for reparable and consumable items for fiscal years 1993 through 1999 because the Department first separately reported data on reparable and consumable items in its 1993 Supply System Inventory Report. Our review focused on the models and items with predictable demand. We did not analyze items with limited demand (see app. II). We did not independently test or validate the accuracy of the data reported in these inventory systems.  We adjusted Department data to account for inflation as part of our analysis of component performance in realizing inventory reductions over time.", "We conducted our work between May 1999 and January 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
