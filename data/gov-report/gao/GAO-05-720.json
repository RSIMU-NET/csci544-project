Adding to these challenges is the difficulty that USPTO has had attracting and retaining qualified staff. In this context, GAO was asked to obtain information about USPTO's patent organization. Specifically GAO reviewed (1) overall progress in implementing the initiatives in its strategic plan; (2) efforts to attract and retain a qualified patent workforce; and (3) remaining challenges, if any, in attracting and retaining a qualified patent workforce."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USPTO has made more progress in implementing its strategic plan initiatives to increase the agency's capability than initiatives aimed at decreasing patent pendency. USPTO has fully or partially implemented all 23 capability initiatives that focus on improving the skills of employees, enhancing quality assurance, and altering the patent system through changes in existing laws or regulations. In contrast, the agency has partially or fully implemented only 8 of the 15 initiatives aimed at reducing pendency. Lack of funding was cited as the primary reason for not implementing these initiatives. With passage of legislation in December 2004 to increase fees available to USPTO for the next two years, the agency is re-evaluating the feasibility of implementing some of these initiatives. Since 2000, USPTO has taken steps intended to help attract and retain a qualified patent examination workforce, such as enhancing its recruiting efforts and using many of the human capital benefits available under federal personnel regulations. However, it is too soon to determine the long-term success of the agency's recruiting efforts because they have been in place only a short time and have not been consistently sustained due to budgetary constraints. Long-term uncertainty about USPTO's hiring and retention success is also due to the unknown impact of the economy. In the past, when the economy was doing well, the agency had more difficulty in recruiting and retaining the staff it needed. USPTO faces three long-standing challenges that could also undermine its efforts to retain a qualified workforce: the lack of an effective strategy to communicate and collaborate with examiners; outdated assumptions in the production quotas it uses to reward examiners; and the lack of required ongoing technical training for examiners. According to patent examiners, the lack of communication and a collaborative work environment has resulted in low morale and an atmosphere of distrust that is exacerbated by the contentious relationship between management and union officials. Also, managers and examiners have differing opinions on the need to update the monetary award system that is based on assumptions that were established in 1976. As a result, examiners told us they have to contend with a highly stressful work environment and work voluntary overtime to meet their assigned quotas. Similarly, managers and examiners disagree on the need for required ongoing technical training. Examiners said they need this training to keep current in their technical fields, while managers believe that reviewing patent applications is the best way for examiners to remain current."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is responsible for issuing  U.S. patents that protect new ideas and investments in innovation and  creativity. However, recent increases in both the complexity and volume of  patent applications have lengthened the time it takes USPTO to process  patents (\u201cpendency\u201d) and have raised concerns among intellectual property  organizations, patent holders, and others about the quality of the patents  that are issued. Over the last 10 years, the number of patent applications  filed annually with USPTO has increased 91 percent from about 185,000 in  1994 to over 350,000 in 2004. USPTO\u2019s resources have not kept pace with  the rising number and complexity of patent applications it must review.  Moreover, at times, USPTO officials acknowledge they have had difficulty  competing with the private sector to attract and retain staff with the high  degree of scientific, technical, and legal knowledge required to be patent  examiners. To help the agency address these challenges, Congress passed a  law requiring USPTO to improve patent quality, implement electronic  government, and reduce pendency.", "In response to the law, USPTO in June 2002 embarked on an aggressive 5- year modernization plan outlined in its 21st Century Strategic Plan  (Strategic Plan), which was updated to include stakeholder input and  rereleased in February 2003. USPTO\u2019s Strategic Plan includes 38 initiatives  related to the patent organization that focus on three crosscutting strategic  themes: capability, productivity, and agility. The capability theme includes  efforts to enhance patent quality through workforce and process  improvements; the productivity theme includes efforts to decrease  pendency of patent applications; and the agility theme includes initiatives  to electronically process patent applications. To fully fund the initiatives in  its Strategic Plan, the agency requested authority from Congress to  increase the user fees it collects from applicants and to spend all of these  fees on patent processing. Legislation to increase the fees was enacted in  December 2004; however, the changes will be effective only in fiscal years  2005 and 2006. Although USPTO\u2019s Strategic Plan includes some initiatives  to improve the skills of its examination workforce, the agency\u2019s more  detailed summary of its actions to attract and retain a qualified workforce  is contained in the Strategic Workforce Restructuring Plan (Workforce  Plan), which the agency developed in 2001.", "In the context of the various efforts being undertaken by USPTO, you  requested that we obtain information about its (1) overall progress in  implementing the initiatives in the 21st Century Strategic Plan related to  the patent organization; (2) efforts to attract and retain a qualified patent  workforce; and (3) remaining challenges, if any, in attracting and retaining  a qualified patent workforce.", "To determine USPTO\u2019s progress toward implementing the Strategic Plan  initiatives for the patent organization, we reviewed the initiatives contained  in the plan, as well as agency documents regarding USPTO\u2019s progress in  implementing each initiative. We also interviewed key USPTO officials and  union officials about the plan\u2019s implementation. We focused our review on  tasks that were to have been completed by December 2004. To determine  what actions USPTO has taken to attract and retain a qualified patent  workforce and what challenges, if any, the agency faces in this area, we  reviewed USPTO\u2019s Workforce Plan and other policies and practices related  to human capital. We interviewed USPTO management and union officials,  as well as officials from the Department of Commerce, its Office of  Inspector General (OIG), and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  about human capital initiatives undertaken by USPTO. We also reviewed  results from USPTO and OPM employee surveys and compared human  capital policies and practices with those recommended by GAO, OPM, and  others. In addition, we attended a USPTO career fair for patent examiners  to observe agency recruiting efforts and conducted focus groups with  patent examiners and supervisory patent examiners to obtain their views  on various issues related to USPTO\u2019s ability to attract and retain a qualified  patent examination workforce. Our review focused exclusively on the  activities of the patent organization and not those of the trademark  organization. We are issuing a separate report addressing the agency\u2019s  strategy for automating its patent process. Appendix I contains a detailed  discussion of the scope and methodology for our review.

First, USPTO grants to  inventors exclusive rights to their inventions for a limited period of time,  usually 20 years. During this time, the inventor can exclude others from  making, using, selling or importing the invention. Second, the agency  preserves and disseminates patent information, for example on issued  patents and most patent applications. Such information allows other  inventors to improve upon the invention in the original application and  apply for their own patent.", "To obtain a patent, inventors\u2014or more usually their attorneys or agents\u2014 submit to USPTO an application that fully discloses and clearly describes  one or more distinct innovative features of the proposed invention (called  claims) and pays a filing fee to begin the examination process. USPTO  evaluates the application for completeness, classifies it by the type of  patent and the technology involved, and assigns it for review to one of its  operational units, called technology centers, that specialize in specific  areas of science and engineering. Supervisors in each technology center  then assign the application to a patent examiner for further review. For  each claim in the application, the examiner searches and analyzes relevant  United States and international patents, journals, and other literature to  determine whether the proposed invention merits a patent\u2014that is,  whether the invention is a new and useful process, machine, manufacture,  or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement to one that  already exists. The examiner may contact the applicant on one or more  occasions to resolve questions and obtain additional information to  determine the proposed invention\u2019s potential patentability. If the examiner  determines that the proposed invention merits a patent, the applicant is  informed, and, upon payment of a fee, USPTO issues a patent. The  applicant may abandon the application at any time during the examination  process. If the application is denied a patent, the applicant may appeal the  decision within an established time. Each examiner typically reviews  applications in the order in which they are received by USPTO.", "The time from the date an application is filed until a patent is granted,  denied, or the application is abandoned is called \u201coverall pendency.\u201d Over  the past decade, overall pendency has increased on average from 20 to  almost 28 months. However, pendency varies by technology center, ranging  from 24 months for applications in such fields as transportation,  agriculture, electronic commerce, mechanical engineering, and  manufacturing to 41 months for applications in the fields of computer  architecture, software and information security (see table 1). In addition to  overall pendency, USPTO monitors the time from when an application is  filed until the examiner makes an initial assessment of the proposed  invention\u2019s patentability and informs the applicant, called first action  pendency. First action pendency also has generally increased in the past  decade from 8 to over 20 months. In 2004, first action pendency ranged  from an average of 14 months for applications in such fields as  semiconductors and optical systems to 33 months for computer  architecture and software applications.

Consequently, how the  agency\u2019s actions will affect its long-term ability to maintain a highly  qualified workforce is unclear.

First, in 2003, to help select qualified applicants, USPTO  identified the knowledge, skills, and abilities that examiners need to  effectively fulfill their responsibilities. As part of this study, USPTO  conducted focus group meetings with, and surveys of, experienced  examiners to identify and validate key skills. In doing so, the agency was  responding to a recommendation from the Department of Commerce\u2019s OIG  to better target candidates likely to stay at USPTO.", "Second, in 2004, the agency\u2019s permanent recruiting team, composed of  senior and line managers, participated in various recruiting events,  including visits to the 10 schools that the agency targeted based on the  diversity of their student population and the strength of their engineering  and science programs. The team also visited 22 additional schools,  participated in two job fairs, and attended three conferences sponsored by  professional societies. To assist the recruiting team, USPTO hired a  consultant to develop a new brand image for the agency, shown in figure 1  below. As part of this effort, USPTO and the consultant surveyed USPTO  managers and supervisors and conducted focus groups with a range of  ethnically diverse audiences, from college seniors to experienced  professionals, to identify the characteristics of examiners and how the  target market perceives the agency, as well as to get a sense of their work  habits, values, and perceptions of work at USPTO. According to USPTO,  the agency\u2019s new brand focuses on the vital role intellectual property plays  in the U.S. economy and the career momentum of patent examiners.  Agency officials said that USPTO uses its employment brand image at every  opportunity, from Internet banner ads to print advertisements. They believe  that this has enhanced public awareness of the agency and has helped  distinguish USPTO from other employers.", "Finally, for 2005, USPTO developed a formal recruiting plan that, among  other things, identified hiring goals for each technology center and  described USPTO\u2019s efforts to establish ongoing partnerships with the 10  target schools. In addition, USPTO trained its recruiters in effective  interviewing techniques to help them better describe the production  system and incorporated references to the production-oriented work  environment in its recruitment literature. During a USPTO career fair in  February 2005, we observed that potential candidates were provided with a  range of information about the work environment at the agency, received  handouts, and heard a formal presentation about the agency and the role  and responsibilities of a patent examiner. The presentation also included  overviews of the basics of intellectual property, the patent examination  process, USPTO\u2019s production model, the skill set needed for a successful  patent examiner, and the benefits the agency offers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USPTO Has Used Many Federal Human Capital Benefits to Attract and Retain Examiners", "paragraphs": ["USPTO has used many of the human capital benefits available under  federal personnel regulations to attract and retain qualified patent  examiners. Among other benefits, USPTO has offered  recruitment bonuses ranging from $600 to over $10,000;  a special pay rate for patent examiners that is 10 percent above federal  salaries for comparable jobs;  noncompetitive promotion to the full performance level;  flexible spending accounts that allow examiners to set aside funds for  expenses related to health care and care for dependents;  reimbursement for law school tuition;  a transit subsidy program that was recognized in 2003 and 2004 as one of  the best in the greater Washington, D.C., area;  flexible working schedules, including the ability to schedule hours off   work at home opportunities for certain supervisory and senior   no-cost health screenings at an on-site health unit staffed with a  registered nurse and part-time physician;   casual dress policy; and   on-site child care and fitness centers at USPTO\u2019s new facility.", "According to many of the supervisors and examiners in our focus groups,  these benefits were a key reason they were attracted to USPTO and are a  reason they continue to stay. The benefits most frequently cited as  important by examiners were the flexible working schedules and  competitive salaries. Many supervisors and examiners said that the ability  to set their own hours allowed them to better coordinate their work  schedules with their personal commitments, such as a child\u2019s school or day  care schedule. Concerning salaries, examiners also cited the special pay  rate offered by USPTO as increasing the agency\u2019s competitiveness with the  private sector. Although entry-level pay for examiners may not be as high  as in the private sector, examiners who have been with the agency for  about 5 to 7 years can earn up to $100,000 annually, and new examiners  can increase their pay relatively rapidly, in part because of the  noncompetitive promotion potential available at the agency. However,  some examiners commented that the benefit of the special pay rate is  eroding over time because examiners do not receive annual locality pay  adjustments to compensate for the high cost of living in the Washington,  D.C., area. According to USPTO management, in 2002 the agency sought  such an adjustment, but OPM denied the request because of a lack of  justification. In addition to basic salary, examiners may also earn various  cash awards based on production or other types of meritorious  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Consistent Recruiting Efforts and Benefits, along with Changes in the Economy, Could Affect USPTO\u2019s Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The long-term effect of USPTO\u2019s recruiting efforts and use of benefits is  difficult to predict for a variety of reasons. First, many of USPTO\u2019s efforts  have been in place for a relatively short duration and have not been  consistently maintained. For example, as shown in table 7, USPTO  suspended recruitment and hiring in fiscal year 2000, which agency  officials said resulted in its inability to meet its hiring goals for the year.  Except for 2002, in those years where USPTO used its recruiting strategy  consistently, such as 2001, 2003, and 2004, it not only met its hiring goals,  but exceeded them.", "The second reason that creates uncertainty about USPTO\u2019s success in  retaining examiners is that USPTO has occasionally suspended some  important employee benefits. For example, funding constraints led USPTO  to discontinue reimbursing examiners for their law school tuition in 2002  and 2003, although the agency resumed reimbursement in 2004, when  funding became available. Examiners who participated in our focus groups  expressed dissatisfaction with the inconsistent availability of the benefits.  Regarding law school tuition reimbursement, one examiner said, \u201cI started  when they started the  and then they cut it off and I  had to pay  myself, which creates a large incentive to leave the  office now that I have . . . student loans to pay off.\u201d Other examiners  expressed similar views. More recently in March 2005, USPTO proposed to  eliminate or modify other benefits such as examiners\u2019 ability to earn credit  hours and alter examiners\u2019 ability to set their own work schedules. For  example, unlike current practice, examiners would no longer be able to  schedule hours off during midday without a written request approved in  advance. These benefits were cited by examiners in our focus groups as  key reasons for working at USPTO, and eliminating such benefits may  impact future retention.", "The third and possibly the most important factor that adds to the  uncertainty surrounding the success of USPTO\u2019s recruitment efforts is the  unknown potential impact of the economy. According to USPTO officials  and examiners, because USPTO competes directly with the private sector  for qualified individuals, changes in the economy have a greater impact on  USPTO\u2019s ability to attract and retain examiners than any actions taken by  the agency. They told us that when the economy picks up, more examiners  tend to leave USPTO and fewer qualified candidates accept employment  offers. Conversely, they said that when there is a downturn in the economy,  employment opportunities at USPTO become more attractive. When  discussing reasons for joining USPTO, many examiners in our focus groups  cited job security and lack of other employment opportunities, making  comments such as \u201cI had been laid off from my prior job, and this was the  only job offer I got at the time\u201d; \u201cI looked towards the government because  I wanted job security\u201d; and \u201c. . . part of the reason I came to the office is  that when I first came out of college, the job market was not great.\u201d", "The relationship between the economy and USPTO\u2019s ability to attract and  retain examiners is reflected in its attrition rates over time. As shown in  figure 3, attrition among patent examiners declined from a high of almost  14 percent in 2000 to just over 6 percent in 2003. This decline coincided  with a recession in 2001, a general slowdown of the economy, and  subsequent collapse of the \u201chigh tech bubble\u201d\u2014which caused many  Internet-based businesses to close, leaving computer scientists and  engineers out of work. The decline in attrition was preceded by a more  robust economy during a time when the high-tech industry was building up.  At that time, attrition at USPTO was steadily rising.", "Since 2004, attrition has risen again to almost 9 percent, fueled in part by an  increase in the number of examiners who retired. By the end of fiscal year  2010, about 12 percent of examiners will be eligible to retire. Another  trend that could affect USPTO\u2019s efforts to maintain a highly qualified patent  examination workforce is the high level of attrition among younger, less  experienced examiners. While attrition among examiners who have been at  USPTO for 3 or fewer years has declined each year since 2000, attrition  among these examiners continues to account for over half of all examiners  who leave the agency. Attrition of examiners with 3 or fewer years of  experience is a particularly significant loss for USPTO because the agency  invests considerable time and money helping new examiners become  proficient during the first few years. Managers and examiners told us that  examiners usually become fully proficient in conducting patent application  reviews in about 4 to 6 years. Managers we spoke with said the agency  needs continuous recruiting efforts to offset these trends and continue to  attract the best candidates. They said they hope to have constant  recruitment efforts and year-round hiring in the upcoming years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USPTO Faces Long- standing Human Capital Challenges That Could Undermine Its Recruiting and Retention Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Although USPTO has taken a number of steps to attract and retain a  qualified patent examiner workforce, the agency continues to face three  human capital challenges of a long-standing nature that could also  undermine its efforts in the future if not addressed. Current workforce  models developed by GAO and others to help federal agencies attract and  retain a qualified workforce suggest, among other things, that agencies  establish an agencywide communication strategy, including opportunities  for feedback from employees; involving management, employees, and  other stakeholders in making key decisions; have appropriately designed  compensation and awards systems; and develop strategies to address  current and future competencies and skills needed by staff.

Accordingly, one of  the goals listed in the Commissioner of Patent\u2019s 2003 performance  appraisal plan was to establish an effective communication strategy.  However, when we asked for the agency\u2019s communication strategy, USPTO  management officials acknowledged the agency does not have a formal  strategy. Instead, USPTO officials provided us with a list of activities  undertaken by the agency to improve communication. However, most of  these activities focused on improving communication among managers but  not between managers and other levels of the organization, such as  between managers and patent examiners. The efforts to communicate with  examiners were largely confined to presenting information to examiners  and generally were not interactive, according to examiners.", "Patent examiners and supervisory patent examiners that participated in  our focus groups frequently said that communication with USPTO  management was poor and that managers provided them with inadequate  or no information. They also said management is out of touch with  examiners and their concerns and that communication with managers  tends to be one way and hierarchical, with little opportunity for feedback.  Management officials told us that informal feedback can always be  provided by anyone in the organization\u2014for example, through an e-mail to  anyone in management. However, some patent examiners believe they will  be penalized for offering any type of criticism of management actions or  decisions and therefore do not provide this kind of feedback.", "The lack of communication between management and examiners is  exacerbated by the contentious working relationship between USPTO  management and union officials and the complexity of the rules about what  level of communication can occur between managers and examiners  without involving the union. Union officials stated that a more  collaborative spirit existed between USPTO and the examiners\u2019 union from  the late 1990s to about 2001. During this period, both parties actively  worked to improve their relationship. For example, in 2001, USPTO  management and the union quickly reached an agreement that led to  increased pay for examiners and paved the way for electronic processing of  patent applications by having examiners rely more heavily on electronic  searches of relevant patent literature. According to union officials, this  agreement was negotiated in about 1-1/2 weeks, improved the morale of  patent examiners, and made them feel valued and appreciated. Since that  time however, both USPTO management and union officials agree that  their working relationship has not been as productive. Both say that  despite several attempts, neither USPTO managers nor union officials have  improved this relationship and that issues raised by either side are  routinely presented for arbitration before the Federal Labor Relations  Authority because the two sides cannot agree. USPTO and union officials  are currently disputing the validity of their 1986 collective bargaining  agreement, which USPTO deems defunct. In February 2004, this issue  was presented for arbitration to determine the validity of the agreement.  According to union officials, the arbitrator agreed with their position that  the agreement was still valid and ordered a 1-year hiatus on negotiations on  a new agreement. USPTO contends that the arbitrator said the two had  \u201ctacit agreements\u201d but did not define the term. In March 2005, without  continuing any debate regarding the validity of the 1986 agreement, USPTO  issued a proposed new collective bargaining agreement with the union. The  union denounced this proposal, reporting in its newsletter to examiners  that \u201cUSPTO declares war on employee professionalism and patent system  integrity.\u201d", "Some USPTO managers alluded to this contentious relationship as one of  the reasons why they have limited communication with patent examiners,  who are represented by the union even if they decide not to join.  Specifically, they believe they cannot solicit the input of employees directly  without engaging the union. Another official, however, told us that nothing  prevents the agency from having \u201ctown hall\u201d type meetings to discuss  potential changes, as long as the agency does not promise examiners a  benefit that impacts their working conditions. Union officials agreed that  USPTO can invite comments from examiners on a plan or proposal;  however, if the proposal concerns a negotiating issue, the agency must  consult the examiners\u2019 union, which is their exclusive representative with  regard to working conditions. For example, union officials said that agency  management can involve examiners on discussions of substantive issues  related to patent law and practice, such as how to implement electronic  filing, but must consult the union to obtain examiners\u2019 views on issues such  as the development of the Strategic Plan which contains initiatives that  would entail, for example, additional reviews of examiners work and other  changes to working conditions.", "Given the lack of effective communication mechanisms between  management and patent examiners and the poor relationship between  management and the union, patent examiners report little involvement in  providing input to key decision-making processes. For example, some of  the examiners in our focus groups stated that although they had heard of  the agency\u2019s Strategic Plan, they were not involved in developing it and had  no idea what it entailed or how it was to be implemented. USPTO  management officials we spoke to acknowledged that employees had no  role in developing the Strategic Plan even though USPTO identifies its  employees as a key stakeholder in the plan. This lack of employee  involvement is not a new problem for the agency. For example, a study  about the agency\u2019s performance measurement and rewards system  conducted in 1995 by a private consultant stated that the agency must  strive to include employees at all levels of the organization in the decision- making process to both introduce a variety of perspectives and experiences  and to generate the critical support of employees to any new system  developed. Additionally, responses to employee surveys conducted in  1998 and 2001 by USPTO and others indicate that employees believed that  they did not play a meaningful role in decision making. Specifically, a  quarter of the examiners surveyed in 1998 expressed satisfaction with their  level of involvement in decisions that affect their work. In 2001, less than  half of examiners who responded to the survey said they believe USPTO  management trusts and respects them or values their opinions. Agency- specific data from the 2004 federal human capital survey conducted by the  Office of Personnel Management have not been released.", "Managers told us that examiners do not need to be involved in decision  making because all of the agency\u2019s senior managers\u2014from the  Commissioner down\u2014\u201ccame up through the ranks.\u201d Moreover, they said  the basic role of the agency has not changed in 200 years. As a result, senior  managers believe they bring the staff perspective to all planning and  decision-making activities. However, examiners in our focus groups believe  that senior managers are out of touch with the role of examiners, making  comments such as \u201cI think it would help if upper management who haven\u2019t  examined in decades could try to do some of it now\u2014it\u2019s so drastically  different than when they were doing it\u2014and realize how difficult it is, and  then maybe they might get a clue. I really don\u2019t think that they realize how  much work it takes to examine an application. It is so different than when  they were examining.\u201d Examiners in our focus groups said that the lack of  communication and involvement has created an atmosphere of distrust in  management officials by examiners and has lowered examiners\u2019 morale."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examiners\u2019 Monetary Awards Are Based on Outdated Assumptions about the Time It Takes to Process a Patent Application", "paragraphs": ["According to human capital models, an agency\u2019s compensation and  rewards system should help it attract, motivate, retain, and reward the  people it needs to achieve its goals. To ensure that their systems meet these  criteria, agencies should periodically assess how they compensate staff and  consider changes, as appropriate. Patent examiners\u2019 monetary awards are  based largely on the number of patent applications they process, but the  assumptions underlying their annual application-processing quotas (called  production quotas) have not been updated since 1976. Depending on the  type of patent and the skill level of the examiner, each examiner is  expected to process an average of 87 applications per year at a rate of 19  hours per application. Examiners who consistently do not meet their  quotas may be dismissed. Patent examiners may earn cash awards based  on the extent to which they exceed their production quotas. Although  examiners in our focus groups generally support production quotas as a  way to guide their work and provide an objective basis for cash awards,  they said that the time estimates involved are no longer accurate.", "Examiners in our focus groups told us that, in the last several decades, the  tasks for processing applications have greatly increased while the time  allowed has not. For example, examiners said the number of claims per  application have increased, which in turn increases the amount of relevant  literature they must review and analyze for each application. Also, while  the greater use of electronic search tools has improved their access to  relevant patent literature, the use of such tools has also increased the  amount of literature they must review. In addition, the complexity of  applications in some fields has increased significantly, requiring more time  for a quality review. Neither USPTO nor the examiners union has collected  information on the effects that such changes as improvements in electronic  search capabilities have had on the time required to review patent  applications.", "Moreover, many examiners in our focus groups said that the time  limitations of the current production quotas are inconsistent with  producing high-quality work and do not adequately reflect the actual tasks  and time required to examine applications. For example, examiners have  responsibilities included in their job expectations, such as responding to  calls from applicants and the public and providing more documentation for  their decisions, which are not accounted for in the production model.  Examiners expressed concern that although the agency\u2019s emphasis on  quality has increased under the Strategic Plan, examiners have not been  allowed more time to fulfill these increased responsibilities for quality, and  there are no negative consequences for examiners who produce low-quality  work. Examiners told us that voluntarily working overtime to meet quotas  is common at USPTO, and they find it demoralizing not to have enough  time to do a good quality job. In commenting on a draft of this report,  USPTO stated that quality is a critical element of an examiner\u2019s  performance standards and if an examiner does not maintain quality, their  rating would reflect this deficiency. Consequences would depend on the  level of deficiency.", "Employee surveys conducted since 1998 suggest that these concerns are  not new to the agency. Specifically, a quarter of the examiners who  responded to the agency\u2019s employee surveys during the period 1998 to 2001  said that the amount of time available for their work was sufficient to  produce high-quality products and services. The 1995 study conducted by a  private consultant also noted that USPTO is production driven and that the  agency\u2019s emphasis on production placed considerable stress on examiners.  Although less than 25 percent of patent examiners who left USPTO in 2002  and 2004 actually completed an exit survey, about half who did cited  dissatisfaction with the nature of the job, the production system, and the  workload as factors that had the most impact on their decision to leave the  agency.", "In contrast, USPTO managers had a different perspective on the production  model and its impact on examiners. They stated that the time estimates  used in establishing production quotas do not need to be adjusted because  the efficiencies gained through actions such as the greater use of  technology have offset the demands resulting from changes such as greater  complexity of the applications and increases in the number of claims.  Moreover, they said that for an individual examiner, reviews of applications  that take more time than the estimated average are generally offset by  other reviews that take less time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USPTO Does Not Require Ongoing Technical Education for Patent Examiners", "paragraphs": ["Current workforce models suggest that professional organizations such as  USPTO make appropriate investments in education, training, and other  developmental opportunities to help build the competencies of its  employees. Reviewing patent applications involves knowledge and  understanding of highly technical subjects, but USPTO does not require  ongoing training on these subjects. Instead, USPTO only requires newly  hired examiners to take extensive training on how to be a patent examiner  during the first year, and all other required training is focused on legal  training. For example, newly hired examiners are required, within their  first 10 months at the agency, to take about 200 hours of training on such  topics as procedures for examining patent applications, electronic tools  used in the examination process, and patent law and evidence. In addition,  almost all patent examiners are required to take a range of ongoing training  on legal matters, including patent law. As a result of the implementation of  some Strategic Plan initiatives, additional mandatory training to help  examiners prepare for tests to certify their legal competency and ensure  their eligibility for promotion from a GS-12 level to a GS-13 is also required.  In addition, patent examiners who have the authority to issue patents  (generally GS-14s or above) must pass tests on the content of legal training  every 3 years. In contrast, patent examiners are not required to undertake  any ongoing training to maintain expertise in their area of technology, even  though the agency acknowledges that such training is important, especially  for electrical and electronic engineers. Specifically, in its 2001 justification  for examiners\u2019 special pay rates, the agency stated, \u201cEngineers who fail to  keep up with the rapid changes in technology, regardless of degree, risk  technological obsolescence.\u201d", "USPTO does offer some voluntary in-house training, such as technology  fairs and industry days at which scientists and others are invited to lecture  to help keep patent examiners current on the technical aspects of their  work. Because this training is not required by USPTO, patent examiners  told us they are reluctant to attend such training given the time demands  involved. USPTO also offers a voluntary external training program for  examiners to update their technical skills. Under this program, examiners  may take technical courses related to their area of expertise at an  accredited college or university. USPTO will pay up to $5,000 per fiscal year  for each participant and up to $150 per course for required materials, such  as books and lab fees. In addition, agency managers told us the agency will  pay registration fees for a small number of examiners to attend  conferences, although sometimes it will not pay travel expenses. While  USPTO officials told us they knew of examiners who had taken advantage  of these opportunities, the agency could provide no data on the extent to  which examiners had taken advantage of these voluntary training  opportunities. Some examiners in our focus groups said that they did  participate in these training opportunities, but others said they did not  because of the monetary costs or personal time involved.", "USPTO believes that a requirement for ongoing technical training is not  necessary for patent examiners because the nature of the job keeps them  up-to-date with the latest technology. According to agency officials, the  primary method for examiners to keep current in their technical fields is by  processing patent applications. However, patent examiners and  supervisors in our focus groups said that often the literature cited in the  application they review for patents, particularly in rapidly developing  technologies, is outdated, can be too narrowly focused, and does not  provide them the big picture of the field. For example, in certain fields,  such as computer software and biotechnology, some examiners told us that  the information cited in the application may be several years old even  though it may have been current at the time the application was submitted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To improve its ability to attract and retain the highly educated and qualified  patent examiners it needs, USPTO has taken a number of steps recognized  by experts as characteristic of highly effective organizations.
