The U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol) and Air and Marine Operations (AMO) are the components within CBP responsible for securing U.S. borders between ports of entry in the land, air, and maritime environments. Border Patrol identified an insufficient number of agents that limited patrol missions along the northern border. AMO identified an insufficient number of agents along the northern border, which limited the number and frequency of air and maritime missions. Border Patrol and AMO also identified a variety of resource challenges along the northern border, such as limited radar and surveillance technology coverage and inadequate facilities to process and temporarily hold apprehended individuals. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and CBP identified actions to address staffing and resource challenges, it is unknown whether these challenges will be addressed. This is primarily because CBP's priority is to secure the U.S.-Mexico (southwest) border. Issued in January 2017, Executive Order 13767 directed DHS to take actions to secure the southwest border by, among other things, constructing physical barriers and hiring thousands of agents.", "While CBP has performance measures that assess selected border security operations or programs, some of which include data from the northern border, it does not have specific measures to assess its effectiveness at securing the northern border between ports of entry. For example, Border Patrol has performance measures that assess security in remote areas on the northern border, but the measures do not include data from maritime border areas. Developing and implementing such measures could help Border Patrol and AMO better assess the effectiveness of their northern border operations between ports of entry, including addressing challenges due to limited staffing and resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations, that Border Patrol and AMO each develop and implement performance measures to assess their effectiveness at securing the northern border between ports of entry.

Historically, the United States has  primarily focused attention and resources on the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.  border with Mexico, which continues to experience significantly higher  levels of reported drug trafficking and unlawful entry than the northern  border. Further, this focus was reiterated in Executive Order 13767, which  directed DHS to obtain complete operational control of the U.S.-Mexico  (southwest) border. Such control was defined in the executive order as  the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including  entries by terrorists or other unlawful (i.e. inadmissible) aliens, and  instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband. Executive  Order 13767 also directed DHS to take actions to secure the southwest  border between ports of entry, including hiring additional CBP law  enforcement personnel and constructing physical barriers along the  border.

Irregular northbound migrants entering  Canada between official ports of entry are not subject to the framework  established by the 2002 Safe Third Country Agreement signed by  Canada and the United States, which governs the processing of asylum  claims along the shared land border and applies only to those individuals  entering at an official port of entry, not between ports of entry. Therefore,  individuals who enter Canada by land between official ports of entry to  make an asylum claim may be allowed to stay in Canada rather than  have their claim handled by the United States. Individuals seeking to  travel to Canada to make an asylum claim, whether or not they may have  a valid asylum claim, are made aware of the potential ability to enter and  remain in Canada pending an asylum decision due to wide sharing of this  information through social media and reporting in the press. Otherwise,  for those attempting to enter Canada through an official land port of entry  to claim asylum, claimants may be returned to pursue their asylum claim  in the country of last presence, which would be the United States, unless  they qualify for one of the exceptions in the agreement.", "According to DHS officials, Canadian data indicates a large percentage of  irregular northbound migrants had previously obtained nonimmigrant  visas, primarily B1/B2 visas, which authorized their temporary travel to  the United States, and subsequently entered Canada between official  ports of entry to claim asylum. DHS, in collaboration with the U.S.  Department of State, worked to identify, and as appropriate, revoke visas  of individuals seeking to enter Canada between official ports of entry.  Border Patrol intelligence reporting in 2017 identified visa fraud concerns  because individuals obtained visas to enter the United States, when it  appeared that their main intention was to enter Canada other than  through a port of entry and claim asylum.", "Border Patrol officials stated that the widespread perception among  irregular northbound migrants they encounter is that Canada\u2019s asylum policies are more welcoming than those of the United States, which has  also contributed to the increased trend in irregular northbound migration.  These officials cited both U.S. and Canadian reporting on the 2016 U.S.  Presidential Election, along with a welcoming statement by the  government of Canada, and perceived generosity of benefits upon  application for asylum in Canada as reasons that migrants seek to enter  Canada between official ports of entry and claim asylum.", "According to Border Patrol officials, the northbound asylum flows from the  United States to Canada could potentially lead to future attempts to enter  the United States illegally between ports of entry from Canada by  individuals whose asylum claims are rejected by the government of  Canada. According to anecdotal reporting to Border Patrol officials, some  of the irregular northbound migrants who entered Canada from the United  States were unable to gain status in Canada or the process was not what  they had anticipated. According to the officials, these individuals  subsequently attempted to reenter the United States in an effort to gain  legal status in the United States. For example, Swanton Border Patrol  Sector reported two incidents in April 2018 in which groups of individuals  who were apprehended attempting to illegally enter the United States  from Canada stated that they were seeking to reenter the United States  after their asylum claims were rejected by the government of Canada."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Christopher Ferencik (Assistant  Director), David Alexander, Michele Fejfar, Eric Hauswirth, Grant  Holyoak, John Mingus, Sasan J. \u201cJon\u201d Najmi, Claire Peachey, Carl  Potenzieri, and Natalie Swabb made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["U.S. Customs and Border Protection provides security between ports of entry along the 4,000-mile-long border between the United States and Canada.", "However, CBP told us that staffing and resource challenges limit its enforcement activities along the U.S.-Canada border.
