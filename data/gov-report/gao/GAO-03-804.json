Users of certain devices containing sealed sources are not required to apply to NRC for a license. Accounting for these devices has been difficult. In addition, since 1998, more than 1,300 incidents have taken place in the United States where sealed sources have been lost, stolen, or abandoned. The majority of these lost devices were recovered. Security for sealed sources varied among the facilities GAO visited in 10 states. Also, a potential security weakness exists in NRC's licensing process to obtain sealed sources. Approved applicants may buy sealed sources as soon as a new license is issued by mail. Because the process assumes that the applicant is acting in good faith and it can take NRC as long as 12 months before conducting an inspection, it is possible that sealed sources can be obtained for malicious intent. In addition, NRC currently evaluates the effectiveness of state regulatory programs, but these evaluations do not assess the security of sealed sources. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, NRC and states have notified licensees of the need for heightened awareness to security, but have not required any specific actions to improve security. NRC has been developing additional security measures since the attacks, and issued the first security order to large facilities that irradiate such items as medical supplies and food on June 5, 2003. Additional orders to licensees that possess high risk sealed sources are expected to follow. NRC and states disagree over the appropriate role of states in efforts to improve security. NRC intends to develop and implement all additional security measures on licensees with sealed sources, including those licensed by states. However, over 80 percent of states responding to our survey feel they should be given responsibility to inspect and enforce security measures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks there has been concern that  certain radioactive material, such as cobalt-60, strontium-90, iodine-131,  cesium-137, iridium-192, and americium-241, could be used in the  construction of a radiological dispersion device\u2014commonly referred to as  a \u201cdirty bomb.\u201d Such radioactive materials are used in devices that treat  cancer, sterilize food and medical instruments, and detect flaws in  pipelines and other types of metal welds. Much of the radioactive material  used in these devices is encapsulated, or sealed, in metal such as stainless  steel, titanium, or platinum to prevent its dispersal. A dirty bomb could be  produced by using explosives in combination with radioactive material  upon detonation. Most experts agree that the dispersed radioactive  material would have few short-term health effects on exposed individuals  and that the explosives, not the radioactive material, would likely cause the  greatest amount of immediate injuries, fatalities, and property damage.  However, a dirty bomb\u2014depending on the type, form, amount, and  concentration of radioactive material used\u2014could cause radiation  exposure in individuals in close proximity to the material for an extended  time and potentially increase the long-term risks of cancer for those  contaminated. In addition, the evacuation and cleanup of contaminated  areas after such an explosion could lead to panic and serious economic  costs on the affected population.", "Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  (NRC) regulates domestic medical, industrial, and research uses of sealed  sources through a combination of regulatory requirements, licensing,  inspection, and enforcement. Section 274 of the act authorizes NRC to give  primary regulatory authority to states (called \u201cagreement\u201d states) under  certain conditions. To date, NRC has relinquished its licensing, inspection,  and enforcement authority to 32 agreement states that administer the use  of sealed sources within their jurisdictions; while continuing to regulate  the use of sealed sources in the remaining states. NRC periodically  evaluates each agreement state\u2019s regulatory program for compatibility with  NRC regulations and its effectiveness in protecting public health and safety.  Two types of licenses are associated with the use of radioactive materials\u2014 general licenses and specific licenses. A generally licensed device usually  contains a sealed source within a shielded device, such as gas  chromatograph units, fixed gauges, luminous exit signs, or reference and  check sources. Such devices are designed with inherent radiation safety  features so that persons with little or no radiation training or experience  can use it, and as such do not require NRC or agreement state approval to  purchase and are widely commercially available. Specific licenses cover  uses, such as cameras used for industrial radiography, medical devices  used to treat cancer, and facilities that irradiate food or medical products  for sterilization. These uses generally require larger amounts of radioactive  material than can be obtained with a general license. Organizations or  individuals wanting to obtain a specific license must submit an application  and gain the approval of either NRC or an agreement state. In addition to  NRC and agreement states, other federal agencies, such as the Department  of Transportation, the Food and Drug Administration, and the  Environmental Protection Agency, regulate the safe transportation,  medical use, and cleanup of radioactive material. The Department of  Energy (DOE) regulates the use of radioactive material at its facilities and  at the national laboratories.", "This report\u2014the third that we have prepared at your request to examine  efforts to control sealed radioactive sources\u2014examines efforts in the  United States to regulate the use of sealed sources domestically and to  prevent the use of this material by terrorists.

To address  these objectives, we distributed a survey to radiation control agencies in  the 32 agreement states, the 18 non-agreement states, the District of  Columbia, and Puerto Rico to determine numbers and types of radioactive  materials licenses in their jurisdictions and to solicit their views on the  regulation of sealed sources. At the time of this report, all of the agreement  states except Arizona, 11 non-agreement states, and Puerto Rico had  responded to our survey. We did not receive responses from the following  non-agreement states\u2014Alaska, Connecticut, Minnesota, Missouri,  Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, and the District of  Columbia. We also surveyed and interviewed officials in the four NRC  regional offices; interviewed officials at NRC headquarters in Rockville,  Maryland; and analyzed NRC license and incident databases. In addition,  we observed NRC evaluations of the effectiveness of state regulatory  programs in Rhode Island and Florida and a similar evaluation of NRC\u2019s  Region III radioactive materials regulatory program in Lisle, Illinois.

Until the 1950s, only naturally  occurring radioactive materials, such as radium-226, were available to be  used in sealed sources. Since then, sealed sources containing radioactive  material produced artificially in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators  have become widely available, including cobalt-60, strontium-90,  technetium-99m, cesium-137, and iridium-192. Under the Atomic Energy  Act of 1954, the states retain sole regulatory authority over most naturally  occurring radioactive material as well as radioactive material produced in  particle accelerators. Federal jurisdiction extends only to those materials  used as a source of material for nuclear fuel or created as a result of  irradiation in nuclear reactors.", "Radioactive material can be found in various forms. For example, cobalt-60  is a metal, while the cesium-137 in some sealed sources is in a powder form  closely resembling talc. Radioactive materials never stop emitting  radiation, but their intensity decays over time at various rates. The term  \u201chalf-life\u201d is used to indicate the period during which the radioactivity  decreases by half as a result of decay. Radioactive materials are measured  by their level of activity. The greater the activity level\u2014measured in units  called curies\u2014the more radiation emitted, which increases the potential  risk to the public if the radioactive materials are lost or stolen.", "Two types of licenses are associated with the use of radioactive materials\u2014 general licenses and specific licenses.

General licensees are automatically licensed without having to  apply to NRC or an agreement state for a license and are subject to a  variety of requirements under NRC\u2019s or agreement states\u2019 regulations.  Furthermore, manufacturers are required to report quarterly to NRC the  names of customers who purchase generally licensed devices. Examples of  requirements general licensees are subject to under NRC\u2019s regulations  include:  general licensees shall not abandon the devices;  complying with instructions and precautions listed on device labels;  performing tests to ensure radioactivity is not leaking from the device at  least every 6 months, and, if leakage is detected, suspend operation of  the device and have it repaired or disposed of by the manufacturer or  another entity authorized to perform such work; and  reporting to NRC or an agreement state the transfer of a device to  another licensee or the disposal of the device.", "A company seeking radioactive material for uses that do not qualify for a  general license must apply to NRC or, if it conducts business in an  agreement state, to the appropriate state for a specific license. Its  application must demonstrate how the use of the materials will meet the  safety requirements in NRC\u2019s or agreement states\u2019 regulations.

Separate systems are in place  at NRC and in each agreement state to track the identities of specific  licensees and the maximum quantity of radioactive material that they are  authorized to possess. These systems do not, however, record the number  of sealed sources actually possessed by specific licensees nor do the  systems track movements (such as purchase, transfer, or disposal) of  sealed sources by specific licensees. Licensees are required to maintain  records for the acquisition and disposition of each sealed source it receives  and inspections by NRC and/or an agreement state includes confirming  inventory records.", "The Secretary of Energy and the Chairman of NRC established a working  group in June 2002 to address, among other things, the options for  establishing a national source tracking system and the potential for the use  of technological methods for tagging and monitoring sealed sources in use,  storage, and transit. This working group reported in May 2003 that a  national source tracking system should provide a \u201ccradle to grave\u201d account  of the origins of each high-risk source, and record how, by whom, and  where a source has been transported, used, and eventually disposed of or  exported. According to the report, such a system would help NRC and DOE  to:  monitor the location and use of sealed sources,  detect and act on discrepancies,  conduct inspections and investigations,  communicate sealed source information to other government agencies,  respond in the event of an emergency,  verify legitimate ownership and use of sealed sources, and  further analyze hazards attributable to the possession and use of sealed  sources.", "The working group did not determine how data on sealed source licensees  in the agreement states would be integrated into a national level system.", "While there are no complete data on the number of sealed sources in the  United States, data are available on the number of specific licensees  authorized to use sealed sources.

In most cases general licensees are not required to apply to NRC  or an agreement state for a license to possess and use a device. Therefore,  in the past, data on general licensees have come from manufacturers of  generally licensed devices that are required to report quarterly to NRC or  the agreement states the names of customers purchasing generally licensed  devices. According to NRC, approximately 40,000 general licensees possess  an estimated 600,000 generally licensed devices in the United States.  Although general licensees are required to follow NRC\u2019s regulations, they  traditionally have little contact with NRC. Mishandling and improper  disposition of generally licensed devices has, on occasion, resulted in  limited radiation exposure to the public and, in some cases, entailed  expensive investigation, cleanup, and disposal activities. For example, two  incidents occurred in New Jersey in 1997 involving luminous exit signs  containing tritium. In May 1997, a 14-year old removed three tritium exit  signs from a demolition site near his home and opened one sign exposing  himself to radioactive material and contaminating his home. In October  1997, a patient at a state-run psychiatric hospital broke a tritium exit sign.  While no injuries resulted, the state spent more than $200,000 cleaning up  the hospital and disposing of the more than sixty barrels of radioactive  waste\u2014primarily contaminated carpeting, furniture, bedding, and other  debris\u2014from the incident.", "NRC amended its regulations effective February of 2001, to, among other  things, better enable NRC to verify and track the location, use, and  disposition of generally licensed devices. NRC focused its efforts to  improve accountability over generally licensed devices on a small subset of  devices that were determined to be of higher risk. The amended regulations  include a requirement for general licensees to register with NRC devices  that contain certain levels of radioactive material. General licensees  would be charged $450 to cover the costs of the registration program.", "Beginning in April 2001, NRC mailed registration forms to about 2,800 of its  general licensees. As of May 2003, approximately 61 percent of them had  responded. Twenty-eight percent of the registration forms were returned as  undeliverable and the remaining 11 percent were not returned by the  general licensee, a response rate significantly lower than NRC expected.  According to NRC, a significant amount of the submitted information is  incomplete or inaccurate, requiring additional follow up that was not  anticipated. To help increase the response rate, phone calls are being made  in advance to locate general licensees before registration forms are sent to  ensure the responsible individuals at the correct addresses receive them. In  addition, NRC has contracted with a private investigation firm to help find  general licensees whose addresses in the database are incorrect.", "Twenty-five of the 31 agreement states that responded to our survey said  that they require registration of some or all generally licensed devices.

These losses averaged about 250 per year. Many  of these incidents involved stolen portable gauges that are used to measure  the moisture content and density of soils, concrete, or asphalt on  construction sites. By themselves, these gauges contain low amounts of  radioactive material and pose relatively little risk to the public. Portable  gauges are most often stolen from construction sites or from vehicles such  as pickup trucks. According to NRC and agreement state officials,  individuals stealing gauges are usually unaware that they contain  radioactive material, and they often abandon or return them once  discovering their contents. Nevertheless, responding to these incidents  takes time and resources. Well logging sources also account for a relatively  large number of lost and abandoned sources. One major oil services  company accounts for over 30 of the 132 total well logging sources  abandoned since 1998. These sources contain several curies of americium- 241 and cesium-137. These losses usually consisted of a sealed source  becoming lodged down a well and subsequently abandoned. The well is  filled with concrete and a marker is attached warning of the presence of  radioactive materials. In addition, sealed sources are occasionally  abandoned when companies owning them go bankrupt.", "According to NRC, most sealed sources that are lost, stolen, or abandoned  are subsequently recovered. In the past 5 years, few incidents have  occurred involving what NRC considers high-risk sealed sources. For  example, in March 1999, an industrial radiography camera containing over  88 curies of iridium-192 (a quantity NRC considers to be of concern) was  stolen from a trailer at the radiographer\u2019s home in Florida. The Florida  radiation control program, local law enforcement, and the Federal Bureau  of Investigation conducted an investigation, but never recovered the sealed  source. According to NRC, the iridium-192 in the sealed source has now  decayed to the point where it is no longer a high risk to the public.", "Another example of lost or stolen sealed sources took place in a North  Carolina hospital in March 1998. During a quarterly inventory of a hospital\u2019s  sealed sources, it was discovered that 19 sealed sources were missing,  containing an aggregate of over 600 millicuries of cesium-137\u2014a highly  dispersible radioactive material. These sources included 18 cesium-137  sealed sources\u2014which had been locked in a safe at the time of the  disappearance\u2014and a new cesium-137 sealed source still stored in its  shipping container. The North Carolina radiation control program, NRC,  DOE, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an extensive joint  investigation.

The combination of  these factors yielded a \u201chazard index,\u201d which serves as an expression of  relative concern. Specific radioactive materials were rated high, medium,  low, or very low, depending upon the degree of health risk posed for their  use in a dirty bomb. The analysis focused on the potential health effects of  the use of radioactive materials in a dirty bomb and did not explicitly  address the psychological and economic consequences. According to an  NRC official, no specific data exists regarding how the public would react  to a dirty bomb, which complicates efforts to analyze its psychological  consequences.", "The working group\u2019s analysis included materials under an NRC license and  DOE\u2019s control in the United States, excluding nuclear weapons materials,  radioactive materials in nuclear power plants, spent fuel, and other  radioactive waste.

Although the agreement states and NRC have similar  types of licensees, agreement states often have greater numbers of  licensees with certain types of sealed sources than NRC-regulated states.  For example, our survey of agreement states indicates that Texas has more  well logging specific licensees than any other state. In addition, states  exclusively regulate the use of naturally occurring and accelerator  produced radioactive materials. Agreement state officials told us that any  consideration of the risks presented by sealed sources needs to include all  materials regulated by NRC and the agreement states because the  psychological and economic consequences of a dirty bomb are likely to be  similar whether the radioactive material is naturally or artificially  produced.

In addition, according to NRC,  there were only 32 reported accidents in fiscal year 2002 involving medical  use of sealed sources out of tens of thousands of medical procedures  conducted.", "To evaluate the performance of its and agreement states\u2019 programs, NRC  developed the Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation Program,  which uses several performance indicators in assessment of program  effectiveness, including timeliness and quality of licensee inspection,  program staffing and training, licensing activity, and response to incidents  and allegations. Officials from NRC and agreement states participate in  these periodic evaluations. During these evaluations, NRC and agreement  state officials review program documentation and interview officials with  the state or regional program to assess the program\u2019s performance. When  the results of each performance indicator have been determined, a final  report is issued. Agreement state or NRC regional programs can be  evaluated as:  adequate to protect the public health and safety,  adequate but needs improvement, and  inadequate to protect public health and safety.", "Figure 3 outlines the results of the most recent reviews of agreement state  and four NRC regional programs.", "NRC\u2019s most recent reviews of the 32 agreement states and NRC regional  programs, dating back to 1998, found that all programs are adequately  protecting public health and safety. Of the last 35 program reviews, 31  programs were found adequate to protect public health and safety\u2014the  highest evaluation. Four programs were found \u201cadequate but needs  improvement\u201d and were placed on \u201cheightened oversight.\u201d A program  placed on heightened oversight must follow a plan to improve performance  or it will be placed on probation for failing to correct programmatic  deficiencies. Furthermore, NRC reserves the right to suspend a state\u2019s  agreement if the state does not comply with one or more of the  requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.", "The Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation Program is intended to  ensure that the NRC and the agreement states adequately protect the health  and safety of the public in accordance with NRC standards. For example, in  February 2003, the Rhode Island program was found \u201cadequate but needs  improvement.\u201d As a result of its evaluation, the Rhode Island program was  placed on heightened oversight and was instructed to follow a detailed plan  to improve performance, which includes NRC monitoring of progress  through bimonthly teleconferences. In addition, the Rhode Island program  must periodically submit a progress report to NRC. The review team found  that a deficiency in staffing and training had led to Rhode Island\u2019s  performance problems. Therefore, as part of the plan to improve  performance, Rhode Island was instructed to address staffing and training  concerns. In November 2003, a follow-up review will be conducted to  establish whether the program has improved enough to remove it from  heightened oversight status.", "The review program also encourages states and NRC regions to learn good  practices from one another. For example, an NRC official recommended  that Florida be cited for a good practice for its in-house training efforts for  the program\u2019s staff, including the creation of a new \u201ctraining coordinator\u201d  position. As a result of participation by an Ohio official during Florida\u2019s last  evaluation, Ohio\u2019s program decided to hire a training coordinator.  Furthermore, because review results are available to the public and a good  practices report is periodically distributed to all agreement states and NRC  regions, all programs have access to the good practices of other programs.", "The report not only shares the good practices, but also the reasons for poor  performance.

Specifically, NRC has issued over 30 advisories and 20  security orders requiring action to nuclear power plants, decommissioning  power reactors, fuel cycle facilities, and spent fuel facilities. Between  November and December 2001, NRC\u2019s Office of Investigations visited 80  nuclear facilities, law enforcement agencies, and first responders  nationwide to interview officials and review records to identify potential  terrorist risks. NRC forwarded potential leads to the Federal Bureau of  Investigation. In addition, NRC has revised the \u201cdesign basis threat\u201d for  nuclear power plants\u2014the largest reasonable threat against which a  regulated private guard force should be expected to defend under existing  law\u2014and issued a corresponding order in April 2003 requiring power  plants to implement additional actions to protect against sabotage by  terrorists and other adversaries. NRC also made a series of internal  administrative changes, such as consolidating the agency\u2019s security  responsibilities in establishing an Office of Nuclear Security and Incident  Response, which includes a Threat Assessment Team responsible for  working directly with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation on security issues. The Office of Nuclear Security  and Incident Response also works with the Department of Homeland  Security and other agencies concerned with terrorism to assess and  respond to potential threats. In an effort to more effectively communicate  and respond to threats, NRC developed a Threat Advisory and Protective  Measures System based on the national Homeland Security Advisory  System, and increased staffing at its 24-hour Emergency Operations Center.  NRC also conducted a review of information available to the general public  on the NRC Web site for potential security risks.", "Efforts to strengthen the security of sealed sources for medical, industrial,  and research use\u2014by both NRC and agreement states\u2014have been limited.  Since September 11, 2001, NRC has issued a total of six advisories urging  licensees to ensure security of sources and advising them to be more aware  of the possibility of theft and sabotage. Licensees were also advised to  double-check shipping documents and inform local police authorities of  their possession of sealed sources. On June 5, 2003, NRC issued its first  security order for large irradiator facilities\u201470 facilities nationwide that  expose products, such as medical supplies, to radiation for sterilization\u2014 that requires licensees to take action to strengthen security. The decision to  select irradiators first has been questioned by agreement state officials and  licensees, as they feel other uses of sealed sources pose a higher risk. For  example, 93 percent of agreement states responding to our survey  identified industrial radiographers as of greater concern. Reasons for this  may include that the sealed sources in these devices are portable, have high  radioactivity, and are widely available (over 570 licensees in the United  States). Although irradiator facilities contain larger amounts of radioactive  material than industrial radiographers, they are specially designed to  include thick concrete and steel walls, security interlocks, and other  protective equipment to protect against radiation exposure. In addition, the  irradiator facilities we visited had taken the initiative to implement  supplementary security measures, such as installing motion detectors,  more extensive security alarms and monitoring, and employee  identification badges. Other uses identified by agreement states officials in  our survey as requiring stricter regulation include portable gauges and well- logging devices\u2014over 4,600 and over 200 licensees nationwide,  respectively.", "Transportation was also identified as needing additional security. Although  most agreement states surveyed indicated that the Department of  Transportation\u2019s (DOT) regulations are adequate to ensure safe  transportation of sealed sources, 81 percent of them identified weaknesses  in current regulations and 77 percent indicated that communications and  coordination needs to be improved between their state program and DOT.  Some DOT officials we spoke with disagreed that sealed sources were  particularly vulnerable during transportation. However, one DOT official  noted that large quantities of iridium-192 are regularly shipped to the  United States from Europe and South America using regular commercial  freight services. Such sources are shipped in stainless steel transport kegs  that require no special tools or equipment to open. Once loaded with up to  10,000 curies of iridium-192, the transport keg weighs only 150 to 200  pounds. While this official believed that, overall, security is sufficient  during transport, he told us that at certain phases such shipments could be  vulnerable to terrorist diversion.", "NRC and the agreement states have formed a materials security working  group to develop and issue new security orders by the end of the year for  approximately 2,100 licensees\u2014located throughout the United States\u2014 that have been determined to be of the greatest risk based upon NRC\u2019s and  DOE\u2019s work to categorize sealed sources. When these orders are issued,  affected licensees will have a certain specified time period to comply with  the order and implement required security measures. At the end of this  period, licensees will be subject to inspections to ensure compliance and  face enforcement actions if actions have not been taken.", "Agreement states\u2019 efforts to strengthen the security of sealed sources have  focused primarily on facilitating NRC actions, such as forwarding NRC  advisories, increasing attention on security when conducting inspections  and license reviews, and coordinating with local law enforcement and first  responders to develop emergency response procedures.

However, 82 percent of  agreement states responding to our survey noted that they want to have  responsibility for inspection and enforcement of security measures for  sealed sources under their authority to ensure public health and safety.  Agreement states already enforce NRC\u2019s existing security regulations under  this authority. In addition, 74 percent of agreement states responding to our  survey indicated they could effectively respond to a radiological incident  with their current resources.", "Individual commissioners at NRC have expressed concern with budget  shortfalls many states are currently experiencing. These commissioners  said that states experiencing budgetary difficulties may not be able to  assume additional responsibilities and that it may impact their program\u2019s  performance. When asked whether their state had sufficient resources to  support new efforts, 60 percent of agreement states responding to our  survey indicated they would need additional resources. However, officials  from organizations representing agreement states and non-agreement  states have met with NRC and advised NRC that, although many states are  facing budget cuts, funding of the radioactive materials programs in these  states have largely been stable and the programs have been able and will  likely be able to adequately fulfill their responsibilities.", "According to our discussions with NRC officials, NRC is also facing budget  and staffing constraints, largely as a result of its dependence upon fees  from the licensees it regulates\u2014only 20 percent of the total sealed sources  licensees nationwide\u2014for funding of its sealed source licensing and  inspection activities. As more states become agreement states, NRC has  fewer licensees to support its licensing and inspection programs. To  address the potential effect this reduction in funding may have on its  licensing and inspection programs, NRC and the agreement states have  entered into a partnership\u2014called the National Materials Program\u2014to  better share the responsibility for protecting public health and safety. Since  the agreement states regulate about 80 percent of the nation\u2019s sealed  source licensees, the National Materials Program allows them to  participate more actively in the development of regulations and guidance,  particularly in areas where they possess expertise. For example, Texas, an  agreement state, regulates more well logging specific licensees than exist  in all NRC-regulated states. Thus, according to NRC officials, Texas could  take the lead in developing any new public health and safety regulations for  well loggers. Both NRC and the agreement states are currently conducting  pilot projects to determine how the National Materials Program can and  will work. In addition, states remain solely responsible for regulating  certain radioactive materials, such as naturally occurring radioactive  material like radium and material produced in particle accelerators,  increasing the importance of federal and state cooperation in developing  and implementing additional safety and/or security measures. NRC and the  agreement states are continuing to work cooperatively to develop  information on how responsibilities can be shared under the National  Materials Program.", "NRC officials said that NRC lacks sufficient staff to conduct inspections of  all licensees expected to receive security orders\u2014large irradiator facilities  and approximately 2,100 licensees that NRC has identified as presenting  the greatest risk. To mitigate this staffing shortage, NRC intends to enter  into contracts with agreement states or independent contractors to assist  in carrying out these inspections. According to agreement state officials we  spoke with, however, agreement states may be reluctant to participate in  these efforts if they have had no role in developing the additional security  requirements or are not provided additional funding. NRC would remain  responsible for taking appropriate enforcement action for any security  violation found during these inspections.

Where NRC and the agreement  states previously concentrated on ensuring the safe and effective use of  sealed sources, they must now increasingly consider how to prevent  terrorists from obtaining and using the material. Efforts to improve  controls over sealed sources face significant challenges, especially how to  balance the need to secure these materials while not discouraging their  beneficial use in academic, medical, and industrial applications. The first  step to improve security is to conduct a threat assessment that would  identify sealed sources most likely to be used in a terrorist attack and the  consequences of such an attack. Defining the types of sealed sources that  are of the greatest concern will allow federal and state efforts to be  appropriately prioritized. NRC\u2019s and DOE\u2019s current efforts to categorize  sealed sources by the greatest amount of risk and their efforts to establish a  national-level tracking system for the highest risk sealed sources are  commendable. However, these efforts could be strengthened by involving  the agreement states, which regulate 80 percent of the nation\u2019s radioactive  materials licensees, in determining risk. In addition, these efforts could be  further strengthened by determining the economic consequences of a dirty  bomb and how to effectively mitigate any resulting psychological  consequences. In addition, NRC\u2019s current regulations leave sealed sources  at risk of malicious use. Modifying its regulations to eliminate general  licensing of devices containing sealed sources could improve  accountability, potentially reducing the number of sources that are lost,  stolen, or abandoned. Furthermore, modifying NRC\u2019s licensing and/or  inspection process to verify\u2014before a licensee purchases radioactive  material\u2014that it will be used as intended may increase the security of  sealed sources.", "The President\u2019s National Strategy for Homeland Security recognizes the  critical importance of integrating federal, state, local, and private sector  efforts to prepare and respond to terrorist attacks, including those using  sealed sources. The initial responsibility, however, falls upon state and  local governments and their organizations\u2014such as police, fire  departments, emergency medical personnel, and public health agencies\u2014 which will almost invariably be the first responders to any terrorist event  involving sealed sources. Because of state and local governments\u2019 role in  responding to incidents\u2014in addition to the fact that the federal  government lacks authority over naturally occurring and accelerator  produced radioactive material\u2014it is critical to involve state and local  governments in the development and implementation of additional security  over sealed sources. State radiological protection agencies can provide  valuable expertise on the licensees that they have been regulating, in many  cases, for decades. Developing criteria and performance measures to gauge  NRC\u2019s and agreement states\u2019 effectiveness at implementing additional  security as part of NRC\u2019s performance evaluation process would help  ensure the consistent application of additional security measures across  the United States. NRC and the agreement states have a proven record of  cooperation in regulating the safe use of radioactive materials, including  sealed sources.

According to NRC, the draft report does not fully reflect its  existing statutory framework and does not recognize that several of our  recommendations would require statutory changes at both federal and  state levels. Furthermore, NRC commented that our draft report should  have focused on high-risk radioactive sources that are of greatest concern  for malevolent use by a terrorist rather than radioactive sources of all  types.", "Regarding NRC\u2019s comments that our draft report does not fully discuss its  activities to increase the security of the highest-risk sealed sources, we  note that our draft report detailed all advisories issued by NRC to sealed  source licensees urging them to ensure security of sealed sources following  September 11, 2001, as well as NRC\u2019s efforts with DOE to define the  radioactive isotopes of concern. We have added information on the  organization and goals of NRC\u2019s new materials security working group.  Furthermore, our report discusses that NRC\u2019s security order to large  irradiators was issued on June 5, 2003. This order was issued four days  after our meeting with NRC officials to discuss our preliminary findings,  conclusions, and recommendations. At the meeting, NRC officials told us  that it could take until the end of 2003 for the order to be issued. It is  important to note that this is the first and only security order related to  sealed sources issued since the September 11, 2001, attacks and that it  applies only to 70 large irradiator facilities in the United States. As  discussed in our draft report, 93 percent of agreement states responding to  our survey identified industrial radiographers, of which there are over 500  nationwide, as of greater concern than large irradiator facilities.", "Regarding NRC\u2019s comment that our draft report does not recognize that  several of our recommendations would require statutory changes at both  federal and state levels, we have clarified our report to recommend that  NRC determine how officials in agreement and non-agreement states can  participate in the development and implementation of additional security  measures. We agree with NRC that its statutory framework reserves to  NRC the authority to promote the common defense and security and our  report discusses the distinction between federal and state authority.  However, we continue to believe, as do state officials we spoke with, that  involving the agreement and non-agreement states in the development and  implementation of additional security measures would be beneficial. As  our draft report stated, state and local governments will almost invariably  be the first responders to any terrorist event involving sealed sources.  States can also provide valuable expertise on licensees that they have been  regulating for decades and which NRC has had no prior contact with. In its  comments, NRC states that the possibility of state budget shortfalls played  absolutely no role in its decision to develop and implement additional  security measures under its common defense and security authority.  However, numerous NRC officials told us during our review that budget  difficulties could impact the performance of state radiation protection  programs and NRC\u2019s former Chairman discussed the issue at a January  2003 meeting. NRC acknowledges in its comments that cooperation with  agreement states is vital to the success of its efforts. We are encouraged  that NRC stated in its comments that it will examine changes to its  statutory framework in its new materials security working group and  intends to work with the states to the maximum extent possible under  existing statutes.", "Regarding NRC\u2019s comment that the draft report should have focused only  on high-risk sources rather than radioactive sources of all types, we note  that the objectives of our review included determining the known number  of all sealed sources in the United States and the number of sources lost,  stolen, or abandoned. Our draft report noted that defining the types of  sealed sources that are of the greatest concern would allow federal and  state efforts to be appropriately prioritized. As we did when responding to  a similar comment NRC made in our May 2003 report, we agree that the  highest-risk sources present the greatest concern as desirable material for  a dirty bomb. However, other sealed radioactive sources could also be  used as a terrorist weapon. No one can say with certainty what the  psychological, social, or economic costs of a dirty bomb\u2014regardless of the  radioactive material used to construct it\u2014would be. We are concerned that  NRC\u2019s and DOE\u2019s identification of the highest-risk sealed sources focuses  solely on the health risks of their use and does not address the  psychological, social, or economic costs of a dirty bomb. It is also  important to note that NRC is still working with the International Atomic  Energy Agency to reconcile differences between their definitions of high- risk sealed sources. Furthermore, many of the radioactive isotopes  identified by NRC and DOE as high-risk are used only at DOE facilities or  by very few NRC licensees in the United States. NRC and DOE did not  consider radioactive materials licensees in the agreement states, which  constitute 80 percent of the nation\u2019s licensees. Without addressing the total  consequences of a dirty bomb and considering the availability of sealed  sources nationwide, we believe NRC\u2019s and DOE\u2019s determination of risk is  incomplete.", "In general, both CRCPD and OAS agreed with the recommendations in the  report. However, both organizations noted that our use of the term \u201csealed  source\u201d to refer to all radioactive materials used in medical, industrial, and  research purposes may exclude many radioactive isotopes that could be  used in a dirty bomb that are loose and not in sealed form, especially those  used in medical and research facilities. We used the term \u201csealed source\u201d  for simplicity to distinguish medical, industrial, and research radioactive  isotopes from material used in nuclear weapons and as fuel in nuclear  reactors. We did not intend to exclude unsealed radioactive material from  our discussion of radioactive materials of concern and have clarified our  use of the term.", "CRCPD stated that the report does not address four critical areas of  potential risk. First, CRCPD believes that a major area of risk is at bankrupt  facilities where sealed sources can be left unattended and/or unsecured for  long periods of time, leaving the sources easy targets for theft. We  acknowledge this risk and have revised our discussion of lost, stolen, and  abandoned sources appropriately. Second, CRCPD noted that radioactive  materials licensed for \u201cstorage only\u201d tend to be neglected by the licensee  and the regulatory agency. While we agree that this is a potential weakness  in sealed source security, individual state practices on \u201cstorage only\u201d  licenses differ. We did not specifically examine these practices during our  review. Third, CRCPD stated that the report does not adequately address  the radioactive material under the control of DOE and naturally occurring  and accelerator produced radioactive material. While DOE does control a  large amount of radioactive material, discussion of the security provided to  it was outside of the scope of our review. We believe our report adequately  discusses the challenges of regulating naturally occurring and accelerator  produced materials. Finally, CRCPD states that the report does not  consider transportation hubs through which very large quantities of  radioactive material pass each day. While we do not specifically discuss  transportation hubs, our draft report noted that weaknesses have been  identified in the transportation of sealed sources and, at certain phases of  transport, these shipments could be vulnerable to terrorist diversion.", "OAS agreed with our recommendation that NRC should include criteria and  performance measures of the agreement states\u2019 implementation of  additional security measures in NRC\u2019s periodic evaluations of agreement  states\u2019 effectiveness. OAS stated that such evaluation is not possible given  the current intention of NRC to issue and implement security orders under  its common defense and security authority. However, we believe that the  recommendation in our draft report that NRC determine how states can  participate in the development and implementation of additional security  measures addresses this concern.", "OAS also noted that our draft report stated that licensees are tracked  instead of individual sealed sources and that the draft report lends support  to the formation of a national tracking system for sealed sources. OAS  commented that our discussion does not accurately describe the current  system. Licensees are required to maintain records for the acquisition and  disposition of each source it receives and maintain an accurate inventory of  sources in their possession. While we agree with this comment and have  revised our discussion of license tracking, our draft report was accurate in  that there is no single source of information in the United States to verify  authorized users, locations, quantities, and movements of sealed sources.  OAS goes on to state that there are serious concerns with the practicality  and accuracy of a national tracking system and that the development of  such a system should be further evaluated with input from the states and  private industry. We agree with OAS\u2019s comments, but believe that our  recommendation to collaborate with the agreement states in order to  determine the types, amount, and availability of the highest risk sealed  sources and the health, psychological, and economic consequences of their  use in a terrorist attack addresses OAS\u2019s concerns.", "Finally, OAS commented that the states have long requested that the  federal government seriously consider placing the use and regulation of all  radioactive materials in a single federal agency. According to OAS, the  current approach results in a disjointed regulatory structure and different  standards for the same public health issue. While we agree that consistency  and avoiding duplication is important, addressing the overall regulation of  radioactive material in the United States was outside the scope of our  review on security of sealed sources.", "We conducted our work from August 2002 through June 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

How effective are federal and state controls over sealed sources? 4. What efforts have been initiated or considered since September 11,  2001, to better safeguard radiological sources?", "To answer these questions, we distributed surveys to 32 agreement states,  18 non-agreement states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and to  NRC\u2019s 4 regional offices. We focused the survey on information about each  state\u2019s radiation control program, specific and general licensing activities,  enforcement actions, effectiveness of controls over sealed sources,  program evaluation processes, transportation of sealed sources, and the  impact of September 11, 2001, on regulatory programs. We acquired a list of  the appropriate agreement and non-agreement state officials from NRC\u2019s  Office of State and Tribal Programs Web site and from the Conference of  Radiation Control Program Directors. Because this was not a sample  survey, but rather a census of all states, there are no sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example,  measurement errors are introduced if difficulties exist in how a particular  question is interpreted or in the sources of information available to  respondents in answering a question. In addition, coding errors may occur  if mistakes are entered into a database. We took extensive steps in the  development of the questionnaires, the collection of data, and the editing  and analysis of data to minimize total survey error. To reduce measurement  error, we conducted two rounds of pretesting to make sure questions and  response categories were interpreted in a consistent manner with both  agreement and non-agreement states. We also provided draft copies of the  questionnaires to NRC, the Organization of Agreement States (OAS), and  the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD) for their  review and comment. Based on both pretesting and comments received  from NRC, OAS, and CRCPD, we made relevant changes to the questions  based upon these pretests. Copies of the agreement and non-agreement  state questionnaires, along with the results to each question, are in  appendixes IV and V, respectively.", "In addition, we edited all completed surveys for consistency and, if  necessary, contacted respondents to clarify responses. All questionnaire  responses were double key-entered into our database (that is, the entries  were 100 percent verified), and a random sample of the questionnaires was  further verified for completeness and accuracy. In addition, all computer  syntax was peer reviewed and verified by separate programmers to ensure  that the syntax was written and executed correctly.", "We made extensive efforts to encourage respondents to complete and  return the questionnaires, including sending up to four reminder electronic  mail messages to non-respondents, calling state radiation control program  directors directly, and collaborating with OAS to promote completion of  this survey. Our efforts yielded responses from 31 of 32 (96.8 percent  response rate) agreement states and 11 of 18 (61.1 percent response rate)  non-agreement states. We also received responses from Puerto Rico and  the four NRC regional offices. In total, we achieved an overall response rate  of 80.4 percent, receiving 45 of the 56 surveys disseminated. We did not  receive a response from one agreement state: Arizona. The non-agreement  states of Alaska, Connecticut, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, South  Dakota, and Wyoming did not respond to our survey, nor did we receive a  response from the District of Columbia. Although we did not receive  surveys from these states, we obtained data on incidents involving sealed  sources and numbers and types of licensees from NRC. Three states (New  York, South Carolina, and Texas) have multiple agencies with jurisdiction  over sealed sources. We sent and received surveys from the appropriate  agencies in each of these states.", "To determine the number and types of sealed source licenses in the United  States and the number of sealed sources lost, stolen, or abandoned, we  relied upon information provided by state radiation control programs in  their responses to our survey. In addition, we obtained data from NRC\u2019s  license tracking system database on licensees NRC regulates\u2014both in the  non-agreement states and on federal facilities in the agreement states. To  determine the number of sealed sources lost, stolen, or abandoned over the  past 5 years, we obtained data on incidents from NRC\u2019s Nuclear Materials  Events Database. We chose to examine the past 5 years because  information was readily available through this database. Because each  state uses different systems to track its licensing activities, we did not  attempt to independently assess the reliability of data provided by the  states in their responses to our survey. However, we did ask states in what  ways and how frequently information in their databases is validated. To  assess the reliability of NRC\u2019s databases, we interviewed officials at NRC in  charge of maintaining its license tracking system database and the Nuclear  Materials Events Database to determine if data in these systems are  reasonably complete and accurate. As a result of these interviews, we did  not find any reasons to question the reliability of these data. In addition, we  also performed limited testing on NRC\u2019s license tracking system database  to find missing data or data outside expected ranges. We did not find  significant errors or incompleteness as a result of these tests and  concluded that the use of the data would not lead to incorrect or  unintentional findings. These are the only data on NRC licensing activities  in the United States and program managers at NRC regularly use the data.", "In addition to data on state programs obtained through our survey, we  obtained information through interviews with officials from state radiation  control programs. We visited the following states during our review:  Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina,  Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Utah. We also interviewed  officials from the Massachusetts, Nevada, New York, and Ohio state  radiation control programs.", "We selected states to visit based upon the numbers of licensees regulated  by the state and the different uses of sealed sources. We selected states  with a low number of licensees (Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Utah), a  medium number of licensees (Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North  Carolina, and Pennsylvania), and a high number of licensees (Florida and  Illinois). In addition, we considered the types of licensees in each state. For  example, we visited South Carolina and Utah because they have two of the  nation\u2019s three low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities\u2014the Chem- Nuclear Systems, L.L.C. facility in Barnwell, South Carolina and the  Envirocare of Utah, Inc., facility in Clive, Utah. When visiting states, we met  with officials from selected licensees that represented the major uses of  sealed sources. We also visited manufacturers because they may possess  larger quantities of radioactive material for installation in devices for sale.  In summary, we visited three sites being decommissioned and  decontaminated, two low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities, two  moisture/density gauge manufacturers, two industrial radiographers, two  medical licensees (hospitals), two large irradiator facilities, a well-logging  licensee, a nuclear pharmacy, a research and development licensee, and an  academic licensee to obtain their views on the effectiveness of NRC and  state regulations, including the challenges associated with sealed source  security. Additionally, we examined physical security measures during  tours of these facilities.", "We also visited Rhode Island, Florida, and the NRC Region III office in  Lisle, Illinois, because they were undergoing NRC program performance  evaluation reviews under the Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation  Program. Visiting a program while it was being evaluated gave us the  opportunity to witness review procedures for evaluating performance,  consistency of application of NRC\u2019s review criteria, transparency of the  review process, and the level of cooperation and involvement between  NRC officials and representatives from agreement states. To follow up our  review of the program evaluation process, we attended a 2-day NRC  training class on the Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation Program  and observed two program evaluation Management Review Board  meetings at NRC headquarters in Rockville, Maryland.", "We attended two conferences related to sealed source regulation\u2014the May  2002 CRCPD annual meeting held in Madison, Wisconsin, and the annual  OAS Conference held in October 2002, in Denver, Colorado. We also  obtained a position paper from the Health Physics Society on the regulation  of sealed sources. Furthermore, we met with the chairman of the Southeast  Compact for low-level radioactive waste and the Advisory Committee on  the Medical Uses of Isotopes to elicit views on the regulation and security  of sealed sources.", "At the federal level, we interviewed numerous NRC officials representing  several different offices and programs. During these interviews, NRC  provided us with information and documents about the regulation of sealed  sources and the challenges it faces in the post September 11, 2001, security  environment. We met with NRC\u2019s Office of Enforcement, Office of  Investigation, Office of Nuclear Materials Safety and Safeguards, Office of  Nuclear Security and Incident Response, and Office of State and Tribal  Programs. Additionally, we attended an August 2002 meeting between  representatives of OAS and CRCPD and the Commissioners of NRC.  Finally, to gain the perspective of federal regulators at the regional level,  we visited three of the four NRC regional offices, including NRC Region I  located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania; Region II located in Atlanta,  Georgia; and Region III located in Lisle, Illinois.", "In addition to officials at NRC, we interviewed several other federal  government agency officials. To learn about sealed source transportation  regulations and issues, we interviewed officials from the Department of  Transportation, including the Office of Hazardous Materials Safety. To  establish the role of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating  sealed sources, we met with officials from the Office of Radiation and  Indoor Air. We also met with officials from the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) and observed a FEMA evaluated exercise in  March 2003 in Springfield and Morris, Illinois, that simulated a radiological  release at a nuclear power plant.
