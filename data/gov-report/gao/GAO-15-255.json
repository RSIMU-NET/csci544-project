CMS has developed educational materials, such as checklists and timelines, for entities covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)\u2014that is, health care providers, clearinghouses, and health plans, which GAO refers to as \u201cpayers\u201d\u2014and their support vendors. In addition, CMS has conducted outreach to prepare covered entities for the transition by, for example, holding in-person training for small physician practices in some states. CMS officials have also monitored covered entity and vendor readiness through stakeholder collaboration meetings, focus group testing, and review of surveys conducted by the health care industry. CMS also reported modifying its Medicare systems and policies. For example, CMS documentation states that the agency completed all ICD-10-related changes to its Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims processing systems, which reflect the results of internal testing. At this time, it is not known what, if any, changes might be necessary based upon the agency's ongoing external testing activities. CMS has also provided technical assistance to Medicaid agencies and monitored their readiness for the transition. For example, all Medicaid agencies reported that they would be able to perform all of the activities that CMS has identified as critical by the transition deadline; however, as of November 2014, not all agencies have started to test their systems' abilities to accept and adjudicate claims containing ICD-10 codes.", "Stakeholder organizations identified several areas of concern about the ICD-10 transition and made several recommendations, which CMS has taken steps to address. For example, stakeholders expressed concerns that CMS's testing activities have not been comprehensive. In addition, while all 28 stakeholders GAO contacted indicated that CMS's educational materials have been helpful to covered entities, stakeholders were concerned about the extent to which those entities were aware of and using those materials. In response, CMS officials said that the agency has scheduled end-to-end testing with 2,550 covered entities during three weeks in 2015 (in January, April, and July), and has promoted awareness of its educational materials by, for example, partnering with payers, providers, and others to direct users to available CMS and industry educational resources. Stakeholders also recommended that CMS expand its in-person training and develop additional specialty-specific materials. CMS officials said the agency has added in-person training in additional states with plans to also offer more video trainings, and planned to develop additional specialty-specific materials. Additionally, stakeholders recommended that CMS do more to engage covered entities through non-electronic methods and to make its Medicare FFS contingency plans public. CMS officials indicated that the agency employs various methods to engage covered entities\u2014including bi-weekly stakeholder collaboration meetings and print advertisements\u2014and also conducted a direct mail pilot project to primary care practices in four states, and plans to expand the pilot.

On September 5, 2012, HHS finalized regulations delaying the effective  date until October 1, 2014. The Secretary of HHS made this decision for the following  three reasons: (1) the industry transition to the revised set of HIPAA electronic transaction  standards, known as Version 5010, did not proceed as effectively as expected;   (2) providers became concerned that other statutory initiatives, such as the Electronic  Health Records Program and the Electronic Prescribing Program were stretching their  resources; and (3) there was a lack of readiness for the ICD-10 transition, as indicated by  industry surveys and polls. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, enacted   April 1, 2014, delayed the transition further by requiring HHS to transition to the use of  ICD-10 codes no sooner than October 1, 2015.

In addition, we interviewed CMS officials  responsible for overseeing the agency\u2019s ICD-10 transition activities. To  provide information on areas where covered entities perceive that CMS\u2019s  activities related to the ICD-10 transition have been helpful, we analyzed  information collected from a non-probability sample of 28 stakeholder  organizations we contacted. To do so, we first identified a non-probability  sample of 36 national stakeholder organizations to collect information that  is representative of the views of the covered entities they represent, as  well as the vendors that support those covered entities. Our criteria for  selecting these stakeholders were as follows: national organizations that  participated in one of CMS\u2019s stakeholder collaboration meetings held in  2013; additional national organizations identified by CMS as a resource  on the agency\u2019s ICD-10 website; organizations that, according to the  American Medical Association, represent medical professions that might  be particularly impacted by the transition or have unique insights; the  Healthcare Administrative Technology Association, a new organization  identified by CMS as important because it represents practice  management system vendors; and other organizations we identified to  ensure that we had representation from each of the broad categories of  non-federal affected covered entities identified by CMS in developing its  regulations. For example, CMS identified outpatient care centers as  covered entities impacted by the ICD-10 transition in conjunction with   Because those covered entities  issuing a final rule in January 2009.were not already represented by one of the previously identified national  organizations, we selected a national organization representing  ambulatory surgical centers, which are a type of outpatient care center.

Specifically, ICD-9 codes are used in all U.S. health care settings  to code diagnoses and are also used in all U.S. inpatient hospital settings  to code procedures. Beginning on October 1, 2015, all health care  transactions that include ICD codes must use ICD-10 codes for dates of  service that occur on or after that date. Transactions with dates of service  that occur prior to the transition date of October 1, 2015, must continue to  be coded with ICD-9 codes. The vendors whose goods or services health  care providers may utilize to help them code and process claims, such as  electronic health record vendors and practice management system  vendors, are not covered entities, but they must respond to HIPAA  standards in order to support their HIPAA-covered customers.

Representatives from CMS  and the National Center for Health Statistics comprise the Coordination  and Maintenance Committee, which is responsible for approving coding  changes and making modifications, based upon input from the public.  CDC and CMS, assisted by the American Hospital Association (AHA) and  the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA)\u2014 collectively known as the Cooperating Parties\u2014are responsible for  supporting covered entities\u2019 transitions to ICD-10. The Cooperating  Parties\u2019 responsibilities include developing and maintaining guidelines for  ICD-10 codes and developing ICD-10-related educational programs.", "In addition to the Cooperating Parties, other organizations are helping to  prepare covered entities for the ICD-10 transition. For example, officials  with the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI), a coalition of  covered entities, vendors, and other members of the health care industry,  hold regular meetings with industry members to discuss how to address  ICD-10 transition issues. Additionally, WEDI and other stakeholders have  made educational materials available on their websites.the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society\u2019s ICD-10  Playbook contains tools, guidelines, and information to help covered  entities prepare for the transition to ICD-10 codes. Stakeholders have  also held sessions on ICD-10 transition-related issues during their  member conferences.", "There are several differences between ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. For  example, ICD-10 codes can include up to seven alphanumeric digits,  while ICD-9 codes can only include up to five alphanumeric digits. The  additional digits in ICD-10 codes allow for the inclusion of more codes.  Specifically, there are approximately 15,000 ICD-9 diagnosis codes  compared to approximately 70,000 ICD-10 diagnosis codes, and  approximately 4,000 ICD-9 procedure codes compared to approximately  72,000 ICD-10 procedure codes. Despite the dramatic increase in the  number of ICD-10 codes, according to CMS and others, most physician  practices use a relatively small number of diagnosis codes that are  generally related to a specific type of specialty.", "The additional number of ICD-10 codes enables providers and payers to  capture greater specificity and clinical information in medical claims. For  example, ICD-10 codes enable providers to report on the body part and  the side of the body subject to the evaluation or procedure. More  specifically, while there was 1 ICD-9 code for angioplasty\u2014a procedure to  restore blood flow through an artery\u2014there are 854 ICD-10 codes for  angioplasty, with codes including additional detail on the body part,  approach, and device used for the procedure. Another difference between  ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes is the terminology and disease classifications,  which have been updated so that they are consistent with new technology  and current clinical practice. For example, under ICD-9, there was a  single code to reflect tobacco use or dependence. Under ICD-10, there is  a category for nicotine dependence with subcategories to identify the  specific tobacco product and nicotine-induced disorder. The updated  disease classifications for nicotine disorders reflect the increased  knowledge of the effects of nicotine. Other differences between ICD-9  and ICD-10 codes include the addition of new concepts that did not exist  in ICD-9 diagnosis codes, such as the expansion of postoperative codes  to distinguish between intraoperative and post-procedural complications;  and the designation of trimester for pregnancy codes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Usage of ICD Codes", "paragraphs": ["The ICD codes are used in a variety of ways by payers, including  Medicare and Medicaid. For example, payers generally use ICD  diagnosis codes to determine whether the care provided by physicians is  medically necessary and, therefore, eligible for reimbursement.  Additionally, Medicare hospital inpatient payment rates are based on  Medicare-Severity Diagnosis-Related Groups (MS-DRG), a system that  classifies inpatient stays according to both patients\u2019 diagnoses and the  procedures the patients receive, both of which are identified using ICD  codes. The MS-DRG signifies the average costliness of inpatient stays  assigned to one MS-DRG category relative to another MS-DRG category.  All payers will need to update all systems and processes that utilize ICD  codes by October 1, 2015, to ensure they are ICD-10 compliant.", "In addition to claims processing, Medicare, Medicaid, and private payers  conduct a variety of quality measurement activities that use quality  measures, which will need to be updated to reflect the ICD-10 codes. For  example, Medicare providers collect and report quality measures to CMS  for the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting program, the Physician  Quality Reporting System, the Physician Value-based Payment Modifier  Program, and the Electronic Health Records program, and many private  payers measure their performance using Healthcare Effectiveness Data  and Information Set\u00ae (HEDIS) measures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Developed Transition Educational Materials, Modified Medicare Systems, and Assisted Medicaid Agencies", "paragraphs": ["In preparation for the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes, CMS  developed various educational materials, conducted outreach, and  monitored the readiness of covered entities and the vendors that support  them for the transition.

For example, CMS developed educational and guidance tools, such as an  implementation handbook, which identified five implementation phases:  (1) awareness, (2) assessment, (3) remediation, (4) testing, and   (5) transition. In addition, according to the CMS official leading these  technical assistance activities, CMS conducted about 60 onsite training  sessions with Medicaid agencies. By January 2015, CMS officials said  the agency will have conducted site visits to 12 Medicaid agencies that  need additional assistance to prepare for the transition, and will conduct  additional trainings as needed. CMS also provides technical assistance to  Medicaid agencies in other ways. For example, a CMS official noted that  the agency advised Medicaid agencies on their testing plans and worked  with them on their development of risk mitigation plans related to provider  readiness. In addition, CMS officials noted that the agency hosts bi- weekly meetings with Medicaid agencies, which include selected external  stakeholders, such as other payers and health care providers, during  which Medicaid agencies share information, lessons learned, and best  practices related to the ICD-10 transition.", "CMS also monitors the readiness of Medicaid agencies for the ICD-10  transition. For example, CMS officials noted that the agency assesses the  readiness of Medicaid agencies quarterly and holds conference calls with  each one. According to CMS officials, as of October 2014, all states and  the District of Columbia reported that they would be able to perform all of  the activities that CMS has identified as critical to preparing for the ICD- 10 transition by the deadline. These critical success factors are the  ability to accept electronic claims with ICD-10 codes; adjudicate claims;  pay providers (institutional, professional, managed care); complete  coordination of benefits with other insurers; and create and send  Medicaid system reports to CMS. CMS officials stated that all Medicaid  agencies must test each of the critical success factors and report back to   However, as of November 26, 2014,  CMS no later than June 30, 2015.not all Medicaid agencies had started to test their systems\u2019 abilities to  accept and adjudicate claims containing ICD-10 codes. Specifically, CMS  officials told us that 2 states had completed internal and external testing,  9 states and the District of Columbia had started internal testing activities,  and 16 states had started external testing activities. The remaining   23 states, according to the CMS officials, were in the process of updating  their policies and systems, which needs to occur before testing begins.

Stakeholders we contacted also noted areas of concern and made  recommendations regarding CMS\u2019s ICD-10 education and outreach  efforts, and requested that the agency mitigate any additional provider  burdens leading up to and following the ICD-10 transition.", "Testing. Twenty of the 28 stakeholders we contacted identified concerns  or made recommendations related to CMS\u2019s ICD-10 testing activities.  Their comments focused on CMS\u2019s lack of comprehensive ICD-10  testing, as well as the need to communicate the future test results to  covered entities.", "Lack of comprehensive testing. Seventeen stakeholders raised  concerns that CMS\u2019s ICD-10 testing was not comprehensive.  Specifically, some of these stakeholders were concerned that CMS  has not yet conducted Medicare FFS end-to-end testing. Additionally,  some of these stakeholders were concerned that CMS would not  include enough covered entities in its testing. For example, one  stakeholder expressed concern that not all provider types, such as  small providers, would be represented in the planned testing. Another  stakeholder was concerned that the number of testing participants  may not be large enough to get a true sense of industry readiness or  the ability of CMS to properly process the full range of ICD-10 codes.", "As previously noted, CMS officials said that the agency has scheduled  Medicare FFS end-to-end testing with a total of 2,550 covered entities  during three separate weeks in 2015, and identified staffing and  financial constraints as the reason for limiting the number of covered  entities participating in the scheduled testing. However, agency  officials indicated that the number of covered entities they plan to test  with will exceed the number requested by some industry groups. In  addition, CMS officials said they are committed to ensuring that the  testing participants are representative of the health care industry.", "Communicate test results. Seven stakeholders we contacted  recommended CMS better communicate the agency\u2019s readiness for  the ICD-10 transition, by, for example, improving communication of  test results. Two of these stakeholders indicated that doing a better  job communicating test results would not only increase confidence  that CMS will be prepared to process claims, but also would help  providers identify modifications needed in their own coding or billing  practices.", "CMS officials noted that the agency intends to publicly release the  results of Medicare FFS end-to-end testing once the agency has  completed its analysis of each of the three scheduled testing periods.  Specifically, CMS\u2019s communications plan indicates that the agency  intends to report on the results of each testing period within a month  of when the testing is completed. CMS officials told us that the report  will provide details about the types and numbers of testing  participants, technical challenges that arise during testing, and CMS\u2019s  plans for fixing them.", "Education. Twenty of the 28 stakeholders we contacted identified  concerns or recommendations related to CMS\u2019s covered entity education  efforts. Specifically, these stakeholders\u2019 comments focused on whether  covered entities were aware of CMS\u2019s educational materials to help them  prepare for the ICD-10 transition. These stakeholders suggested CMS  emphasize benefits from transitioning to ICD-10, as well as best practices  and success stories, expand in-person training, and develop more  specialty-specific materials.", "Covered entity awareness of educational materials. Eleven  stakeholders we contacted expressed concerns about the extent to  which the covered entities they represent were aware of and using the  educational materials developed by CMS. In particular, while all 28  stakeholders we contacted indicated that CMS\u2019s educational materials  have been helpful to covered entities, some of them were concerned  that the materials may not be reaching the covered entities most in  need of them, such as solo or small physician practices, rural and  critical access hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies.", "CMS officials indicated that all of the agency\u2019s outreach efforts\u2014as  described earlier in this report\u2014have been intended to work in concert  to promote awareness of the ICD-10 transition and direct covered  entities, especially hard-to-reach entities, to helpful educational  materials. CMS officials stated that the agency has partnered with a  number of organizations to reach covered entities, including those  covered entities that some stakeholders indicated are most in need of  the materials. Specifically, CMS partnered with WEDI to create the  \u201cICD-10 Implementation Success Initiative,\u201d a partnership between  payers, providers, coding organizations, and other organizations to  promote awareness of the ICD-10 transition by directing users to  available CMS and industry educational resources. In addition, CMS  officials indicated that the agency tracks the use of its educational  materials by, for example, monitoring the number of documents  downloaded or videos viewed, and uses the tracking information to  customize and develop new information as needed. However, the  agency\u2019s monitoring activities do not provide specific information on  whether the providers most in need of these materials\u2014which  stakeholders identified as solo or small physician practices, rural and  critical access hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies\u2014 are accessing and using them.", "Place greater emphasis on sharing ICD-10 benefits, best practices,  and success stories. Seven stakeholders we contacted suggested  that CMS put greater emphasis on sharing ICD-10 benefits, best  practices, and success stories in order to increase support among  providers for the transition. Specifically, one stakeholder said that it  would be helpful if CMS could identify \u201cphysician champions\u201d who  could discuss the benefits of transitioning to ICD-10, walk other  physicians through the steps needed to prepare for the transition, and  reassure them that they will not suffer financially in the process of  preparing for the transition. Similarly, another stakeholder suggested  that success stories could illustrate that the effort to comply with the  ICD-10 transition may not be as difficult as anticipated. A third  stakeholder mentioned that CMS could do more to explain how the  transition to ICD-10 can create value in delivering patient care.", "CMS officials highlighted agency materials that describe benefits, best  practices, and success stories that are currently available on the Road  to 10 website, and also described materials they are developing. For  example, CMS officials identified website materials that describe  clinical, operational, professional, and financial benefits of using ICD- 10 codes, which are topics that physicians identified as resonating  with them; and video testimonials from physician champions. CMS  officials also noted that the agency is developing additional positive  testimonials and best practice resources from providers and payers,  as well as ICD-10 \u201cuse cases\u201d that will provide practical examples of  how ICD-10 codes will be used in a clinical setting. Officials noted that  the development of these materials is part of an effort to share  positive physician experiences as a way to re-engage physicians and  other covered entities following the transition delay to October 1,  2015. CMS officials indicated that this information will be posted to the  CMS website in December 2014, but did not provide additional details  on the specific materials they plan to develop during the period of our  review.", "Expand in-person training and provide more advance notice of those  events. Six stakeholders we contacted recommended that CMS  expand its in-person training for physician practices to additional  states. Initially, CMS officials indicated that they planned to hold these  in-person training events in 18 states.that every state has small or rural practices that are struggling to  make the ICD-10 transition and could benefit from CMS\u2019s training   One stakeholder remarked  activities. Another stakeholder indicated that CMS had initially only  provided a few days\u2019 advance notice for scheduled training, and  requested that CMS provide more advance notice.", "CMS officials said the agency is expanding the in-person trainings   to additional states, beyond the 18 states noted above, where  resources allow. Specifically, as of January 2015, officials said that  they had held trainings in 11 additional states. CMS officials also  indicated that the agency is collaborating with nationally and locally  recognized organizations to expand training to additional states.  Officials said that where resources are not available for in-person  training, CMS is reviewing options to offer more video training through  the ICD-10 website. In response to concerns about the notice  provided for these events, CMS officials said that the Road to 10  website identifies scheduled in-person training events by location, and  that the agency is working closely with the CMS regional offices,  medical specialty associations, and other state and local partners to  raise awareness of these events.", "Develop additional specialty-specific materials. Four stakeholders we  contacted requested that CMS continue developing additional  physician specialty-specific educational materials. For example, one  stakeholder suggested that CMS develop more materials that focus  on specific, practical examples of how the ICD-10 codes would be  used in a clinical setting.", "CMS officials noted that the agency has made various specialty- specific materials available, and stated that the agency plans to add  more specialty-specific educational materials to its Road to 10  website, and, as requested, will partner with stakeholders to develop  materials targeted to their providers. In commenting on a draft of this  report, CMS officials noted that the agency plans to develop materials  for anesthesia, bariatric, general surgery, pulmonary, and renal  specialties; however, they did not indicate when those materials will  be made available on the website.", "Outreach. Nineteen of 28 stakeholders we contacted recommended that  CMS take additional actions that could improve its outreach efforts.", "Specifically, stakeholders recommended that the agency communicate  plans to ensure that Medicare FFS providers would be reimbursed in a  timely manner; provide information on the effect of the ICD-10 transition  on CMS\u2019s quality measurement activities; contact providers through non- electronic methods, such as print media and mail; promote a greater  sense of immediacy in preparing for the transition; provide information on  alternative methods for Medicare claims submission; and make public  CMS\u2019s Medicare FFS contingency plans.", "Communicate plans to ensure Medicare FFS payment. Seven  stakeholders we contacted recommended that CMS take action to  ensure that providers would be reimbursed in a timely manner if  CMS\u2019s Medicare FFS claims processing systems are unable to   accept and correctly process claims. These recommendations  included the following: (1) expand the use of the agency\u2019s Medicare  Part B advance payment policy to account for instances where   MACs are unable to receive and, therefore, pay providers\u2019 claims;(2) reimburse Medicare providers\u2019 claims even if there are problems  with the ICD diagnosis codes submitted; and (3) allow Medicare  providers to submit either ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes\u2014referred to as dual  coding\u2014for a period of time following the October 1, 2015, transition  deadline.", "CMS officials stated that the agency understands the importance of  paying claims on time during the ICD-10 transition, and is committed  to working closely with providers to ensure a smooth transition and  responded to each of the recommendations:", "CMS officials indicated that the agency\u2019s current authority permits  CMS to determine circumstances that warrant the issuance of  advance payments to affected physicians and suppliers providing  Medicare Part B services, and that this authority could be used  should CMS systems be unable to process valid Part B claims that  contain ICD-10 codes beginning October 1, 2015. Under these  circumstances, no action would need to be taken by the physician  or supplier, nor would the agency need to publish additional  criteria or modify the existing advance payment policy, according  to CMS officials.", "CMS officials stated that the submission of valid ICD-10 codes is a  requirement for payment; however, when the presence of a  specific diagnosis code is not required for payment then the claim  would be paid even if a more appropriate ICD-10 code should  have been used on the claim. For example, CMS officials told us  that, because there are many reasons why an individual would  need to go in for an office visit, office visits do not require the  claim to include specific ICD-10 codes; therefore, as long as a  claim for an office visit includes a valid ICD-10 code, it would be  paid. Additionally, CMS officials indicated that, absent indications  of potential fraud or intent to purposefully bill incorrectly, CMS will  not instruct its contractors to audit claims specifically to verify that  the most appropriate ICD-10 code was used. However, audits will  continue to occur and could identify ICD-10 codes included  erroneously on claims which could lead to claims denials,  according to CMS officials.", "CMS officials said that dual processing of ICD-9 and ICD-10  codes on Medicare claims is not possible given that HIPAA does  not allow for the use of two different code sets at the same time.", "Communicate how the ICD-10 transition affects CMS programs that  use clinical quality measures. Six stakeholders we contacted  expressed a need for more information on how the ICD-10 transition  will affect CMS programs that make use of clinical quality measures.  One stakeholder suggested that there is a lack of understanding  about how the ICD-10 transition will affect quality measurement  reporting.", "See http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment- Instruments/HomeHealthQualityInits/OASIS-C1.html. transition deadline. In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS  officials stated that CMS had made available a crosswalk of ICD-9  and ICD-10 codes for quality measures in the hospital inpatient  and hospital outpatient quality reporting programs.", "Engage through non-electronic methods. Five stakeholders we  contacted recommended that CMS do more to engage with covered  entities through non-electronic methods. For example, one  stakeholder indicated that not all of its members rely on electronic  communications, instead relying on more traditional forms of receiving  information\u2014such as print media and mail\u2014and suggested that CMS  expand the methods it uses to engage with covered entities. Other  stakeholders recommended that CMS work with local or regional  resources, such as the Regional Extension Centers (REC), as part of  a strategy to reach a broader audience.", "Beyond the agency\u2019s electronic outreach efforts, CMS officials  indicated that the agency employs various methods, including bi- weekly stakeholder collaboration meetings, in-person training, and  print advertisements, to engage covered entities. Another activity  officials noted as responsive to stakeholder feedback is the direct mail  pilot project that began in August 2014, and which CMS officials said  the agency plans to expand in 2015. CMS officials noted that CMS is  able to track whether recipients of direct mail have accessed the  agency\u2019s ICD-10 website. Additionally, CMS officials said that, in  2012, the agency began conducting multiple trainings with the RECs  on the ICD-10 transition in partnership with the Office of the National  Coordinator for Health Information Technology.", "Promote a greater sense of immediacy. Four stakeholders we  contacted recommended that CMS\u2019s outreach efforts foster a greater  sense of \u201cimmediacy\u201d in order to convince covered entities that they  should begin preparing for the transition; the amount of time  necessary to properly prepare is significant. For example, one  stakeholder urged CMS to strengthen its message to providers by  encouraging providers to conduct specific transition-related activities,  such as a systems remediation assessment.", "CMS officials noted that the agency has taken steps to modify the  types of messages they send covered entities as the transition  deadline approaches. After the most recent delay in the transition  date, officials said that CMS\u2019s messages began highlighting the  practical steps covered entities could take to get started with their  transition to ICD-10. For example, officials noted that CMS has issued  \u201cone year out\u201d messages intended to help covered entities follow a  one-year plan to transition to ICD-10, as well as messages that direct  covered entities to detailed ICD-10 transition guidance and resource  materials. CMS officials said that the agency\u2019s messaging in 2015 will  continue to focus on encouraging covered entities to begin specific,  technical activities, such as by providing guidance on how to conduct  end-to-end tests for ICD-10 readiness.", "Communicate Medicare FFS claims submission alternatives. Four  stakeholders we contacted expressed concern that providers could  face delays in reimbursement if they have problems making changes  to their practice management or electronic health record systems to  enable the electronic submission of claims with ICD-10 codes by the  transition deadline; therefore, they suggested that CMS do more to  communicate alternatives for submitting claims.", "CMS officials noted that the agency has already made available  information on alternatives for claims submissions to covered entities  through an MLN Matters article. These alternatives, according to the  article, consist of free billing software available from the MACs\u2019  websites or MACs\u2019 Internet portals if the portal offers claims  submissions. In addition, providers and suppliers may submit paper claim forms. However, this information is included in an article  primarily addressing CMS\u2019s Medicare FFS ICD-10 testing approach,  and it may not be clear to covered entities that this document also  communicates Medicare FFS claim submission alternatives. Officials  indicated that CMS plans to publish a claims submission alternative  educational product in September 2015, but if the agency learns that  providers need the information sooner, they will issue the document  earlier.", "Communicate Medicare FFS contingency plans. Four stakeholders  we contacted suggested that CMS should make public the agency\u2019s  Medicare FFS contingency plans that address potential post-transition  issues. Two stakeholders suggested that without a contingency plan,  covered entities may doubt whether CMS is ready for the transition  deadline, and that making such plans public would demonstrate  CMS\u2019s commitment to the transition date and instill confidence that  CMS has a clear strategy for addressing any issues that may arise.", "CMS officials developed a draft contingency plan that outlines the  steps CMS will take to address specific issues affecting Medicare FFS  claims processing if they were to arise after the transition, but this  plan has not been shared with the public. Officials indicated that they  do not intend to make the contingency plan public because the  information relevant to providers\u2014that is, claims submission  alternatives\u2014has already been made available in an MLN article.  CMS\u2019s contingency plan addresses the agency\u2019s plans in the following  scenarios: if covered entities are unable to submit ICD-10 codes, if  covered entities are submitting incorrect ICD-10 codes, and if CMS\u2019s  Medicare FFS claims processing systems are unable to accept and  correctly process claims. To help prepare in the case of the latter  scenario, the plan indicates that the agency would hold an exercise\u2014 which occurred in December 2014, according to CMS officials\u2014to  simulate the actions that could be taken in such an event. Officials  said that if there are issues that occur on or after October 1, 2015,  CMS will use its regular communication channels to educate the  provider community about what is happening and what, if anything,  providers need to do.", "Provider Burden. Seven of the 28 stakeholders we contacted expressed  concerns that the burden of participating in CMS audits and various other  concurrent programs is limiting and will continue to limit health care  providers\u2019 ability to focus on ICD-10 transition preparedness, and  requested that CMS mitigate any additional provider burdens leading up  to and following the ICD-10 transition. For example, one stakeholder  suggested that CMS delay implementing any new audits, because the  individuals responsible for preparing for the transition to ICD-10 codes are  often the same individuals involved in responding to CMS\u2019s audit  activities. Another stakeholder indicated that a lack of staff is the greatest  barrier to a successful ICD-10 transition, as providers are also trying to  simultaneously comply with a number of competing health reform  priorities, such as the Medicare Electronic Health Records program.", "In written responses to us, CMS officials stated that the agency  understands the effect new audit activities have on providers. However,  officials also indicated that some audits may have the potential to  decrease provider burden, and that it would not be appropriate for CMS to  delay all new audits. Additionally, while CMS officials did not identify  specific actions the agency could take to address stakeholders\u2019 concerns  about the burden of participating in various other concurrent programs,  they noted that the transition to ICD-10 is foundational to advancing  health care.
