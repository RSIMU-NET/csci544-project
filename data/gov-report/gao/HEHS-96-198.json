The networks are responsible for consolidating and realigning services within their areas to provide an interlocking, interdependent system of care. VA expects to improve efficiency by trimming management layers, consolidating redundant medical services, and better using available private and public resources.", "Another important change in the VA health care system is an enhanced focus on the provision of primary care and an increased emphasis on shifting care from inpatient to outpatient settings. VA is in the process of implementing a primary care approach in all of its clinics. Under primary care, veterans are expected to enroll in an outpatient clinic, where they are assigned to a primary care physician or physician group.

In fiscal year 1991, the Martinez hospital had an average daily census of 235 patients. Although the Martinez hospital served veterans from much of northern California, most users came from the East Bay and Sacramento areas.", "In 1991, the Congress appropriated emergency funds to construct a replacement outpatient clinic and a nursing home on the grounds of the closed hospital. The replacement clinic\u2014a prototype for the VA system\u2014became operational in November 1992. It included modern ambulatory surgery capabilities, sophisticated imaging technology, and attractive surroundings. Construction of the nursing home was delayed pending demolition of the hospital building, but the nursing home is scheduled to open in the fall of 1996.", "In 1992, VA planners conducted a study to determine where to build a replacement hospital. The options considered included partially renovating and seismically retrofitting the closed Martinez hospital, constructing a new hospital in Sacramento, constructing dual hospitals in Martinez and Sacramento, and constructing a joint venture hospital at Travis Air Force Base. Although the dual hospital option was judged to offer the greatest improvement in accessibility, the cost was considered prohibitive. After further negotiations with the affected parties, which resulted in the Air Force\u2019s offer to allow VA to establish some hospital beds at DGMC on an interim basis and reduce the number of beds to be included in the final construction project, VA decided on the 243-bed joint venture, including 170 new beds and 73 existing beds.", "Although VA sought funding for the hospital project in its fiscal year 1996 budget submission, the Congress did not fund the hospital aspect of the project. Instead, the Congress provided $25 million to construct only an outpatient clinic at Travis. Rather than going forward with construction of the clinic, however, VA, in its fiscal year 1997 budget submission, requested $32 million toward construction of the entire original $211 million project.

Such an increase in market share appears unlikely because the veteran population in the service area is projected to decrease by about 25 percent between 1995 and 2010.

This assumption appears flawed given the changing health care delivery market.", "Because the data used in VA\u2019s integrated planning model are several years old, the model does not fully reflect the decrease in hospital utilization occurring because of changes in medical practice and medical technology. For example, a few years ago, it was common practice for patients to remain in the hospital for 1 to 2 weeks following surgery. Now, however, it is common medical practice to get patients out of bed the day of or day after major surgery and to discharge them within a few days. In addition, new techniques, such as less invasive laparoscopic surgery, help shorten lengths of stay for those patients requiring hospital admission. Similarly, advances in medical technology and techniques, such as laser surgery, permit many procedures to be safely performed on an outpatient basis.", "Moreover, in the past few years, VA has made major strides toward shifting care to outpatient settings. For example, the performance expectations that the under secretary for health set for VISN directors establish goals for increasing both the percentage of surgeries performed on an outpatient basis and the percentage of hospital admissions shifted to outpatient settings. The NCHCS clinics served more veterans in fiscal 1995 than they did in 1992, and fewer veterans were admitted to hospitals in 1995 than in 1990, the last full year that the Martinez hospital was open. This reduced usage seems consistent with VA\u2019s shifting of care from inpatient to outpatient settings.", "With the establishment of the recently constructed Martinez outpatient clinic, NCHCS became a model for the rest of the VA system. The Martinez clinic offers modern ambulatory surgery and sophisticated imaging technology, permitting much care to be delivered on an outpatient basis. The bed days of care provided to veterans served by the Martinez clinic are among the lowest in the VA system, according to the VISN director. The ambulatory surgery and imaging capabilities at Martinez also help reduce hospital admissions from other VA clinics. For example, the Sacramento and Oakland clinics refer some patients to Martinez for ambulatory surgery rather than admitting them to a hospital. As the Oakland, Sacramento, and Redding clinics\u2019 ability to perform outpatient surgery is expanded, further reductions in hospital admissions might well result.", "VA is also moving towards nonhospital settings for patients who need subacute care.

The fourth NCHCS clinic, in Redding, does not currently meet the needs of all veterans seeking care. The Redding clinic, which provides only primary care, evaluates all veterans seeking care but, according to the chief medical officer, does not serve higher-income veterans in the discretionary care category for hospital care or veterans who have no service-connected disabilities and do not receive a VA pension.

Because patients with emergent conditions are not stable and require immediate hospitalization, they are transported by ambulance to the nearest hospital capable of providing the needed services. Because of the distance from Sacramento, Oakland, Redding, and Martinez to Travis Air Force Base, patients needing emergency care generally would not be transported to Travis even if more beds were available there. Such patients would continue to obtain care in community hospitals.", "If VA had additional beds at Travis Air Force Base, some of the veterans currently using the Palo Alto and San Francisco hospitals might be shifted to the Travis hospital.

Another VA official said that it is difficult to attract physicians to a small hospital because of the limited range of patients and services provided. The dean of the University of California at Davis medical school, however, did not see the size of the facility as a problem. Because of its proximity to UC-Davis, a hospital at Mather would, he said, be able to draw physicians and residents from the medical school. He said that Mather could be used for more routine hospitalizations and that specialized care could be provided at the University of California at Davis Hospital.", "NCHCS\u2019 facility planner said that converting the Mather facility to only an outpatient clinic and ambulatory surgery center would cost about the same as converting the facility into a VA hospital, but annual operating costs would be less. Using the Mather hospital as a clinic would relieve crowding at the existing Sacramento clinic.", "In November 1995, VA sent a letter to the Air Force Base Conversion Agency expressing an interest in acquiring, at no cost, the Mather facility and a separate dental clinic located at McClellan Air Force Base. The proposal was endorsed by the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors and, on May 30, 1996, VA notified the Secretary of the Air Force of its intention to acquire the hospital. VA had concluded that acquiring the hospital, including required modifications, would be the most cost-effective alternative to building a new VA outpatient clinic in Sacramento.", "The Air Force has already received an appropriation of $10 million for fire, safety, and seismic improvements to the building. The Air Force informed VA that it will proceed with the improvements if it gets assurance from VA that the facility will be used as a hospital. As of August 1996, VA had not provided the Air Force assurance that the facility would be used as a hospital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Expand VA Use of Existing Beds at DGMC", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force appears to have additional beds that could potentially be made available for VA use if the need arises. About 40 beds have been converted to office and other space. Moreover, further integration of Air Force and VA patient care services could provide VA access to additional beds.", "According to VA officials, one significant drawback to VA\u2019s use of DGMC is the lack of office space for VA physicians. Typically, physicians spend only a portion of their day with hospitalized patients, using the rest of their day to see patients on an outpatient basis, complete paperwork, or conduct research. Because VA does not have an outpatient clinic at Travis and no physicians\u2019 offices are available to VA, physicians\u2019 options are limited.", "Both VA and Air Force officials agreed that it is less costly to build office space than hospital space. While VA has no immediate need for additional beds, if either VA or DOD demand for inpatient care increases in the future, additional office space could be built, and some or all of the space currently used for administrative purposes could be returned to patient care. Similarly, additional inpatient beds might be made available if some of the 75 beds in the aeromedical staging facility could be used to support the ambulatory surgery program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Excess Capacity at Existing VA Hospitals Could Be Used to Meet Hospital Care Needs of East Bay Veterans", "paragraphs": ["Both the Palo Alto and San Francisco VA medical centers have significant excess capacity that could be used to serve veterans, especially those from the East Bay. Some of these veterans live closer to Palo Alto or San Francisco than they do to Travis Air Force Base. The chief medical officer from the Oakland clinic said that the Palo Alto and San Francisco hospitals had approached him about referring more patients.", "The main hospital at Palo Alto was severely damaged in an earthquake, and a replacement acute care facility is under construction The replacement hospital, scheduled to open in 1997, will be virtually a bed-for-bed replacement for the bed tower damaged in the earthquake. It will include 228 medical/surgical beds, including 24 intensive care unit beds. Because of changes in medical practice, the medical center director estimates that the hospital will have about 100 excess medical and surgical beds when it opens.", "Moreover, the Menlo Park division of Palo Alto also has a number of empty beds. The division, which includes 118 psychiatric beds and a 100-bed drug and alcohol abuse unit, plans to reduce its operating beds by 50 percent. As a result, Palo Alto and its Menlo Park division will have sufficient excess capacity to accommodate the additional 60 psychiatric beds planned at Travis.", "The VA medical center at San Francisco also has excess capacity. The San Francisco medical center is authorized 240 beds and is currently staffed to operate 190 beds, with an average daily census of about 160 patients, including many who may require only subacute hospital or extended care. The medical center director said that the hospital has about 80 excess beds now and will likely have more in the future because the hospital\u2019s workload has been steadily declining; the base closures in the Bay area have slowed the rate of decline, however, as military retirees with dual eligibility have sought care from VA after closure of DOD hospitals. Further, the San Francisco hospital is more convenient for some East Bay veterans because it is closer that the Travis Air Force Base, served by public transportation, or both."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Expand Use of Community Hospitals Close to Veterans\u2019 Homes", "paragraphs": ["Thousands of unused beds are available in community hospitals in northern California. In the approximately 4 years since VA\u2019s decision to build a replacement hospital at Travis Air Force Base was made, significant changes in the availability of beds in community hospitals have occurred. For example, a major hospital in the Martinez area\u2014Merrithew\u2014expressed interest in selling its excess capacity to VA. Another hospital in Martinez\u2014Kaiser Permanente\u2014plans to close.Similarly, four hospital systems based in Sacramento\u2014Catholic, UC-Davis, Kaiser Permanente, and Sutter\u2014have alliances with hospitals covering a wide geographic area in northern California. An alliance with one of these hospital systems might bring hospital care closer to veterans\u2019 homes than would construction of a VA hospital at Travis. The potential for such an alliance is one of the alternatives being explored by the network.", "Although VA currently makes extensive use of contract hospitals to provide emergency services, it lacks authority to contract for routine hospital care for most veterans. VA has specific statutory authority (38 U.S.C. 1703) to contract for medical care when its facilities cannot provide necessary services because they are geographically inaccessible. VA also has authority (38 U.S.C. 8153) to enter into agreements \u201cfor the mutual use, or exchange of use, of specialized medical resources when such an agreement will obviate the need for a similar resource to be provided\u201d in a VA facility. Specialized medical resources are equipment, space, or personnel that\u2014because of their cost, limited availability, or unusual nature\u2014are unique in the medical community. Neither statute authorizes VA to routinely provide hospital care through contracts with community facilities. As a result, VA cannot currently rely exclusively on contracting to meet any unexpected growth in the needs of veterans in the service area.", "VA is seeking to expand its legislative authority to contract for hospital and other health care services. Language that would expand its contracting authority was included in veterans\u2019 health care eligibility reform legislation (H.R. 3118) passed by the House of Representatives on July 30, 1996. If enacted, contracting reforms would give VA considerable flexibility to contract with community hospitals.", "A number of basic contracting approaches could be used to obtain beds from community hospitals. First, VA could lease excess space in a community hospital and staff and operate its own beds, sharing certain services with the hospital. Second, VA could contract with a hospital to operate a set number of beds for veterans. Such contracts, however, involve certain risks because of the unknown demand for care. In other words, if VA overestimates demand, then its costs of providing care through contracting would increase. The third method of providing care though contracting would be to purchase care \u201con the margin,\u201d paying for each hospital episode separately, as VA does now for emergency services.", "In May 1993, we testified before the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs on the effects of changes in the health care system on VA\u2019s major construction program. At that time, we suggested that VA consider seeking authority to use demonstration projects to test the feasibility of and best methods for contracting with community hospitals as an alternative to building VA hospitals that might never be used. One of the areas proposed for consideration as a demonstration site was the northern California area served by the former Martinez hospital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Study of Options for Serving Veterans in Sierra Pacific Network Will Be Affected by Travis Decision", "paragraphs": ["VA is developing plans for restructuring the way health care services are provided in the Sierra Pacific Network. The Congress\u2019 decision on whether to fund the proposed Travis project has significant implications for the study.", "In 1995, VA provided its network directors proposed criteria to help identify opportunities for efficiencies. For example, the criteria suggest that directors use community providers (subject to current restrictions under the VA law) if the same kind of services of equal or higher quality are available at either lower cost or equal cost but in more convenient locations for patients. The criteria also encourage directors to use nearby VA facilities and to integrate or consolidate services if doing so would yield significant administrative or staff efficiencies.", "In addition, the Sierra Pacific Network director has established a task team consisting of facility directors to study the best way to deliver care in the network. The goal is to develop a short-term strategic plan (1 to 2 years) and a longer term strategic plan (3 to 5 years). These plans are to be completed in the fall of 1996, although the Sierra Pacific Network director said that final plans on how to best deliver care will not be complete until spring of 1997.", "The task team is studying current use rates for each facility in the network, the types of services available at each facility, where the patients live, and the cost and availability of services in the community.

NCHCS clinics in Sacramento, Oakland, and Martinez, while crowded and operating at less than full efficiency, are meeting inpatient and outpatient needs and turning away no veterans.", "Second, the decision to build at Travis was driven by VA\u2019s 1992 assessment of veterans\u2019 health care needs in northern California, which relied on assumptions concerning the future availability and use of hospital beds that are no longer valid. To support the number of beds VA plans to build at Travis, VA would need to more than triple the number of veterans now served there under the joint venture with the Air Force. VA\u2019s ability to attract such a large supply of new users is questionable, however, given the large supply of unused hospital beds in VA, Air Force, and private hospitals; the decreasing veteran population; and the shifting of medical care from inpatient to outpatient settings. Such uncertainties subject VA to the risk of spending federal dollars to build a hospital that will have a large supply of beds that may never be used.", "Third, alternatives to the construction project could meet any increase in demand for hospital care without incurring the risk of spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build and operate hospital beds that are unlikely to ever be used. VA has many more efficient alternatives to serve northern California veterans. For example, it might be able to obtain use of additional beds from the Air Force at DGMC or to obtain the Mather hospital from the Air Force when McClellan Air Force Base is closed. Similarly, it could change hospital referral patterns for its existing clinics, especially the Oakland and Martinez clinics, to send more hospital patients to Palo Alto and San Francisco to take advantage of existing excess capacity. Finally, if VA had the legislative authority, it could expand contracting with community hospitals in order to provide veterans access to hospital care closer to their homes and at the same time strengthen the financial viability of community hospitals, especially those operating at less than 50-percent occupancy.", "Pursuing such alternatives before spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build and operate a new VA hospital appears consistent with VA\u2019s new network planning strategy in that it would help maintain the viability of existing VA hospitals. Without such planning, the existing VA hospitals\u2019 viability may be jeopardized by declining workloads associated with shifting veterans to the new Travis hospital.", "Although construction of outpatient facilities at Travis Air Force Base appears justified to support the existing VA beds, there do not appear to be enough veterans in the primary area to be served by the clinic to support a clinic of the size that VA plans. In addition, if VA obtains and converts the Mather hospital into a clinic and ambulatory surgery center, or constructs a new outpatient clinic in Sacramento, the ability of the Travis clinic to attract veterans from the Sacramento area would likely be diminished. The clinic needs of veterans in the Travis area could be met with less clinic space than VA included in the proposed Travis project, and VA could build the smaller clinic with the flexibility to expand if necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation to the Congress", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Congress deny VA\u2019s request for funds to construct additional hospital beds at Travis Air Force Base, given the availability of cost-effective alternatives to meet the health care needs of veterans in the NCHCS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Consideration by the Congress", "paragraphs": ["The Congress may also wish to consider directing VA to spend only part of existing appropriated funds to construct a smaller outpatient clinic designed to provide considerably fewer than 85,000 visits a year.
