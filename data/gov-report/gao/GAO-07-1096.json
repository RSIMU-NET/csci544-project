In addition to establishing these three new programs,  WIA requires that services for these programs, along with those of a  number of other employment and training programs, including the  Wagner-Peyser-funded Employment Service, be provided through a single  service delivery system\u2014the one-stop system. States were required to  implement these changes by July 1, 2000.

In addition to  mandatory partners, one-stop centers have the flexibility to include other  optional partners, such as TANF or the Food Stamp Employment and  Training program, in the one-stop system to better meet specific state and  local workforce development needs.

Labor states that requirements to become affiliated are broad and  easy to meet and, as a result, believes that unaffiliated offices do not exist.  Labor suggests that because we rely on a survey of states to collect the   information, the data are most likely the result of a misunderstanding on  the part of survey respondents. In conducting our work, we followed  generally accepted government auditing standards. We developed the  survey instrument based on a questionnaire used in previous studies, and,  for this study, we pretested it with state WIA administrators from five  states to ensure that it was easily understandable, unambiguous, and  unbiased. Furthermore, officials\u2019 responses to other questions confirmed  their understanding, and as part of our quality control, we followed up  with state officials when their responses were ambiguous. In one case, for  example, responses were ambiguous on the questions related to stand-  alone offices. We conducted a follow-up conversation with a state official  who confirmed that the states\u2019 stand-alone offices were not affiliated with  the one-stop system. We therefore believe that respondents understood  our questions and that our survey results are accurate. We stand by our  findings and our recommendation. Given that Labor reports requirements  to be affiliated with the one-stop system are easy to meet, we hope that  Labor will take steps to ensure that all states are meeting those  requirements.

We did not  survey the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories.  The survey included questions on states\u2019 one-stop delivery systems related  to the    numbers of local workforce investment areas and participants served;    numbers of comprehensive one-stop centers, satellite or affiliated sites,  and how these changed from program year 2003 to April 1, 2007;  infrastructure cost data for program year 2005;    use of stand-alone Employment Service offices;    mandatory programs and how these services were provided;    extent of integration of certain functions (e.g., reception area,  information systems, and intake forms) at comprehensive one-stop  centers; and    program monitoring of customer satisfaction.", "The questionnaire was forwarded to state officials in April 2007, and  responses were received through late May 2007. We received surveys from  all 50 states, although some states did not answer every question. States\u2019  survey responses were as of April 1, 2007. Because we administered the  survey to all 50 states, our results are not subject to sampling error.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  other types of errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For  example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted, or the  sources of information available to respondents in answering a question,  can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We included  steps in the development of the survey, the collection of data, and the  editing and analysis of data to minimize such nonsampling errors. To  reduce nonsampling error, the questionnaire was reviewed by survey  specialists and pretested with officials from 5 states to develop a  questionnaire that was relevant, easy to comprehend, unambiguous, and  unbiased. We made changes to the content and format of the questionnaire  based on the specialists\u2019 reviews and the results of the pretests. Completed  questionnaires were keypunched, and each record was verified by  comparing them with their corresponding questionnaires, and any errors  were corrected. When the data were analyzed, a second independent  analyst checked all computer programs. Finally, to assess the reliability of  certain data obtained from the survey, we independently researched the  information from other publicly available sources.", "In order to analyze trends in states\u2019 one-stop delivery systems, we  compared 2007 survey data with survey data from 2000 and 2001. In  addition to our surveys, we conducted a literature review to identify  relevant findings from other studies\u2014including those sponsored by  Labor\u2014that examined one-stop delivery systems.
