These requirements may include environmental mitigation practices outlined in BLM's best management practices policy. In some cases, operators may request exceptions to lease and permit requirements. GAO was asked to examine BLM's efforts to mitigate environmental impacts from oil and gas development.", "This report examines the extent to which BLM (1) approved requests for exceptions to lease and permit requirements and how these decisions were made and documented, (2) involved the public in the development of lease and permit requirements and in the approval of exception requests, and (3) implemented and assessed the effectiveness of its best management practices policy.

Oil and gas operators may request exceptions to a permit requirement, such as prohibition of drilling in an area during times of the year when certain wildlife are present. BLM may approve such a request\u2014allowing the operator to continue to drill during a portion of the normally prohibited time\u2014if, for instance, no wildlife are present. GAO's survey of 42 BLM offices found that fewer than half tracked data on exception requests. Additionally, GAO found that the process for considering these requests and documenting decisions varied. BLM does not have a policy requiring field offices to consistently track exception data or documented procedures specifying how requests should be considered and documented. Because BLM does not consistently track exception request data or have a consistent process for considering requests and clearly documenting decisions, BLM may be unable to provide reasonable assurance that it is meeting its environmental responsibilities.", "BLM has consistently involved the public in developing lease requirements and, to a lesser extent, permit requirements. For example, GAO reviewed 35 lease sales that occurred from calendar years 2012 through 2015 at the six field offices visited and found that in all cases the field offices provided the public an opportunity to review and comment on lease parcels to be offered for sale. BLM has not generally involved the public in the approval of exception requests. According to BLM's policy, public notification of an exception is not required unless granting it would result in a substantial modification or waiver of a lease requirement, which, according to BLM officials, rarely occurs.", "BLM has generally implemented its best management practices policy by including key practices as permit requirements, but it has not consistently documented inspections or used inspection data to assess the policy's effectiveness. The policy identifies four key practices that should be considered for inclusion as permit requirements in nearly all circumstances: (1) painting facilities to blend with the environment, (2) constructing roads to certain BLM standards, (3) implementing interim reclamation, and (4) completing final reclamation. During file reviews at six BLM field offices, GAO found that at least one of the four key practices was included as a permit requirement in almost all of the 109 files reviewed. However, in reviewing documentation of inspections, GAO found that documents were not consistent and not always sufficient to determine whether BLM had verified key practices. GAO further found that BLM generally does not use data collected from inspections to assess the effectiveness of permit requirements in mitigating environmental impacts. BLM does not have guidance specifying how inspections should be documented and how inspection data should be used. Without sufficiently detailed documentation of inspections and effective use of data from inspections, BLM is unable to fully assess the effectiveness of its best management practices policy to mitigate environmental impacts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that BLM develop a policy for tracking and documenting exceptions.

The process is illustrated in figure  1.", "FLPMA requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop land use plans  and, when appropriate, revise them. The plans identify, among other  things, federal land and mineral resources that will be available for oil and  gas development and other activities. As part of developing or revising  land use plans, BLM is required under the National Environmental Policy  Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, to evaluate likely environmental  impacts of proposed actions in the plan, such as developing oil and gas  resources in certain areas. Generally, BLM prepares an environmental  impact statement\u2014a detailed analysis of the likely environmental effects  of a proposed action\u2014in preparing a land use plan. However, depending  on the anticipated level of public interest and potential for significant  impacts, BLM may instead develop an environmental assessment\u2014a  more concise analysis developed for an amendment to the plan. BLM  officials said the agency uses the land use plans and environmental  impact statements to (1) help develop reasonably foreseeable  development scenarios to estimate outcomes, such as the number of  wells to be involved and the surface disturbance that may occur under the  land use plan; (2) identify land open and closed to leasing; (3) identify  resource protection measures, such as lease requirements and  environmental best management practices; and (4) establish monitoring  protocols. BLM develops land use plans over several years. During a  plan\u2019s development, BLM coordinates with state and local governments  and collaborates with stakeholders, including oil and gas operators,  nongovernmental organizations, and state wildlife agencies, and provides  multiple opportunities for comment by the public. Comments can address  such topics as criteria for granting exceptions to lease requirements and  the appropriateness of best management practices.", "Once a land use plan is completed, BLM holds a lease sale. Operators  may purchase a lease for land identified by the land use plan as available  for oil and gas development. As part of this phase, BLM generally  conducts an environmental assessment to determine whether the  proposed development is likely to significantly impact the environment.  In the assessment, BLM can propose applying lease requirements that  were identified in the land use plan, where many of the requirements are  intended to protect the environment. For example, a lease requirement  may state that an operator cannot drill within a specified distance of a  raptor\u2019s nest during its breeding season. BLM allows the public to review  and comment on draft environmental assessments for lease sales,  including proposed lease requirements. In addition, the public may protest  a lease before it is offered for sale. When a lease is offered for sale, the  lease requirements identified through the environmental assessment are  included as requirements for holding the lease.", "Operators that have obtained a lease must submit to BLM a drilling permit  application and obtain BLM\u2019s approval before drilling any new oil or gas  wells.

According to BLM  officials, these permit requirements are generally attached to ensure  environmental protection, safety, or conservation of mineral resources  and may be based on environmental best management practices,  described below. While BLM notifies the public that an operator has  submitted a drilling permit application, BLM may or may not require public  comment on the associated NEPA analysis. According to BLM\u2019s NEPA  Handbook, the type of public involvement required when an  environmental assessment is prepared is at the discretion of the decision  maker and can include public notification before or during preparation of  the environmental assessment, among other types of involvement.

We found that 2 of the 6 field offices required operators to use a standardized form when requesting an exception, while the remaining offices received requests via a letter or sundry notice. In reviewing files, we found that there was more complete information about the request in offices using a standardized form for exception requests. For example, one of the forms required  information on the permit or lease requirement involved, a description  of the proposed exception to the requirement, and the justification for  the request. In other offices that did not have a standardized form,  information on the operator requests varied. In some cases the  operator provided a detailed explanation of the request, whereas in  other instances little information was provided other than that an  exception was requested.", "Lease versus permit requirements. BLM officials in all 6 field offices told us that they make minimal distinction between lease and permit requirements when reviewing exception requests. Knowing which requirement is at issue is necessary to determine the applicable exception criteria. When reviewing BLM files, we found that sometimes documentation in the file clearly indicated the exception request was related to a permit requirement, whereas other times it was unclear whether the request related to a permit or lease requirement. Without clear documentation in the file indicating whether the request is for a permit or lease requirement, it may be difficult to identify what exception criteria, if any, apply to the request.", "Written exception policy. We found that 3 of the 6 BLM field offices had a written policy for processing exception requests. These policies, according to BLM officials, were developed to provide greater specificity about the exception process. According to BLM officials at 1 of the offices with a written policy, having a written policy helps them communicate expectations to operators for how exception requests will be considered.", "Internal checklist. We found that 2 of the 6 field offices employed an internal checklist for processing exceptions, though an official in 1 of the offices stated that staff used it inconsistently. In 1 of these offices, the checklist details a sequential review process where signatures and comments are made by the relevant decision makers. Specifically, the form requires input from BLM\u2019s project lead and wildlife biologist, state fish and game officials, and the BLM field office manager. In completing the checklist, officials are to identify the applicable criteria for considering the request and describe whether there is any biological benefit for the proposed action. The field office manager receives the checklist after relevant input has been made by BLM staff and then completes a signature box on the form for granting, denying, partially granting, or not concurring. Space is also  provided for the field office manager to provide an explanation of the  decision. In contrast, other offices did not have a standardized form  for considering the request and approved or denied the request via  sundry notice without an explanation. In these instances, BLM\u2019s actual  process for considering the request was unclear.", "Compensatory mitigation. We found that 1 of the 6 field offices frequently requires compensatory mitigation when approving an exception. This means that if the field office grants an exception, it requires the operator to take some other action to mitigate the environmental impacts of the exception. According to BLM officials, the office has developed a standard practice of requiring operators to improve 25 acres of habitat for each approved month of an exception to a wildlife-related seasonal drilling limitation. According to these officials, this practice was developed over time. BLM officials also told us that allowing year-round drilling for certain projects could minimize disturbance to wildlife by allowing drilling to be completed sooner. For example, a project might have taken 3 years to complete if seasonal permit drilling requirements were in effect, whereas it might take 1 1/2 years to complete if BLM approves an exception to seasonal drilling permit requirements.", "Resource management plan exception criteria. We found that the primary resource management plan for all 6 BLM field offices we visited had generally identified criteria for granting exceptions, in accordance with BLM\u2019s November 2007 policy. However, the specificity of the criteria varied. One of the resource management plans we reviewed included very specific exception criteria for a number of lease and permit requirements. For example, the plan describes lease requirements related to a type of habitat used by birds for mating. It specifically states that surface disturbance is prohibited or restricted within a 1/4 mile perimeter of the habitat, if occupied. The plan then identifies the particular conditions under which BLM may approve an exception request. Specifically, the plan states that BLM may approve the exception if it is determined that the \u201caction is of a scale, sited in a location, or otherwise designed so that the action will not impair the function and suitability of sharp-tailed grouse breeding habitat.\u201d In contrast, another resource management plan includes less specific criteria for granting exceptions. The plan states that exception requests from seasonal lease and permit requirements will be coordinated with the state wildlife agency and that requests are to be analyzed and documented individually for compliance with the resource management plan and NEPA. However, the plan further states that \u201cthere is no clear formula\u201d for arriving at these biological recommendations. In addition, the plan does not  include specific information on any particular lease or permit  restriction; rather, the plan lays out a variety of factors to consider,  such as weather.", "In reviewing a nongeneralizable sample of 54 exception decisions made  in fiscal years 2009 through 2015 at the 4 field offices that could provide  us with data, we found that documentation of exception decisions  varied. We examined each file for a range of information, including (1)  documentation on the operator\u2019s request for the exception, (2) whether  the exception request related to a lease or permit requirement, (3)  whether the exception criteria were specified, (4) the basis for the field  office\u2019s decision, and (5) how the decision was communicated to the  operator. We found that of the 54 exception decisions reviewed, 27 were  well documented, 20 were partially documented, and 7 were not well  documented. While BLM has some written guidance on considering and  documenting exception requests, it may not result in BLM staff  documenting exception decisions fully or clearly because the November  2007 guidance does not specify the format for documenting the exception  requests and decisions. We found that the checklist used for considering  and documenting exception decisions employed in 1 of the field offices  provided an effective means to consistently and clearly document the  decision making process.

However, the field offices  generally do not post the information electronically on BLM\u2019s public  website. According to representatives of environmentally related  nongovernmental organizations, when BLM does not make this  information available on a website, it is difficult for the public to track  potential drilling activities and comment.", "Once a drilling permit application is received, BLM field offices complete  an environmental assessment to assess the potential environmental  impacts of the proposed development. As part of this process, the agency  can develop permit requirements, which are intended to mitigate  environmental impacts. In 2014, BLM began implementing a website  called ePlanning through which BLM field offices are required to make  environmental assessments associated with drilling permits (among other  documents) available to the public. Prior to the use of ePlanning, the  public could not access drilling permit environmental assessments on a  centralized site, although officials from 2 of the field offices we visited  stated that they previously posted some limited information about the  environmental assessments on their individual field office websites.  According to BLM policy, BLM\u2019s ePlanning website is intended to  standardize the agency\u2019s land use planning documents and allow public  access to NEPA documents, including environmental assessments  completed as part of the oil and gas permitting process. According to  BLM\u2019s ePlanning implementation plan, when the plan is fully  implemented, BLM offices will be required to post all NEPA documents on  the site within 1 week of completion and must include all associated draft  and final documents. Documents posted to ePlanning must be updated  within 1 week of any status change. According to a BLM official  responsible for overseeing the implementation of ePlanning, while the  agency expects the site to be fully implemented by late 2017, the  remaining implementation steps involve internal, technical changes to the  system. The official stated that the aspects of the site that are accessible  to the public are \u201cfully functional\u201d at this time, meaning that BLM offices  are currently posting all NEPA-related documents to the site.", "Officials from all of the 6 field offices we visited stated that their office  posts environmental assessments related to oil and gas permits to  ePlanning when they are final. However, officials from only 1 of the 6 field  offices stated that their office makes a draft version of the environmental  assessment available online; officials from the other 5 stated they post a  draft version of the environmental assessment only sometimes. Officials  from 4 of these offices explained that they would post a draft if  development in the area was likely to be of substantial public interest. For  example, BLM officials stated that proposed development near a national  park or a populated area may warrant increased public involvement.  Again, representatives of environmentally related nongovernmental  organizations stated that, in some cases, it is difficult to identify and  comment on proposed drilling activities.

According to BLM\u2019s policy, public notification is not required  unless granting an exception would result in a substantial modification or  waiver of a lease requirement. According to BLM officials, this is seldom  the case, particularly if the exception criteria are outlined in the land use  plan. According to a BLM official, one circumstance in which the public  could be involved is when an operator requests an exception at the time a  drilling permit is requested. In this circumstance, the public may be able  to submit comments on BLM\u2019s environmental assessment for the permit,  depending on the scale of the proposed drilling project. However, BLM  officials from all 6 offices we visited stated that public involvement in  exception requests was infrequent. BLM officials stated that in many  cases public involvement may not be practical. For example, an operator  may experience drilling complications and need an exception to drill 1 or  2 additional days beyond a seasonal deadline. BLM officials stated that in  such cases, it would be impractical to solicit public input given the need to  respond to the operator\u2019s request promptly. Additionally, BLM officials  stated that if they are making a decision in accordance with exception  criteria in the lease or permit developed through the NEPA process,  public involvement is not required.", "Representatives of environmentally related nongovernmental  organizations told us that they typically do not comment on exception  request decisions because BLM generally does not notify, or solicit input  from, the public when determining whether to grant an exception. Several  representatives told us their organizations focus their efforts on providing  comments related to lease and permit requirements early in the oil and  gas development process. For example, several representatives told us  their organizations provide the majority of their input when BLM is  developing its resource management plans or identifying lease parcels for  sale. One representative said that the organization rarely finds out when  operators have been granted exceptions and so at times believe  incorrectly that lease and permit requirements are in effect. One  representative told us that the representative\u2019s organization attempted to  develop informal agreements with certain BLM field offices whereby BLM  staff would notify the organization when an exception request was  submitted. However, according to the representative, the organization  was unable to develop such agreements. Another organization\u2019s  representative stated that BLM and operators often agree to an exception  verbally and document the decision afterwards, precluding any  opportunity for public comment. This representative noted that some  exceptions, such as those that allow an additional 1 or 2 days of work,  might not warrant comments. However, the representative stated that if  an exception request were made for a more significant activity, such as a  road proposal for an area that has a no surface occupancy requirement,  the organization would like the opportunity to provide comments. A  representative of an oil and gas industry association stated that operators  make requests in accordance with criteria laid out in leases and permits  and that the exception process is a key part of BLM\u2019s adaptive  management policy, which attempts to provide for a flexible management  approach based on current resource conditions.", "Of the 6 BLM field offices we visited, only 1 made information about  exception decisions available to the public, both in the office and on its  website.

Officials described the best  management practices policy as being flexible to accommodate a wide  range of site-specific conditions found across the areas where BLM  oversees oil and gas development.

Additionally, according to BLM field office  officials, some field offices have developed their own best management  practices. BLM officials told us that more recently issued resource  management plans typically include an appendix listing best management  practices. In examining the most recently issued resource management  plans for the field offices we visited, we found that four of six field offices  had plans that included a best management practices appendix. The  other two field offices are in the process of updating their resource  management plans. In reviewing the plans that contained best  management practices appendixes, we found that the amount of  information they contained varied. For example, one plan included over  80 pages of suggested best management practices, while another plan  included information on best management practices that totaled fewer  than 20 pages.", "BLM field office officials stated that the extent to which best management  practices are attached as BLM permit requirements, or included in an  operator\u2019s plan, varies. Officials told us that some companies are more  proactive and include best management practices in their plans, whereas  other companies rely on BLM to identify such practices. BLM staff from  one field office stated that discussion about best management practices  typically occurs when BLM officials visit a proposed drilling site. During  such visits, BLM officials and the operator will discuss the proposed plan,  and BLM staff will highlight practices they anticipate would be effective in  mitigating environmental impacts. The operator may then elect to  voluntarily include these practices in the proposed plan, or BLM may  include them as permit requirements.", "A representative from an association of oil and gas operators stated that  BLM\u2019s best management practices policy is generally successful because  the BLM field offices have the flexibility to determine which practices to  require. Additionally, the representative told us that many best  management practices are initially developed by operators. The  representative stated that operators may try various approaches for  mitigating environmental impacts of oil and gas development, and when  they identify a practice that works, BLM will often adopt it as a best  management practice and require other operators to implement it as well.  The representative cautioned that the feasibility and effectiveness of  practices greatly depends on the local topography and geology. For  example, one best management practice is to bury temporary liquid  gathering lines used to transport fluids away from a drill site, thereby  reducing visual impacts to the landscape. However, in certain areas, this  is not an effective approach to protecting the environment because the  area has very little topsoil and would require digging through rocks to bury  the lines. Such digging, according to the representative, could result in  longer-term impacts to the environment than leaving the gathering lines  on the surface.", "Representatives from environmentally focused nongovernmental  organizations offered a mixed view of best management practices. Some  representatives stated that it was beneficial for operators to employ these  practices. Another representative pointed out that the easier a best  management practice is, the more likely it is to be implemented. For  example, painting a storage tank to blend in with the environment is  relatively easy and commonly implemented, whereas certain practices  related to drilling\u2014such as conducting horizontal or directional drilling to  reduce surface disturbance\u2014are more complex and may not be used as  often. A representative from another environmental organization stated  that BLM applies best management practices in a sporadic and  nonrigorous manner and that the bureau appears to treat these practices  as a menu from which operators can select the ones they would like to  implement.

For example, we  observed some inspection documents using the narrative format that  consisted of two lines of general remarks that did not identify whether  implementation of the four key practices had been verified. In contrast, we  found that the checklist format typically resulted in greater assurance that  the four key practices were verified. For example, we found that the four  key practices were verified in 64 of 65 (98 percent) inspection documents  when the checklist format was used, versus 15 of 62 (24 percent)  documents when only the narrative format was used. In some cases, we  observed a version of the checklist format that included an additional  check to indicate whether all permit requirements were verified during the  inspection. The use of this check provided assurance that the inspector  had verified all permit requirements that applied to that well, rather than  only the requirements listed on the checklist. Appendix II contains  templates of the three formats.", "BLM\u2019s guidance for documenting inspections does not clearly indicate  which forms are required to document environmental inspections.

However, at another point, the guidance states that only  the narrative format must be used for environmental inspections.", "During interviews with BLM officials responsible for conducting  environmental inspections, we found that officials did not have a common  understanding of the requirements for documenting inspections. For  example, an official at one field office stated that, when conducting  environmental inspections, he uses the narrative format and does not use  the checklist format. Officials at another field office stated that they  complete both formats but do not always print a copy of the narrative  format for the hard copy file, which is BLM\u2019s official record. Officials at  another field office stated they received conflicting instructions about  which documentation format to use. According to the officials, at one  point, the field office used a version of the checklist format and received  guidance from BLM\u2019s Washington Office that they should instead be  using the narrative format in AFMSS. However, the officials stated that  the following year, they received instruction from the Washington Office  stating that both formats are required to document environmental  inspections. As a result of the conflicting instructions, at the time of our  visit, officials said they were unsure of the requirements for documenting  environmental inspections.", "BLM is in the process of developing updates to its AFMSS database,  which a BLM official stated will include more detailed forms for  documenting environmental inspections and the ability to electronically  document inspections from the field. Specifically, BLM officials stated that  one planned update will replace the existing narrative format for  documenting environmental inspections with a checklist format similar to  the one described above. In addition, BLM is continuing its effort to  develop a mobile computing solution as part of its AFMSS update. The  mobile computing solution would allow BLM employees to remotely  document environmental inspections when in the field. According to  BLM\u2019s lead point of contact for the development of these AFMSS  updates, BLM is currently evaluating different devices to determine which  one will best meet the agency\u2019s needs. BLM officials stated that the  updates are projected to be implemented by the end of 2017.", "We also found that some BLM field office employees may not have  received training on how to document environmental inspections. BLM  offers a limited number of voluntary classroom training courses but does  not require training for BLM officials responsible for conducting  environmental inspections. Some officials responsible for conducting  environmental inspections stated that they have been unable to attend  the voluntary training because funding to travel to the training was not  approved. Some BLM field office officials stated that, in the absence of  required training or the necessary funds to attend voluntary training, they  rely on on-the-job training. An official from one field office stated that new  employees must rely on training received from a mentor, who may not  have attended classroom training recently or at all. In our 2016 report on  Interior\u2019s human capital challenges, we found that Interior\u2019s bureaus,  including BLM, have not evaluated their oil and gas staff\u2019s training needs  or the effectiveness of the training provided to key oil and gas staff, and  we recommended that Interior annually evaluate its bureaus\u2019 training  programs.

Funding for the training is also under  consideration. Currently, BLM headquarters funds training for the existing  inspector certification courses, while funding for training those conducting  environmental inspections is allocated by field office managers. The BLM  official responsible for training stated that, as a result, funding challenges  can impact the consistency of training across the agency. If BLM  headquarters funded the new training, it could reduce the funding  challenges field office managers currently face. The official further stated  that if the training was successfully implemented, it should ensure greater  consistency and thoroughness of environmental inspections. However, in  December 2016, a BLM official stated that BLM does not have a policy  that would require employees to attend the redesigned training.

As a result, a report on the self-assessment  recommended that BLM update or issue policy about monitoring the  effectiveness of best management practices. According to BLM officials,  the agency implemented this recommendation by issuing a monitoring  inspection policy in 2009. The policy requires BLM field offices with oil  and gas management responsibilities to conduct monitoring inspections in  accordance with CEQ regulations. BLM\u2019s policy states that monitoring is  conducted to assess actual or potential environmental impacts, determine  whether BLM standards are being met, and evaluate whether permit  requirements (which could include best management practices) are  effective to achieve their desired intent. To ensure the agency\u2019s  compliance with the CEQ requirements, BLM\u2019s policy requires BLM field  offices to report the number of completed monitoring inspections.", "BLM officials from all of the six field offices we visited stated that their  field office conducts some type of monitoring activities.

Because BLM\u2019s  AFMSS database is unable to track monitoring inspections, the 2009  policy required officials to report the number of monitoring inspections in  BLM\u2019s PMDS. We found that two of the field offices we visited did not  report numbers of monitoring inspections in the PMDS from fiscal years  2010 through 2015. Officials from one of these field offices explained that  they require operators to conduct monitoring through third-party  contractors, and the officials did not believe the activities should be  reported because the monitoring was not conducted by BLM employees.  Officials from the other field office stated that they conducted monitoring  inspections and tracked these inspections using their own internal  spreadsheets.", "BLM\u2019s 2009 monitoring policy includes an attachment that provides  guidance on how to interpret and implement the policy. The attachment  provides examples of the types of activities that could be considered  monitoring inspections, including conducting wildlife surveys, conducting  habitat restoration surveys, and determining the status of interim  reclamation. The attachment also explains how a monitoring inspection  differs from an environmental inspection. For example, in assessing  interim reclamation, an environmental inspection would verify whether the  operator seeded a disturbed area according to permit requirements, while  a monitoring inspection would collect data to assess whether the seeding  was successful. The attachment states that, in some cases, a visit to a  particular inspection site could count as both an environmental inspection  and a monitoring inspection, depending on the activities completed.", "However, we found that despite this guidance, officials at the six field  offices we visited varied in their approaches to conducting monitoring and  did not share a common understanding of what types of activities  constitute a monitoring inspection. For example, officials from one field  office stated that they consider inspections related to air or water quality  to be monitoring inspections, while officials from another field office stated  that they consider inspections related to reclamation of plugged and  abandoned wells to be monitoring inspections. Officials from a third field  office stated that they plan to consider inspections of plugged and  abandoned wells to be monitoring inspections, but in prior years, the field  office had considered all environmental inspections as monitoring  inspections. Some BLM field office officials stated they were unsure of the  difference between a monitoring inspection and an environmental  inspection. BLM employees responsible for conducting monitoring  inspections are also responsible for conducting environmental  inspections. As previously noted, BLM has only voluntary classroom  training for these employees, and some employees have had only on-the- job training because of barriers to attending the voluntary training that  BLM currently offers.", "We also found that BLM field offices generally do not use the data  collected from monitoring inspections to assess the effectiveness of lease  and permit requirements, including best management practices, at  mitigating environmental impacts. Although BLM\u2019s 2009 monitoring policy  requires that field offices track the number of monitoring inspections  completed, it does not provide guidance on how data collected during  monitoring inspections should be tracked or used. As a result, according  to BLM officials, monitoring inspection data are captured in a variety of  formats, including monitoring reports submitted by operators, agency  databases, and spreadsheets. In addition, although officials from five of  the six BLM field offices we visited stated that their field office has access  to monitoring data, officials from four of the field offices stated they  generally have not used the data to assess the effectiveness of mitigation  measures. Officials at one field office stated that collecting and  maintaining monitoring data is at the discretion of individual BLM  employees, while officials from another field office stated that they were  unaware of any efforts to use monitoring data to assess the effectiveness  of mitigation. Officials from two field offices stated that while they have  access to monitoring data, they are unable to analyze the data because  of its format or the office\u2019s system for tracking the data. Both of the two  field offices where officials described using monitoring data described  mechanisms for tracking the data, which included databases and a series  of electronic spreadsheets. In particular, one of the two offices was using  a database to track interim and final reclamation efforts and was able to  generate reports based on a variety of criteria to assess the status of  reclamation.", "Representatives from environmentally focused nongovernmental  organizations and an association of oil and gas operators stated that,  from their perspective, BLM may not fully assess the effectiveness of best  management practices. For example, a representative from one  nongovernmental organization stated that the analysis of the  effectiveness of the best management practices is sometimes conducted  by operators, so the quality of the data and the conclusions are  questionable. In addition, he stated that he was unaware of any analysis  comparing the environmental impact of projects that use best  management practices with the impact of projects that do not. Another  representative stated that from his perspective monitoring seemed to be a  low priority for BLM. A representative from an association of oil and gas  operators stated that in some instances BLM requires operators to  conduct surveys and provide the agency with survey data, but the agency  does not always use the data provided to assess the effectiveness of best  management practices.", "When BLM field offices are unable to effectively use data collected during  monitoring inspections, the agency cannot leverage these inspections to  assess the effectiveness of its mitigation efforts, including its best  management practices policy, in accordance with the purpose of its 2009  monitoring policy. Providing guidance to the field offices on how  monitoring data should be used could enhance BLM\u2019s ability to assess  the effectiveness of its mitigation activities across the bureau. In addition,  as previously discussed, although BLM is redesigning its training for  employees responsible for conducting inspections, it does not currently  have a policy that would require employees to take the redesigned  training. Ensuring that staff have training could potentially improve BLM  employees\u2019 understanding of what types of activities should be included  as part of the agency\u2019s monitoring inspection program and improve the  consistency of reporting and documenting inspections. Improving BLM\u2019s  monitoring inspection program could allow the agency to better assess  environmental impacts of oil and gas development and the effectiveness  of efforts to mitigate such impacts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["BLM is responsible for managing oil and gas development on federal  lands while also mitigating the environmental impacts of such  development. BLM mitigates the impacts primarily through the  requirements that it places on the leases and permits it issues to  operators. It has also developed a best management practices policy, and  best management practices may be included as lease and permit  requirements. Operators can request exceptions to these requirements,  and BLM can decide to approve requests if certain criteria are met.", "However, BLM field offices have not tracked exception data consistently,  making it difficult to determine the extent to which they have approved  exception requests. Additionally, BLM staff across field offices are not  using a consistent process for considering and clearly documenting  exception decisions. Although BLM issued a policy in November 2007  stating that exception decisions should be fully documented, it does not  have documented procedures to ensure that field office decisions are  consistently and clearly documented. BLM could better quantify the extent  to which exceptions are approved and better ensure that such decisions  are consistent with its responsibilities under NEPA if it tracked exception  requests and had documented procedures for consistently considering  and clearly documenting exception decisions across its field offices.", "In addition, BLM does not currently require field offices to make the  results of its exception decisions available to the public. Without access to  this information, the public may not be able to provide substantive input  into BLM\u2019s future land use planning processes.", "Moreover, BLM field offices have generally implemented BLM\u2019s best  management practices policy but have not consistently documented  environmental inspections to verify that operators have implemented the  practices as required, in part because the guidance for documenting  inspections is unclear. Without consistently documenting that all permit  requirements are verified as implemented when conducting  environmental inspections, BLM field offices cannot provide assurance  that activities designed to mitigate environmental impacts have been  carried out by operators as required. In addition, documentation of  environmental inspections that is not sufficiently clear and accurate could  limit BLM\u2019s ability to take and uphold enforcement actions when needed.", "Further, BLM field offices have not effectively used monitoring inspection  data to assess the effectiveness of best management practices to  mitigate environmental impacts of oil and gas development.  Consequently, the agency may be limited in its ability to understand and  demonstrate the extent to which its lease and permit requirements have  successfully mitigated the environmental impacts of oil and gas  development. The agency is in the process of implementing training for  employees responsible for conducting environmental and monitoring  inspections, but it has not established a policy requiring employees to  complete this training. Without such a requirement, BLM cannot ensure  that employees understand how to carry out monitoring inspections, that  environmental inspection documents will be prepared consistently by field  office staff, or that the data will be used to assess the effectiveness of  best management practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Director of the Bureau of Land Management should take the  following six actions.  1.

Direct field offices to make the results of exception request decisions available to the public, such as on BLM\u2019s public website. 4. Clarify guidance related to documentation of environmental inspections to ensure that inspections are documented in a manner that indicates whether all permit requirements were checked as part of the inspection. 5. Provide additional guidance to field offices on how to collect and use data collected during monitoring inspections and, in doing so, determine and implement an approach for using the data to assess the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s mitigation efforts, including its best management practices. 6.

According to an attachment to  BLM\u2019s 2007 policy on exceptions, it is to fully document exception  decisions in the case file with the appropriate level of environmental  review. Interior stated that it is required to document exception decisions  in case files and that these files can be made available to the public upon  request. Interior further stated that database upgrades will improve  exception tracking and public posting in the future. In our review, we  found that BLM offices did not always document exception decisions. We  further found that these offices did not consistently track exception  decisions. As a result, the public may not be aware of the extent to which  exceptions are approved or the reasons for doing so.  Because the public  is an important stakeholder in the land use planning process, we believe  that BLM should strive to make this information available to the public to  enhance its ability to participate as BLM develops new land use planning  documents.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Specifically, this report  examines the extent to which BLM (1) approved requests for exceptions  from lease and permit requirements intended to mitigate environmental  impacts, and how these decisions were made and documented; (2)  involved the public in the development of lease and permit requirements  and in the approval of exception requests; and (3) implemented its best  management practices policy and assessed its effectiveness in mitigating  environmental impacts. Because of availability of data and the issuance  of policies, the time frames varied for each of the objectives.", "To conduct our work, for all three objectives, we reviewed relevant laws,  regulations, and BLM guidance. We also interviewed officials in BLM  headquarters and officials from a nongeneralizable sample of eight BLM  field offices (two of which were for scoping purposes to help formulate our  audit approach and not included in our file reviews) and the  corresponding four BLM state offices. We selected field offices based  primarily on (1) geographic variability and (2) oil and gas leasing and  permitting activity. Specifically, we visited and interviewed officials in two  BLM state offices (Colorado and Wyoming) and interviewed officials by  telephone in two additional offices (Utah and New Mexico). We also  visited and interviewed officials in seven BLM field offices (Carlsbad and  Farmington in New Mexico, Buffalo and Pinedale in Wyoming, White  River and Colorado River Valley in Colorado, and Vernal in Utah) and  interviewed an official by telephone in one additional office (Royal Gorge  in Colorado). In fiscal year 2014, the four states we selected accounted  for approximately 75 percent of producing federal leases and 85 percent  of approved drilling permits.", "To obtain additional perspectives on our three objectives, we interviewed  by telephone representatives from an oil and gas association  representing industry perspectives, seven environmentally related  nongovernmental organizations, and four state wildlife agencies  corresponding with the BLM state and field offices we visited.", "To learn about available BLM data and BLM\u2019s decision making related to  exceptions, waivers, and modifications, we conducted a survey,  interviewed agency officials, and completed a file review of a  nongeneralizable sample of exception decisions. We electronically  surveyed BLM officials responsible for 52 BLM offices with oil and gas  activity to determine the extent to which BLM approved requests for  exceptions to lease and permit requirements, and how these decisions  were made and documented for fiscal years 2005 through 2015. We sent  the questionnaire by e-mail in an attached Microsoft Word form that  respondents could return electronically after marking checkboxes or  entering responses in blank spaces. In an e-mail in advance of the  questionnaire, we asked the official at each land unit if he or she was the  correct respondent, and, if not, we asked for a referral to the official who  was. We sent the questionnaire with a cover letter on March 1, 2016. We  telephoned all respondents who had not returned the questionnaire after  approximately 2 weeks and again after 4 weeks and asked them to  participate. We received completed responses from officials responsible  for 42 BLM offices in the field, which constituted an 81-percent response  rate. The survey asked about available data on exceptions, waivers, and  modifications from lease stipulations and drilling permit conditions of  approval. In instances in which field offices had the data, we requested  that they be e-mailed to us. Because the data were tracked inconsistently  and BLM officials made statements indicating uncertainty about the  completeness of the data, we determined the data were not sufficiently  reliable for use to generate summary statistics on exception decisions  across the bureau.", "Additionally, to learn about the exception process, we used a  semistructured interview guide to interview BLM officials in four state  offices (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico) and BLM officials in  six field offices (Carlsbad and Farmington in New Mexico; Buffalo and  Pinedale in Wyoming; Colorado River Valley in Colorado, and Vernal in  Utah). To complete our file review, we used exception data provided by  field offices to select a nongeneralizable sample of well files that included  exception decisions. Specifically, at the six field offices included in our file  review (Carlsbad and Farmington in New Mexico, Buffalo and Pinedale in  Wyoming, Colorado River Valley in Colorado, and Vernal in Utah), we  selected a nongeneralizable sample of approximately 10 files per office  using the exception data field offices had sent to us as part of our survey.  We selected these files based on fiscal year and the operator making the  request to obtain a range of requests over time. Four of the six offices  provided us data, while the remaining two were unable to do so. At the  four offices that provided us data, we selected a nongeneralizable sample  of 44 files from fiscal years 2009 through 2015. These 44 files included 54  exception requests. We then examined the files to see whether the  decision was reasonably documented. This included examining (1) how  the request was made; (2) who at BLM reviewed the request; (3) what the  applicable BLM criteria were, if any; (4) whether BLM provided an  explanation of its decision; and (5) how BLM communicated the decision  to the operator. In many instances, the well files were not complete. The  initial assessment on the reasonableness of the documentation was  made by one analyst and subsequently reviewed and verified by a  separate analyst. When a discrepancy occurred, source documents were  examined, and the assessment was discussed. We determined that the  process of assessing the reasonableness of the documentation of BLM\u2019s  exception decisions based on the available source documentation in the  well file rendered the findings of the review to be sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. Because we examined this issue at six field offices, our  findings are not representative of all BLM field offices.", "To examine the extent to which BLM involved the public in the  development of lease and permit requirements and associated exception  requests, we analyzed lease sale documents, conducted follow-up on our  semistructured interviews with BLM field office officials, reviewed relevant  BLM policies and guidance, and interviewed BLM\u2019s program contact for  its ePlanning initiative. Specifically, we reviewed environmental  assessments and other lease sale documents obtained from BLM\u2019s public  website that were associated with lease sales held during calendar years  2012 through 2015 by the six field offices included our review. We  reviewed the environmental assessments to determine whether public  comments had been solicited and if any provided comments related to  proposed lease requirements. We reviewed available documentation\u2014for  example, protest letters from the public or BLM\u2019s responses to such  letters\u2014to determine whether an opportunity for public protest had been  made available. To assess the reliability of the lease sale data used for  this analysis, we confirmed with BLM state office officials the number of  lease sales held by each office during the scope of our review. We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In  addition, we conducted follow-up with BLM field office officials to clarify  semistructured interview responses related to opportunities for public  involvement at various stages of the development of permit requirements.  To examine the extent to which the public was involved in BLM\u2019s  decisions to grant exceptions to lease or permit requirements, we  interviewed BLM officials at the six BLM field offices we visited using our  semistructured interview guide. We also asked questions related to this  during our interviews with representatives from an oil and gas  association, environmentally related nongovernmental organizations, and  state wildlife agencies.", "To examine the extent to which BLM implemented its best management  practices policy and assessed its effectiveness to mitigate environmental  impacts, we interviewed key program contacts regarding their roles in  overseeing BLM\u2019s oil and gas program, best management practices, and  ongoing initiatives related to the Automated Fluid Minerals Support  System (AFMSS) and employee training. We also used a semistructured  interview guide to interview BLM officials in the selected four state offices  and six field offices. We also conducted a file review at the six field offices  we visited and reviewed monitoring inspection data from BLM\u2019s  Performance Management Data System (PMDS), both described in detail  below. In addition, we reviewed relevant BLM policies and guidance. The  purpose of our file review for this objective was to identify the extent to  which selected BLM well files included best management practices as  permit requirements and contained documentation that BLM had verified  operators\u2019 implementation of the requirements when conducting  environmental inspections.", "To design the methodology for our file review, we (1) identified best  practices to include in the scope of our review, (2) developed a data  collection instrument, and (3) identified a random sample of well files.  Because many best management practices are site-specific, we chose to  limit our review to four key practices, described in our report, that BLM  policy states should be considered in nearly all circumstances. To  develop a data collection instrument, we developed a hard copy form to  be used when reviewing each file. This form included fields to document  whether the team was able to review the file, whether the four key  practices were identified as permit requirements, and whether the four  key practices were verified as part of the environmental inspections  documented in the file. Following our initial implementation of the file  review during our first field office site visit, we confirmed that the data  collection instrument functioned as designed. To identify a random  sample of well files, we used data from BLM\u2019s AFMSS on approved  permits from fiscal year 2006 through 2015. To assess the reliability of  the AFMSS data, we interviewed BLM officials and found that the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Using these criteria, we  generated a random sample of well files for each of the six BLM field  offices included in our review. At each field office, we worked down the  randomly ordered list of sampled files to review as many files as possible  within the available time. In total, we reviewed 109 files, which included  152 inspection documents. Although this sample is not generalizable to  BLM field offices as a whole, it is a statistically unbiased picture of the six  field offices we visited.", "When conducting the file review at each office, two team members  reviewed the files, using the prepared data collection instrument, for the  allotted period of time. Next, the team members exchanged the files and  completed data collection instruments to review the completed forms  against the source material. To the extent that discrepancies were noted,  the analysts consulted the source documentation onsite and came to  agreement regarding the most accurate coding for that circumstance. In  some cases, the underlying documentation was limited. For example, in  some cases documentation of environmental inspections consisted of a  short narrative, and the analysts were required to interpret the narrative to  determine whether the four key best management practices were  reviewed as part of the inspection. Consequently, there may have been  some instances in which another person might have interpreted the  source documentation to come to a different conclusion. While this is  noted as a limitation, we determined that the process of verifying the file  review data collection instruments against the source documentation  rendered the findings of the file review to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "We also reviewed data from BLM\u2019s PMDS related to monitoring  inspections. We asked BLM headquarters to provide us with PMDS  monitoring data for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. We chose this time  frame to coincide with BLM\u2019s monitoring policy, which was implemented  in fiscal year 2010. The data indicated the number of monitoring  inspections reported by BLM cost centers. BLM cost centers represent  organizational units, such as field or district offices. We reviewed the  PMDS data to determine whether the six field offices included in our  review had reported monitoring inspections in fiscal years 2010 through  2015. In completing this review, we identified certain cost centers that  were identified as a program division rather than a field or district office.  As a result, it was unclear whether the inspections reported by such cost  centers could potentially be associated with one of the offices included in  our review. In order to ensure the accuracy of our analysis of the data, we  conducted follow-up with officials from each of the six BLM field offices.  We provided the PMDS data for all cost centers in the state appropriate  for the field office and identified which lines of data we identified as  having been reported by the field office. We asked the officials to confirm  whether our interpretation of the data was accurate. Officials from four of  the offices confirmed that our interpretation was accurate. Officials from  one field office identified data reported by their office that we had not  identified during our analysis. An official from the remaining office thought  that the office had reported monitoring inspections during fiscal years  2010 through 2015 but could not identify inspections associated with the  office in the provided data. On the basis of our analysis, we found the  data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 to April 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
