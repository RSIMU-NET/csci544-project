Specifically, GAO found that DHS and GSA had not conducted a comprehensive assessment of current needs, identified capability gaps, or evaluated and prioritized alternatives that would help officials adapt consolidation plans to changing conditions and address funding issues as reflected in leading practices. GAO recommended that DHS and GSA conduct various assessments and analyses and use the results to inform updated DHS headquarters consolidation plans. The agencies concurred with this recommendation.", "In its September 2014 report, GAO also found that DHS and GSA cost and schedule estimates for the headquarters consolidation project at St. Elizabeths did not conform or, only minimally or partially conformed, with leading estimating practices, and were therefore unreliable. Thus, GAO recommended that DHS and GSA develop revised cost and schedule estimates for the remaining portions of the consolidation project in accordance with leading practices, and the agencies concurred with this recommendation.", "The DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015, enacted in April 2016 would, according to the accompanying Senate committee report, ensure that DHS and GSA fully address the recommendations from GAO's September 2014 report and provide Congress the information needed to make sound decisions regarding the project. Among other things, the Act required DHS, in coordination with GSA, to submit information to Congress, including various assessments and updated cost and schedule estimates related to the DHS headquarters consolidation. As of April 2018, however, DHS and GSA had not submitted the information to Congress that would either meet the requirements of the Act or address GAO's recommendations. DHS and GSA officials cited funding instability as one challenge to updating consolidation plans and cost and schedule estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other things, GAO recommended in its September 2014 report that DHS and GSA develop revised DHS headquarters plans that reflect leading practices for capital decision making and also reliable cost and schedule estimates.

The  multi-billion dollar construction project, managed by DHS and the General  Services Administration (GSA), is the centerpiece of DHS\u2019s larger effort  to manage and consolidate its workforce of over 20,000 in the National  Capital Region. As conceived in 2006, the federally owned St. Elizabeths  site was designed to consolidate DHS\u2019s executive leadership, operational  management, and other personnel at one secure location rather than at  multiple locations throughout the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.  The St. Elizabeths project is intended to allow for more efficient DHS  operations and provide long-term cost savings by reducing reliance on  leased space. From fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2014, the St.  Elizabeths consolidation project had received approximately $495 million  through DHS appropriations and approximately $1.1 billion through GSA  appropriations, for a total of over $1.5 billion. However, since  construction began in fiscal year 2009, the project has generally received  less funding than requested, which DHS and GSA officials have stated  has led to cost escalations and schedule delays. The President\u2019s fiscal  year 2019 budget requests a total of about $400 million for continued  consolidation and new development funds for the project.", "In September 2014, we made three recommendations to improve the  management of DHS headquarters consolidation, and DHS and GSA  concurred with the recommendations.", "In 2014, we recommended that:  1.  DHS and GSA conduct the following assessments and use the results  to inform updated DHS headquarters consolidation plans: a comprehensive needs assessment and gap analysis of current  and needed capabilities that take into consideration changing  conditions; and an alternatives analysis that identifies the costs and benefits of  leasing and construction alternatives for the remainder of the  project and prioritizes options to account for funding instability.  2.  DHS and GSA develop revised cost and schedule estimates for the  remaining portions of the consolidation project that conform to GSA  guidance and leading practices for cost and schedule estimation,  including an independent evaluation of the estimates.  3.  DHS designate the headquarters consolidation program a major  acquisition, consistent with DHS acquisition policy, and apply DHS  acquisition policy requirements.", "In our September 2014 report, we further stated that Congress should  consider making future funding for the St. Elizabeths project contingent  upon DHS and GSA developing a revised headquarters consolidation  plan that conforms with leading practices and that (1) recognizes changes  in workplace standards, (2) identifies which components are to be  colocated at St. Elizabeths and in leased and owned space throughout  the National Capital Region, and (3) develops and provides reliable cost  and schedule estimates.", "Subsequently, in 2015, we designated our three recommendations to  DHS and GSA as \u201cPriority Recommendations\u201d due in part to the important  fiscal and operational implications of DHS headquarters consolidation. In  addition, we have designated the broader areas of Managing Federal  Real Property and Strengthening DHS Management Functions as High  Risk areas due to mismanagement vulnerabilities or a need for  transformation.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Headquarters  Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015, enacted in April 2016 would,  according to the accompanying Senate committee report, ensure that  DHS and GSA fully address the recommendations from our September  2014 report and provide Congress the additional information needed to  make sound decisions regarding the headquarters consolidation project.  Among other things, the Act requires DHS, in coordination with GSA, to  submit information to Congress about DHS headquarters consolidation  efforts not later than 120 days after enactment (enacted April 29, 2016).  Required information includes a comprehensive assessment of the  difference between the current real property and facilities needed by DHS  in the National Capital Region, an analysis that identifies the costs and  benefits of leasing and construction alternatives for the remainder of the  consolidation project, and updated cost and schedule estimates.  Furthermore, under the Act, the Comptroller General is to report on its  review and evaluation of the quality and reliability of the cost and  schedule estimates not later than 90 days after their submittal to  Congress. As of April 2018, DHS and GSA had not submitted the  required headquarters consolidation information to Congress or  implemented our related recommendations.", "Although DHS and GSA have yet to provide the information to Congress,  construction is proceeding at the St. Elizabeths campus. Figures 1 and 2  show progress made to the Center Building from September 2016 to  March 2018. This structure will house the Secretary of Homeland Security  and other key leadership.", "My testimony summarizes the key findings of our September 2014 report  on DHS and GSA efforts to manage the DHS headquarters consolidation  project, and provides a status update on DHS and GSA implementation of  our recommendations. To complete our September 2014 report, we  compared DHS and GSA capital planning efforts against applicable  leading practices in capital decision making and interviewed DHS and  GSA officials responsible for the planning and management of the DHS  headquarters consolidation. We also compared DHS and GSA  documents on the estimated cost and schedule for the St. Elizabeths  project with cost- and schedule-estimating leading practices we have  identified in our prior work, and relevant GSA guidance. To assess  subsequent DHS and GSA actions to implement our September 2014  recommendations, we conducted periodic follow-up with DHS and GSA  officials and obtained relevant documentation. The work upon which this  statement is based was conducted in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consolidation Plans Did Not Fully Conform with Leading Capital Decision- Making Practices and GAO Recommendation Has Not Been Implemented", "paragraphs": ["In our September 2014 report, we found that DHS and GSA planning for  the DHS headquarters consolidation did not fully conform with leading  capital decision-making practices intended to help agencies effectively  plan and procure assets. Specifically, we found that DHS and GSA had  not conducted a comprehensive assessment of current needs, identified  capability gaps, or evaluated and prioritized alternatives that would help  officials adapt consolidation plans to changing conditions and address  funding issues as reflected in leading practices. At that time, DHS and  GSA officials reported that they had taken some initial actions that may  facilitate consolidation planning in a manner consistent with leading  practices. For example, DHS had an overall goal of reducing the square  footage allotted per employee across the department in accordance with  workplace standards, such as standards for telework and hoteling. As  we reported in 2014, DHS and GSA officials acknowledged that new  workplace standards could create a number of new development options  to consider, as the new standards would allow for more staff to occupy  the space at St. Elizabeths than previously anticipated. DHS and GSA  officials also reported at that time that analyzing different leasing options  could affect consolidation efforts. However, we found that the  consolidation plans, which were finalized between 2006 and 2009, had  not been updated to reflect these actions.", "In addition, we found in September 2014 that funding for the St.  Elizabeths project had not aligned with what DHS and GSA initially  planned. We reported that according to DHS and GSA officials, the  funding gap between what DHS and GSA requested and what was  received from fiscal years 2009 through 2014, was over $1.6 billion.  According to these officials, this gap created cost escalations of over $1  billion and schedule delays of over 10 years relative to original estimates.  We found in 2014 that these delays posed challenges for DHS in terms of  its leasing portfolio. Specifically, DHS\u2019s long-term leasing portfolio was  developed based on the original expected completion date for St.  Elizabeths development in 2016. In 2014, DHS and GSA reported that  they had begun to work together to consider changes to the DHS  headquarters consolidation plans, but they had not announced when new  plans would be issued. Furthermore, because final documentation of  agency deliberations or analyses had not yet been developed, it was  unclear if any new plans would be informed by an updated  comprehensive needs assessment and capability gap analysis as called  for by leading capital decision-making practices. Therefore, in our  September 2014 report we recommended that DHS and GSA conduct  various assessments and analyses and use the results to inform updated  DHS headquarters consolidation plans. DHS and GSA concurred with this  recommendation and stated that their forthcoming draft St. Elizabeths  Enhanced Consolidation Plan would contain these analyses.", "As of April 2018, however, the agencies had not submitted updated plan  information to Congress that would either meet the requirements of the  DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act or address our  recommendation. According to DHS officials, the agencies prepared a  comprehensive response to the Act, including updated analyses, but the  information is no longer current and now needs to be revised and  revalidated before it is submitted to Congress. Officials told us that the  updated consolidation plans and analyses assumed that the project would  receive more funding in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 than was  appropriated. Further, officials told us that the current Administration is  expected to provide input on the planned DHS component occupancies at  the St. Elizabeths campus. We continue to believe that DHS and GSA  attention to following leading capital decision-making practices\u2014including  having a consolidation plan that justifies future actions\u2014is critical given  the project\u2019s multi-billion dollar cost and impact on departmental  operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost and Schedule Estimates for the St. Elizabeths Project Did Not Reflect Leading Practices and GAO Recommendation Has Not Been Implemented", "paragraphs": ["In our September 2014 report, we found that DHS and GSA cost and  schedule estimates for the headquarters consolidation project at St.  Elizabeths did not conform or only minimally or partially conformed with  leading estimating practices, and were therefore unreliable.  Furthermore, we found that in some areas, the cost and schedule  estimates did not fully conform with GSA guidance relevant to developing  estimates.", "In 2014, we found that DHS and GSA cost estimates for the headquarters  consolidation project at St. Elizabeths did not reflect leading practices,  which rendered the estimates unreliable. For example, we found that the  2013 cost estimate\u2014the most recent available at the time of our 2014  report\u2014did not include (1) a life-cycle cost analysis of the project,  including the cost of repair, operations, and maintenance; (2) was not  regularly updated to reflect significant changes to the program including  actual costs; and (3) did not include an independent estimate to  determine whether other estimating methods produce similar results. In  addition, a sensitivity and a risk and uncertainty analysis had not been  performed to assess the reasonableness of the cost estimate. We have  previously reported that a reliable cost estimate is critical to the success  of any program. Specifically, we have found that such an estimate  provides the basis for informed investment decision making, realistic  budget formulation and program resourcing, meaningful progress  measurement, proactive course correction when warranted, and  accountability for results. Accordingly, in 2014, we concluded that DHS  and GSA would benefit from maintaining current and well-documented  estimates of project costs at St. Elizabeths\u2014even if project funding is not  fully secured.", "In 2014, we also found that the 2008 and 2013 schedule estimates (the  estimates available at the time of our review) did not include all activities  for both the government and its contractors necessary to accomplish the  project\u2019s objectives and did not include schedule baseline documents to  help measure performance as reflected in leading practices and GSA  guidance. For the 2008 schedule estimate, we found that resources (such  as labor, materials, and equipment) were not accounted for and a risk  assessment had not been conducted to predict a level of confidence in  the project\u2019s completion date. In addition, we found the 2013 schedule  estimate was unreliable because, among other things, it was incomplete  in that it did not provide details needed to understand the sequence of  events, including work to be performed in fiscal years 2014 and 2015.", "In 2014, we concluded that developing cost and schedule estimates  consistent with leading practices could promote greater transparency and  provide decision makers needed information about the St. Elizabeths  project and the larger DHS headquarters consolidation effort. However, in  commenting on our analysis of St. Elizabeths cost and schedule  estimates, DHS and GSA officials said that it would be difficult or  impossible to create reliable estimates that encompass the scope of the  entire St. Elizabeths project. In response to our findings, officials said that  given the complex, multiphase nature of the overall development effort,  specific estimates are created for smaller individual projects, but not for  the campus project as a whole. Therefore, in their view, leading  estimating practices and GSA guidance cannot reasonably be applied to  the high-level projections developed for the total cost and completion date  of the entire St. Elizabeths project. GSA stated that the higher-level,  milestone schedule currently being used to manage the program was  more flexible than the detailed schedule we proposed, and had proven  effective even with the highly variable funding provided for the project.", "However, our September 2014 review found this high-level schedule was  not sufficiently defined to effectively manage the program. For example,  our review showed that the schedule did not contain detailed schedule  activities that included all government, contractor, and applicable  subcontractor efforts. In our 2014 report, we recognized the challenges of  developing reliable cost and schedule estimates for a large-scale,  multiphase project like St. Elizabeths, particularly given its unstable  funding history and agreed that incorporating cost- and schedule- estimating leading practices could involve additional costs. However, we  also concluded that unless DHS and GSA invest in these practices,  Congress risked making funding decisions and DHS and GSA  management risked making resource allocation decisions without the  benefit that a robust analysis of levels of risk, uncertainty, and confidence  provides. Therefore, in our September 2014 report we recommended that  DHS and GSA develop revised cost and schedule estimates for the  remaining portions of the consolidation project in accordance with leading  practices. DHS and GSA concurred with the recommendation.", "As of April 2018, however, the agencies had not submitted revised cost  and schedule information to Congress that would either meet the  requirements of the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act  or address our recommendation. GSA is leading efforts to revise the  project\u2019s cost and schedule estimates, and according to GSA officials, the  revised figures will take into account leading cost- and schedule-  estimation practices, including a risk assessment. We continue to believe  that creating up-to-date, reliable cost and schedule estimates for DHS  headquarters consolidation should be an integral part of DHS and GSA  efforts to reassess the project. Without this information, it will be more  difficult for agency officials and Members of Congress to make informed  decisions regarding resource allocations and compare competing funding  priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Did Not Consistently Apply Its Acquisitions Guidance When Overseeing the St. Elizabeths Project, but Has Taken Steps to Implement GAO\u2019s Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["In our September 2014 report, we also found that DHS had not  consistently applied its major acquisition guidance for reviewing and  approving the headquarters consolidation project. Specifically, we found  that DHS had guidelines in place to provide senior management the  opportunity to review and approve its major projects, but DHS had not  consistently applied these guidelines to its efforts to work with GSA to  plan and implement headquarters consolidation. Part of the inconsistency  was the result of DHS designating the headquarters consolidation project  as a major acquisition in some years but not in others. For example, we  found that in 2010 and 2011, DHS identified the headquarters  consolidation project as a major acquisition and included the project on  DHS\u2019s Major Acquisitions Oversight List. Thus, the project was subject  to the oversight and management policies and procedures established in  DHS major acquisition guidance; however, the project did not comply with  major acquisition requirements as outlined by DHS guidelines. For  example, we found that the project had not produced any of the required  key acquisition documents requiring department-level approval, such as  life-cycle cost estimates and an acquisition program baseline, among  others.", "As we reported in 2014, in 2012, the project as a whole was dropped from  the list. Subsequently, in 2013 and 2014, DHS included the information  technology (IT) acquisition portion of the project on the list, but not the  entire project. DHS officials explained that they considered the St.  Elizabeths project to be more of a GSA acquisition rather than a DHS  acquisition because GSA owns the site and the majority of the building  construction is funded through GSA appropriations. In our 2014 report,  we recognized that GSA had responsibility for managing contracts  associated with the headquarters consolidation project. However, we also  noted that a variety of factors, including the overall cost, scope, and  visibility of the project, as well as the overall importance of the project in  the context of DHS\u2019s mission, made the consolidation project a viable  candidate for consideration as a major DHS acquisition. By not  consistently applying this review process to headquarters consolidation,  we concluded that DHS management risked losing insight into the progress of the St. Elizabeths project, as well as how the project fits in  with its overall acquisitions portfolio. Thus, in our September 2014 report  we recommended that the Secretary of Homeland Security designate the  headquarters consolidation program a major acquisition and apply DHS  acquisition policy requirements. DHS concurred with the  recommendation.", "As of April 2018, DHS has made some progress implementing this  recommendation. For example, on September 16, 2014, DHS issued an  Acquisition Decision Memorandum designating the DHS-funded portions  of the headquarters consolidation program as a Major Acquisition  Program to be overseen by the departmental Acquisition Review Board  (ARB). DHS also made progress implementing this recommendation by  conducting and documenting an ARB of the program in November 2016.  The ARB process provided DHS greater oversight of headquarters  consolidation, and provided a forum for officials to consider a wide range  of issues affecting consolidation efforts, such as funding and project  scope. In addition, in January 2018, DHS officials reported that they were  working to align headquarters consolidation program documentation to  meet the spirit of DHS acquisition policy guidance. We will reassess the  status of this recommendation after the consolidation plan and cost and  schedule estimates are updated and submitted to Congress per the DHS  Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act. At that time, we believe  there will be more certainty about the future direction of the project  overall, and DHS\u2019s funded portion in particular, and we will be better able  to assess the level of DHS acquisitions oversight for the project.", "Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Correa, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
