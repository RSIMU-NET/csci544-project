DOL uses an information technology (IT) system to manage and track requests, but it has not implemented key required and recommended capabilities for enhancing FOIA processing, such as capabilities to accommodate individuals with disabilities or electronic redaction. Implementing the required and recommended capabilities could improve the efficiency of the department's FOIA processing. DOL and its components have implemented a process for prioritizing FOIA requests, allowing for expedited processing in certain cases, and in fiscal year 2014 the department processed an estimated 76 percent of requests that GAO reviewed within 20 working days. For the estimated 24 percent of cases that were not timely, officials attributed these delays, in part, to the involvement of multiple components in a single request or the time required to process large volumes of requested records. However, the department did not document the rationales for delays in its FOIA tracking system or notify requesters of them. Further, the department had not responded to administrative appeals within the statutory time frame of 20 working days, but is taking steps to reduce the backlog of appeals.", "From January 2005 through December 2014, 68 FOIA-related lawsuits were brought against DOL. Of these lawsuits, the court ruled in favor of the department in 18 cases, jointly in favor of both the department and the requester in 1 case, and in favor of the requesters in 3 cases. In 44 of the remaining lawsuits, the department and the requesters established settlement agreements that awarded attorney's fees and other costs to the requesters or resulted in the department potentially releasing additional information. A decision on 2 lawsuits was undecided as of April 2016 (see figure).", "Although recommended by Department of Justice guidance, the department did not notify requesters of mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services as an alternative to litigation.

Before FOIA\u2019s enactment in 1966, an individual seeking access to federal  records faced the burden of establishing a \u201cneed to know\u201d before being  granted the right to examine a federal record. FOIA established a \u201cright to  know\u201d standard, under which an organization or person could receive  access to information held by a federal agency without demonstrating a  need or reason. The \u201cright to know\u201d standard shifted the burden of proof  from the individual to a government agency and required the agency to  provide proper justification when denying a request for access to a  record.", "Any person, defined broadly to include attorneys filing on behalf of an  individual, corporations, and organizations, can file a FOIA request. For  example, an attorney can request labor-related workers\u2019 compensation  files on behalf of his or her client, and a commercial requester, such as a  data broker that files a request on behalf of another person, may request  a copy of a government contract. In response, an agency is required to  provide the relevant record(s) in any readily producible form or format  specified by the requester unless the record falls within a permitted  exemption. (Appendix II describes the nine specific exemptions that can  be applied to withhold, for example, classified, confidential commercial,  privileged, privacy, and several types of law enforcement information.)

The 1996 e-FOIA amendments, among other things, sought to  strengthen the requirement that federal agencies respond to a request in  a timely manner and reduce their backlogged requests. In this regard, the  amendments made a number of procedural changes, including providing  a requester with an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it  can be processed more quickly and requiring agencies to determine  within 20 working days (an increase from the previously established time  frame of 10 days) whether a request would be fulfilled. The e-FOIA  amendments also authorized agencies to multi-track requests\u2014that is, to  process simple and complex requests concurrently on separate tracks to  facilitate responding to a relatively simple request more quickly. In  addition, the amendments encouraged online, public access to  government information by requiring agencies to make specific types of  records available in electronic form.", "In a later effort to reduce agencies\u2019 backlogged FOIA requests, the  President issued Executive Order 13392 in December 2005, which set  forth a directive for citizen-centered and results-oriented FOIA. In  particular, the order directed agencies to provide a requester with  courteous and appropriate service and ways to learn about the FOIA  process, the status of a request, and the public availability of other  agency records. The order also instructed agencies to process requests  efficiently, achieve measurable process improvements (including a  reduction in the backlog of overdue requests), and reform programs that  were not producing the appropriate results.", "Further, the order directed each agency to designate a senior official as  the Chief FOIA Officer. This official is responsible for ensuring agency- wide compliance with the act by monitoring implementation throughout  the agency; recommending changes in policies, practices, staffing, and  funding; and reviewing and reporting on the agency\u2019s performance in  implementing FOIA to agency heads and to the Department of Justice.  (These are referred to as Chief FOIA Officer reports.)", "The Department of Justice, which has overall responsibility for overseeing  federal FOIA activities, issued guidance in April 2006 to assist federal  agencies in implementing the executive order\u2019s requirements for reviews  and improvement plans. The guidance suggested several potential areas  for agencies to consider when conducting a review, such as automated  tracking of requests, automated processing and receipt of requests,  electronic responses to requests, forms of communication with  requesters, and systems for handling referrals to other agencies.", "The OPEN Government Act, which was enacted in 2007, also amended  FOIA in several ways. For example, it placed the 2005 executive order\u2019s  requirement for agencies to have Chief FOIA Officers in law. It also  required agencies to include additional statistics on timeliness in their  annual reports. In addition, the act called for agencies to establish a  system to track the status of a request.", "Further, in January 2009, the President issued two memoranda,  Transparency and Open Government and Freedom of Information Act,  both of which focused on increasing the amount of information made  public by the government. In particular, the latter memorandum directed  agencies to (1) adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure in all FOIA  decisions, (2) take affirmative steps to make information public, and (3)  use modern technology to do so. This echoed Congress\u2019s finding, in  passing the OPEN Government Act, that FOIA established a \u201cstrong  presumption in favor of disclosure.\u201d", "In September 2013, the Department of Justice issued guidance to assist  federal agencies in implementing the memoranda and the OPEN  Government Act that included procedures for agencies to follow when  responding to FOIA requests.

The guidance also includes procedures on the expedited processing of  FOIA requests.", "Agencies, including DOL, are generally required to respond to a FOIA  request within 20 working days. A request may be received in writing or  by electronic means. Once received, the request is processed through  multiple phases, which include assigning a tracking number, searching for  responsive records, processing records, and releasing records. Also, as  relevant, agencies respond to administrative appeals and lawsuits filed as  a result of their actions and decisions in addressing the FOIA requests.  Figure 1 provides a simplified overview of the FOIA process, from the  receipt of a request through responding to a lawsuit.", "As indicated above, during the intake phase of a typical agency FOIA  process, a request is to be logged into the agency\u2019s FOIA system and a  tracking number assigned. The request is then to be reviewed by FOIA  staff to determine its scope and level of complexity. The agency then  typically sends a letter or e-mail to the requester acknowledging receipt of  the request, with a unique tracking number that the requester can use to  check the status of the request, as well as notifying the requester of  estimated fees, if any.", "Next, FOIA staff begin the search to retrieve the responsive records by  routing the request to the appropriate program office(s).This step may  include searching and reviewing paper and electronic records from  multiple locations and program offices.", "Agency staff then process the responsive records, which includes  determining whether a portion or all of any record should be withheld  based on statutory exemptions. If a portion or all of any record is the  responsibility of another agency, FOIA staff may consult with the other  agency or may send (\u201crefer\u201d) the document(s) to that other agency for  processing. After processing and redaction, a request is reviewed for  errors and to ensure quality. The documents are then released to the  requester, either electronically or by mail.", "FOIA also provides requesters with the right to file an administrative  appeal if they disagree with the agency\u2019s decision.

Specifically, if any agency fails to comply  with the statutory time limits, including responding to requests within 20  working days, a requester has the right to consider the request denied  and sue the agency to compel disclosure. A requester should generally  exhaust his or her administrative remedies, such as filing an  administrative appeal, before filing a lawsuit.", "In 2007, FOIA was amended to allow both requesters and agencies to  contact the Office of Government Information Services, within the  National Archives and Records Administration, to help resolve a dispute  at any point in the FOIA process, including after filing an administrative  appeal.

This  act requires federal agencies to make their electronic information  accessible to people with disabilities.", "In accordance with the OPEN Government Act, DOL has implemented  SIMS-FOIA to assist the department in tracking the requests received and  processed. The system assigns unique tracking numbers for each  request received, and tracks and measures the timeliness of the  requests. Further, staff who process requests are able to include in the  system the date the request was received by the first component that may  be responsible for processing the request and the date the request was  routed to and received by the appropriate component responsible for  processing the request. Based on this information, the system then  calculates the date by which the response is due to the requester, which  is 20 working days from the date the request was received by the office  responsible for its processing.", "In responding to our questionnaire, 22 of 23 components reported using  SIMS-FOIA and provided documentation to demonstrate their use of the  system to track requests. Due to its independent oversight role within the  department, DOL\u2019s Office of Inspector General stated that it does not use  this system to track its requests. According to its FOIA Officer, the office  has instead created a separate system that is similar to SIMS-FOIA\u2014the  Office of Inspector General FOIA Tracking System\u2014to track its requests.", "Further, in accordance with the act, DOL implemented its FOIA public  portal that links to SIMS-FOIA and allows requesters to track the status of  their requests through an Internet service using assigned request tracking  numbers. Specifically, requesters can access the public portal via the  DOL website (http://www.dol.gov/foia) to obtain the status of their  requests. The information provided by the portal includes dates on which  the agency received the requests and estimated dates on which the  agency expects to complete action on the requests.", "Nevertheless, while the department has taken these actions, it has not  ensured that SIMS-FOIA and the online portal are compliant with  requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. According to DOL  officials in OIS, during a test performed by the department\u2019s Office of  Public Affairs, the online portal was determined to have accessibility  issues. Specifically, the portal could not be easily accessed by those who  were blind or had impaired vision. In addition, the 508 compliance tester  in the department\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer found that  SIMS-FOIA was not accessible to vision impaired employees who need to  use the system.", "With regard to this finding, the Office of the Chief Information Officer  determined that, because the system is only used internally by DOL  employees, it would fulfill the requirements of Section 508 by providing  reasonable accommodations, such as large screen magnifiers and verbal  description tools, to those affected employees needing access to the  information contained in SIMS-FOIA. According to the Office of the Chief  Information Officer, accommodations would be made on a case-by-case  basis to address the employee\u2019s specific needs.", "Further, OIS officials told us that the department is working to make the  online portal and SIMS-FOIA compliant with the requirements of Section  508. However, OIS officials could not say by what date compliance with  the requirements is expected to be achieved. Having systems that are  compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (as amended) is  essential to ensure that the department\u2019s electronic information is  accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities.", "Beyond the requirements provided in law and guidance to develop  automated  systems to track FOIA requests, three federal agencies have  collectively identified capabilities for systems that they consider to be best  practices for FOIA processing. Specifically, in conjunction with the  Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency, the  National Archives and Records Administration\u2019s Office of Government  Information Services identified the following 12 capabilities of an  automated system that it considers recommended best practices for FOIA  processing: using a single, component-wide system for tracking requests; accepting the request online, either through e-mail or online request multi-tracking requests electronically;  routing requests to the responsible office electronically;  storing and routing responsive records to the appropriate office  electronically;  redacting responsive records with appropriate exemptions applied  electronically;  calculating and recording processing fees electronically; allowing supervisors to review the case file to approve redactions and  fee calculations for processing electronically; generating system correspondence, such as an e-mail or letter, with a generating periodic reporting statistics, such as annual report and  quarterly backlog data, used to develop reports; and  storing and routing correspondence, such as letters or e-mails  between agencies and requesters.", "As of March 2016, DOL had implemented 7 of the 12 recommended best  practices for SIMS-FOIA and the FOIA public portal. Specifically, the  department had implemented the capabilities of a single tracking system,  as well as capabilities for accepting requests through e-mail; multi- tracking requests; routing the request to the office responsible for  processing the request; storing and routing correspondence with a  requester; and generating periodic report statistics, such as the fiscal year  FOIA annual report and quarterly report, that identify requests received,  processed, and backlogged. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the  department uses a separate FOIA appeals tracking system\u2014the Matter  Management System\u2014to track appeals electronically.", "However, the department had not implemented 4 other recommended  capabilities, and had partially implemented 1 capability. Specifically, the  department\u2019s automated FOIA tracking system lacked capabilities to store  and route responsive records electronically, redact responsive records  electronically, and review the case file to approve redactions and fee  calculations electronically. Further, the department had not implemented  the capability to generate correspondence to a requester. In addition,  SIMS-FOIA partially included the recommended capability to calculate  and record processing fees electronically. Specifically, the system could  record fees electronically, but it could not calculate fees electronically.", "Figure 2 illustrates the extent to which DOL had implemented  recommended capabilities to enhance FOIA processing.", "In discussing this matter, the OIS director and FOIA officials in the  component offices stated that, since the current system generally meets  statutory requirements, the department has not yet made improvements  to the system to reflect the recommended capabilities. The officials said  that they are aware of current system limitations and have begun  researching various technologies to incorporate the remaining  capabilities. Nevertheless, the officials said that, due to competing  interests and resource needs, the department has made a decision to  continue using SIMS-FOIA without these capabilities in the meantime.  The officials did not provide a time frame for when the capabilities would  be implemented.

The component is to grant  the request for expedited processing when the requester explains in detail  the basis for the need to expedite the request and demonstrates a  compelling need based on the criteria described above. Upon receiving a  request for expedited processing, the component is responsible for  deciding whether the request is to be expedited and for notifying the  requester of the final decision within 10 calendar days.", "The guide states that, when a request is submitted, the component\u2019s  FOIA staff must identify the processing track to which it will be assigned  (i.e., simple, complex, or expedited). According to OIS officials, the  component FOIA processors assess whether requests are simple or  complex based on their experience in handling requests and familiarity  with requests that are submitted routinely. Further, according to the guide,  FOIA processors assess whether requests are to be given expedited  treatment whenever they determine that requests demonstrate a  compelling need, such as when they pertain to an imminent threat to the  life or physical safety of an individual.", "All of the components had taken steps that followed the regulation and  best practices guidance to prioritize the selected fiscal year 2014 FOIA  requests. That is, as the components\u2019 FOIA processors logged in the  requests, they assigned them to one of the three processing tracks. With  the exception of the Office of the Inspector General, the components  used SIMS-FOIA to designate the processing track for the requests.

With this questionnaire, we took a number of steps to minimize  these errors. For example, our questionnaire was developed in  collaboration with a GAO methodologist.", "The results of our questionnaire were summarized to describe component  efforts to manage, prioritize, and process FOIA requests.
