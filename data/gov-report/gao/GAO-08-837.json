This new strategy established goals and objectives to achieve over 12 to 18 months, or by July 2008.

GAO also discusses U.S. strategies for Iraq. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from U.S. agencies, the United Nations, and the Iraqi government. GAO also had staff stationed in Baghdad. Since May 2003, GAO has issued over 130 Iraq-related audits, which provided baseline information for this assessment. GAO prepared this report under the Comptroller General's authority."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The New Way Forward responded to failures in prior strategies that prematurely transferred security responsibilities to Iraqi forces or belatedly responded to growing sectarian violence. Overall violence, as measured by enemy-initiated attacks, fell about 70 percent in Iraq, from about 180 attacks per day in June 2007 to about 50 attacks per day in February 2008. Security gains have largely resulted from (1) the increase in U.S. combat forces, (2) the creation of nongovernmental security forces such as Sons of Iraq, and (3) the Mahdi Army's declaration of a cease fire. Average daily attacks were at higher levels in March and April before declining in May 2008. The security environment remains volatile and dangerous. The number of trained Iraqi forces has increased from 323,000 in January 2007 to 478,000 in May 2008; many units are leading counterinsurgency operations. However, the Department of Defense reported in March 2008 that the number of Iraqi units capable of performing operations without U.S. assistance has remained at about 10 percent. Several factors have complicated the development of capable security forces, including the lack of a single unified force, sectarian and militia influences, and continued dependence on U.S. and coalition forces. The Iraqi government has enacted key legislation to return some Ba'athists to government, give amnesty to detained Iraqis, and define provincial powers. However, it has not yet enacted other important legislation for sharing oil resources or holding provincial elections. Efforts to complete the constitutional review have also stalled. A goal of The New Way Forward was to facilitate the Iraqis' efforts to enact all key legislation by the end of 2007. Between 2005 and 2007, Iraq spent only 24 percent of the $27 billion it budgeted for its own reconstruction efforts. More specifically, Iraq's central ministries, responsible for security and essential services, spent only 11 percent of their capital investment budgets in 2007--down from similarly low rates of 14 and 13 percent in the 2 prior years. Violence and sectarian strife, shortage of skilled labor, and weak procurement and budgeting systems have hampered Iraq's efforts to spend its capital budgets. Although oil production has improved for short periods, the May 2008 production level of about 2.5 million barrels per day (mbpd) was below the U.S. goal of 3 mbpd. The daily supply of electricity met only about half of demand in early May 2008. Conversely, State reports that U.S. goals for Iraq's water sector are close to being reached. The unstable security environment, corruption, and lack of technical capacity have contributed to the shortfalls. The Departments disagreed with our recommendation, stating that The New Way Forward strategy remains valid but the strategy shall be reviewed and refined as necessary. We reaffirm the need for an updated strategy given the important changes that have occurred in Iraq since January 2007. An updated strategy should build on recent gains, address unmet goals and objectives and articulate the U.S. strategy beyond July 2008."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2007, the President announced a new U.S. strategy to stem the  high levels of violence in Iraq and help the Iraqi government foster  conditions for national reconciliation.

To improve these conditions, The New Way  Forward established near-term (12 to 18 months) goals that the  Administration stated were achievable in this time period. In addition, the  strategy reasserted the Administration\u2019s long-term goal or end state for  Iraq: a unified, democratic, federal Iraq that can govern, defend, and  sustain itself, and is an ally in the war on terror.

Enemy-initiated attacks  against the coalition and its Iraqi partners increased through October 2006  and remained at high levels through the end of the year. During 2006,  according to State and United Nations (UN) reports, insurgents, death  squads, militias, and terrorists increased their attacks against civilians,  largely on a sectarian basis. In addition, the number of internally displaced  persons (IDP) in Iraq sharply increased, primarily as a result of sectarian  intimidation and violence that forced many people from their homes.

In late March 2008, the Internally Displaced Persons  (IDP) Working Group reported that the number of IDPs remained very  high, but new displacement was occurring at a lower rate. The working  group attributed the lower rate of displacement to, among other things, the  increasing ethnic homogenization within Iraq; the decrease in security  incidents in some areas of Baghdad; and restrictions on freedom of  movement in many Iraqi provinces. During April 2008, according to UN  and International Organization for Migration reports, hundreds of Iraqi  families fled their homes in the Sadr City area of Baghdad, with the  majority returning by early June 2008.

He  therefore called for an increase of over 20,000 U.S. combat and other  forces, including an additional 5 brigades.

Only one major component  of the Iraqi security forces, the Iraqi army, has counterinsurgency as its  primary mission. The Iraqi army represents about 45 percent of 445,000  trained Iraqi security forces. The Iraqi local police represent 37 percent of  total trained security forces and have civilian law enforcement as a  primary mission. The Iraqi national police account for 10 percent of total  trained Iraqi forces. According to the Independent Commission on the  Security Forces of Iraq, the national police are not a viable organization, as  they face significant challenges, including public distrust, real and  perceived sectarianism, and uncertainty as to whether it is a military or  police force. The commission recommended that the national police be  disbanded and reorganized under the Ministry of Interior. As a smaller  organization with a different name, it would be responsible for specialized  police tasks such as explosive ordnance disposal, urban search and  rescue, and other functions.", "Second, sectarian and militia influences have divided the loyalties of the  Iraqi security forces. In May 2007, the U.S. Commission on International  Religious Freedom reported that Iraq\u2019s Shi\u2019a-dominated government has  engaged in sectarian-based human rights violations and has tolerated  abuses committed by Shi\u2019a militias with ties to political factions in the  governing coalition. According to the commission, the Iraqi government,  through its security forces, has committed arbitrary arrest, prolonged  detention without due process, targeted executions, and torture against  non-Shi\u2019a Iraqis. In September 2007, we determined that the Iraqi  government had not eliminated militia control over local security forces  and that sectarianism in the Iraqi security forces was a serious problem in  Baghdad and other areas of Iraq. According to DOD, in March 2008,  sectarianism and corruption continue to be significant problems within the  Ministries of Interior and Defense. For example, some army units sent to  Baghdad have had ties to Shi\u2019a militias, making it difficult to target Shi\u2019a  extremist networks. According to the March 2008 State Department  Human Rights Report, the effectiveness of Ministry of Interior forces,  particularly the national police, was seriously compromised by militia  influence.", "Third, as we reported in November 2007, Iraqi units remain dependent  upon the coalition for their logistical, command and control, and  intelligence capabilities. The Ministries of Defense and Interior were not  capable of accounting for, supporting, or fully controlling their forces in  the field, nor do the Iraqi security forces have critical enablers such as  intelligence and logistics systems and processes that permit independent  planning and operations. Due to Iraq\u2019s immature logistics systems, many  Iraqi military and police units will continue to depend on MNF-I for key  sustainment and logistics support through 2008. Further, the Independent  Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq stated that the Iraqi Army  remains heavily dependent on contracted support to satisfy day-to-day  requirements, and it appears that contracted logistics support in some  form will be necessary for 2 to 3 years.", "Fourth, shortfalls in training, leadership, personnel, and sustainment have  contributed to the limited progress in the number of Iraqi battalions  capable of operating independently, according to DOD reports. To address  this problem, the Iraqi government has expanded its training capacity.  According to DOD\u2019s March 2008 report, the Ministry of Interior has  expanded the number of its training facilities from 4 to 17 over the past  year and is implementing its first annual strategic plan. In addition, the  Iraqi army plans to develop training centers in 2008 that will train an  additional 2,000 soldiers per cycle. However, DOD noted that Ministry of  Interior and Defense basic combat and police training facilities are at or  near capacity and that the shortage of leaders in the Iraqi security forces  will take years to address.

However, this date was not met, as only 8 of 18 provinces had  transitioned to Iraqi control at that time. According to DOD, in September  2007, the principal cause for the delay in transitioning provinces to Iraqi  control was the inability of the Iraqi police to maintain security in the  provinces.

In recognition of this  critical need, U.S. capacity development efforts have shifted from long- term institution-building projects to an immediate effort to help Iraqi  ministries overcome their inability to spend their capital investment  budgets. As U.S. funding for Iraq reconstruction totaling $45 billion is  almost 90 percent obligated ($40 billion) and about 70 percent disbursed  ($31 billion) as of April 2008, the need for Iraq to spend its own resources  becomes increasingly critical to economic development.", "Between 2005 and 2007, Iraq budgeted about $27 billion in capital  investments for its own reconstruction effort, as shown in table 3.  However, the government spent about 24 percent of the amount budgeted.  According to Ministry of Finance total expenditure reports displayed in  figure 11, Iraq has spent low percentages of capital investment budgets  between 2005 and 2007 in several key categories. Total government  spending for capital investments increased slightly from 23 percent in 2005  to 28 percent in 2007. However, Iraq\u2019s central ministries spent only 11  percent of their capital investment budgets in 2007\u2014a decline from  similarly low spending rates of 14 and 13 percent in 2005 and 2006,  respectively. Last, spending rates for ministries critical to the delivery of  essential services varied from the 41 percent spent by the Water Resources  Ministry in 2007 to the less than 1 percent spent by the Ministries of Oil  and Electricity.", "As discussed in the next section, low spending rates for the oil, electricity,  and water sectors are problematic since U.S. investments in these sectors  have ended and increased production goals for these sectors have  consistently not been met. Iraq will have additional resources for capital  investments in 2008. Iraq\u2019s 2008 budget was developed with the  assumption that Iraq would receive $57 per barrel for oil exports. As of  May 2008, Iraqi crude oil was selling at about $104 per barrel. Oil exports  generate about 90 percent of total government revenues each year.

The Embassy stated  that it is in the process of implementing a previous GAO  recommendation that will enhance U.S. capacity development in Iraq.  In contrast, State department contends that our recommendation is  not needed because such a plan already exists. An integrated plan is  still needed and becomes even more important as State and Treasury  announce another new capacity development program \u2013 the Public  Finance Management Action Group \u2013 to help Iraq with budget  execution issues.  3.

The government of Iraq allocated $10 billion of its revenues for capital  projects and reconstruction when it passed its 2007 budget in February  2007. We focused on Iraq\u2019s efforts to spend its capital budget because  it is a key benchmark that the government committed to achieve by the  end of 2007. The New Way Forward identified Iraq\u2019s inability to fully  spend its own resources to rebuild its infrastructure and deliver  essential services as a critical economic challenge to Iraq\u2019s self- reliance.  2.  Treasury states that Iraq has improved its overall budget execution in  2007, citing as an example an overall increase in Iraq\u2019s budget from $23  billion in 2006 to $26.6 billion in 2007, an increase of 16 percent.  However, the Ministry of Finance reports expenditures in Iraqi dinar,  not US dollars. When analyzed in dinars, Iraq\u2019s budget decreased 3  percent from 34.5 trillion dinars in 2006 to 33.5 trillion dinars in 2007.  The 16 percent increase that Treasury reported is due to the 19 percent  appreciation of Iraqi dinar in 2007.   3.  We agree that Iraq\u2019s budget doubled in size between 2005 and 2008 in  dollar terms. However, much of the increase was due to a 25 percent  appreciation of the Iraqi dinar and a four fold increase in the budgets  of Iraq\u2019s security ministries.  4.  Treasury states that the our draft report dismisses the significance of  the increase in Iraq\u2019s budgetary \u201ccommitments\u201d, stating that GAO\u2019s  analyses rely only on Iraqi Ministry of Finance\u2019s total expenditure  report rather than the Ministry\u2019s special capital reports. The latter  report includes budgetary \u201ccommitments\u201d. We did not use the special  reports in our analyses for two reasons: (1) Treasury Department  officials stated in our meetings with them that the special reports  contain unreliable and unverifiable data and (2) the special reports do  not define commitments, measure them or describe how or when these  commitments would result in actual expenditures. In addition, our  reviews of these special reports show inconsistent use of poorly  defined budgetary terms, as well as columns and rows that did not add  up.  5.  Treasury stated that Iraq counts capital expenditures in the grants  section of its expenditure reports, as well as the non-financial assets  section. After reviewing the grants section, we have updated the data  presented in table 3 to include an additional $1.1 billion in budget and  expenditures for 2007. Accordingly, the percent of the budget spent in  2007 was 28 percent.  6.  We added information on the Iraqi government\u2019s report that it spent  and committed about 63 percent of its investment budget.  7.

DOD recognized, as with all strategies, updates and refinements occur  at varying intervals to take into account changes in the strategic  environment.  However, DOD did not concur with our  recommendation, stating that The New Way Forward strategy remains  valid. We disagree for several reasons. First, much has changed in Iraq  since January 2007, including some of the assumptions upon which  The New Way Forward was based. Specifically:    Violence in Iraq is down but U.S. surge forces are leaving and over  100,000 armed Sons of Iraq remain.", "Late 2007 target dates for the government of Iraq to pass key  legislation and assume control over local security have passed.", "The United States is currently negotiating a status of forces  agreement with Iraq to replace UN Security Council Resolutions.", "The Secretary of Defense recently articulated a new long term goal  for Iraq\u2014an Iraq that helps bridge sectarian divides in the Middle  East.", "Second, The New Way Forward is not a complete strategic plan  because it lays out goals and objectives for only the near-term phase  that ends in July 2008. Third, the goals and objectives of The New Way  Forward and the phase that follows it are contained in disparate  documents such as Presidential speeches, White House fact sheets, and  an NSC power point presentation, rather than in a strategic planning  document similar to the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq (NSVI),  the prior U.S. strategy for Iraq. Fourth, the documents that describe the  phase after July 2008 do not specify the administration\u2019s long term  strategic goals and objectives in Iraq or how it intends to achieve them.  In contrast, while the NSVI was also an incomplete strategy, it  contained a comprehensive description of U.S. political, security, and  economic goals and objectives in Iraq over the short term, medium  term, and long term.", "We continue to believe that the Administration should update its  strategy for Iraq, given the importance of the war effort to U.S. national  security interests, the expenditure of billions of dollars for U.S. military  and civilian efforts in Iraq, and the continued deployment of at least  140,000 troops in Iraq. An updated U.S. strategy must reflect changes in  conditions in Iraq by assessing the progress made over the past 18  months, targeting the unmet goals of the New Way Forward, and  articulating our long-term strategic objectives for Iraq.  2.  DOD cited the MNF-I/U.S. embassy-Iraq Joint Campaign Plan as a  comprehensive, government wide-plan that guides the effort to achieve  an Iraq that can govern, defend, and sustain itself. In our review of the  classified Joint Campaign Plan, however, we identified limitations to  the plan, which are discussed in a separate, classified GAO report\u2014 Stabilizing Iraq: DOD Should Identify and Prioritize the Conditions  Necessary for the Continued Drawdown of U.S. Forces. Further, we  believe that the Joint Campaign Plan is not a substitute for an updated  strategic plan for Iraq. As we stated in our report, a campaign plan is  an operational, not a strategic, plan, according DOD\u2019s doctrine for joint  operation planning. A campaign plan must rely on strategic guidance  from national authorities for its development. For example, the April  2006 MNF-I/U.S. embassy Baghdad Joint Campaign Plan relied on the  NSC\u2019s prior strategic plan, the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq, as  a basis for the plan\u2019s development. The classified campaign plan does  not provide Congress or the American people with the administration\u2019s  road map for achieving victory in Iraq.  3.  According to DOD, MNF-I and the U.S. embassy recently assessed the  security line of operation and determined that the goals for the phase  ending in summer 2008 have been met. We disagree with DOD\u2019s  statement that the security goals for this phase have been met. For  example, The New Way Forward stated that the Iraqi government  would take responsibility for security in all 18 provinces by November  2007, but only 8 of 18 provinces had transitioned to Iraqi control at that  time. As of June 18, 2008, only 9 of 18 provinces had transitioned. Our  classified report on the Joint Campaign Plan provides more  information on the goals of the security line of operation, the various  phases of the campaign plan, and a recent assessment of the security  line of operation.  4.  DOD stated that it is misleading for our report to characterize the Iraqi  security forces capability by giving the percentage of units at  Operational Readiness Assessment (ORA) level 1, noting that as of late  May 2008, 70 percent of Iraqi units were in the lead in  counterinsurgency operations. We added information on Iraqi units in  the lead to our report. However, we believe that the report is not  misleading by providing information on ORA level 1 units because this  was a benchmark established by Congress and derived from  benchmarks and commitments articulated by the Iraqi government  beginning in June 2006. Thus, the numbers of independent Iraqi  security forces as measured by ORA level 1 continue to be an  important measure of the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.  Further, as we discuss in the report, the term \u201cin the lead\u201d has evolved  to include less capable Iraqi security forces. Specifically, according to  testimony of the MNF-I Commanding General, MNF-I counted only  ORA level 1 and ORA level 2 units as \u201cin the lead\u201d in January 2007.  However, as of March 2008, MNF-I was also counting some ORA level  3 units\u2014that is, units only \u201cpartially capable of conducting  counterinsurgency operations\u201d\u2014as in the lead in counterinsurgency  operations.  5.  DOD disagreed with our measuring progress in power generation  against an ever-rising demand for electricity and noted that energy  production has increased over the past year. We present data on the  gap between supply and demand for electricity in Iraq because the  Departments of State and Defense use this statistic to measure  progress. We have updated our report to reflect data through May 2008  and DOD\u2019s statement regarding the slight increase in electricity  generation over the past year.  6.  DOD stated that the goal upon which we measure oil production  progress was an arbitrary goal set by the CPA. State Department had  similar technical comments. We used the goal of 3.0 mbpd production  capacity because the DOD command responsible for funding and  managing oil reconstruction projects in Iraq\u2014the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers\u2014has consistently used this goal to measure progress in  Iraq. As recently as April 2008, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has  included this goal in its weekly update to the Secretary of the Army.  We have updated our report to include oil production statistics  through May 2008.  7.  DOD stated that although the hydrocarbon legislation is important to  the economic development of Iraq, Iraq\u2019s oil wealth is being distributed  to provinces on a reasonably equitable basis. Providing Iraq\u2019s oil  wealth through the budget process is not a sustainable solution to  equitably distribute resources since allocations must be negotiated  annually. The hydrocarbon legislation intends to provide an enduring  resolution for the management and control of Iraq\u2019s current and future  hydrocarbon resources and the distribution of revenues from them.  Furthermore, this legislation is to provide a transparent legal  framework that defines the rights of foreign investors and encourages  the foreign investment needed to modernize Iraq\u2019s oil sector.  8.  We updated our report to include enemy-initiated attacks data for May  2008.
