The Committee designated that the Small Business Administration be responsible for providing export training to new-to-export firms. Both the Department of Commerce and U.S. Export-Import Bank staffs provide information on their agencies\u2019 programs during the training sessions. Because export training is the first step in assisting new-to-export firms, you asked us to assess how well the agencies were (1) coordinating the delivery of export training and (2) measuring training program results.", "The Department of Commerce did not coordinate closely with the Small Business Administration in introducing its export training program. As a result, Commerce and the Small Business Administration provide separate and duplicative training programs for potential small business exporters, although the Commerce program is aimed at serving minority- and women-owned firms. The goal of both programs is to create an interest in exporting and a demand for export services. Both training programs have the same objectives and similar content and seek to serve a similar mix of clients. Such duplication can result in agency staff being diverted from their primary responsibilities of making loans and counseling clients. Three of the 10 U.S. Export Assistance Centers that we visited had decided to combine both programs into a single export training program serving potential exporters. The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, located in the Office of the Secretary of Commerce, did not prevent these duplicative efforts.", "Neither Commerce nor the Small Business Administration systematically collect outcome data for their export training programs.  Instead, both agencies track the number of clients trained and Commerce identifies export successes for its clients overall but not specifically for its training participants. Small Business Administration survey data indicate that few training participants have used the export services provided by the centers sponsoring the training, but they do not explain the reasons for these results. Neither Commerce nor Small Business Administration staff systematically follow up with training participants to learn whether they have exported, the difficulties they encountered, and how the training programs might need to be adjusted to be more helpful. According to some training sponsors, the difficulty of recruiting qualified firms has resulted in the expansion of participant criteria to include non-export-ready firms, which may explain why few participants have used export services.", "In this report, we are recommending that the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee eliminate duplication of export training services by determining the best way to combine the Small Business Administration and Commerce\u2019s export training programs delivered by the U.S. Export Assistance Centers.

The other USEAC partners, the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), were to provide firms with export financing support. In addition, SBA was to provide training for new-to-export firms through its Export Trade Assistance Partnership program. The program provides training, counseling, and trade mission opportunities available from federal, public, and private organizations.", "Commerce\u2019s Office of U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service and SBA\u2019s Office of International Trade oversee their staffs at the 19 USEACs\u2014 generally one SBA loan officer and several Commerce trade specialists per USEAC. The USEACs are aided by a nationwide network of 55 domestically focused Commerce District Export Councils (comprised of local businesses) as well as over 1,000 Small Business Development Centers, partially funded by SBA. In addition, USEACs partner with chambers of commerce, trade centers, and colleges and universities to encourage small businesses to expand their export activities and to assist small businesses seeking to export.", "To increase the number of U.S. exporters, Commerce and SBA seek to identify export-capable firms that are not yet exporting and provide them with export training opportunities. Commerce and SBA staff recruit attendees through trade associations, chambers of commerce, advertising, seminar attendance, and cold-calling firms. SBA\u2019s Office of International Trade requires its staff to conduct one Export Trade Assistance Partnership program annually. SBA does not provide training program funding. Training facilitation is a collateral duty of SBA\u2019s staff at the USEACs and a small part of their required performance criteria.", "Both SBA and Commerce work with other federal and state agencies to deliver the training curriculum. For example, SBA , Commerce, and Eximbank staff at the USEACs participate in export training by providing information on their agencies\u2019 programs. In addition, public and private entities, such as state export promotion agencies or local colleges, sometimes present information on specific export topics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Two Export Training Programs Were Not Coordinated", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Commerce did not coordinate closely with SBA when it developed a separate Commerce export training program in 1999 as part of the Global Diversity Initiative\u2014a Commerce effort to reach an underserved community of minority- and woman-owned firms. Six years after the TPCC delineated agency roles at USEACs, Commerce\u2019s U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service began offering export training, known as the Market Entry Program, that duplicated training provided by SBA. Not only are the program objectives similar, but the participant criteria and the curricula are very much the same. (See table 1.) Moreover, speakers for the programs were the same. Several of the centers have combined program presentations. TPCC officials, located in the Secretary of Commerce\u2019s Office, were aware that Commerce had instituted the Market Entry Program at the USEACs but were unaware that it duplicated SBA\u2019s training.", "Seven of the 10 U.S. Export Assistance Centers we visited had conducted both Export Trade Assistance Partnership and Market Entry Programs. Training agendas at three of these centers were identical, while the training agendas at the remaining four centers were similar. Similar course topics for both programs include market research, market entry and pricing, legal aspects of exporting, required documentation and transportation methods, the regulatory environment of importing countries, international methods of payment, trade finance, and cultural nuances.", "SBA and Commerce USEAC staff at nearly all of the centers that we visited routinely present information on their services at each other\u2019s programs. Moreover, both agencies\u2019 staff assist each other in identifying potential training participants. The one SBA staff at each USEAC not only develops the SBA training as a collateral duty but also participates in Commerce\u2019s training program. Sponsoring the program can be time- consuming, particularly the process of recruiting firms, according to SBA officials. SBA program guidelines suggest using Commerce staff and others to help design and deliver the program, and Commerce USEAC staff have done so. Commerce, which has several staff at most USEACs, has dedicated staff to facilitate the Market Entry Program and has provided program funding. In addition to 2 headquarters staff administrators, Commerce has dedicated 4 staff as field coordinators and 21 as trade specialists in the USEACs to assist with the training, in addition to their other duties. Market Entry Program guidelines require Commerce program coordinators to use SBA staff to identify and provide outreach to minority firms.", "Because both training programs have similar course topics and common presenters and serve similar clients, Commerce and SBA staff at three U.S. Export Assistance Centers have combined the Export Trade Assistance Partnership and the Market Entry Programs into a single training program.

The TPCC annually requires member agencies to submit information on their trade promotion efforts and identify program or agency issues as part of its mandate to create a unified budget and eliminate duplication. Citing the need to better coordinate trade promotion activities, the TPCC prioritizes member agencies\u2019 needs, uses agency initiatives to support those priorities, and submits a memorandum to OMB outlining them. Commerce\u2019s Global Diversity Initiative, identified as a relatively new initiative to outreach to underserved communities, was included to support a requested increase in funding for Commerce\u2019s U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service small business programs. When we spoke with TPCC officials in March 2001 regarding the similarities in SBA\u2019s and Commerce\u2019s export training programs, they were unaware of how the programs were duplicative.

SBA data collected in the spring of 2001 indicate that only a few training participants later used Commerce\u2019s products and services.

SBA regularly collects loan data for its clients, but it does not systematically collect data on export sales generated by training participants. For example, SBA headquarters officials requested data on export sales generated by Export Trade Assistance Partnership Program participants in fiscal year 2000, but several SBA staff at the USEACs that we visited told us that no such request has been made for fiscal year 2001.

As mentioned earlier, SBA conducted a one-time survey to collect that data, but it does not do so on a regular basis. In that survey, SBA trainers reported that 96 of the 1,196 firms that received training (8 percent) had generated $452 million in export sales. However, that data may overstate program results. According to the survey data provided to us, a portion of the export sales identified came from firms that had received export training but also had already been exporters. Consequently, not all of the $452 million in export sales can be claimed as a result of the training received by these firms.", "According to Commerce officials, it takes about a year or more to become an active exporter. SBA officials said that they may become aware of training participant exports when the participant uses a USEAC product, but they said that they have not been able to systematically track graduates. Commerce\u2019s Market Entry Program, begun in fiscal year 1999, has had time to show some results. Commerce officials also cited the difficulty of tracking participants but told us that they knew of a few participants that had gone on to export. Tracking training participants is both time-consuming and challenging, according to both SBA and Commerce officials, due to the lag time between the business\u2019s first exposure to the training material and its eventual success in entering an export market. Other factors may also complicate the collection of data needed for tracking outcomes. In some cases, for example, firms that are already exporting may send its employees for training, but it would not be appropriate to count these firms as new exporters or count their exports as additional exports.

According to SBA and Commerce officials, a general lack of interest in exporting by small firms and the availability of similar training locally at world trade centers and universities make it difficult to find firms willing to dedicate work time to training or to find qualified training participants. At one USEAC, several classes were cancelled due to lack of interest, while other USEACs experienced high dropout rates. Difficulty in recruiting and the need to fill classes resulted in letting firms enroll, even if they did not have an exportable product or were in fact large manufacturing firms. Moreover, not all participants in the seminars were focused on becoming exporters. For example, with local needs driving course content, the objectives in one training seminar were expanded to include providing information about importing.

Training officials told us that exporters face numerous difficulties in foreign markets, such as finding local agents as well as dealing with requirements imposed by foreign governments. In addition, small business loans have become increasingly difficult to find due to changes in the U.S. banking sector.

Commerce\u2019s objective of increasing various minority and women exporters through training could have been accomplished by coordinating with SBA trainers to emphasize minority- and women-owned businesses when recruiting for their program. In fact, both agencies have experienced difficulties in identifying export-capable firms that could benefit from export training and in recruiting such firms for the training programs they are providing. Also, Commerce and SBA have not systematically conducted follow-up contacts with training participants in order to understand their export experiences and make training program adjustments to better serve potential small business exporters.
