Specifically, this report addresses FEMA's efforts to implement, assess, and improve selected disaster response programs for urban search and rescue, incident management, and evacuation tracking. GAO reviewed documentation such as policies, procedures, after action reports, and readiness assessments for these programs and deployments to select disasters for fiscal years 2010 through 2014\u2014capturing pre and post Hurricane Sandy disasters.

Specifically, GAO found that FEMA uses leading management practices in implementing its Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) program. For example, FEMA has aligned the mission of the US&R Program--to save lives and reduce suffering in communities impacted by a disaster-- with its goal setting efforts in its US&R Strategic Plan. It also communicates program risks to stakeholders and assesses performance so the program can be continuously strengthened. However, all nine US&R task forces GAO interviewed reported challenges funding the maintenance and replacement of their aging equipment to ensure that it is not outdated and adheres to manufacturer standards. FEMA has not developed a plan to prioritize and fund the replacement of this equipment and doing so would help ensure that these task forces are capable of meeting their important response mission.", "FEMA applies some leading program management practices in implementing, assessing, and improving its Incident Management Assistance Teams (IMAT)\u2014such as setting strategic goals and identifying program risks\u2014but does not use other practices that would enhance program management. National and regional IMAT team members are comprised of FEMA employees hired on temporary 4-year contracts. GAO found that FEMA lacks a standardized plan to ensure that all national and regional IMAT members receive required training, and IMAT teams do not always develop after action reports after disaster deployments and document lessons learned. GAO also found that the IMAT program has experienced high attrition across national and regional IMAT teams\u2014since its implementation in fiscal year 2013\u2014and FEMA has not developed a strategy to address these challenges. Developing a plan to address training and retention challenges would help FEMA better meet IMAT program goals.", "FEMA's efforts to implement, assess, and improve its evacuation tracking system nationwide have been inconsistent due to lack of state and local resources and interest in using the system. However, FEMA officials said they are taking steps to address concerns raised by users of the system, including technical issues with the software. For example, FEMA has developed a new implementation plan to provide guidance to its regional offices for better communicating and training state and local officials on the use of its tracking software and intends to finalize a system strategic plan in the next nine to 15 months. Since these efforts are ongoing, GAO cannot yet assess the extent that they will address the inconsistences or user concerns with the system."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FEMA develop a plan to prioritize and fund the replacement of US&R task force equipment; a plan to ensure that IMAT teams receive required training, and a workforce strategy for retention of IMAT staff; and document, track, and analyze recommendations and lessons learned from disaster deployments.

In an emergency that  requires a federal response, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) assists state,  local, and tribal governments in coordinating response and recovery  efforts and provides federal disaster response resources including search  and rescue teams, incident response teams, and evacuation assistance,  when applicable. For example, in March 2014, a mudslide traveling  about 200 miles per hour flooded the city of Oso, Washington without  warning and spread debris over 300 acres. The slide was massive,  covering 6,000 feet of highway, destroying over 50 homes, blocking the  North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, and creating a dam that then  formed a lake where none had existed before. On this day, there were 59  people at home when the slide hit; only 16 survived. FEMA deployed its  urban search and rescue (US&R) task forces to help locate survivors and  human remains as well as its incident management assistance teams  (IMAT)  to assist with response efforts. These FEMA disaster response  programs are called for in the Post-Katrina Emergency Management  Reform Act of 2006 (Post-Katrina Act) along with a requirement that  FEMA assist state and local officials with evacuation planning. One way  in which FEMA is meeting this requirement is the creation of the National  Mass Evacuation Tracking System (NMETS). These programs along with  several other FEMA programs were established in response to disasters  such as Hurricane Katrina which severely tested disaster management at  the federal, state, and local levels and revealed weaknesses in response  programs.", "You asked us to review aspects of select FEMA disaster response  programs. This report addresses FEMA\u2019s efforts to implement, assess  and improve disaster response programs for urban search and rescue,  incident management, and evacuation tracking.", "To answer our objective, we gathered and reviewed relevant  documentation such as policies and procedures, program directives,  strategic plans, guides, memoranda and internal documents for each of  the programs. We also gathered data on program expenditure costs, and  the type and number of deployments for each of the programs for fiscal  years 2010 through 2014. We selected disasters during this time frame to  which FEMA deployed both a US&R task force and an IMAT  team, and to  capture any changes made to the US&R and IMAT  programs based on  their response to Hurricane Sandy which struck the United States in  October 2012. As a result, we selected seven disasters for review. For  FEMA\u2019s US&R program, we interviewed 10 US&R task forces to discuss  their response to recent disasters, coordination with federal, state, and  local officials, and strengths and challenges with the program. We  selected 3 task forces from each US&R division that responded to at least  one disaster that an IMAT  responded to from 2010 to 2014, and that  included a mix of types of responses (e.g. responses to hurricanes,  tornadoes, and mudslides), as well as 1 inactive task force. We also  observed an US&R exercise in April 2015 to gather information on the  US&R roles, response, and specialized equipment used during an  incident or disaster.

Following the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma the US&R program added the ability to field  task forces for National Special Security Events and first exercised this  ability at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and the 1997 presidential  inauguration in Washington D.C. After the terrorist attacks of September  11, 2001 (9/11), the US&R program developed operational capabilities for  chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive environments. In  addition to receiving annual appropriations, in 2002, Congress  appropriated $54 million to the task forces, as part of a supplemental  appropriation. Between 1992 and 2014, the US&R task forces have  deployed to 77 events (see appendix II for the list of events), including the  attacks on 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Sandy, the earthquake in  Haiti, and prepositioning for National Special Security Events.", "The US&R program includes 28 US&R task forces across the United  States, as shown in figure 1. Each task force is sponsored by an  emergency management response agency, typically a fire department.  Task force members are career or volunteer first responders, such as  canine handlers, physicians, and structural engineers. Every task force  has up to 210 members that are to be capable of arriving on scene at a  disaster within 16 hours of notification. The task forces are designed with  \u201cthree-deep\u201d rosters, meaning they strive to have at least three people to  fill each staff position on the roster. The positions on the roster differ  based on the type of team. Type 1 teams have 70 personnel with a full  equipment cache and the capacity to respond to hazardous materials  (Hazmat) and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive  incidents. Type 3 teams have 28 personnel and a smaller equipment  cache that is primarily designed to response to weather-driven  disasters.", "Each US&R task force is to maintain a cache of equipment in eight  categories: communications, Hazmat, logistics, medical, planning, rescue,  technical, and water, as shown in figure 2. The cache requirements are  uniform for each task force, a fact that promotes interoperability among  task forces when they are working together on a deployment. Each task  force maintains a cache of more than 2,000 types of items and there may  be more than one of each item. For example, hydrogen peroxide is one  item on the cache list used for wound care, but the team is required to  carry 10 units, or bottles, of that item. The items in each category range  from small, easy to transport items like hand held radios and hammers, to  large items that require special transportation, such as water rescue  boats. Some items require replacement after use, like bandages, while  others should last years, like a canine kennel. Some items in the cache  are low-cost and routinely replaced, while others require regular  maintenance and are costly to replace. For example, the 2014 unit price  of the Raker Shore System, a pneumatic powered tool that is used for  rescue, is $16,832, while aspirin used for medical treatment costs $0.03  per tablet.", "The US&R program is managed by FEMA\u2019s Operations Division\u2019s US&R  Branch of the Response Directorate.

In accordance  with guidance from the US&R program\u2019s Strategic Group, FEMA allocates  a portion of its annual appropriation to each task force for training  exercises, equipment acquisition and maintenance, program  management, and other support functions. Annual costs are funded  through readiness cooperative agreements between FEMA and each of  the 28 task force sponsoring agencies. Between fiscal year 2010 and  fiscal year 2014, each US&R task force received an average of $1.1  million per year in cooperative agreement funds.

The IMAT  program includes 3 national teams and 13  regional teams across FEMA\u2019s 10 regions. (See appendix III  for a map  with IMAT  locations).  National IMAT  teams typically respond to Level I  catastrophic events which require significant federal assistance and  coordination in response and recovery. Regional teams typically respond  to Level II  and III  incidents that may require a high or moderate amount of  federal assistance. IMATs can also provide assistance in events that  are not disasters, such as National Special Security Events. For example,  the national IMAT  teams assisted the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention in the Ebola response as well as providing support during the  influx of unaccompanied minors in 2014.

After FEMA used nearly all of its IMAT  teams in  response to Hurricane Sandy, the agency increased the number of IMAT  staff. FEMA increased total program staffing by replacing its 97  permanent full time employees in fiscal year 2010 with 255 new CORE  positions for fiscal year 2015. CORE IMAT  employees are hired on 4-year  contracts, and the positions may be renewed if there is ongoing disaster  work and funding is available. Under the new team composition, the 3  national IMAT  teams grew from 16-member teams staffed by permanent  full time employees to 32-member teams staffed by CORE employees. At  the same time, the regional IMAT  teams grew from teams of 4 permanent  full time employees to teams of 12 CORE employees (See appendix IV  for national and regional IMAT  position organizational charts). In  establishing the CORE teams, FEMA shifted all program funding to the  disaster relief fund and program expenditures increased from  approximately $13 million in fiscal year 2010 to $35 million obligated from  the disaster relief fund for fiscal year 2015 (to include all salaries and  benefits and available program costs, but not including disaster-specific  costs).

The  US&R Strategic Plan outlines six mission goals including response,  readiness, communication, collaboration, accountability, and  implementation of the US&R strategic training plan. US&R program  officers established specific objectives, strategies, and performance  measures to support the goals. For example, one goal is to save lives  and protect property in an all-hazards environment. An objective  supporting this goal is refinement of the structural collapse mission. In  an effort to achieve this objective, the US&R program plans to  develop, review, and update deployment concepts of operations for  potential secondary missions such as Hazmat and human remains  detection canine missions. State emergency managers we spoke with  said that during a disaster, US&R task forces will do whatever is  needed to achieve their mission. During recent disasters, this has  meant that the US&R task forces provided assistance beyond  traditional structural collapse operations. For example, in response to  Hurricane Sandy, task forces were needed to provide humanitarian  assistance in conducting wellness checks in affected neighborhoods.  After the mudslide in Oso, Washington, US&R task forces were  needed to conduct canine human remains detection searches, and  the task forces deployed 22 canine units. The clear mission,  objectives, and strategies set by the program gives the task forces the  authority to take action to save lives and help the task forces achieve  their overarching mission. This alignment of agency mission with  strategic goals and resources is a leading practice for effective  program management.", "Communication:  FEMA communicates US&R program risks and  performance issues through the US&R Advisory Organization. The  advisory organization is composed of senior members or specialists  from the 28 task forces. When the task forces raise an issue to the  advisory organization, it is to assign subgroups to examine the issue  in order to propose a solution or course of action. For example, at a  September 2015 meeting of the organization, the Logistics sub-group  briefed the advisory organization on a plan they are developing to  reduce the equipment cache to ensure they are able to rapidly  respond to incidents. The advisory organization maintains an Action  Tracker List with priority issues that the group addresses. A majority  of the task forces (6 of the 9 we contacted) said the advisory  organization was an effective mechanism for collaboration and  communication and addressing challenges within the US&R program.  Creating a venue for communicating program risks and uncertainties  and addressing issues that arise during the course of program  performance is another leading practice for effective program  management.", "Program execution: Each of the 28 US&R task forces uses the same  operations manual, which outlines procedures for task force  activation, operation in the field, and demobilization. All 9 task forces  we interviewed reported that they rely on the operations manual as a  reference to conduct task force operations. In addition, each of the 28  US&R task forces is governed by a similar cooperative agreement  between its sponsoring agency and FEMA and the members of each  task force must meet the same training standards and carry the same  equipment cache. This uniformity in management of the task forces  promotes interoperability  and reliability,  both for task forces  collaborating in a disaster response and for states anticipating US&R  assistance after a request to FEMA. This is also a leading practice for  effective program management.", "FEMA officials cited several benefits of the US&R program. For example,  they said the US&R program is more cost-efficient than a full-time federal  US&R resource. They estimated that, in order to staff three shifts (or 24  hour coverage) of an equivalent,  federally-maintained 70 member US&R  team, it would cost $22.7 million per task force. In comparison, the fiscal  year 2014 budget for the US&R program (all 28 task forces) was  approximately $35 million. They also said that US&R sponsoring  agencies benefit from sponsoring a task force because the training and  equipment they receive is often valuable for their primary function as a  fire department or emergency response agency. Eight out of nine state  emergency managers we interviewed expressed a positive opinion of the  US&R program and said that they would request search and rescue  assistance from FEMA if it was ever needed.

We found that each AAR includes a  standard format for communicating and addressing issues that arose  during the course of US&R\u2019s Task Forces\u2019 response to specific  disasters. For example, in response to the 2013 Colorado flooding,  each task force deployed (four in total) issued an AAR containing the  areas cited above\u2014which included a section on the task force\u2019s  performance on six elements: search, medical, rescue, safety,  communications, and logistics. For each element, a description of the  task, analysis of performance, and improvement action to be taken  was reported, if applicable.", "Administrative readiness evaluations: These evaluations assess  task forces on their readiness for deployment and include two parts:  an annual self-assessment conducted by each task force and a  triennial peer review, led by members of peer task forces.

We  reviewed 28 evaluations which included one evaluation for each of the  28 task forces for fiscal years 2012 through 2014. On the basis of the  results of the peer evaluation, task forces may be deemed \u201cfully  operational\u201d, \u201cconditional,\u201d or \u201cnon-operational\u201d. If a task force is not  fully operational, it must develop a corrective action plan in  collaboration with officials from the FEMA US&R Branch and  implement that plan. We found that 1 of the 28 US&R task forces has  been in a conditional or non-operational status for 7 years. That task  force was first placed on non-operational status in 2007 and regained  conditional status in 2010, only to fall back to non-operational status in  2012. That task force was again placed on conditional status in 2013,  non-operational in 2014, and in September 2015, FEMA announced  that it would be removed from the US&R program. FEMA US&R  officials said they had provided sufficient time for the task force to take  corrective actions, but the task force failed to effectively respond.  During our review, FEMA issued a draft program memorandum with  administrative procedures for removing task forces that fail to regain  fully-operational  status within 2 years of being placed on non- operational status. According to the draft program memorandum,  the task force will have the opportunity to appeal the decision for its  removal.", "Operational Readiness Exercise Evaluation Program: This  program requires task forces to conduct a large-scale training  exercise every 3 years, develop a training plan based on that  exercise, and update the plan annually. Task forces use the Exercise  Evaluation Guide to assess their performance. We observed one of  FEMA\u2019s large-scale exercises in April 2015, where US&R task forces  conducted three rescue scenarios and were evaluated on their  performance. In addition, we reviewed the results for another large- scale training exercise and found that the reporting followed the  criteria laid out in the US&R evaluation guide.

While some items are low-cost and  routinely replaced after use, like bandages, other items have a much  longer service life, may require regular maintenance, and are costly to  replace. For example, each task force has pneumatic powered tools, such  as the strut system which is used to support collapsed buildings for  search and rescue. The total strut kit, which consists of multiple  expandable struts and other support equipment, cost about $72,000 in  2014, see figure 4 for an example of its use.", "Task force leaders we interviewed identified challenges in funding  maintenance and upgrade of the equipment in their cache, along with  adhering to recommended manufacturer shelf life requirements. For  example, the standard US&R radio system is 10 years old and is  becoming outdated. In addition, US&R hazmat equipment has a 5-year  replacement cycle and is due for replacement. Through the US&R  cooperative grant agreements, FEMA allocates about $155,000 to each  task force annually, identified for equipment maintenance and acquisition.  US&R team leaders said that the allocation covers equipment  maintenance but is not sufficient to acquire or replace equipment.", "The 2013-2017 US&R Strategic Plan identified the need for the Logistics  Functional Group within the advisory organization to develop a  replacement life cycle analysis as part of a strategy to finance the  replacement of high-cost items in the equipment caches. While FEMA  program officials have not yet developed this strategy, they have drafted  a position paper detailing the life cycle and costs (along with multiple  replacement options) for one piece of critical equipment in the US&R  cache\u2014the self-contained breathing apparatus. In September 2015,  FEMA replaced this piece of equipment (approximately $1.1 million) using  funding that had been intended for the task force that was de- commissioned during the course of our review. In addition, FEMA  changed the funding cycle for the annual grants from 1 year to 3 years  beginning in 2015 in an effort to provide task forces more flexibility  for  high-dollar purchases. Task force managers we spoke with reported that  a longer funding cycle could help them budget for equipment  replacement.

A key component of  effective program management is committing resources that support the  goals and strategic mission of the program. The Standard for Program  Management calls for agencies to engage in resource planning to  determine which resources are needed and when they are needed to  successfully implement the program. FEMA program managers agreed  that a comprehensive plan would help them better prioritize future high- cost equipment purchases, noting that they had not yet focused their  management attention on this issue.

For example, to share  lessons learned and best practices after deployments and exercises,  IMAT  team leaders hold monthly meetings. These meetings provide an  opportunity for team leaders to address challenges or problems that arise  during incidents and work to establish strategies to resolve these issues.  FEMA Response Directorate officials also told us that IMAT  members  participate in monthly meetings so that those performing the same job  functions can share experiences and strategies for effective disaster  response. FEMA officials also communicate potential program risks and  performance issues through three strategic working groups, which  address program-specific challenges in the areas of retention, training,  and equipment. These groups allow IMAT  members to discuss issues  and share findings and recommendations for program changes. For  example, one working group is exploring ways to centralize certain types  of equipment to be used during catastrophic incidents.", "With the implementation of the new CORE IMAT  program in 2013, FEMA  Response Directorate officials also employed leading practices in  program management for promoting program execution by enabling staff  to obtain training. Specifically, they established a preliminary training  program through the IMAT  Academy and long-term training requirements  for staff to acquire the requisite skills and abilities to effectively conduct  their position-specific responsibilities and become fully qualified under the  FEMA Qualification System (FQS). As part of their training, IMAT  members first participate in the 14-week IMAT  Academy, which includes  orientation to FEMA\u2019s emergency management system, team building,  and real-world exercises. IMAT  members are then to complete  subsequent cadre-specific training courses at the Emergency  Management Institute and build experience through on-the-job training  during disaster deployments and exercises to become qualified under  FQS.", "However, IMAT  leaders at the regional and national levels expressed  concerns about limited access to training opportunities after the academy  as well as limited funds available to enable IMAT  members to fulfill  training requirements. Specifically, all 10 regional IMAT  representatives  and 1 of 3 national team leaders said that there was not sufficient funding  or access to training opportunities for staff during their 4-year contracts as  CORE employees. Regional IMAT  team leaders said that many required  courses through the Emergency Management Institute are not offered  frequently enough for IMAT  members to attend, or have not yet been  developed. IMAT  leaders also said that limited funds and infrequent  disasters result in inconsistent training across teams. They also said that  since their regions do not have budgets dedicated to IMAT  training, they  do not track costs associated with regional IMAT  training. FEMA  Response Directorate officials told us that cadre managers in FEMA  headquarters are responsible for ensuring that staff in their cadres have  access to appropriate courses. Regional officials from one region also  told us that without planning to ensure consistent access to required  courses, it could take 2 years for some IMAT  CORE members to  complete all their cadre-specific requirements.", "Although state emergency managers reported having positive  experiences and strong relationships with the previous IMAT  teams  staffed by more experienced permanent full time FEMA employees, they  expressed concerns about a lack of qualified staff on the new CORE  IMATs. For example, officials from two states said that the previous  IMATs were very experienced and performed a key role in providing  management assistance during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. An official from  another state described crucial support provided by the previous IMATs  during the response to the Oso mudslide in 2014, including providing  technical and subject matter assistance and coordinating federal  resources. State officials had limited interactions with new CORE IMATs  but described mixed experiences. For example, officials in two states  expressed positive views of IMAT  assistance and the states\u2019 overall  relationships with the new IMATs,  while officials from two other states  where the new IMAT  teams had deployed expressed concerns about the  lack of experience among the new teams in performing key duties during  disaster response.

To improve FEMA\u2019s workforce planning and training  efforts, we recommended that they identify long-term goals, establish  timeframes for developing performance measures, and develop a  process to collect and analyze workforce and training data. In April  2015, FEMA said it would issue a Human Capital Strategic Plan  addressing these recommendations by September 2015. However,  we have not yet received documentation of this new plan. To  improve management and training in the Reservist program, we  recommended that FEMA take steps to improve monitoring and  communication of program policies across all regions, establish  criteria for program hiring, establish a more rigorous performance  appraisal system, and implement training milestones and a  mechanism to track training costs. FEMA has taken steps to address  these including updating policies and guidance, centralizing  management of the program, implementing a new communication  strategy, standardizing hiring criteria, establishing a training plan with  milestones, and establishing a system to track training costs.

As part of this reporting, FEMA has developed  annual performance metrics for IMATs,  including the ability of IMAT  teams to deploy to and stabilize an incident within 72 hours and  establish joint objectives with state partners within 18 hours. FEMA  Response Directorate officials capture and analyze this data through  the National Watch Center, which tracks IMAT  status and deployment  time after disaster declarations.

Discussions with IMAT  leaders conducted by the  strategic working group on retention revealed that turnover can have a  negative impact on IMAT  performance, relationships with state and other  partners, and team cohesion, and it may limit the return on investment of  hiring and training new CORE staff. See table 1 for FEMA\u2019s transition to  its new IMAT  teams and attrition.", "According to IMAT  officials from 9 of 10 regions and 1 of 3 national IMATs  key reasons cited for the attrition in the initial years of implementing the  program are the relatively low pay and lack of upward mobility for CORE  IMAT  members. FEMA\u2019s new pay-for-performance system for CORE  employees starts new staff at a pay rate lower than that of the permanent  full time employees previously staffing the IMATs, and team members  rely on disaster deployments and training exercises to receive  performance-based pay raises and bonuses. Because pay-for- performance is tied to disasters and training, team leaders said that it can  be challenging for team members to earn higher pay when there are not  opportunities to deploy to disasters and limited training opportunities.  Further, high attrition in the IMAT  program can be costly because of the  investment required to hire and train new staff. For example, as described  above, all new IMATs must participate in a 14-week IMAT  Academy.  According to FEMA, this costs approximately $39,000 per team member.  High attrition results in additional costs to FEMA to continually train new  staff to replace those who leave before completing their 4-year contracts.  For example, total IMAT  attrition cost FEMA $2.2 million in additional  IMAT  Academy training costs for training replacement CORE IMAT  team  members in fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, based on FEMA\u2019s  estimated cost per member.", "In response to concerns about attrition, FEMA Response Directorate  officials established a working group to address IMAT  retention in July  2015.
