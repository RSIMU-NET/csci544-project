Many of the data used by PREDICT come from internal FDA sources, such as FDA databases. PREDICT also uses data from sources outside of FDA, such as other federal agencies, states, and foreign governments. Some of the data are open source data\u2014information that is publicly available, such as information from newspapers and websites. FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) relies on other FDA offices and federal agencies to provide open source data for PREDICT, but ORA does not have a documented process for identifying, obtaining, and using the data, relying instead on an ad hoc process. Federal standards for internal control call for agencies to document internal controls. Without a documented process for identifying, obtaining, and using open source data, FDA does not have reasonable assurance that ORA will consistently identify, obtain, and use such data for PREDICT.", "The implementation of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enacted in 2011, will provide PREDICT with additional data for estimating the risk of imported food. FDA identified FSMA provisions likely to generate data, including the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP), which requires importers to verify that their foreign suppliers use processes and procedures that provide the same public health protection as applicable U.S. requirements. Because FSVP and other FSMA-related programs are still new and not yet fully implemented, the details of how PREDICT will use the data have not been worked out. However, according to FDA officials, the data will be useful. For example, FSVP data will identify suppliers that are not in compliance with standards, and PREDICT will use those data in assigning risk scores to imports from those suppliers.", "FDA has assessed the effectiveness of PREDICT by monitoring of key data and by conducting an internal evaluation of the system, and it has implemented many, but not all, of its recommendations from the evaluation. GAO's analysis of FDA data from fiscal year 2012 through 2014 shows that in general, PREDICT is working as intended: imported food with higher-risk scores is more likely to be physically examined and to be found in violation of food safety standards or labeling requirements. In May 2013, FDA completed an evaluation of PREDICT that examined five key processes. As a result of the evaluation, FDA developed 24 recommendations for improving PREDICT and prioritized these recommendations based on feasibility and impact. According to FDA, the agency has fully implemented 15, partially implemented 6, and not implemented 3 of the recommendations. FDA officials said that the agency has not fully implemented all recommendations because of a lack of resources. However, federal standards for internal control specify that agencies are to ensure that the findings of reviews are promptly resolved. To that end, agencies are to complete, within established time frames, all actions that correct or otherwise resolve the matters brought to management's attention.

According to a 2013 report by the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA), 15 percent of the U.S. food supply was imported,  including nearly 50 percent of fresh fruits and 20 percent of fresh  vegetables. In addition, according to the National Marine Fisheries  Service (NMFS) about 94 percent of seafood consumed in the United  States was imported in 2014. FDA, under the Department of Health and  Human Services, is responsible for oversight of more than 80 percent of  the U.S. food supply. In fiscal year 2002, imported entry lines\u2014an entry  line is each portion of an import shipment that is listed as a separate item  on an entry document\u2014of FDA-regulated food totaled approximately 4.4  million. According to FDA, by 2015, this number had nearly tripled to  approximately 12 million. The total volume of U.S. food imports under  FDA\u2019s jurisdiction has increased from approximately 39 million metric tons  in 1999 to 67 million metric tons in 2014, based on data compiled by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Economic Research Service  (see fig. 1). Given the volume of imports into the country, there is  considerable potential for violative items\u2014products that do not meet U.S.  safety standards or labeling requirements\u2014to enter the U.S. food supply.", "FDA is responsible for helping to ensure that certain food products  marketed in the United States meet certain statutory and regulatory  requirements, whether the products are produced in the United States or  another country. FDA staff work with personnel from the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to  examine violative products. In 2007, we added the federal oversight of  food safety to our list of high-risk areas needing broad-based  transformation, largely because of inconsistent oversight, ineffective  coordination, and inefficient use of resources. Since then, we have found  shortcomings with FDA\u2019s oversight of imported food safety. We made  numerous recommendations, and the agency has implemented all of  them.", "The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enacted in January  2011, expanded and modified previously existing FDA authorities, giving  FDA several new authorities that enhance the agency\u2019s oversight of  imported food. Also, in December 2011, FDA fully implemented its  Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance  Targeting (PREDICT), a computerized tool intended to improve the  screening of FDA-regulated imports and the targeting of entry lines for  examination. PREDICT is designed to estimate the risk of imports using  information such as the history of the facility, inspection records, and  country of origin. FDA staff called entry reviewers use these risk  estimates to target for examination shipments with high levels of risk,  while the tool encourages entry reviewers to allow shipments with low  levels of risk to enter the United States with minimal review.", "In 2014, we found that FDA did not examine for pesticide residues the  majority of entry lines that had the highest PREDICT risk scores and that  the agency\u2019s plan to test the tool\u2019s reliability lacked statistically valid  measures. The Department of Health and Human Services indicated that  it would investigate the feasibility and potential costs of implementing this  recommendation and described its ongoing efforts. In 2015, we found  that FDA was not conducting the number of foreign food facility  inspections\u2014the results of which are used in PREDICT\u2014mandated  under FSMA. We recommended that the agency complete an analysis  to determine the annual number of foreign food inspections that is  sufficient to ensure comparable safety of imported and domestic food  and, if appropriate, recommend appropriate legislative changes. FDA  concurred with this recommendation, pending the acquisition of the  resources necessary to conduct the analysis.", "With imported food making up a substantial and growing portion of the  U.S. food supply, you asked us to review how FDA is using PREDICT to  protect the safety of the U.S. food supply.

We examined the data sources,  data quality controls, and methodology used by PREDICT and assessed  them to ensure that they were sufficiently reliable to support accurate  descriptions of the system inputs, processes, and resulting risk scores. To  determine how implementation of FSMA will affect PREDICT, we  reviewed FDA proposed and final rules implementing FSMA, reviewed  FDA documents, and interviewed FDA officials. To determine the extent  to which FDA has assessed the effectiveness of PREDICT and used the  results of those assessments to improve the tool, we interviewed FDA  officials about the ways in which FDA has assessed PREDICT, reviewed  the evaluation that FDA has conducted, and assessed the extent to which  FDA has implemented the recommendations from the evaluation.", "As discussed above, we examined the data sources, data quality  controls, and methodology used by PREDICT and assessed them to  ensure that they were sufficiently reliable to support accurate descriptions  of the system inputs, processes, and resulting risk scores.

These new provisions included new  requirements and authorities for FDA, including a requirement to develop a comprehensive plan to expand the food  safety capacity of foreign governments; a requirement to increase inspections of foreign food facilities and the  authority to enter into cooperative arrangements with foreign  governments to facilitate the inspection of foreign food facilities; the authority, under certain circumstances, to require as a condition of  admission that imported food be accompanied by certifications or  assurances from accredited third-party certification bodies, agencies,  or representatives of foreign governments where the food originated;  and  the authority to require importers to verify that their foreign suppliers  meet applicable U.S. food safety standards.", "Owing in part to the volume of imported food, FDA cannot physically  examine every shipment; the agency examines about 1 percent of entry  lines annually. FDA electronically screens all imported food shipments to  determine which imports to physically examine at the border and which  imports to allow into U.S. commerce.", "The electronic screening process consists of two phases: (1) Prior Notice  screening, which is intended to protect against potential terrorist acts and  other public health emergencies, and (2) admissibility screening, which is  intended to ensure that the food is admissible under the Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Imported food products are generally considered  admissible if they are in compliance with applicable FDCA regulations  that ensure food is not adulterated, misbranded, manufactured or packed  under insanitary conditions, or restricted in sale in the country in which it  was produced or from which it was exported, among other things.", "The first phase, Prior Notice screening, requires that an importer, broker,  or other entity submit notification to FDA of food being imported or offered  for import into the United States before that food arrives at the port of  entry. Prior Notice information includes data such as the names and  addresses of the manufacturer or grower, importer, owner, and ultimate  consignee (the \u201cdeliver to\u201d location); FDA product code for the food item;  and country of production. Information that FDA uses for Prior Notice  review can either be submitted electronically through CBP\u2019s system,  which passes the information to FDA, or submitted electronically directly  to FDA. FDA targets, screens, and reviews the information to ensure that  the information meets the Prior Notice requirements and to determine  whether the food potentially poses a terrorism threat or other significant  health risk. If such risks are identified, FDA is to work with CBP to  examine the shipment upon arrival at the port. If adequate Prior Notice  information is not provided, the food is subject to refusal of admission and  may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or consignee. If FDA  subsequently verifies that adequate Prior Notice information is provided  and the food does not appear to pose a terrorism threat, the shipment is  allowed to proceed to FDA\u2019s admissibility screening.", "During the second phase, admissibility screening, FDA electronically  screens entry lines using PREDICT to determine their level of risk.  \u201cRisk\u201d\u2014reflected by the PREDICT risk score\u2014includes factors such as  the inherent health risk of the product, compliance risk associated with  firms, facility inspection results, and broker history, among others, and is  then compared to all other entry lines within a specified commodity over  the past 30 days. If PREDICT determines that an entry line poses a low  risk, PREDICT recommends the entry be allowed to enter into U.S.  commerce, and another FDA system, called the Operational and  Administrative System for Import Support (OASIS), issues a system- generated \u201cMay Proceed\u201d message, allowing the product into U.S.  commerce without further review. If PREDICT determines that the entry  line poses a high risk, an entry reviewer decides whether to examine the  entry line for admissibility. The entry reviewer determines if the entry line  is under import alert. If the entry line is not under import alert and no  further examination is needed, the entry reviewer allows the entry line into  U.S. commerce by issuing a manual \u201cMay Proceed\u201d message through  OASIS. The entry reviewer may determine that a field or laboratory  examination is needed for an entry line that is not under an import alert. In  this case, an FDA investigator examines the entry either at the port of  entry or at another location, such as the importer\u2019s or consignee\u2019s  warehouse or a cold storage facility. The investigator may examine a  product\u2019s label to determine whether it meets labeling requirements.  Additionally, the investigator may examine the shipment for rodent or  insect activity or inadequate storage while in transit, among other things.  Figure 2 shows FDA investigators examining imported food.", "If the product does not appear to be violative after the examination, the  owner or consignee receives a notice stating that the line is released, and  the product is allowed into U.S. commerce.", "If the product appears to be violative, the investigator may decide to take  samples from the product for a laboratory examination to test for rodent or  insect activity and other such elements that could confirm that the entry is  violative. If the samples indicate that the food is not violative, the owner or  consignee receives a notice stating that the line is released, and the  product is allowed into U.S. commerce. If the samples are violative, the  owner or consignee receives a notice stating that the line is being  detained and is subject to refusal. Once the owner or consignee receives  a notice stating that the line is being detained and is subject to refusal,  the owner or consignee may request that FDA immediately refuse the  product, and the product must either be exported or destroyed. If the  owner or consignee does not request refusal, then the owner or  consignee decides whether to submit testimony or request to  \u201crecondition\u201d the product\u2014for example, relabeling the product or  converting the product into a type of product not regulated by FDA. If  the owner or consignee submits testimony regarding the admissibility of  the food or FDA approves a request to recondition the product, then an  FDA hearing determines whether the product should be released. If FDA  determines that the owner or consignee has provided sufficient  information to overcome the appearance of a violation, the owner or  consignee receives a notice stating that the product is released. If FDA  determines that the owner or consignee\u2019s actions failed to bring the  product into compliance, the food must be exported or destroyed.", "If the product is subject to an import alert, FDA determines whether the  product should be detained without physical examination. If FDA  determines that the product should not be detained, the owner or  consignee receives a notice stating that the product is released. If FDA  determines that the product should be detained, FDA issues a notice  stating that the line is being detained and is subject to refusal, and the  owner or consignee decides whether to export or destroy the product.  Figure 3 illustrates the key elements of FDA\u2019s screening process.", "From 2012 to 2014, about 0.1 percent of all food entry lines were refused  and exported or destroyed each year. During this period the countries  with the highest number of entry lines that were refused were India,  Mexico, and China and the most commonly refused items included rice,  herbals and botanicals (not teas), tuna, shrimp and aquaculture- harvested seafood products, and vitamins and minerals.", "When unsafe food enters the country, FDA may respond by issuing  advisories about the affected food. Depending on the circumstances, FDA  may also use other enforcement tools, such as seizure, injunction, and  administrative detention. FDA can also seek voluntary recalls of unsafe  food. If a responsible party does not voluntarily recall the food, FDA may  issue a mandatory recall order, provided that certain criteria are met.", "In early 2010, FDA began an effort to assess foreign food safety systems  to determine whether certain other countries have a regulatory system\u2014 including food safety statutes, regulations, and an implementation  strategy\u2014that is comparable to the U.S. food safety system. Under this  effort, FDA in 2010 developed a systems recognition tool to assess the  overall food safety systems of foreign countries for foods under FDA\u2019s  jurisdiction.

For  example, it may point out that some of the entry line data are missing or  invalid\u2014based on a comparison with other FDA databases\u2014and  recommend performing a manual review of databases.", "After PREDICT has applied the rules to the entry data, entry reviewers  analyze the results. The first thing an entry reviewer sees is the main  entry review screen, which lists all the current entry lines to be reviewed  and their PREDICT risk scores and flags. The entry reviewer can click on  a PREDICT risk score to see a table, referred to as the PREDICT  Mashup. The PREDICT Mashup displays the individual risk values that  contributed to the overall PREDICT risk score for that entry line. For  example, the PREDICT Mashup may show that PREDICT assigned the  product\u2019s manufacturer a risk-based score of 10 for its facility inspection  history, which would signify a high risk. The same Mashup may show  that PREDICT assigned the product\u2019s country of origin a risk-based score  of 3 for its history, which would signify a lower risk. The entry reviewer  can also \u201croll over,\u201d or move the cursor over, flags to obtain more  information. For example, an entry reviewer may roll over a \u201crecent  targeted activity\u201d flag\u2014which indicates that this product from this  manufacturer was recently examined\u2014to obtain information (sometimes  through another database) about when the product was examined and  the results of the examination.", "The entry reviewer uses all of this information to decide how to proceed.  For example, the entry reviewer may decide to allow the entry line to  proceed into commerce or to hold it for examination or laboratory  analysis. Any action taken by the entry reviewer, including the results of  any examination, will become part of the history of the facility, which will  then contribute to future PREDICT scores."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Implementation of FSMA Will Provide PREDICT with Additional Data on Imported Food", "paragraphs": ["FSMA, which was enacted in 2011, contains provisions that will provide  PREDICT with additional data to analyze (i.e., from additional sources)  when estimating the risk of imported food. FDA officials told us that even  with the changes brought about by FSMA, PREDICT will continue to be  used to target imports for examination but will now draw data from even  more sources. FDA officials identified five FSMA provisions and  authorities as likely to generate the most data for use in PREDICT. Of  these five, the first three are as follows:", "Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP): The FSVP rule  requires importers to verify that their foreign suppliers use processes  and procedures that provide the same level of public health protection  as the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls and other  applicable requirements of FDCA. For example, importers must  develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP that provides adequate  assurances that the foreign supplier is producing food that is, among  other things, not adulterated (e.g., that it does not contain Salmonella)  and is not misbranded with respect to labeling for the presence of  major food allergens. Verification activities could include monitoring  records, annual on-site inspections or review of such inspections  performed by a qualified auditor, and testing and sampling of  shipments. The date by which importers must comply with the FSVP  regulations depends on a number of factors.", "Inspection of foreign food facilities: FSMA includes a provision that  authorizes FDA to direct resources according to the known safety  risks of facilities, especially those that present a high risk. The law  directs FDA to inspect at least 600 foreign facilities within 1 year of  enactment of FSMA and, in each of the 5 years following that period,  to inspect at least twice the number it inspected during the previous  year.", "Laboratory accreditation: FSMA also includes a provision that  requires FDA to establish a program for the testing of food by  accredited laboratories and to recognize accreditation bodies for  accrediting the laboratories, including independent private  laboratories. The provision requires owners or consignees to have  food products tested by an accredited laboratory in certain  circumstances, including when a food product is under an import alert  that requires successful consecutive tests. The results of these tests  may be submitted to FDA electronically and used to determine  compliance and admissibility of the food product. FDA has not yet  issued a proposed rule for establishing the program, but an agency  official stated that the agency is working on a rule now.", "The other two FSMA provisions likely to generate data for use in  PREDICT are related to third-party certification, for which FDA issued the  final rule in November 2015. FSMA directs the establishment of a system  for the recognition of accreditation bodies to accredit third-party  certification bodies (also known as auditors) to certify that a foreign  facility, or any product produced by the facility, meets the applicable FDA  food safety requirements. If an accredited third-party certification body  or its audit agent discovers a condition that could cause or contribute to a  serious risk to public health, the certification body must immediately notify  FDA. The following two FSMA provisions rely on third-party  certifications and will likely generate data for use in PREDICT:", "Voluntary Qualified Importer Program (VQIP): FSMA requires FDA  to establish a program that offers expedited review and entry to  certain participating importers that import food from foreign facilities  certified by accredited third-party certification bodies. FDA published  draft guidance for VQIP in the Federal Register in June 2015.  According to an FDA Fact Sheet on VQIP, the agency expects to  begin receiving applications for the program in January 2018.", "Import certifications: Under FSMA, FDA has the authority, under  certain circumstances, to require certifications or other assurances  from agencies, or representatives of foreign governments where the  food originated, or an accredited third-party certification body. FDA  can determine that an article of food requires certification based on,  among other factors, the known safety risks associated with the food;  the country, territory, or region of origin of the food; or evidence that  the food safety systems for that product are inadequate. FDA  published the final rule on accreditation of third-party certification  bodies in the November 27, 2015, Federal Register.", "Because some of these FSMA-related programs are still new and not yet  fully implemented, the details of how certain data generated by these  programs will be integrated into PREDICT are not finalized, but according  to FDA officials, PREDICT will use data produced by these programs and  authorities in a variety of ways. Implementation of FSVP, for example, will  identify importers that are not in compliance, and PREDICT would use  that information in assigning risk scores to products from those importers.  The food products from suppliers and importers that have a history of  noncompliance with food safety regulations will receive higher PREDICT  risk scores than those that are consistently in compliance. In addition, if  the results from an inspection of a foreign food facility show that the  facility is noncompliant, that information would be provided to PREDICT,  and PREDICT would use that information in assigning risk scores to  imports from that facility.
