However, Enforcement does not have written procedures for generating its public reports (currently, the annual report), including for compiling and verifying the enforcement statistics used in the report. To produce the report, Enforcement staff told GAO that staff and officials hold meetings in which they determine which areas and accomplishments to highlight (see figure). Enforcement was not able to provide documentation demonstrating that the process it currently uses to prepare and review the report was implemented as intended.

According to SEC staff with whom we spoke, Enforcement\u2019s  annual report is not required by statute; rather, Enforcement voluntarily  publishes the report, which contains selected enforcement statistics and  narratives about enforcement priorities and cases.

Each year, SEC brings hundreds of enforcement actions\u2014including  judicial enforcement actions and administrative proceedings\u2014against  individuals and companies as a result of its investigations. Examples of  actions taken in fiscal year 2018 include charges against a company that  allegedly defrauded investors in a Ponzi scheme and charges against a  bank for misconduct in its sales practices for certain financial products  offered to retail investors.

Local CMS in regional offices  report to their regional managers but coordinate with the Enforcement  Case Management and Systems Reporting Group.
