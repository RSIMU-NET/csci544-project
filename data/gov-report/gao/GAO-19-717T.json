The PSLF program was established in 2007 and is intended to  encourage individuals to enter and continue careers in public service. It  does so by forgiving borrowers\u2019 remaining federal student loan balances  after they have made at least 10 years of loan payments while working in  qualifying public service jobs and meeting other requirements. Starting in  September 2017, the first borrowers began applying for loan forgiveness  through the PSLF program. After concerns were raised about high PSLF  denial rates and some borrowers facing barriers to pursuing loan  forgiveness, Congress appropriated $700 million in 2018 to temporarily  expand the PSLF program to forgive the loans of certain borrowers who  did not initially qualify. However, borrowers have continued to cite  problems with Education\u2019s management of the PSLF program and its  temporary expanded process.", "Drawing on our prior work on the PSLF program and the temporary  expanded process, my remarks today address (1) the extent to which  borrowers\u2019 applications for loan forgiveness through the PSLF program  and the temporary expanded process have been approved or denied, (2)  the extent to which Education provides the PSLF servicer with sufficient  information to administer the program, and (3) opportunities for improving  service to borrowers. In addition, I will highlight several key actions we  have recommended that Education can take to improve the PSLF  program and the temporary expanded process to help ensure consistent  services to borrowers and safeguard taxpayer funds.

Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) program, through the Office of  Federal Student Aid. Only Direct Loans are eligible for the PSLF program  and the temporary expanded process. Under the Direct Loan program,  Education issues and oversees federal loans provided to students, and  contractors service these loans. Education currently contracts with nine  loan servicers that each handle the billing and other services for a share  of the over $1 trillion in outstanding student loans provided through the  Direct Loan program. Borrowers interested in pursuing loan forgiveness  under PSLF, or the temporary expanded process, must have their loans  eventually transferred to Education\u2019s sole PSLF loan servicer in order to  proceed. This designated PSLF servicer handles day-to-day activities  associated with the PSLF program and the temporary expanded process,  which include responding to borrower inquiries, making preliminary  determinations about whether borrowers\u2019 employment and loans qualify  for loan forgiveness, and processing loan forgiveness applications.", "The PSLF program and the temporary expanded process provide eligible  borrowers with forgiveness on the remaining balance of their Direct Loans  after they have met all program requirements. To receive forgiveness for  a loan, borrowers are required to be employed in a qualifying public  service job for 10 years when making 120 qualifying payments. Borrowers  must also be employed in a qualifying public service job at the time they  apply for forgiveness, and at the time they receive forgiveness for their  loans. Although there are some differences in the eligibility requirements  for PSLF and the temporary expanded process, borrowers are generally  required to:", "Work full-time for at least 10 years at a public service organization, a government organization, agency, or entity at any level (federal,  state, local, or Tribal); a nonprofit, tax exempt organization (under section 501(c)(3) of  the Internal Revenue Code); or another private nonprofit organization that provides certain public  services.", "Not be in default on their loans.", "Make 120 on-time monthly loan payments for the full amount due on  their bill. These monthly payments do not need to be consecutive.", "Repay their loans through a qualifying repayment plan. The PSLF  program generally requires borrowers to repay their loans through one  of the eligible income-driven repayment plans or the Standard  repayment plan. The temporary expanded process allows borrowers  to qualify for loan forgiveness if they are participating in several  additional types of repayment plans, including the Graduated  repayment plan, Extended repayment plan, Consolidated Standard  repayment plan, and Consolidated Graduated repayment plan. In  addition, for the temporary expanded process, the following two  payments generally must be at least as much as the borrower would  have paid under an income-driven repayment plan: (1) the payment  made immediately prior to applying for the temporary expanded  process, and (2) the payment made 12 months prior to applying for  the temporary expanded process.", "There are key differences in the processes for applying for loan  forgiveness under the PSLF program versus the temporary expanded  process (see table 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approximately 99 Percent of Borrower Applications for Loan Forgiveness through Both the PSLF Program and the Temporary Expanded Process Have Been Denied", "paragraphs": ["Despite broad borrower interest in the PSLF program and the temporary  expanded process, very few borrowers have been granted loan  forgiveness.

According to Education\u2019s most recent publically  released PSLF program data through March 2019, PSLF program denial  rates have continued to hover around 99 percent since our 2018 review.  Of the 76,002 loan forgiveness applications that had been processed, the  PSLF servicer had denied 75,138 (99 percent), as of March 2019.", "According to data as of March 2019, close to one-half of the PSLF  program loan forgiveness applications the PSLF servicer had processed  were denied because the borrower had not yet made 120 qualifying  payments. The other most common reasons PSLF program applications  were denied were because of missing information on the application or  because the borrower did not have qualifying federal loans. For borrowers  that have been approved, Education had forgiven almost $31 million in  outstanding student loans, an average of more than $59,000 per  approved borrower.", "Denial rates are also very high for the temporary expanded process.

For the 1  percent of applications that were approved from May 2018 through May  2019, Education had granted almost $27 million in loan forgiveness under  the temporary expanded process, totaling about 4 percent of the $700  million appropriated funds, according to our 2019 report. Borrowers  received an average of about $41,000 in loan forgiveness.", "The high denial rates for the PSLF program and temporary expanded  process suggest that many borrowers are confused by the requirements.  In our 2018 report, we noted that officials from the PSLF servicer said that  borrowers were frequently confused by the PSLF program requirements  related to qualifying loans, employment, repayment plans, and  payments. PSLF servicer officials also said that borrowers were  sometimes unaware that they were not on a PSLF-qualifying repayment  plan or that forbearance, deferment, and loan consolidation would affect  their qualifying payments. For example, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau has reported that borrowers have complained of  spending years making payments, believing they were making progress  towards PSLF loan forgiveness, and then learning that they were not  eligible. Similarly, in our 2019 report on the temporary expanded  process, we noted that officials from Education, the PSLF loan servicer,  and representatives from selected organizations representing student  borrowers all said that the requirement to submit an application for the  PSLF program to be eligible for the temporary expanded process can  confuse borrowers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shortcomings in the Information Education Provides to the PSLF Servicer Increase the Risk of Administrative Errors", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on how shortcomings in the information  Education provides to the PSLF servicer has resulted in uncertainty about  PSLF program requirements and increased the risk of potential errors in  borrower eligibility determinations.

We reported that Education\u2019s guidance and  instructions to the PSLF servicer are dispersed in a piecemeal manner  across multiple documents, including Education\u2019s original contract with  the servicer, multiple updates to the contract, and hundreds of emails. As  a result, PSLF servicer officials said that their staff were sometimes  unaware of relevant PSLF program guidance and instructions in emails  provided by Education, which creates a risk that some policy updates will  be overlooked and not consistently implemented. The absence of a  central, authoritative source of PSLF guidance and instructions creates a  risk of differing interpretations and inconsistent implementation. It also  makes it difficult to maintain program continuity in the event of staff  turnover or if Education decides to contract with a new servicer to  administer the PSLF program. Federal internal control standards state  that agencies should communicate information to those who need it, in a  form that enables them to carry out their responsibilities.", "Around the time our 2018 report was issued, Education officials told us  they planned to develop a comprehensive PSLF servicing manual, but  they did not have a timeline for completing it. In response, we  recommended that Education develop a timeline for issuing a  comprehensive guidance and instructions document for PSLF servicing.  Education agreed with this recommendation and reported in September  2019 that it was continuing its efforts to improve and streamline guidance  for the PSLF servicer. While Education said it is working on developing its  comprehensive PSLF servicing manual, it does not yet have a timeline for  how it will complete this manual and has pushed back the estimated  implementation date for this recommendation to 2020.

However, we  found that these sources were not comprehensive, and that PSLF  servicer officials said they sometimes had to consult other sources that  have significant limitations. For example, PSLF servicer officials told us  they used an online directory of nursing home facilities to help determine  if certain nursing homes were nonprofit employers. However, this website  explicitly stated that it did not guarantee that the information it provided  was accurate or current. Federal internal control standards state that  agencies should communicate the necessary quality information to those  who need it, and PSLF servicer officials said that having additional  information would help them assess employers more quickly and  minimize the risk of inaccurate decisions.

Education agreed with this  recommendation, and said it planned to incorporate qualifying employer  information into an online PSLF Help Tool. As of September 2019,  Education reported that it had incorporated a feature into its online PSLF  Help Tool to help borrowers determine if their employer fits within general  eligibility criteria. However, Education said more specific information to  help the PSLF servicer make employer eligibility determinations and an  employer database will not be available until 2020.

PSLF servicer officials said inconsistencies in the information provided by  other loan servicers make it challenging to determine whether borrowers  are on qualifying repayment plans or making qualifying payments.  Officials with Education and the PSLF servicer said that these  inconsistencies increase the risk of miscounting qualifying payments. This  is contrary to federal internal control standards, which state that agencies  should use quality information. Our 2018 report recommended that  Education standardize the payment information that the PSLF servicer  receives from other loan servicers to ensure the PSLF servicer obtains  more consistent and accurate payment information.

However, our recent  work has found several areas in which the agency\u2019s outreach activities  related to the temporary expanded process are limited. While Education  and PSLF loan servicer officials told us that they primarily direct  borrowers to online sources to inform them about requirements for the  temporary expanded process, we found that the agency does not include  information about the temporary expanded process in key online sources.  For example, according to agency officials, one of Education\u2019s primary  PSLF outreach mechanisms\u2014the online PSLF Help Tool, which the  agency launched in December 2018\u2014does not include any information  about the temporary expanded process. Officials from Education and  the PSLF servicer stated that integrating information about the temporary  expanded process into the online PSLF Help Tool would be beneficial for  borrowers and would reduce confusion about the temporary expanded  process. In addition, our 2019 report found that while all nine of  Education\u2019s loan servicers\u2019 websites contain some information on the  PSLF program, none of them (other than the PSLF loan servicer)  included information about the temporary expanded process on their  websites or provided a link to Education\u2019s website specific to the  temporary expanded process.

In particular, the  requirement that borrowers must have already submitted a separate  PSLF application in order to be eligible for loan forgiveness through the  temporary expanded process can confuse borrowers. Borrowers currently  must submit a separate PSLF application, even if they know it will be  denied, before Education will consider their request for forgiveness  through the temporary expanded process. Education officials  acknowledged that the majority of requests for the temporary expanded  process come from borrowers who have not first submitted a PSLF  application. Similarly, our September 2019 report found that 71 percent of  the denied requests were denied because the borrower had not submitted  a PSLF application. Officials from the PSLF loan servicer said that  borrowers who called were frequently confused when they received a  denial for the temporary expanded process based on the fact that they  had not first submitted an application for the PSLF program.", "This lack of a borrower-friendly process complicates the path towards  loan forgiveness and does not align with Education\u2019s strategic plan  objective to improve the quality of service to customers. To address this  issue, our 2019 report recommended that Education streamline the  process for borrowers to request loan forgiveness through the temporary  expanded process by integrating the request for temporary expanded  process consideration into the PSLF application, eliminating the need for  borrowers to submit a separate PSLF application prior to consideration.  Education agreed with this recommendation and stated that it will  integrate requests for the temporary expanded process into the PSLF  application as part of its ongoing initiative to overhaul its online portal for  student loan borrowers.

Officials with the PSLF servicer said they  rely on borrowers to catch any payment counting errors resulting from  issues with information provided by other loan servicers. As we reported,  the PSLF servicer provided borrowers with aggregate counts of qualifying  payments, which are useful for helping borrowers track their progress, but  did not provide borrowers with enough detail to check the servicer\u2019s  counts and identify prior payments that the servicer may have missed.  This is also contrary to federal internal control standards which call for  communicating necessary information to external parties. Our 2018  report recommended that Education ensure that borrowers receive  sufficiently detailed payment information from the PSLF servicer to be  able to identify any errors in the servicer\u2019s counts of qualifying payments.  Education agreed with this recommendation and stated that efforts were  underway to standardize the payment count information that is provided  to borrowers. As of September 2019, Education reported that it is  reviewing communications from the PSLF servicer to ensure that  borrowers receive sufficiently detailed information regarding payment  counts and payment history and that this review will be completed by  September of 2020. To help borrowers detect potential payment counting  errors that could ultimately affect their eligibility for the PSLF program, we  believe Education should implement this recommendation and provide  borrowers with more detailed qualifying payment information.", "Further, our 2019 report on the temporary expanded process found that  Education does not provide complete information to borrowers about  options they have to contest payment counts or other aspects of the  eligibility determination process. An Education official told us that while  there is no formal process for borrowers who are dissatisfied with their  temporary expanded process determinations to contest the determination,  borrowers do have additional options for addressing concerns, such as an  additional review by the PSLF servicer, or a complaint to Education\u2019s  Federal Student Aid Feedback System or Ombudsman. Education  officials told us that the agency does not provide information about these  options in its denial letters or on its website for the temporary expanded  process, noting that borrowers could find this information at the bottom of  Education\u2019s Federal Student Aid main website. However, borrowers may  not know where to find this information should they choose to contest  their temporary expanded process determination, because this  information is not effectively communicated to them in accordance with  federal internal control standards. To address this, our 2019 report  recommended that Education provide borrowers with more information on  the website for the temporary expanded process and in the servicer\u2019s  denial letters about options available to borrowers should they wish to  contest the servicer\u2019s decision. Education agreed with this  recommendation and stated that it would add information about the  options borrowers have to contest temporary expanded process decisions  to relevant websites and denial letters. Implementing this  recommendation will increase the likelihood that borrowers with valid  concerns about the temporary expanded process will have them  appropriately resolved.", "In conclusion, my statement has highlighted several actions Education  could take to strengthen the PSLF program and the temporary expanded  process to deliver on the promise the federal government has made to  borrowers pursuing careers in public service. Education is responsible for  establishing an administrative structure for the loan servicer, but more  than 10 years after the PSLF program was first established, Education  has not provided the loan servicer with a comprehensive source of  guidance and instructions on how to operate the PSLF program, and  could provide additional information to help ensure that eligibility  determinations are being made correctly. Education is responsible for  ensuring that borrowers are aware of and understand programmatic  requirements. However, the high denial rates for the PSLF program and  its temporary expanded process suggest that borrowers are still  confused. It is also important for Education to maintain borrower  confidence, but the department has not provided critical information to  borrowers to help them remedy potential errors.", "Large numbers of borrowers have pursued careers in public service,  sometimes at lower pay than in the private sector, with the hope of one  day achieving loan forgiveness through the PSLF program. They have  often had to navigate the PSLF program requirements with a lack of  sufficient information from Education only to be denied 10 years later  when they applied for loan forgiveness because their prior years of  employment or loan payments did not qualify. In addition, some  borrowers who were denied may not be aware that they might be eligible  for loan forgiveness through the temporary expanded process, potentially  missing out on this temporary opportunity. Education needs to take action  to better serve these borrowers and help smooth their long road towards  loan forgiveness. Education has not yet taken action to fully implement  the eight recommendations discussed in this testimony. We continue to  believe that implementing these eight recommendations would strengthen  program administration, improve service to borrowers, and help to fulfill  the original goal of encouraging individuals to enter and continue in public  service employment. We will continue to monitor Education\u2019s efforts in  these areas.", "Chairwoman Davis, Senior Republican Smucker, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
