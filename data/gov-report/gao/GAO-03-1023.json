As required, GAO reviewed the two DOD reports submitted in early 2003 and is, with this report, submitting its views to the Congress on whether (1) the military services met the so-called \"50-50 requirement\" for fiscal years 2001-2 and (2) the projections for fiscal years 2003-7 are reasonable estimates.

DOD data show all the services, except the Air Force in fiscal year 2001, to be below the 50-percent funding limit on private sector work. However, as before, GAO found errors in the data that, if corrected, would overall increase funding of the private sector and move each service closer to the contract limit. For example, for fiscal year 2002, the Navy did not include about $401 million in private sector maintenance work on aircraft carriers and surface ships. Correcting for these and other errors would increase the Navy's percentage of private sector depot maintenance funds for that year from the 42.6 percent reported to 46.9 percent. Such data weaknesses show that prior-years reports do not precisely measure the division of maintenance funding. At best, over time these results provide rough approximations and indicate trends that may be useful to decision makers. Because of data deficiencies and changing budget projections, the futureyears report does not provide reasonable estimates of public and private sector maintenance funding for fiscal years 2003-7 and limits its usefulness to decision makers. GAO reported this shortcoming in the past, and problems continue. For example, the Army underreported maintenance work at nondepot locations as it continues to consolidate the work and better control it at such locations. Other Army work was not reported because some commands did not receive guidance and others misapplied it. These errors would add about $200 million annually to the Army's future estimate and increase the percent of projected funding in the private sector. Opportunities still exist for improvements, including for streamlining the 50- 50 reports, continued service audit agency support, and data development. Streamlining the 50-50 reports could help address problems caused by, among other factors, inexact program estimates. Second, although DOD is concerned that recent revisions to federal audit standards could keep service auditors from further participation in the 50-50 process, GAO believes that a way can be developed to enable auditors' continued support yet ensure their independence. Third, data development could be helped by better disseminating guidance and training participating personnel."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under 10 U.S.C. 2466, not more than 50 percent of annual depot  maintenance funding provided to the military departments and  defense agencies can be used for work accomplished by private-sector  contractors.

Other Army  work was not reported because some commands did not receive 50-50  instructions and others misapplied the guidance. Unfamiliarity with the  guidance was caused in some instances by the large turnover from last  year in the staff responsible for collecting and summarizing data. Staff  turnover was cited by each of the military services as contributing to  increased errors and training needs. To the extent we identified them,  these specific errors would add about $228 million in total to the Army\u2019s  public and private sector workloads in 2002; the net effect of correcting  for these errors would add 2.5 percent to the private sector percentage  allocation in 2002.

Similar to the Army, the Navy\u2019s 50-50 process  also involves multiple naval commands as well as the Marine Corps. As in  prior years, we believe this increases the complexity in managing the  process and in ensuring consistency in application of the guidance. It also  exacerbates the less than adequate data validation efforts.", "We identified several problems that carried over from last year\u2019s 50-50  efforts. The Navy did not report any depot maintenance work  accomplished along with the nuclear refueling of its aircraft carriers, citing  the exclusion of nuclear refueling from the 10 U.S.C. 2460 definition of  depot maintenance. We continue to believe that depot repairs not directly  associated with refueling tasks should be reported because these kinds of  repair actions are reported by other organizations and funding for these  tasks are identifiable in contracts and financial systems. The Navy also  continues to inconsistently report inactivation activities that involve the  servicing and preservation of systems and equipment before it is placed in  storage or in an inactive status. Officials report public sector workloads  for inactivation activities on nuclear ships but do not report such work on  nonnuclear ships, saying that the former workload is complex while the  latter is not. We think all such depot-level work should be counted since  the statute and implementing guidance does not make a distinction of  complexity. These two examples would add about $401 million to the  private sector workloads in fiscal year 2002.", "We also determined that about $41 million of partnership workloads were  incorrectly exempted from reporting because the work was not  accomplished at a designated depot or was not performed by contract  employees.", "The Marine Corps data are included as part of the Department of the Navy  50-50 report for compliance purposes, but the Corps exercises a separate  process for collecting data. Compared to the other services, the Marine  Corps has a small depot program but makes more relative errors and has  substantial shortcomings in its management oversight and control actions.  For example, most of the program offices in the command that is  responsible for acquiring and upgrading weapon systems did not report at  all. Our review found that this understated the private sector total for  fiscal year 2002 by about $32 million and the public sector total by almost  $7 million. We also identified other errors including a nearly $19 million  overstatement of the public sector when an official incorrectly included  obligations from fiscal year 2001 in the total for 2002.", "On balance, for the Department of the Navy as a whole we found the total  dollar amount of errors affected the private sector data more than the  public sector. Correcting for the errors we found substantially increases  the private sector percentage share in fiscal year 2002 from 42.6 percent to  46.9 percent, a gain of over 4 percent.

As provided by law at the time, the Secretary  of the Air Force issued a waiver. The Air Force reported itself back below  the limitation for fiscal year 2002.", "Most of the errors we found were the same or similar from past reviews.  For example, the Air Force continues to make a significant adjustment in  its reporting for contract administration and oversight costs. The  adjustment increases the reported public sector funding and decreases the  private sector. The total adjustment was $125 million (in absolute terms)  for fiscal year 2002. Consistent with the 50-50 guidance, which states that  costs should be associated with the end product (i.e., the repaired item),  we think these costs should instead be treated as contracting expenses.  Accordingly, we reversed this adjustment in our analysis. The Air Force  also continues to count some component repair costs twice, once when  the component is repaired and again when it is installed in an equipment  item or assembly during a periodic overhaul. Officials said these are both  reportable events, while we think this overstates the amount of actual  repair work done. Eliminating the double count would affect about $666  million in 2002\u2014a $485 million decrease in the public sector amount and a  $181 million decrease in the private sector.", "As in past years, we also identified many errors in the amounts reported  for programs supported by interim and contractor logistics support  contracts. We determined that several programs used incorrect factors and  assumptions to calculate the depot portion of total contract costs. We  found other programs that could not adequately explain or justify their  estimating methods\u2014some had been developed years ago by officials no  longer in the program and simply applied by new staff without checking  their validity nor maintaining adequate supporting documentation to  explain and rationalize the results. Relatively high turnover of staff  responsible for collecting and managing 50-50 data tends to increase the  number and persistence of errors and omissions.

The reported projections are based, in part, on incorrect data,  questionable assumptions and estimating factors, and some  inconsistencies with existing budgets and management plans. As with the  prior years, the net effect of the problems we found generally increases  the percentage of funding for projected private sector work. The  uncertainty and instability of budget estimates combined with the errors  and omissions we found result in a future-years report that is not very  useful to congressional and DOD decision makers.", "We found many of the same problems identified in the prior-years data  were continued in the future-years projections. The Army continued to  underreport maintenance work at field locations and made other errors  similar to its prior-years presentation. While supporting documentation for  the Army\u2019s projected data was inadequate, errors and omissions of the  same magnitude as fiscal year 2002 would add more than $200 million  annually to the totals projected for the public and private sectors in the  Army\u2019s future-years report. Similarly, in its respective projections, the  Navy continued to not report depot maintenance accomplished with, but  not directly related to nuclear refueling; the Marine Corps underreported  work from the acquisition command; and the Air Force contract estimates  again involved some questionable estimating factors and assumptions.  Overall, we found this year as in the past that the services tend to place  less emphasis and priority on collecting and validating the future-years  data compared to efforts on the prior-years data.", "Besides errors in reporting, other internal and external factors can create  large fluctuations in reported data, which in turn can provide a distorted  and misleading view to outside observers about efforts to remain  compliant with the 50-50 requirement. For example, in the current future- years report, the Air Force\u2019s projected public-sector work financed  through the working capital fund is about $3.0 billion higher than the total  amount reported for the same 4-year time period in the future-years report  submitted in 2002. Although this would appear to indicate a large influx of  new work to the public depots, in reality the amount of work, according to  budget estimates and management reports, is expected to remain fairly  level during this reporting period in terms of production hours and size of  workforce. Most of the dollar (and percentage) increase in public-sector  work is the result of price hikes in the sales rate charged to its customers.  Price hikes were caused primarily by increases in the cost of spare and  repair parts that were used in the repair process.", "The future-year estimates are not reasonable because they represent  budget and planning data that change over time, incorporate the same  errors found in prior-year data, and also have other problems. The budget  and planning data used to project the share of depot maintenance work to  be performed in the public and private sectors in the future are estimates.  At best, they provide only rough estimates of future funding allocations;  and these estimates change over time. As an illustration, our comparison  of the consistency of the 2003 reported data with that in DOD\u2019s 50-50  reports submitted in 2002 showed that congressional and DOD decision  makers were given quite a different view this year of the public-private  sector workload mix than that presented just last year. With so many  errors and frequent changes, the future-years data may be misleading and  not very useful to congressional and DOD decision makers, particularly  the further estimates are in the future. While we have identified these  shortcomings in the past, the problems continue and show no signs of  getting better.", "DOD officials agreed that the planning and budget data available for  making future projections beyond the budget year are not very useful as  predictors of the balance of future workloads between the public and  private sectors.

However, this year the Air Force Audit  Agency did not participate; while the Army did participate, some of the  errors they identified were not corrected in the reports to the Congress;  and the Navy audit was not done in time to result in changes to the 50-50  data submitted to the Congress. A more meaningful review would be one  that was carried on when the data are being aggregated, with input to the  process in time to influence the reported data. DOD officials told us that  the audit services were not expecting to work on future 50-50 efforts.  Audit services are reconsidering their roles because of recent changes to  government auditing standards regarding auditor independence when  performing both audit and nonaudit management assistance services to  the same client.", "Air Force auditors have had a positive role in the 50-50 process in past  years. Serving in an advisory capacity, they identified errors and cognizant  program officials made corrections before the Air Force input was  finalized and forwarded to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. This  year, however, Air Force auditors decided not to participate. Officials said  they were concerned about conflict of interest because auditors  participating in the management services review could also be involved in  audit service reviews of depot maintenance programs, processes, and  funds. While Army auditors participated in the process during this year\u2019s  cycle and some of their work influenced changes in this year\u2019s reported  data, some errors were not corrected because of time constraints imposed  by the 50-50 reporting schedule. Army officials said the Army Audit  Agency would not likely be involved in next year\u2019s 50-50 process primarily  because of concerns about independence. Navy auditors became involved  in the process this year after we recommended their participation in prior  reports. However, the Navy Audit Service work was not done in time to  influence the Navy\u2019s 50-50 report. According to audit service officials, their  decision to do an audit of the data after it was submitted rather than  providing advisory services to cognizant officials developing the Navy\u2019s 50- 50 report was influenced by the before-mentioned change in audit  standards.

Overall quality and direction of DOD\u2019s reporting seems to  have reached a plateau where further major improvements have been  limited. As we have previously discussed, one of the reasons this has  occurred is that 50-50 guidance was not always distributed to the people  who needed it. Further, significant turnover of personnel responsible for  developing the data without providing sufficient time and training to  familiarize them regarding the 50-50 requirement and process adversely  affected the quality of the 50-50 data.

At best, DOD\u2019s  data over time should be treated as providing a rough approximation of  the allocation of depot maintenance workloads between the public and  private sectors with some indication of trends. As such, the information on  actual prior-years allocations can be useful to the Congress in its oversight  role and to DOD officials in deciding support strategies for new systems  and in evaluating depot policies and practices. On the other hand, because  it provides an increasingly less reliable estimate of projected allocations  the further it gets from the current year, the future-years report is not a  very useful tool for informing the Congress or DOD officials about likely  future compliance. This occurs because of the changing nature of  projections, a combination of errors and omissions, less emphasis by the  services on the collection and validation of future-years data, and the use  of ever-changing budgetary estimates to construct projections. These  budgetary estimates\u2014and built-in assumptions\u2014become more inexact  and more problematic the further into the future the projections are made  due to their very speculative and volatile natures. Indeed, tracking the 50- 50 projected data from year to year reveals wide swings in the total  amounts reported and in the relative allocations to the public and private  sectors. As a result, congressional and DOD decision makers were given  quite a different view this year of the public-private sector workload mix  than that presented just last year.

We discussed with DOD  officials the main differences between the two processes and the manner  in which the data were derived from budgets and planning requirements  and key assumptions made in the outyear data.", "For reviews of both 50-50 reports, we performed certain checks and tests,  including variance analyses, to judge the consistency of this information  with data from prior years and with the future-years budgeting and  programming data used in DOD\u2019s budget submissions and reports to the  Congress. For example, we compared each service\u2019s 50-50 data reported in  February and April 2003 for the period 2001 through 2006 with data  reported for these same years in the 50-50 reports submitted in 2002. We  found repeated and significant changes, even though the estimates were  prepared only about 1 year apart. We used this analysis to further discuss  with officials and analyze reasons for changes in reported data and  percentage allocations between the 2002 and 2003 reports submitted to the  Congress. Variance analysis showed that congressional and DOD decision  makers were given quite a different view of the public-private sector  workload mix than that presented just last year.", "Several factors concerning data validity and completeness were  considered in our methodology and approach to reviewing the prior- and  future-years reports. One key factor is the continuing deficiencies we  have noted in DOD\u2019s financial systems and reports that preclude a clean  opinion on its financial statements and that result in limited accuracy of  budget and cost information. Another factor is that documenting depot  maintenance workload allocations between the public and private sectors  is becoming more complicated by the consolidation of maintenance  activities and the performance of depot-level maintenance at field  locations. These complicating factors (1) make it more difficult to identify  work that meets the statutory definition of depot maintenance,  (2) complicate workload reporting, and (3) result in underreporting of  depot maintenance for both the public and private sectors. In addition,  changes in business philosophy and approach can make analysis more  difficult. For example, many new contracts are performance-based and  may not discretely identify maintenance activities or account separately  for their costs. This can result in under- and overreporting of depot  maintenance work performed in the private sector. It also forces more  reliance on the contractor for providing information needed in 50-50  reporting and may result in DOD officials having to use more assumptions  and estimating methodologies in lieu of contract data.", "As part of our efforts to identify areas for improvement, we reviewed  DOD\u2019s efforts to improve the accuracy and completeness of reports.

We compared this year\u2019s  sets of instructions with last year\u2019s to identify changes and additions. We  reviewed efforts to identify reporting sources and to distribute guidance  and taskings. We asked primary data collectors to provide their opinions  on how well efforts were managed and data verified and to identify \u201cpain  points\u201d and ideas they had to improve reporting.

The department did not agree with our adjustment for nuclear aircraft  carriers. The Navy interprets the 10 U.S.C. 2460 exclusion of nuclear  refueling of aircraft carriers from the definition of depot maintenance  to mean that no work associated with the refueling complex overhaul  of nuclear carriers is reportable for 50-50 purposes.  Navy officials also  said that non-nuclear depot repairs on carriers are not severable tasks  to be split out from contracts. We continue to believe that the costs of  depot repairs and tasks not directly associated with nuclear refueling  tasks during carrier overhauls should be reported. Many maintenance  tasks performed at the same time as the nuclear refueling are not  related to the refueling; and when these and similar tasks are  performed during other maintenance activities, the Navy does report  them as depot maintenance. We found that the funding for these tasks  is clearly identifiable in the contract financial records and could be  counted just like other 50-50 work. In our view, without some nexus  between that work and refueling work, it would be inconsistent with  the plain language of section 2460 to exempt that work simply because  it was performed during a refueling complex overhaul of nuclear  carriers.  We deleted the reference to severable tasks in the body of the  report, as our intent was not to suggest that the Navy break out non- nuclear work from nuclear work onto separate contracts or work  orders, but rather that the funding for non-nuclear refueling work  accomplished on existing contracts be identified and reported.  2.  The department did not agree with our adjustment for surface ship  inactivations. DOD considers nuclear ship inactivation work to be a  relatively complex process that is equivalent to depot level  maintenance, but that conventional ship inactivation work performed  by the private sector is not as complex and is not equivalent to depot- level maintenance. In addition, the department\u2019s written response  indicated that surface ship inactivation work accomplished by the  public sector is also not reported in the 50-50 data. We believe that  inactivation work should be reported because the relevant title 10  statutes and OSD\u2019s 50-50 guidance do not make this distinction of  relative complexity and requires reporting of all depot maintenance,  regardless of location and source of funding.  Further, DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation 7000.14-R, vol. 6A, ch. 14 (which prescribes  depot maintenance reporting requirements) includes inactivation as a  depot maintenance activity. Although we did not review inactivation  work accomplished by public sector workers, it should also be  reported if it meets the definition of depot maintenance.  3.  The Air Force did not agree with our reversal of the 50-50 reporting  adjustment it makes for the salaries and overhead expenses of  government employees administering depot maintenance contracts.   The Air Force believes that the costs for government personnel  managing depot maintenance contracts represent public sector costs;  therefore, to report them as contract would misrepresent the public- private sector percentage allocations.  However, OSD\u2019s 50-50 guidance  requires that all the costs associated with accomplishing a specific  depot workload\u2014labor, material, parts, indirect, and overhead\u2014 should be counted for 50-50 purposes in the sector accomplishing the  actual maintenance. The guidance cites examples, such as counting the  contract maintenance on depot plant equipment as public sector costs  because the plant equipment is part of the costs incurred to perform  maintenance at the depot.  Similarly, we think that contract  administrative costs should be counted as part of the costs incurred to  accomplish the work in the private sector. We note that the Air Force  will stop making this adjustment after this year when financing for the  depot contracts is moved from the working capital fund to direct  appropriations. It remains to be seen, however, how the Air Force will  account for contract administrative expenses in the future.  4.  The department did not agree that counting the repair costs twice for  some components installed in higher level assemblies is inconsistent  with the statutory requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2466(e) and 10 U.S.C.  2460.  The Air Force believes that the original repair cost for a  component and its subsequent cost as material used in system or  subsystem overhaul are two distinct and separate transactions and that  both costs should be reported for 50-50 purposes.  We continue to  believe that counting some component repair costs twice when the  components are incorporated in a higher-level assembly distorts the  50-50 reports and the actual amount of work accomplished by both the  public and private sectors.  In our view, there is no reason to conclude  that the intent of title 10 requires double counting component repairs  and that a more reasonable reading is that DOD can implement those  provisions so as to allow for adjustments in reporting to more  accurately reflect the cost of depot work.  DOD adopted a similar  approach in response to a recommendation in our 2001 report.  In that  report, we found that unrealistic and outdated budget data were being  reported when there were other, more accurate information sources.   Accordingly, OSD revised its 50-50 guidance to allow for revising  budgetary estimates to better reflect known and anticipated changes in  workloads, workforce, priorities, and performance execution rates.   This resulted in the Air Force reporting additional hundreds of millions  of dollars in projected depot work based on current workload  estimates. A similar approach could be used to eliminate the effects of  double counting reparables later used in higher-level assemblies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Depot Maintenance: Key Unresolved Issues Affect the Army Depot  System\u2019s Viability.
