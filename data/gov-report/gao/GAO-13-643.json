While GAO's analysis shows that VA follows its procedures for reviewing initial accreditation applications, VA relies on limited self-reported information to determine whether applicants have a criminal history or their character could be called into question, which in turn leaves VA vulnerable to accrediting individuals who may not provide responsible assistance. For example, when GAO conducted additional checks on a non-representative sample of accredited individuals, GAO found that some individuals had histories of bankruptcies or liens, information which could help develop a more complete picture of applicants' character and prompt further inquiry by VA into their background. VA's procedures also do not ensure that representatives have adequate program knowledge. For example, VA's initial training requirements are minimal and VA does not consistently monitor whether representatives meet additional continuing education requirements. As a result, some accredited representatives may not have adequate program knowledge to effectively assist clients with their claims. After being briefed on GAO's findings in May 2013, VA's OGC announced plans to take additional steps toward conducting background checks on applicants and auditing ongoing character and training requirements.", "VA efforts to administer accreditation are hindered by an inadequate allocation of resources and unclear communication with claimants. For example, OGC has only four staff dedicated to overseeing thousands of accreditation applications each year, in addition to monitoring approximately 20,000 accredited representatives. As a result, OGC has not kept pace with pending accreditation applications, and has not consistently monitored continuing requirements. OGC's reliance on manual data entry results in resource-intensive program administration. For instance, OGC lacks information technology systems and tools that would help it proactively and efficiently identify representatives who are not meeting ongoing training requirements. Moreover, VA does not clearly solicit feedback from claimants about accredited representatives. For example, neither VA's accreditation web page nor information VA sends to claimants clearly communicates their rights or how to report abuses. Absent such outreach, claimants may not be aware that some representatives may be engaging in prohibited practices. Lastly, VA's current accreditation program does not address some emerging threats to claimants. For instance, VA has received complaints regarding unaccredited individuals inappropriately charging claimants to apply for benefits. By law, only accredited individuals can assist claimants. However, VA is not aware of the extent these unaccredited individuals operate, and is limited in the actions it can take to prevent them from assisting claimants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve the integrity of accreditation, GAO recommends that VA explore options for strengthening knowledge requirements and addressing emerging threats, improve its outreach, and determine the resources needed to adequately carry out accreditation.

Representatives who  assist veterans and their families in applying for benefits must have good  moral character and be capable of providing competent representation,  and VA has responsibility for making such determinations through its  accreditation process.

To identify  requirements for the program, we reviewed applicable federal laws,  regulations, and program guidance.

We also visited a VA  regional office to obtain an operational perspective. To gain further  understanding of VA\u2019s procedures for screening applicants and  addressing complaints, we reviewed a randomly selected and  representative sample of 92 accreditation decisions made in 2012, and a  judgmental sample of 24 complaints received by VA.

Since current program rules were adopted in mid-2008, the  number of applications VA received has grown from 2,696 in 2008 to over  5,000 in each year since. Additionally, almost 80 percent of claims that  were open as of November 2012 used the services of a representative,  with VSOs accounting for the bulk of those claims (see fig. 1).", "VA\u2019s Office of General Counsel (OGC) oversees the accreditation  program. To this end, OGC staff review accreditation applications and  make approval decisions, monitor whether accredited representatives  meet ongoing program requirements, and investigate issues and  complaints that could lead to a representative having his or her  accreditation cancelled or suspended. Table 2 describes the initial and  ongoing requirements for these representatives. Additionally, OGC staff  receive and review fee agreements\u2014contracts between claimants and  representatives outlining how claimants will be charged for services.  Within VA, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) also plays a  limited role in enforcing accreditation rules\u2014checking that individuals are  accredited when claimants designate them as their representative. In  cases where an individual is not accredited, VA policy is to inform the  would-be representative of accreditation program rules and prohibit the  individual from serving as the representative for that claim.", "VA rules also govern the fees that each type of representative can charge  claimants. VSO representatives are required to provide their services free  of charge.

The official that  oversees accreditation also stated that VA is considering requiring  applicants to supply information on any professional certifications they  hold and confirming this information with agencies like the Financial  Industry Regulatory Authority, which regulates brokers\u2019 activities.", "Not consistently following up on references: VA may be missing  opportunities to obtain additional information about applicants by not  consistently following up on character references. While attorneys and  agents are required to provide references in their accreditation  applications, the official who oversees accreditation told us that VA  contacts references only for agents, which we verified in our review of  applications. Further, the value of reference letters VA receives is  questionable as VA did not use a standard set of questions or guidance to  obtain specific information that should be included in reference letters,  such as requesting information on the agents\u2019 criminal or employment  history. Several reference letters we reviewed did not provide substantial  information on applicants\u2019 ability to assist veterans. In one instance, VA  had to request additional reference letters for an applicant because two of  the applicant\u2019s reference letters were from members of the same church  group and had identical language. Additionally, we found several  instances where references listed in applications were family members or  lived at the same address as the applicant, calling into question the  impartiality of the information received. At our May 2013 exit briefing with  VA, officials announced that VA has revised and will begin using a  standardized letter to references to specifically request information on  agents\u2019 criminal and employment histories, as well as their interest in  serving veterans.", "Reliance on VSOs and state bars: OGC officials told us that they rely  heavily on the judgment of VSOs when deciding whether to accredit their  prospective representatives. OGC officials told us that they believe VSOs  do a good job of screening their applicants and that it is in the best  interests of VSOs to maintain a positive reputation regarding the quality of  representation they provide as VSOs depend on contributions from  veterans to fund their operations. That said, VA does not actively review  VSO certification plans and therefore cannot know whether there is  variability in procedures and standards among organizations. Regarding  attorneys, VA generally presumes good character and fitness to represent  claimants if they have a state bar membership in good standing.  However, our work shows that an attorney\u2019s standing with a state bar may  not always be a sufficient proxy for good character. In one example, an  attorney was in good standing with his state bar, but he had several  previous suspensions from the bar and multiple felonies in his criminal  record involving theft or misappropriation of property or funds. In this  instance, VA chose not to accredit the individual based on his self- reported criminal record, but it is not clear what the outcome would have  been had VA relied on his bar membership status in the absence of such  self-reported information.", "Limited ongoing monitoring: Once representatives become accredited, VA  does little to ensure that they retain good character. VA requires attorneys  and agents to annually certify that they are in good standing with any  court, bar, or federal or state agency to which they are admitted to  practice or authorized to appear. VA also requires VSOs to recertify their  representatives every 5 years. However, VA officials told us that they  currently face a backlog in processing these annual certifications and  therefore have not consistently monitored whether these re-certifications  have occurred. For example, the official that oversees accreditation told  us that in one instance, an attorney self-reported in a letter to VA that he  was disbarred and that his accreditation should be cancelled. Since VA  does not consistently monitor whether attorneys annually certify their  standing with the bar, the agency would not have known that this  individual was disbarred had he not voluntarily communicated this  information.

However, organizations that represent or  help train agents told us the exam covers a wide array of subjects  concerning veterans\u2019 benefits law and procedure without deeply  broaching any particular topic. Further, they said that the exam alone is  not sufficient to determine whether agents have enough knowledge to  represent veterans. For attorneys, VA presumes that any attorney in good  standing with the bar is qualified and knowledgeable enough to assist  veterans. As such, attorneys are not required to take an initial exam to  demonstrate their knowledge of veterans\u2019 benefits law. However, officials  from two organizations that provide training for accreditation told us that  membership with the bar does not guarantee that an individual is  knowledgeable about VA benefits law. One attorney noted that it can take  years to understand VA benefits issues and provide knowledgeable  assistance in this area. In fact, representatives from one VSO told us that  attorneys and agents often contact VSOs with questions about  representing their claimants.", "In addition, VA\u2019s initial and ongoing training requirements do not ensure  accredited attorneys and agents are knowledgeable and VA does not  consistently enforce existing requirements. In addition to requiring that  attorneys and agents complete 3 hours of qualifying continuing legal  education (CLE) within 12 months as an initial condition of accreditation,  VA requires that accredited attorneys and agents complete 3 hours of  training every 2 years, and that this training cover certain topics such as  representation before VA, claims procedures, basic eligibility for benefits,  and appeal rights. Officials from two organizations that provide training for  accreditation told us that this amount of training is not sufficient to ensure  that attorneys and agents are knowledgeable. Additionally, officials from  these organizations told us that VA does not review, or provide guidance  on course content. OGC officials told us that they rely on each state bar  association to approve its own training, which can introduce variability  across states. Moreover, VA does not consistently ensure that attorneys  and agents complete required training. OGC officials told us that  individuals who do not certify their training requirements could have their  accreditation suspended. Despite this, OGC has fallen behind on its  monitoring of this requirement, and it is likely that individuals who should  not be accredited continue to assist claimants. After our May 2013 exit  briefing with VA, OGC officials informed us that they are developing plans  to annually audit the training certifications which attorneys and agents  must file with OGC.", "VA relies on VSOs to train their representatives and ensure that VSO  representatives can provide knowledgeable assistance to veterans with  relatively little oversight from VA.

Two VSOs we spoke with also said that they monitor  whether their representatives are meeting knowledge requirements.  However, the official who oversees accreditation said VA relies on VSOs  to ensure their staff have appropriate training and that VA does not review  VSO training programs. While VA did not express concerns about VSO  representatives meeting knowledge requirements, GAO\u2019s standards for  internal controls state that information about a program\u2019s operations  should be communicated to management, in order to determine whether  the agency is achieving compliance requirements under relevant laws  and regulations.

However, officials from an organization  representing attorneys and agents told us that VA does not consistently  follow up with veterans to make sure that their paperwork is complete and  there have been instances where mistakes on initial claims resulted in  veterans losing the ability to claim benefits that they were entitled to  receive. Similarly, the officials told us that a representative who is not  knowledgeable enough to use the appropriate language for appealing a  decision may result in VA not recognizing the communication as a formal  disagreement with VA\u2019s decision, in turn causing the veteran to miss the  deadline for appealing their claims case."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Resource Allocation and Unclear Communication with Claimants Hinder Efforts to Administer Accreditation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequate Staffing and Information Technology Leads to Backlogs and Limited Program Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["VA has dedicated only a few staff to administer its accreditation program,  which has resulted in limited monitoring efforts and workload backlogs.  VA officials told us that approximately four staff positions in OGC are  dedicated to accreditation. These staff are responsible for reviewing  thousands of applications each year, and ensuring that the approximately  20,000 individuals already accredited meet continuing requirements.  Officials told us this level of staffing is insufficient to carry out all these  responsibilities and that VA has chosen to prioritize screening initial  accreditation applications over monitoring ongoing requirements. Even  so, VA has a significant backlog of accreditation applications to review.  VA estimates that it may take 60 to 120 days to review an application  after it is received. Because by law only accredited individuals may  represent claimants, this backlog may cause delays for claimants who  need assistance with their claims.", "VA currently has no plans to permanently increase the number of staff  dedicated to accreditation. OGC officials told us that they have been  seeking to increase the number of staff working on accreditation, but have  been unsuccessful in obtaining additional permanent staff. An official  noted that in the fall of 2012, several staff were assigned to accreditation  on a temporary basis and, with their help, OGC was able to eliminate its  backlog of attorney and VSO representative applications. However, OGC  stated that a considerable backlog of agent applications remains and it is  likely the backlog of attorney and VSO representative applications will  return since this temporary initiative has ended. Moreover, as of May  2013, one of the four positions was not filled because of a resignation.  OGC is in the process of replacing staff lost to attrition as well as  obtaining an additional temporary staff person. Still, OGC officials stated  that they would need several additional staff beyond the four dedicated  positions to function more effectively. It is questionable if this will happen  in the near future as VA\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget calls for  fewer staff in VA\u2019s OGC. This may also affect OGC\u2019s plans to increase its  oversight of accredited representatives because those plans are  contingent upon eliminating the backlog of initial applications.", "VA\u2019s implementation of its accreditation process is also hampered by  limited information technology (IT) support. Officials told us that the  database system used by OGC cannot automatically inform individuals  that they are meeting program requirements and OGC staff must do this  manually. Further, an official noted that a significant amount of data entry  is required when applicants submit information for accreditation. Officials  noted that other IT improvements, such as the ability for applicants to  electronically submit applications, or for accredited representatives to  submit certifications of good standing and training certifications would  help OGC manage its responsibilities more efficiently.

In prior work, we reported  that targeted communication with a specific message is a best practice for  outreach to veterans. Individuals who do not yet have representation  receive a letter from VA after submitting a claim containing some  information on representation\u2014such as explaining what VSOs are and  that they provide assistance at no charge. However, the letter does not  discuss attorneys and agents, nor does it note that a claimant should not  have to pay for services associated with filing an initial claim. Similarly,  the form that claimants use to designate an attorney or agentindividuals to the section of the law governing fees, but does not explain  that claimants should not pay for filing an initial claim. Beyond these  forms, VBA officials told us that VA does not actively conduct outreach to  claimants regarding representation, what to expect from their  representative, or their right to not pay filing fees for initial claims. As a   refers  result, several VSOs we interviewed stated that veterans are often  unaware of their rights or what to expect during the claims process. One  VSO service officer told us that nearly all veterans he encounters are  unaware that they should not pay to file initial claims. He added that if a  veteran is told that he or she must pay a fee, the veteran will usually just  assume this is how business is done. Further, many of the complaints to  VA we reviewed regarded improper fees.", "VA\u2019s ability to learn about and address potential abuses also may be  hampered by a complaint process that is not well-communicated to  claimants. GAO standards for internal controls state that effective  communications\u2014such as with external stakeholders\u2014is critical for  agencies to ensure they receive information that may significantly affect  whether they achieve their objectives. While VA regulations establish a  complaint process, VA may be missing opportunities to serve and protect  claimants as it has not clearly communicated to claimants or others how  to report concerns about representatives. For example, VA\u2019s  accreditation website does not explicitly state how to report concerns  about representatives. While the website provides a link to an e-mail  address used for general inquiries, an official noted that OGC receives a  large volume of emails at this address\u2014including complaints\u2014and is  behind in responding to inquiries. Additionally, the materials provided to  individuals when filing a claim also do not clearly state how to report  complaints. When we interviewed veterans at two VSOs in the D.C. area,  we generally found that they were unfamiliar with program requirements  and did not know where or how to file a complaint.", "Further, the process of responding to and addressing complaints\u2014which  can be difficult and lengthy\u2014is understaffed, thereby limiting its  effectiveness. VA officials told us they require clear and convincing  evidence in order to cancel a representative\u2019s accreditation. One official  noted the process of monitoring representatives who received complaints  is difficult given competing demands for resources. Additionally, collecting  evidence can be difficult because claimants may be reluctant to reveal  their identities when making complaints. They added that some  cancellation actions may take years to resolve when representatives  exercise their right to appeal decisions. An OGC official told us that  allocated resources were currently inadequate to effectively monitor  representatives about whom complaints had been submitted and that  information about complaints is not shared with other parts of VA. For  instance, OGC does not share information with VBA that could help  identify or monitor the activities of representatives with complaints.

Because VA is not aware of  the extent to which these individuals interact with claimants, VA cannot  take action or ensure they provide quality services. An OGC official told  us that when it learns of these individuals, it is limited in the actions it can  take beyond instructing the individual to stop. Additionally, he said he has  written to state attorneys general offices regarding potential wrongful  actions a few times in the last year, but does not know if the states took  action. In our review, we found a few instances in which OGC sent letters  concerning unaccredited individuals to state attorneys general only to  continue to receive complaints about these individuals. An OGC official  added that, beyond cancelling or suspending accreditation, there are no  penalties for individuals who violate the requirements of accreditation and  that cases generally are not referred to VA\u2019s Inspector General.", "Accreditation also does not address whether individuals should sell  financial products to veterans. Our prior work has shown that some  accredited individuals were selling financial products to veterans in order  to shelter assets and allow them to qualify for VA pension benefits.Some of these cases involved vulnerable populations, such as veterans  in assisted living facilities, or involved individuals selling products that  resulted in veterans losing control of their assets without qualifying for VA  benefits. VA and some VSO officials told us that financial planners  continue to be an area of concern. VA officials told us that an increasing  number of financial planners are applying for accreditation as agents. In  fact, all six of the agents in our file review appeared to have a financial  planning background. VA also told us that when an individual with a  financial planning background applies for accreditation, it asks for  additional information about their business plans, reviews any business  websites, and reminds applicants that the purpose of accreditation is to  provide assistance to veterans and that they should not use accreditation  to promote financial products. That said, the official who oversees  accreditation told us that they often lack a sufficient basis to deny  accreditation to these individuals because being a financial planner in and  of itself does not violate VA\u2019s accreditation rules. He added that it might  be helpful to collect additional information on these individuals, such as  from financial regulators, when deciding whether to accredit them.", "It is also difficult for VA to ensure that claimants are being charged  appropriate fees. Attorneys and agents are not allowed to charge or  receive a fee for the preparation or initial filing of a claim, but are allowed  to charge a fee for services provided after VA has decided the claim and  a notice of disagreement has been filed initiating an appeal of that  decision. The allowable fee is often 20 percent of retroactive benefits  awarded if the claim is granted. However, there is no restriction on fees  charged for services before an individual files a claim. VA\u2019s OGC issued a  letter in 2004 noting that attorneys may charge claimants for services that  are rendered before the individual begins the process of filing a claim,  such as consulting with the individual about the range of VA and other  federal benefits he or she may qualify for. Some VSOs and other experts  expressed some concern regarding pre-filing consultation fees. The head  of one VSO noted that these fees may serve as a mechanism to hide the  fact that attorneys and agents are charging claimants for preparing  claims. Ambiguity regarding these fees makes it difficult for claimants and  VA to know whether they are being charged allowable fees, and may  result in attorneys inappropriately billing for work related to the claim as if  it was for a general consultation. Because fees for pre-filing activities are  outside the claims process, VA also has no way of knowing the extent to  which they occur or are properly charged.

We agree and fully support VA\u2019s plans to identify  available resources within and outside of OGC.", "VA concurred in principle with our second recommendation that it explore  strengthening initial and continuing knowledge requirements. VA stated  that it believes that existing initial knowledge requirements for attorneys  and agents adequately ensure that VA claimants have qualified  representation. Additionally, VA expressed concerns that additional  knowledge or testing requirements could have a chilling effect on attorney  representation for claimants. Nevertheless, VA stated that it will consider  ways in which it can equip newly accredited attorneys and agents with  information regarding veterans benefits law and procedures. Additionally,  VA stated it plans to revise and update examinations for prospective  agents to ensure they have adequate knowledge of veterans law and  procedures.  Regarding VSO representatives, VA reiterated that it  believes it is in each organization\u2019s best interest to ensure their  representatives are competent and qualified. Nevertheless, VA plans to  request and review training curricula for up to about 10 percent of  recognized organizations each year\u2014an effort which we commend.  We  support these efforts, but continue to believe VA should consider ways to  better equip all accredited attorneys and agents with relevant information  and not limit efforts to just newly accredited attorneys and agents, for  example, by improving the quality of required continuing legal education.", "Regarding our recommendation to enhance communications with  claimants, VA concurred and plans to include information on how to  report complaints on OGC\u2019s accreditation Web site, and will work with  VBA to identify potential outreach activities.  We agree with VA\u2019s stated  efforts to improve communication with claimants.", "VA also concurred in principle with our recommendation to explore  options for addressing potentially abusive practices by representatives  and stated it would consider seeking additional legislative authority to  address these practices and enforce program rules. VA noted that  imposing penalties on unaccredited individuals, individuals who  inappropriately charge claimants, or sell financial products to claimants  could help curb inappropriate practices, but in some cases may have a  chilling effect on the legitimate activities of others. We acknowledge that  penalties may be an appropriate deterrent in some but not all  circumstances and agree with VA\u2019s desire to balance any changes with  maintaining access for claimants to valuable assistance. We also urge VA  to further explore other remedies that would not require legislative action,  such as closer cooperation with state and local law enforcement  regarding individuals who may commit unlawful acts.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We conducted this performance audit from September 2012 to  August 2013, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

To assess the extent to which VA carries out its  procedures, we reviewed a random, representative sample of 92 case  files for attorneys and agents who were granted accreditation in 2012.  We examined these files to determine whether individuals provided  complete information on their personal histories, whether individuals had  the appropriate qualifications, and to determine whether VA took steps to  collect additional information when necessary. We determined whether  the evidence in each file indicated that VA carried out the procedures that  VA officials stated they follow when reviewing files.reviewed all 24 complaints that OGC received in 2012 regarding  attorneys and claim agents in order to understand the actions that VA  takes in response to concerns. Additionally, we selected a random,  judgmental sample of 21 attorneys and agents to determine whether an  independent background check would uncover issues that could call their  character into question. These 21 individuals consisted of 5 attorneys and  6 agents selected in our random sample of 2012 accreditation decisions,   Additionally, we  and 5 attorneys and 5 agents whose complaint files we reviewed.used Accurint\u2014a commercial database of public records\u2014to determine  whether these individuals had (1) a criminal history, (2) bankruptcies, (3)  liens, or (4) professional licenses revoked.
