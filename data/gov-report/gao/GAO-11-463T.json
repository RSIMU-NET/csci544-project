In recent testimony, the Director of National Intelligence stated that there had been a dramatic increase in malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. computers and networks. In addition, recent reports of cyber attacks and incidents affecting federal systems and critical infrastructures illustrate the potential impact of such events on national and economic security. The nation's ever-increasing dependence on information systems to carry out essential everyday operations makes it vulnerable to an array of cyber-based risks. Thus it is increasingly important that federal and nonfederal entities carry out concerted efforts to safeguard their systems and the information they contain. GAO is providing a statement describing (1) cyber threats to cyber-reliant critical infrastructures and federal information systems and (2) the continuing challenges facing federal agencies in protecting the nation's cyber-reliant critical infrastructure and federal systems. In preparing this statement, GAO relied on its previously published work in the area, which included many recommendations for improvements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Cyber-based threats to critical infrastructure and federal systems are evolving and growing. These threats can come from a variety of sources, including criminals and foreign nations, as well as hackers and disgruntled employees. These potential attackers have a variety of techniques at their disposal that can vastly expand the reach and impact of their actions. In addition, the interconnectivity between information systems, the Internet, and other infrastructure presents increasing opportunities for such attacks. Consistent with this, reports of security incidents from federal agencies are on the rise, increasing over 650 percent over the past 5 years. In addition, reports of cyber attacks and information security incidents affecting federal systems and systems supporting critical infrastructure illustrate the serious impact such incidents can have on national and economic security, including the loss of classified information and intellectual property worth millions of dollars. The administration and executive branch agencies continue to act to better protect cyber-reliant critical infrastructures, improve the security of federal systems, and strengthen the nation's cybersecurity posture. However, they have not yet fully implemented key actions that are intended to address threats and improve the current U.S. approach to cybersecurity, such as (1) implementing near- and mid-term actions recommended by the cybersecurity policy review directed by the president; (2) updating the national strategy for securing the information and communications infrastructure; (3) developing a comprehensive national strategy for addressing global cybersecurity and governance; and (4) creating a prioritized national and federal research and development agenda for improving cybersecurity. Federal systems continue to be afflicted by persistent information security control weaknesses. For example, as part of its audit of the fiscal year 2010 financial statements for the U.S. government, GAO determined that serious and widespread information security control deficiencies were a governmentwide material weakness. Over the past several years, GAO and agency inspectors general have made hundreds of recommendations to agencies for actions necessary to resolve prior significant control deficiencies and information security program shortfalls. The White House, the Office of Management and Budget, and selected federal agencies have undertaken additional governmentwide initiatives intended to enhance information security at federal agencies. However, these initiatives face challenges, such as better defining agency roles and responsibilities and establishing measures of effectiveness, and require sustained attention, which agencies have begun to provide. As such, GAO continues to identify protecting the federal government's information systems and the nation's cyber critical infrastructure as a governmentwide high-risk area."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify at today\u2019s hearing on the cyber  threats to critical infrastructure and the American economy.", "Pervasive and sustained cyber attacks against the United States continue  to pose a potentially devastating impact on federal and nonfederal systems  and operations. In February 2011, the Director of National Intelligence  testified that, in the past year, there had been a dramatic increase in  malicious cyber activity targeting U.S. computers and networks, including  a more than tripling of the volume of malicious software since 2009.  Recent press reports that computer hackers broke into and stole  proprietary information worth millions of dollars from the networks of six  U.S. and European energy companies also demonstrate the risk that our  nation faces. Such attacks highlight the importance of developing a  concerted response to safeguard federal and nonfederal information  systems.", "Mr. Chairman, GAO recently issued its high-risk list of government  programs that have greater vulnerability to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement or need transformation to address economy, efficiency,  or effectiveness challenges. Once again, we identified protecting the  federal government\u2019s information systems and the nation\u2019s cyber critical  infrastructure as a governmentwide high-risk area. We have designated  federal information security as a high-risk area since 1997; in 2003, we  expanded this high-risk area to include protecting systems supporting our  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, referred to as cyber critical infrastructure  protection or cyber CIP.", "In my testimony today I will describe (1) cyber threats to cyber-reliant  critical infrastructures and federal information systems and (2) the  continuing challenges federal agencies face in protecting the nation\u2019s  cyber-reliant critical infrastructures and federal systems.

Public and private organizations rely on computer systems to transfer  increasing amounts of money and sensitive and proprietary information,  conduct operations, and deliver services to constituents.", "The security of these systems and data is essential to protecting national  and economic security, and public health and safety. Conversely,  ineffective information security controls can result in significant risks,  including the loss of resources, such as federal payments and collections;  inappropriate access to sensitive information, such as national security  information, personal information on taxpayers, or proprietary business  information; disruption of critical operations supporting critical  infrastructure, national defense, or emergency services; and undermining  of agency missions due to embarrassing incidents that diminish public  confidence in government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cyber-reliant Critical Infrastructure and Federal Systems Face Increasing Cyber Threats", "paragraphs": ["Threats to systems supporting critical infrastructure and federal  information systems are evolving and growing. Government officials are  concerned about attacks from individuals and groups with malicious  intent, such as criminals, terrorists, and foreign nations. Federal law  enforcement and intelligence agencies have identified multiple sources of  threats to our nation\u2019s critical information systems, including foreign  nations engaged in espionage and information warfare, criminals, hackers,  virus writers, and disgruntled employees and contractors. These groups  and individuals have a variety of attack techniques at their disposal that  can be used to determine vulnerabilities and gain entry into targeted  systems. For example, phishing involves the creation and use of fake e- mails and Web sites to deceive Internet users into disclosing their personal  data and other sensitive information.", "The connectivity between information systems, the Internet, and other  infrastructures also creates opportunities for attackers to disrupt  telecommunications, electrical power, and other critical services. For  example, in May 2008, we reported that the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s  (TVA) corporate network contained security weaknesses that could lead  to the disruption of control systems networks and devices connected to  that network. We made 19 recommendations to improve the  implementation of information security program activities for the control  systems governing TVA\u2019s critical infrastructures and 73 recommendations  to address weaknesses in information security controls. TVA concurred  with the recommendations and has taken steps to implement them.

These incidents put sensitive information at risk. Personally  identifiable information about U.S. citizens has been lost, stolen, or  improperly disclosed, thereby potentially exposing those individuals to  loss of privacy, identity theft, and financial crimes. Agencies have  experienced a wide range of incidents involving data loss or theft,  computer intrusions, and privacy breaches, underscoring the need for  improved security practices. Further, reported attacks and unintentional  incidents involving critical infrastructure systems demonstrate that a  serious attack could be devastating.", "When incidents occur, agencies are to notify the federal information  security incident center\u2014the United States Computer Emergency  Readiness Team (US-CERT). Over the past 5 years, the number of  incidents reported by federal agencies to US-CERT has increased  dramatically, from 5,503 incidents reported in fiscal year 2006 to about  41,776 incidents in fiscal year 2010 (a more than 650 percent increase). The  three most prevalent types of incidents and events reported to US-CERT  during fiscal year 2010 were: (1) malicious code (software that infects an  operating system or application), (2) improper usage (a violation of  acceptable computing use policies), and (3) unauthorized access (where  an individual gains logical or physical access to a system without  permission). Additionally, according to Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) officials, US-CERT detects incidents and events through its  intrusion detection system, supplemented by agency reports, for  investigation (unconfirmed incidents that are potentially malicious or  anomalous activity deemed by the reporting entity to warrant further  review).", "Reports of cyber attacks and information security incidents against federal  systems and systems supporting critical infrastructure illustrate the effect  that such incidents could have on national and economic security.", "In July 2010, the Department of Defense (DOD) launched an investigation  to identify how thousands of classified military documents (including  Afghanistan and Iraq war operations, as well as field reports on Pakistan)  were obtained by the group WikiLeaks.org. According to DOD, this  investigation was related to an ongoing investigation of an Army private  charged with, among other things, transmitting national defense  information to an unauthorized source.", "In 2010, the Deputy Secretary of Defense stated that DOD suffered a  significant compromise of its classified military computer networks in  2008.

For  example, in its role as the focal point for federal efforts to protect the  nation\u2019s cyber critical infrastructures, DHS issued a revised national  infrastructure protection plan in 2009 and an interim national cyber  incident response plan in 2010. Executive branch agencies have also made  progress instituting several governmentwide initiatives that are aimed at  bolstering aspects of federal cybersecurity, such as reducing the number  of federal access points to the Internet, establishing security  configurations for desktop computers, and enhancing situational  awareness of cyber events.

In  October 2010, we reported that 2 recommendations had been implemented  and 22 were partially implemented. Officials from key agencies involved  in these efforts (e.g., DHS, DOD, and the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB)) stated that progress had been slower than expected  because agencies lacked assigned roles and responsibilities and because  several of the mid-term recommendations would require action over  multiple years.

In July 2010, we reported that the U.S.  government faced a number of challenges in formulating and  implementing a coherent approach to global aspects of cyberspace,  including, among other things, providing top-level leadership and  developing a comprehensive strategy. Specifically, we found that the  national Cybersecurity Coordinator\u2019s authority and capacity to effectively  coordinate and forge a coherent national approach to cybersecurity were  still under development. In addition, the U.S. government had not  documented a clear vision of how the international efforts of federal  entities, taken together, support overarching national goals. We  recommended that, among other things, the national Cybersecurity  Coordinator develop with other relevant entities a comprehensive U.S.  global cyberspace strategy. The coordinator and his staff concurred with  our recommendations and stated that actions had already been initiated to  address them.", "Finalizing cybersecurity guidelines and monitoring compliance related  to electricity grid modernization. In January 2011, we reported on efforts  by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop  cybersecurity guidelines and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  (FERC) efforts to adopt and monitor cybersecurity standards related to  the electric industry\u2019s incorporation of IT systems to improve reliability  and efficiency\u2014commonly referred to as the smart grid. We determined  that NIST had not addressed all key elements of cybersecurity in its initial  guidelines or finalized plans for doing so. We also determined that FERC  had not developed an approach for monitoring industry compliance with  its initial set of voluntary standards. Further, we identified six key  challenges with respect to securing smart grid systems, including a lack of  security features being built into certain smart grid systems and an  ineffective mechanism for sharing information on cybersecurity within the  industry. We recommended that NIST finalize its plans for updating its  cybersecurity guidelines to incorporate missing elements and that FERC  develop a coordinated approach to monitor voluntary standards and  address any gaps in compliance. Both agencies agreed with these  recommendations.", "Creating a prioritized national and federal cybersecurity research and  development (R&D) agenda. In June 2010, we reported that while efforts  to improve cybersecurity R&D were under way by the White House\u2019s  Office Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and other federal entities,  six major challenges impeded these efforts. Among the most critical was  the lack of a prioritized national cybersecurity research and development  agenda. We found that despite its legal responsibility and our past  recommendations, a key OSTP subcommittee had not created a prioritized  national R&D agenda, increasing the risk that research pursued by  individual organizations will not reflect national priorities.
