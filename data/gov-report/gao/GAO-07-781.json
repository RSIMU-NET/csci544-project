However, federal government leadership roles and responsibilities for preparing for and responding to a pandemic continue to evolve, and will require further clarification and testing before the relationships of the many leadership positions are well understood. The Strategy and Plan do not specify how the leadership roles and responsibilities will work in addressing the unique characteristics of an influenza pandemic, which could occur simultaneously in multiple locations and over a long period. A pandemic could extend well beyond health and medical boundaries, affecting critical infrastructure, the movement of goods and services across the nation and the globe, and economic and security considerations. Although the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Secretary is to lead the public health and medical response and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Secretary is to lead overall nonmedical support and response actions, the Plan does not clearly address these simultaneous responsibilities or how these roles are to work together, particularly over an extended period and at multiple locations across the country. In addition, the Secretary of DHS has designated a national Principal Federal Official (PFO) to facilitate pandemic coordination as well as five regional PFOs and five regional Federal Coordinating Officers. Most of these leadership roles and responsibilities have not been tested under pandemic scenarios, leaving it unclear how they will work. Because initial actions may help limit the spread of an influenza virus, the effective exercise of shared leadership roles and responsibilities could have substantial consequences. However, only one national multisector pandemic-related exercise has been held and that was prior to the issuance of the Plan. While the Strategy and Plan are an important first step in guiding national preparedness, they do not fully address all six characteristics of an effective national strategy. Specifically, they fully address only one of the six characteristics, by reflecting a clear description and understanding of problems to be addressed, and do not address one characteristic because the documents do not describe the financial resources needed to implement actions. Although the other characteristics are partially addressed, important gaps exist that could hinder the ability of key stakeholders to effectively execute their responsibilities, including state and local jurisdictions that will play crucial roles in preparing for and responding to a pandemic were not directly involved in developing the Plan, relationships and priorities among actions were not clearly described, performance measures focused on activities that are not always linked to results; insufficient information is provided about how the documents are integrated with other key related plans, and no process is provided for monitoring and reporting on progress."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["An influenza pandemic is a real and significant threat facing the United  An influenza pandemic is a real and significant threat facing the United  States and the world.

However, the leadership roles and  responsibilities prescribed under the NRP may need to operate somewhat  differently because of the characteristics of a pandemic that distinguish it  from other emergency incidents. For example, because a pandemic  influenza is likely to occur in successive waves, planning has to consider  how to sustain response mechanisms for several months to over a year\u2014 issues that are not clearly addressed in the Plan. In addition, the  distributed nature of a pandemic, as well as the sheer burden of disease  across the nation, means that the support states, localities, and tribal  entities can expect from the federal government would be limited in  comparison to the aid it mobilizes for geographically and temporarily  bounded disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes. Consequently, legal  authorities, roles and responsibilities, and lines of authority at all levels of  government must be clearly defined, effectively communicated, and well- understood to facilitate rapid and effective decision making.

It also states that  in the context of response to a pandemic, the Secretary of Homeland  Security would coordinate overall nonmedical support and response  actions, sustain critical infrastructure, and ensure necessary support to the  Secretary of Health and Human Services\u2019 coordination of public health and  medical emergency response efforts. Additionally, the Plan states that the  Secretary of Homeland Security would be responsible for coordinating the  overall response to the pandemic; implementing policies that facilitate  compliance with recommended social distancing measures; providing for a  common operating picture for all departments and agencies of the federal  government; and ensuring the integrity of the nation\u2019s infrastructure,  domestic security, and entry and exit screening for influenza at the  borders.", "Other DHS responsibilities include operating and maintaining the National  Biosurveillance Integration System, which is intended to provide an all- source biosurveillance common operating picture to improve early  warning capabilities and facilitate national response activities through  better situational awareness. This responsibility, however, appears to be  both a public health issue and an overall incident management issue,  raising similar issues about the interrelationship of DHS and HHS roles  and responsibilities. In addition, a pandemic could threaten our critical  infrastructure, such as the capability to deliver electricity or food, by  removing essential personnel from the workplace for weeks or months.  The extent to which this would be considered a medical response with the  Secretary of Health and Human Services in the lead, or when it would be  under the Secretary of Homeland Security\u2019s leadership as part of his/her  responsibility for ensuring that critical infrastructure is protected, is  unclear. According to HHS officials we interviewed, resolving this  ambiguity will depend on several factors, including how the outbreak  occurs and the severity of the pandemic.", "Officials from other agencies also need greater clarity about these roles  and responsibilities. For example, USDA is not planning for DHS to  assume the lead coordinating role if an outbreak of avian flu among  poultry occurs sufficient in scope to warrant a presidential declaration of  an emergency or major disaster.

For example, a FEMA official said that given the number of  people who would be involved in responding to a pandemic, collaboration  between HHS, DHS, and FEMA would need to be greater than for any  other past emergencies. Officials are starting to build relationships among  the federal actors for a pandemic. For example, some of the federal  officials with leadership roles for an influenza pandemic met during the  week of March 19, 2007, to continue to identify issues and begin  developing solutions. One of the participants, however, told us that  although additional coordination meetings are needed, it may be  challenging since there is no dedicated funding for the staff working on  pandemic issues to participate in these and other related meetings.", "The national PFO for pandemic influenza said that a draft charter has also  been developed to establish a Pandemic Influenza PFO Working Group to  help identify and address many policy and operational issues before a  pandemic. According to a FEMA official, some of these issues include staff  availability, protective measures for staff, and how to ensure that the  assistance to be provided under the Stafford Act is implemented and  coordinated in a unified and consistent manner across the country during  a pandemic. As of June 7, 2007, the draft charter was undergoing some  revisions and was expected to be sent to the Secretary of Homeland  Security for review and approval around the end of June. Additionally,  there are plans to identify related exercises, within and outside of the  federal government, to create a consolidated schedule of exercises for the  national PFO for pandemic influenza and regional PFOs and FCOs to  participate in by leveraging existing exercise plans. DHS officials said that  they expect FEMA would retain responsibility for maintaining this  consolidated schedule.", "It is unclear whether the newly established national and regional positions  for a pandemic will further clarify leadership roles. For example, in 2006,  DHS made revisions to the NRP and released a Supplement to the  Catastrophic Incident Annex\u2014both designed to further clarify federal  roles and responsibilities and relationships among federal, state, and local  governments and responders. However, we reported in February 2007 that  these revisions had not been tested and there was little information  available on the extent to which these and other actions DHS was taking  to improve readiness were operational. Additionally, DHS is currently  coordinating a comprehensive review of the NRP and NIMS to assess their  effectiveness, identify improvements, and recommend modifications.

We found that the Strategy and Plan partially  address this characteristic by describing their purpose and scope.  However, neither document described in adequate detail their  methodology for involving key stakeholders, how they relate to other  national strategies, or a process for updating the Plan.", "In describing its purpose, the Strategy states that it was developed to  provide strategic direction for the departments and agencies of the U.S.  government and guide the U.S. preparedness and response activities to  mitigate the impact of a pandemic. In support of the Strategy, the Plan  states that its purpose is to translate the Strategy into tangible action and  direct federal departments and agencies to take specific, coordinated steps  to achieve the goals of the Strategy and outline expectations for state,  local, and tribal entities; businesses; schools and universities;  communities; nongovernmental organizations; and international partners.", "As a part of its scope, the Plan identifies six major functions:                     (1) protecting human health, (2) protecting animal health, (3) international  considerations, (4) transportation and borders, (5) security  considerations, and (6) institutional considerations.

The Strategy\u2019s  guiding principles include recognition of the private sector\u2019s integral role  and leveraging global partnerships. The Plan\u2019s principles are more  expansive, listing 12 planning assumptions that it identifies as facilitating  its planning efforts. For example, 1 of the assumptions is that illness rates  would be highest among school-aged children (about 40 percent).", "Another element under this characteristic is the involvement of key  stakeholders in the development of the strategy. Neither the Strategy nor  Plan described the involvement of key stakeholders, such as state, local,  and tribal entities, in the development of the Strategy or Plan, even though  they would be on the front lines in a pandemic and the Plan identifies  actions they should complete. The Plan contains 17 actions calling for  state, local, and tribal governments to lead national and subnational  efforts, and identifies another 64 actions where their involvement is  needed. Officials told us that federal stakeholders had opportunities to  review and comment on the Plan but that state, local, and tribal entities  were not directly involved, although the drafters of the Plan were  generally aware of their concerns. Stakeholder involvement during the  planning process is important to ensure that the federal government\u2019s and  nonfederal entities\u2019 responsibilities and resource requirements are clearly  understood and agreed upon. Therefore, the Strategy and Plan may not  fully reflect a national perspective on this critical national issue since  nonfederal stakeholders were not involved in the process to develop the  actions where their leadership, support, or both would be needed. Further,  these nonfederal stakeholders need to understand their critical roles in  order to be prepared to work effectively under difficult and challenging  circumstances.", "Both documents address the scope of their coverage and include several  important elements in their discussions, but do not address how they  compare and contrast to other national strategies. The Strategy recognizes  that preparing for a pandemic is more than a purely federal responsibility,  and that the nation must have a system of plans at all levels of government  and in all sectors outside of government that can be integrated to address  the pandemic threat. It also extends its scope to include the development  of an international effort as a central component of overall capacity. The  Strategy lays out the major functions, mission areas, and activities  considered under the extent of its coverage. For example, the Strategy\u2019s  scope is defined as extending well beyond health and medical boundaries,  to include sustaining critical infrastructure, private sector activities, the  movement of goods and services across the nation and the globe, and  economic and security considerations. Although the Strategy states that it  will be consistent with the National Security Strategy and the Strategy for  Homeland Security, it does not specify how they are related. The Plan  mentions the NRP and states that it will guide the federal pandemic  response.

In this regard, the Plan recognizes that one of the nation\u2019s  greatest vulnerabilities is the lack of connectivity between communities  responsible for pandemic preparedness. The Plan specifically cites  vulnerabilities in coordination of efforts between the animal and human  health communities, as well as between the public health and medical  communities.

For example, pillar 2, surveillance and  detection, under the transportation and borders functional area, includes  an objective to develop and exercise mechanisms to provide active and  passive surveillance during an outbreak, both within and outside our  borders. Under this objective is an action item for HHS, in coordination  with other specific federal agencies, to develop policy recommendations  for transportation and borders entry and exit protocols, screening, or both  and to review the need to develop domestic response protocols and  screening within 6 months. The item\u2019s performance measure is policy  recommendations for response protocols, screening, or both.", "While some action items depend on other action items, these linkages are  not always apparent in the Plan. For example, one action item, concerning  the development of a joint strategy for deploying federal health care and  public health assets and personnel, is under the preparedness and  communication pillar. However, another action item concerning the  development of strategic principles for deployment of federal medical  assets is under the response and containment pillar within the same  chapter. While these two action items are clearly related, the plan does not  make a connection between the two or discuss their relationship. An HHS  official who helped draft the Plan acknowledged that while an effort was  made to ensure linkages among action items, there may be gaps in the  linkages among interdependent action items within and across the Plan\u2019s  chapters on the six functional areas (i.e., the chapters that contain action  items).", "Some action items, particularly those that are to be completed by state,  local, and tribal governments or the private sector, do not identify an  entity responsible for carrying out the action. Although the plan specifies  actions to be carried out by states, local jurisdictions, and other entities,  including the private sector, it gives no indication of how these actions will  be monitored and how their completion will be ensured. For example, one  such action item states that \u201call health care facilities should develop and  test infectious disease surge capacity plans that address challenges  including: increased demand for services, staff shortages, infectious  disease isolation protocols, supply shortages, and security.\u201d Similarly,  another action item states that \u201call Federal, State, local, tribal, and private  sector medical facilities should ensure that protocols for transporting  influenza specimens to appropriate reference laboratories are in place  within 3 months.\u201d Yet the plan does not make clear who will be  responsible for making sure that these actions are completed.", "While most of the action items have deadlines for completion, ranging  from 3 months to 3 years, the Plan does not identify a process to monitor  and report on the progress of the action items nor does it include a  schedule for reporting progress. Agency officials told us that they had  identified individuals to act as overall coordinators to monitor the action  items for which their agencies have lead responsibility and provide  periodic progress reports to the HSC. However, we could not identify a  similar mechanism to monitor the progress of the action items that fall to  state and local governments or the private sector. The first public  reporting on the status of the action items occurred in December 2006  when the HSC reported on the status of the action items that were to have  been completed by November 3, 2006\u20146 months after the release of the  Plan. Of the 119 action items that were to be completed by that time, we  found that the HSC omitted the status of 16 action items. Two of the action  items that were omitted from the report were to (1) establish an  interagency transportation and border preparedness working group and  (2) engage in contingency planning and related exercises to ensure  preparedness to maintain essential operations and conduct missions.", "Additionally, we found that several of the action items that were reported  by the HSC as being completed were still in progress. For example, DHS,  in coordination with the Department of State (State), HHS, the Department  of the Treasury (Treasury), and the travel and trade industry, was to tailor  existing automated screening programs and extended border programs to  increase scrutiny of travelers and cargo based on potential risk factors  within 6 months. The measure of performance was to implement enhanced  risk-based screening protocols. Although this action item was reported as  complete, the HSC reported that DHS was still developing risk-based  screening protocols, a major component of this action. A DHS official,  responsible for coordinating the completion of DHS-led action items,  acknowledged that all action items are a work in progress and that they  would continue to be improved, including those items that were listed as  completed in the report. The HSC\u2019s report included a statement that a  determination of \u201ccomplete\u201d does not necessarily mean that work has  ended; in many cases work is ongoing. Instead, the complete  determination means that the measure of performance associated with an  action item was met. It appears that this determination has not been  consistently or accurately applied for all items. Our recent report on U.S.  agencies\u2019 international efforts to forestall a pandemic influenza also  reported that eight of the Plan\u2019s international-related action items included  in the HSC\u2019s report either did not directly address the associated  performance measure or did not indicate that the completion deadline had  been met.", "Most of the Plan\u2019s performance measures are focused on activities such as  disseminating guidance, but the measures are not always clearly linked  with intended results. This lack of clear linkages makes it difficult to  ascertain whether progress has in fact been made toward achieving the  national goals and objectives described in the Strategy and Plan. Most of  the Plan\u2019s performance measures consist of actions to be completed, such  as guidance developed and disseminated. Without a clear linkage to  anticipated results, these measures of activities do not give an indication  of whether the purpose of the activity is achieved. Further, 18 of the action  items have no measure of performance associated with them. In addition,  the plan does not establish priorities among its 324 action items, which  becomes especially important as agencies and other parties strive to  effectively manage scarce resources and ensure that the most important  steps are accomplished."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Strategy and Plan Do Not Address Resources, Investments, and Risk Management", "paragraphs": ["A national strategy needs to describe what the strategy will cost; identify  where resources will be targeted to achieve the maximum results; and  describe how the strategy balances benefits, risks, and costs. Guidance on  costs and resources needed using a risk management approach helps  implementing parties allocate resources according to priorities, track  costs and performance, and shift resources, as appropriate. We found that  neither the Strategy nor Plan contain these elements.", "While neither document addresses the overall cost to implement the Plan,  the Plan refers to the administration\u2019s budget request of $7.1 billion and a  congressional appropriation of $3.8 billion to support the objectives of the  Strategy. In November 2005, the administration requested $7.1 billion in  emergency supplemental funding over 3 years to support the  implementation of the Strategy. In December 2005, Congress appropriated  $3.8 billion to support budget requirements to help address pandemic  influenza issues. The Plan states that much of this funding would be  directed toward domestic preparedness and the establishment of  countermeasure stockpile and production capacity, with $400 million  directed to bilateral and multilateral international efforts. However, the 3- year $7.1 billion budget proposal does not coincide with the period of the  Plan. Additionally, whereas the Plan does not allocate funds to specific  action items, our analysis of budget documents indicates that the funds  were allocated primarily toward those action items related to vaccines and  antivirals.", "Developing and sustaining the capabilities stipulated in the Plan would  require the effective use of federal, state, and local funds. Given that  funding needs may not be readily addressed through existing mechanisms  and could stress existing government and private resources, it is critical  for the Plan to lay out funding requirements. For example, the Plan states  that one of the primary objectives of domestic vaccine production  capacity would be for domestic manufacturers to produce enough vaccine  for the entire U.S. population within 6 months. However, it states that  production capacity would depend on the availability of future  appropriations. Despite the fact that the production of enough vaccine for  the population would be critical if a pandemic were to occur, the Plan  does not provide even a rough estimate of how much the vaccine could  cost for consideration in future appropriations.", "Despite the numerous action items and specific implementing directives  and guidance directed toward federal agencies, states, organizations, and  businesses, neither document addresses what it would cost to complete  the actions that are stipulated. Rather, the Plan states that the local  communities would have to address the medical and nonmedical effects of  the pandemic with available resources, and also that pandemic influenza  response activities may exceed the budgetary resources of responding  federal and state government agencies.", "The overall uncertainty of funding to complete action items stipulated in  the Plan has been problematic. For example, there were more than 50  actions in the Plan that were to be completed before the end of 2006 for  which DOD was either a lead or support agency. We reported that because  DOD had not yet requested funding, it was unclear whether DOD could  address the tasks assigned to it in the Plan and pursue its own  preparedness efforts for its workforce departmentwide within current  resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Strategy and Plan Partially Address Organizational Roles, Responsibilities, and Coordination", "paragraphs": ["A national strategy should address which organizations would implement  the strategy, their roles and responsibilities, and mechanisms for  coordinating their efforts.

This  characteristic entails identifying the specific federal departments,  agencies, and offices involved and, where appropriate, the different  sectors, such as state, local, private, and international sectors. We found  that the Strategy and Plan partially address this characteristic by  containing broad information on roles and responsibilities. But, as we  noted earlier, while the Plan describes coordination mechanisms for  responding to a pandemic, it does not clarify how responsible officials  would share leadership responsibilities. In addition, it does not describe  mechanisms for coordinating preparations and completing the action  items, nor does it describe an overall accountability and oversight  framework.", "The Strategy identifies lead agencies for preparedness and response.  Specifically, HHS is the lead agency for medical response; USDA for  veterinary response; State for international activities; and DHS for overall  domestic incident management, sustainment of critical infrastructure and  key resources, and federal coordination. The Plan also briefly describes  the preparedness and response roles and responsibilities of DOD, the  Department of Labor, DOT, and Treasury. The Plan states that these and  all federal cabinet agencies are responsible for their respective sectors and  developing pandemic response plans. In addition, the Strategy and Plan  broadly describe the expected roles and responsibilities of state, local, and  tribal governments; international partners; the private and nonprofit  sectors; and individuals and families. For example, in the functional area  of transportation and borders, the Plan states that it expects state and  local communities to involve transportation and health professionals to  identify transportation options, consequences, and implications in the  event of a pandemic.", "The Plan states that the primary mechanism for coordinating the federal  government\u2019s response to a pandemic is the NRP. In this regard, the Plan  acknowledges that sustaining mechanisms for several months to over a  year will present unique challenges, and thus day-to-day monitoring of the  response to a pandemic influenza would occur through the national  operations center with an interagency body composed of senior decision  makers from across the government and chaired by the White House.  Additionally, the Plan states that policy issues that cannot be resolved at  the department level would be addressed through the HSC-National  Security Council policy coordination process. As stipulated in the Plan, the  specifics of this policy coordination mechanism were included in the May  2006 revisions to the NRP.", "The Plan also generally identifies lead and support roles for the action  items federal agencies are responsible for completing, but it is not explicit  in defining these roles or processes for coordination and collaboration.  While it identifies which federal agencies have lead and support roles for  completing 305 action items, the Plan does not define the roles of the lead  and support agencies. Rather, it leaves it to the agencies to interpret and  negotiate their roles. According to DOT officials we met with, this lack of  clarity, coupled with staff turnover, left them unclear about their roles and  responsibilities in completing action items. Thus, they had to seek  clarification from DHS and HHS officials to assist them in defining what it  meant to be the lead agency for an action item. Additionally, the Plan does  not describe specific processes for coordination and collaboration  between federal and nonfederal organizations and sectors for completing  the action items.", "Related to this issue, we recently reported that some of DOD\u2019s combatant  commands, tasked with providing support in the event of a pandemic, had  received limited detailed guidance from the lead agencies about what  support they may be asked to provide during a pandemic. This has  hindered these commands\u2019 ability to plan to provide support to lead  federal agencies domestically and abroad during a pandemic.", "The Plan also does not describe the role played by organizations that are  to provide the overall framework for accountability and oversight, such as  the HSC. According to agency officials, the HSC is monitoring executive  branch agencies\u2019 efforts to complete the action items. However, there is no  specific documentation describing this process or institutionalizing it.

The  current interim Goal is particularly important for determining what  capabilities are needed for a catastrophic disaster. It defines 36 major  capabilities that first responders should possess to prevent, protect from,  respond to, and recover from a wide range of incidents and the most  critical tasks associated with these capabilities. An inability to effectively  perform these critical tasks would, by definition, have a detrimental effect  on protection, prevention, response, and recovery capabilities. The interim  Goal also includes 15 planning scenarios, including one for pandemic  influenza that outlines universal and critical tasks to be undertaken for  planning for an influenza pandemic and target capabilities, such as search  and rescue and economic and community recovery. Yet, the Strategy and  Plan do not integrate this already-developed planning scenario and related  tasks and capabilities. One federal agency official who assisted in drafting  the Plan told us that the Goal and its pandemic influenza scenario had  been considered but omitted because the Goal\u2019s pandemic influenza  scenario is geared to a less severe pandemic\u2014such as those that occurred  in 1957 and 1968\u2014while the Plan is based on the more severe 1918-level  mortality and morbidity rates.", "Further, the Strategy and Plan do not provide sufficient detail about how  the Strategy, action items, and proposed set of independent plans are to be  integrated with other national strategies and framework. Without clearly  providing this linkage, the Plan may limit a common understanding of the  overarching framework, thereby hindering the nation\u2019s ability to  effectively prepare for, respond to, and recover from a pandemic. For  example, the Plan contains 39 action items that are response related (i.e.,  specific actions are to be taken within a prescribed number of hours or  days after an outbreak). However, these action items are interspersed  among the 324 action items, and the Plan does not describe the linkages of  these response-related action items with the NRP or other response  related plans. Further, DHS officials have recognized the need for a  common understanding across federal agencies and better integration of  agencies plans to prepare for and respond to a pandemic. DHS officials are  developing a Federal Concept Plan for Pandemic Influenza to enhance  interagency preparedness, response, and recovery efforts.", "The Plan also requires the federal departments and agencies to develop  their own pandemic plans that describe the operational details related to  the respective action items and cover the following areas: (1) protection of  their employees; (2) maintenance of their essential functions and services;  (3) how they would support both the federal response to a pandemic and  those of states, localities, and tribal entities; and (4) the manner in which  they would communicate messages about pandemic planning and  response to their stakeholders. Further, it is unclear whether all the  departments will share some or all of the information in their plans with  nonfederal entities. While some agencies-such as HHS, DOD, and the  Department of Veterans Affairs-have publicly released their pandemic  plans, at least one agency, DHS, has indicated that it does not intend to  publicly release its plan. Since DHS is a lead agency for planning for and  responding to a pandemic, this gap may make it more challenging to fully  advance joint and integrated planning across all levels of government and  the private sector.", "The Plan recognizes and discusses the need for integrating planning across  all levels of government and the private sector to ensure that the plans and  response actions are complementary, compatible, and coordinated. In this  regard, the Plan provides initial planning guidance for state, local, and  tribal entities; businesses; schools and universities; and nongovernmental  organizations for a pandemic. It also includes various action items that  when completed, would produce additional planning guidance and  materials for these entities. However, the Plan is unclear as to how the  existing guidance relates to broad federal and specific departmental and  agency plans as well as how the additional guidance would be integrated  and how any gaps or conflicts that exist would be identified and  addressed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although it is likely that an influenza pandemic will occur in the future,  there is a high level of uncertainty about when a pandemic might occur  and its level of severity. The administration has taken an active approach  to this potential disaster by establishing an information clearinghouse for  pandemic information; developing numerous planning guidelines for  governments, businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals;  issuing the Strategy and Plan; completing many action items contained in  the Plan; and continuing efforts to complete the remaining action items.", "A pandemic poses some unique challenges. Other disasters, such as  hurricanes, earthquakes, or terrorist attacks, generally occur within a  short period and the immediate effects are experienced in specific  locations. By contrast, a pandemic would likely occur in multiple waves,  each lasting weeks or months and affecting communities across the  nation. Initial actions may help limit the spread of an influenza virus,  reflecting the importance of a swift and effective response. Therefore, the  effective exercise of shared leadership roles and responsibilities could  have substantial consequences, both in the short and long term. However,  these roles and responsibilities continue to evolve, leaving uncertainty  about how the federal government would lead preparations for and  response to a pandemic. Since the release of the Plan in May 2006, no  national pandemic exercises of federal leadership roles and  responsibilities have been conducted. Without rigorous testing, training,  and exercising, the administration lacks information to determine whether  current and evolving leadership roles and responsibilities are clear and  clearly understood or if more changes are needed to ensure clarity.", "The Strategy and Plan are important because they broadly describe the  federal government\u2019s approach and planned actions to prepare for and  respond to a pandemic, as well as expectations for states and  communities, the private sector, and global partners. Although they  contain a number of important characteristics, the documents lack several  key elements. As a result, their usefulness as a management tool for  ensuring accountability and achieving results is limited. For example,  because the Strategy and Plan do not address the resources and  investments needed to implement the actions called for, it is unclear what  resources are needed to build capacity and whether they would be  available. Further, because they did not include stakeholders that are  expected to be the primary responders to a pandemic in the development  of the Strategy and Plan, these documents may not fully reflect a national  perspective on this critical national issue, and stakeholders and the public  may not have a full understanding of their critical roles. In addition, the  linkages among pandemic planning efforts and with all-hazards plans and  initiatives need to be clear so that the numerous parties involved can  operate in an integrated manner. Finally, because many of the  performance measures do not provide information about the impacts of  proposed actions, it will be difficult to assess the extent to which we are  better prepared or to identify areas needing additional attention.  Opportunities exist to improve the usefulness of the Plan because it is  viewed as an evolving document and is intended to be updated on a  regular basis to reflect ongoing policy decisions, as well as improvements  in domestic preparedness. Currently, however, time frames or  mechanisms for updating the Plan are undefined.", "While the HSC publicly reported on the status of approximately 100 action  items that were to have been completed by November 2006, the Plan lacks  a prescribed process for monitoring and reporting on the progress of the  action items or what has been accomplished as a result. Therefore, it is  unclear when the next report will be issued or how much information will  be released. In addition, some of the information reported was incorrect.  This lack of transparency makes it difficult to inform a national dialogue  on the progress made to date or what further steps are needed. It also  inhibits congressional oversight of strategies, funding priorities, and  critical efforts to enhance the nation\u2019s level of preparedness.", "DHS officials believe that their efforts to develop a Federal Concept Plan  for Pandemic Influenza may help to more fully address some of the  characteristics that we found the Strategy and Plan lack. According to  those officials, the proposed Concept Plan may help, for example, better  integrate the organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination of  interagency partners. They recognized, however, that the Concept Plan  would not fully address all of the gaps we have identified. For example,  they told us that the Concept Plan may not address actual or estimated  costs or investments of the resources that will be required. Overall, they  agreed that more needs to be done, especially in view of the long time  requirements and challenging issues presented by a potential pandemic  influenza."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance preparedness efforts for a possible pandemic, we are making  the following two recommendations:  We recommend that the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Health and  Human Services work together to develop and conduct rigorous testing,  training, and exercises for pandemic influenza to ensure that federal  leadership roles are clearly defined and understood and that leaders are  able to effectively execute shared responsibilities to address emerging  challenges. Once the leadership roles have been clarified through testing,  training, and exercising, the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Health  and Human Services should ensure that these roles are clearly understood  by state, local, and tribal governments; the private and nonprofit sectors;  and the international community.", "We also recommend that the Homeland Security Council establish a  specific process and time frame for updating the Implementation Plan for  the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza. The process for updating  the Plan should involve key nonfederal stakeholders and incorporate  lessons learned from exercises and other sources. The Plan should also be  improved by including the following information in the next update:  the cost, sources, and types of resources and investments needed to  complete the action items and where they should be targeted;    a process and schedule for monitoring and publicly reporting on progress  made on completing the actions;    clearer linkages with other strategies and plans; and    clearer descriptions of relationships or priorities among action items and  greater use of outcome-focused performance measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS, HHS, and the HSC for review  and comment.

For example, DHS stated that it is  working closely with HHS and other interagency partners to develop and  implement a series of coordinated interagency pandemic exercises and  will include all levels of government as well as the international  community and the private and nonprofit sectors. Additionally, DHS stated  that its Incident Management Planning Team intends to use our list of  desirable characteristics of an effective national strategy as one of the  review metrics for all future plans.

We also studied the findings in reports issued by  Congress, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of the Inspector  General, the Homeland Security Council (HSC), and the Congressional  Research Service.
