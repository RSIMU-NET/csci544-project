These activities, including required conciliation attempts, are directed by HUD's standards, which are based on law, regulation, and best practices. GAO's 2004 report examining trends in case outcomes raised questions about the quality and consistency of the intake (the receipt of initial inquiries) and investigation processes. This follow-up report assesses the thoroughness of fair housing intake and investigation (including conciliation) processes, and complainant satisfaction with the process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Evidence from several sources raises questions about the timeliness and thoroughness of the intake process. Thirty percent of complainants GAO surveyed noted that it was either somewhat or very difficult to reach a live person the first time they contacted a fair housing agency. GAO experienced similar difficulty in test calls it made to each of the 10 FHEO and 36 state FHAP agency intake centers. For example, 5 locations did not respond to the test calls. Further, FHEO and FHAP agencies do not consistently record in their automated information system contacts they receive that they consider potential fair housing inquiries and timeliness data are unreliable, limiting the system's effectiveness as a management control. GAO's review of a national random sample of 197 investigative case files for investigations completed within the last 6 months of 2004 found varying levels of documentation that FHEO and FHAP investigators met investigative standards and followed recommended procedures. Further, though the Fair Housing Act requires that agencies always attempt conciliation to the extent feasible, only about a third of the files showed evidence of such attempts. FHEO officials stated that the required investigation and conciliation actions may have been taken but not documented as required in case files. According to GAO's survey of a national random sample of 575 complainants whose complaint investigations were recently completed, about half were either somewhat or very dissatisfied with the outcome of the fair housing complaint process, and almost 40 percent would be unlikely to file a complaint in the future. Although GAO and survey respondents found that FHEO and FHAP agency staff were generally courteous and helpful, important lapses remain in the complaint process that may affect not only how complainants feel about the process but also how thoroughly and promptly their cases are handled."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and  the 100 state and local agencies it has certified through its Fair Housing  Assistance Program (FHAP agencies) handled over 9,000 complaints of  housing discrimination under the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil  Rights Act of 1968, as amended). The act generally prohibits  discrimination against minorities, persons with handicaps, and other  protected groups in the sale and rental of residential dwellings. The act as  amended provides HUD with enforcement powers and establishes a  100-day benchmark for completing investigations of complaints. HUD\u2019s  Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) administers the  program and handles complaints of housing discrimination. FHAP agencies  also handle complaints that allege violations of substantially similar state  and local laws.", "To meet the Fair Housing Act\u2019s (Act) requirements, FHEO has developed a  process for receiving, investigating, and resolving housing discrimination  complaints. This process has three stages:  intake, during which FHEO offices and FHAP agencies receive inquiries  from individuals (complainants), determine whether the inquiries  involve a potential violation of the Fair Housing Act (or equivalent state  law), and file fair housing complaints for those that do;   investigation, during which FHEO or FHAP agency investigators collect  evidence to determine whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a  discriminatory housing practice occurred or is about to occur and  simultaneously work with parties to conciliate, or reach a mutually  acceptable solution; and  adjudication, during which an administrative law judge, another  administrative entity, or a federal or state court actually determines  whether a violation of the Act has occurred.", "The Act requires that efforts be made to conciliate complaints\u2014that is, to  reach a resolution acceptable to all parties\u2014throughout the complaint  process, beginning with the intake stage. FHEO and FHAP agencies use an  automated case tracking system, the Title Eight Automated Paperless  Office Tracking System (TEAPOTS) to record information about  complaints and key steps in the investigative process.", "HUD reported in 2002, that the incidence of consistent adverse treatment  against minority home seekers had declined over the last decade.  Nonetheless, a series of reports using paired testing to measure the level of  discrimination in the U. S. housing market found that about 20 percent of  the time a member of a protected group will experience discrimination  when attempting to rent an apartment.", "This report, which focuses on intake, investigation, and conciliation (the  complaint process), is the second in a series on HUD\u2019s handling of housing  discrimination complaints. GAO\u2019s earlier report on fair housing found,  among other things, that as of September 2003 more than a third (39  percent) of open housing discrimination investigations had passed the  100-day benchmark. GAO noted at the time that FHEO and the FHAP  agencies were trying to speed their efforts to resolve these cases. Further,  GAO reported that FHEO hub directors cited tension between the need to  meet the 100-day benchmark and the need to conduct a thorough  investigation, stating that at times one goal cannot be achieved without  some cost to the other. The report also found that increasingly the most  common outcome of housing discrimination investigations was a finding of  \u201cno reasonable cause\u201d to indicate discrimination occurred. In 2004, almost  half of all investigations closed had a finding of no-cause and less than 7  percent had a finding of reasonable cause. About one third were  conciliated.", "This report addresses the thoroughness of the process for resolving  housing discrimination complaints\u2014that is, the extent to which FHEO and  FHAP agencies meet HUD standards, policies, and best practices in a  timely manner. GAO reviewed  the thoroughness and timeliness of FHEO and FHAP agencies\u2019 efforts  during the intake process;  the extent to which FHEO and FHAP agencies ensure the thoroughness  of investigations, regardless of the outcome;  the extent to which FHEO and FHAP agencies attempt to conciliate fair   complainants\u2019 satisfaction with the thoroughness, fairness, and  outcomes of the fair housing process.", "To assess the thoroughness of the intake process, we asked FHEO offices  and FHAP agencies around the country to keep logs of inquiries they  received during a 4-week period and measured (1) the extent to which  these inquiries were in FHEO\u2019s information system and resulted in fair  housing complaints and (2) the timeliness of the responses. The centers  that participated in the log exercise represented 78 percent of  investigations in 2004. We also made \u201ctest\u201d telephone calls to 46 selected  intake centers (one FHEO office in each of HUD\u2019s 10 regions and all 36  statewide FHAP agencies) during which GAO analysts posing as  complainants contacted intake staff to file a mock complaint. We used  these calls to measure the time it took to ultimately reach a staff person or  to receive a return call. We also determined the extent to which, during the  initial contact, intake staff gathered necessary information for deciding  whether to undertake a full investigation, including whether Title VIII  appeared to cover the alleged incident. Because of the limitations of this  sample, the results are not generalizable to all potential complainants of  housing discrimination. To assess the thoroughness of investigations and  efforts to conciliate complaints, we reviewed the documentation in 197  randomly selected case files of housing discrimination cases from around  the country that were completed during the second half of calendar year  2004 with outcomes of no-cause or that were closed administratively or  conciliated. We used a structured data collection instrument to record  whether the files contained specific evidence of investigation steps and  their timing. We sampled a sufficient number of case files to permit  national estimates\u2014that is, to permit statistical generalization to all cases  closed with these outcomes during the second half of 2004. Using the same  data collection instrument, we also reviewed 12 of the 15 FHEO cases with  reasonable cause outcomes that completed the adjudication process during  this period. In addition, for each case we compared selected file contents  with TEAPOTS records used to track the case. We did not assess whether  investigations reached an appropriate decision regarding any specific fair  housing inquiry or investigation. To measure complainants\u2019 satisfaction  with the complaint process, we conducted a nationwide telephone survey  of a random sample of 575 complainants in housing discrimination cases  that were investigated and closed between July 2004 and December 2004.  The survey had an overall 38 percent response rate. Appendix I contains a  detailed description of our methodology. In addition, our detailed survey  results can be found on GAO\u2019s Web site at www.gao.gov. We conducted our  work from September 2004 to October 2005 in Atlanta; Chicago; San  Francisco and Oakland; Kansas City, Kansas; Baltimore; Columbia, South  Carolina; and Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Fair Housing Act is the most comprehensive of the federal statutes that  prohibit discrimination in the rental and sale of housing.

It applies  to a number of what are termed \u201cissues,\u201d including discrimination in the  sale, rental, advertising, and financing of housing; in the provision of  brokerage services; and in other activities related to residential real estate  transactions. Generally, the Act covers all dwellings\u2014that is, buildings  designed to be used wholly or in part as residences and land where a  dwelling will be located. When first enacted in 1968, the Fair Housing   Act\u2019s administrative enforcement process was limited principally to  conciliation. In 1988, Congress strengthened HUD\u2019s authority and  established a comprehensive administrative process to enforce the law, but  conciliation remained a primary feature.", "The Act gives HUD, private persons, and the U.S. Attorney General tools  and remedies to enforce the antidiscrimination provisions. Using HUD\u2019s  administrative process, individuals who believe they have experienced  discrimination in a housing-related situation can file a complaint that HUD  may then investigate and resolve. Individuals may also elect to file suit in  civil court rather than using the administrative procedure set out in the act.

FHAP agencies must be in states or  localities whose laws provide rights and remedies that are substantially  similar to those in the Act\u2014for example, local laws must provide for the  same 100-day benchmark for investigations that is stipulated in the Act.  FHEO offices refer complaints alleging violations of state and local fair  housing laws to FHAP agencies\u2014for example, a certified state office of  civil rights. Currently, there are 100 of these agencies around the country.", "FHEO staff has responsibility for the intake, investigation, and resolution  of some of these complaints.

If an aggrieved  party contacts a FHEO office regarding discrimination that allegedly  occurred in a state or locality that has a FHEO-certified \u201csubstantially  equivalent\u201d state or local agency (that is, a FHAP agency), FHEO will  complete the intake process and refer the complaint to that agency for  enforcement.", "In 2004, FHEO and the FHAP agencies received approximately 9,500 filed  complaints (see fig. 2). For this same period, only 5 percent of the closed  case files resulted in reasonable cause outcomes.

An FHEO official noted that the  staff shortage affected not only enforcement of the Act, but also FHEO\u2019s  other responsibilities, forcing managers to assume heavier caseloads and  professional staff to perform administrative duties rather than  concentrating on the complaint process. The total number of full-time  equivalents (FTE) in FHEO has fluctuated over the last 10 years, falling  from a high of 750 in fiscal year 1994 to a low of 579 in fiscal year 2000.

Figure 3 describes the complaint process for  HUD-investigated complaints. FHAP agencies would follow a similar  process. In the intake stage, FHEO hubs and FHAP agencies receive  inquiries by telephone, fax, mail, in person, or over the Internet. Intake staff  record inquiries in TEAPOTS, interview complainants, and may do other  research\u2014for example, searches of public records\u2014to see if enough  information exists to support filing a formal complaint. This process is  known as \u201cperfecting\u201d a complaint. In order to be perfected, a complaint  must  contain the required four elements of a Title VIII complaint: the names  and addresses of the person alleging the discriminatory practice and the  respondent, a description and the address of the dwelling involved, and  a statement of the facts leading to the allegation; and  satisfy the Act\u2019s jurisdictional requirements that the complainant has  standing to file the complaint; that the respondent, dwelling, subject  matter of discrimination (e.g., refusal to rent or sell) and the basis (e.g.,  race, color, or familial status) for the alleged discrimination are covered  by the Act; and that the complaint has been filed within a year of the last  occurrence of the alleged discriminatory practice.", "Hub directors decide which complaints meet these criteria and become  perfected complaints. Complaints that do not meet the criteria are  dismissed. Intake staff record information about perfected complaints in  TEAPOTS, have complainants sign the complaints, send letters notifying  complainants and respondents about the complaint and the process that  will be used to address it, and send the complaint file to an investigator.  FHEO\u2019s Title VIII Intake, Investigation, and Conciliation Handbook  (Handbook) sets a 20-day benchmark for completing the intake stage for  these cases, but a 5-day benchmark for cases that it first takes in and then  refers to FHAP agencies.", "Complaints that are perfected proceed to an investigation. During this  stage, FHEO and FHAP agencies gather evidence to determine whether a  violation of the Act or a state or local housing law has occurred or is about  to occur. The Handbook provides guidance for investigators but notes that  investigations may vary. Agency guidance directs that directors of FHEO\u2019s  hub offices review the results of completed investigations to determine  whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing  practice has taken place or could take place. With the concurrence of the  relevant HUD regional counsel, the hub director issues a determination and  directs the regional counsel to issue a charge, or short written statement of  facts, that led to the decision. In a March 6, 2003 memorandum, HUD\u2019s  Office of General Counsel (OGC) in headquarters requested that regional  counsels send OGC\u2019s Office of Fair Housing the final draft of any charge  that they propose to file and that they not file charges until they have  received a response from OGC\u2019s Office of Fair Housing.

Cases are closed administratively for several  reasons\u2014for instance, when a complainant withdraws from the case or  cannot be located. The Act requires HUD to make conciliation efforts  throughout the complaint process, beginning when the complaint is filed  and continuing until the charge is filed or the case dismissed. The  Handbook and federal regulations allow investigators to make conciliation  efforts, but the regulations also state that generally officers, employees,  and agents not associated with the case will attempt conciliation.  Conciliation agreements are intended to protect the public interest through  provisions such as requiring respondents to file periodic reports with HUD.

Our test calls also showed that FHEO and FHAP  agency staff sometimes did not seek information needed to determine  whether a potential violation of the Act had taken place and to file a formal  complaint, or gather limited information that might help the agency  recontact the complainant or assess the urgency of the situation. Among  the logged contacts that the agencies determined were potential violations  of the Act and were recorded in TEAPOTS, half resulted in formal  complaints. However, only 57 percent of these completed the process  within the 20-day benchmark.

Depending on the quality of intake, potential complainants may or may not  feel comfortable continuing the process, and those who do not may give up  on pursuing their complaints. Thus, the agency\u2019s initial response to  complainants plays an important role in the fair housing complaint process.  However, our test calls revealed some potentially serious lapses in  agencies\u2019 responses to complainants\u2019 inquiries.", "First, we found that agencies did not always respond promptly to initial  attempts to contact them to file a complaint and that because of  requirements that some agencies imposed, trying to file a complaint could  be a challenging process. In 5 of the 46 calls, the agency did not return the  test call, even after 3 attempts. In another 2 cases, the intake organization  required that the caller provide intake information via the Internet or in  person. As shown in figure 4, in 20 of the remaining 39 test cases, the caller  spoke with a live person on initial contact. Of the 9 calls requiring a  callback, 6 were not returned within 1 business day, and 3 were not  returned for 3 or more days. Our survey of complainants suggests that they  experienced similar difficulties to ours in contacting intake staff. An  estimated 30 percent noted that it was either somewhat or very difficult to  reach a live person the first time they contacted a fair housing agency, and  34 percent said they had difficulty contacting staff after the initial contact.  These percentages were relatively constant regardless of whether FHEO or  a FHAP agency handled the case or its outcome, with one exception.  Complainants whose cases were conciliated reported that they had less  difficulty contacting staff than complainants whose cases were closed with  other outcomes.", "We also found that intake staff did not seem to display a sense of urgency in  dealing with complaints. Over half of the agencies (23 of 39) relied  primarily on a form that the complainant must fill out (HUD-903 or state  equivalent) to collect the information needed to begin an investigation, and  in the initial phone call requested little more than the complainant\u2019s name  and mailing address. Using such a form to gather information for a  potential complaint could take a week or more\u2014during which the caller  could lose a housing opportunity. Two other agencies would not mail a  complaint form, insisting that the caller come in to the office to file a  complaint. However, information from contact logs that the FHAP agencies  and FHEO offices maintained for 4 weeks, at our request, showed that the  most prevalent mode of contact is telephone, and that walk-in and Internet  contacts represented less than 5 percent. Given this situation, requiring  potential complainants to appear in person added an additional challenge  that could potentially make it difficult for a complainant to continue with  the process. Further, a test caller to one of these agencies, stressing the  urgency of her situation, was informed that filing a complaint was a \u201cslow  process\u201d and that her complaint would not be acted on for some time,  whether intake was done over the phone or via the organization\u2019s form.  FHEO\u2019s annual performance goals do not include goals for the time it takes  to return initial contacts from complainants. However, FHEO has  established a 20-day benchmark for completing the intake process, starting  with the date that the initial inquiry is recorded in TEAPOTS. In  commenting on a draft of this report, HUD\u2019s General Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity stated that the agency  tracks the time it takes to file a complaint from the point of initial contact,  and that a new initiative, the FHEO-OGC Case Processing Research  Project, is expected to assist with decision making during the intake  process since it uses a triage system to determine case complexity.", "Despite any inconveniences, when our test callers did reach the agencies,  the staff treated them well. In none of our test cases did hold time exceed 3  minutes, and staff at several agencies spoke extensively with test callers,  answering questions and providing guidance and information on the  process. Our survey of former complainants that completed the  investigation process showed similar findings. While complainants had  difficulty reaching an agency, once they did, more than half said that  agency staff did either a good or an excellent job of explaining the process  and timing of each step."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHEO and FHAP Agencies Collected Limited Information during Initial Intake Contacts", "paragraphs": ["When collecting intake information during our test calls, FHEO and FHAP  agency staff focused primarily on collecting the complainant\u2019s name,  address, and protected class, as well as a description of the discriminatory  act. Staff sometimes did not ask for other information that would be helpful  in recontacting the complainant or assessing the urgency of the situation.  To systematically assess the thoroughness of the intake test calls, we  identified criteria from the Act (the minimum elements of information  needed to proceed with the complaint), HUD\u2019s Title VIII Handbook, and  training materials from the National Fair Housing Training Academy.  Additionally, we obtained information on best practices from a fair housing  advocacy group as well as HUD\u2019s training materials and interviews with  agency officials.

However, HUD policy recommends that  staff obtain as much information as possible during the initial intake  interview. We also believe that level 1 items should, with little exception, be  collected as part of the initial contact in order to have information  necessary to recontact the complainant and determine the urgency of the  situation.", "How complinnt knew  of thi property/nit Doe client wnt nit/property?", "For rentnit, did complinnt  submit ppliction?", "Wht otcome doe the  complinnt hope to ee  result from the complint?", "Did complinnt sugget to  repondent thn invetigtion  might commence?", "Did complinnt diuss thi  complint with ny other  orgniztion?", "Disability of complinnt (if ny)", "How did complinnt feel  abt the dicrimintory ct?", "Was complinnt informed  abt other check/inqrie?", "Was complinnt informed  tht credit check wold e done?", "Wht was complinnt  wering when ct occrred?", "Was complinnt informed  tht previousndlord  wold e contcted?", "On average, intake staff collected approximately 44 percent of level 1  information, which is identified by HUD policy as critical to collect during  intake. For example, 21 agencies did not ask for the respondent\u2019s first and  last name, and 15 did not ask for the respondent\u2019s organization. As  indicated in figure 5, in only 8 agency test cases did intake staff ask the  complainant for the name of an alternate contact person and in only 7  agency test cases did the intake staff request a work number\u2014an important  piece of information because, according to FHEO officials, many  complainants are in the process of moving and are difficult to recontact.  Also, intake staff about half of the time asked for the respondent\u2019s  telephone number. Further, the agencies collected little information  beyond level 1. On average, they gathered 8 percent of level 2, 11 percent of  level 3, and 9 percent of level 4 information. Some level 4 (best practice)  information that was most often collected during our case study includes  the respondent\u2019s gender (13 test calls), respondent\u2019s race (9 test calls), and  what the complainant hoped to see as a result of filing a complaint (8 test  calls). (See fig. 5.)", "Although HUD policy recommends that intake staff obtain as much  information as possible regarding the aggrieved person\u2019s allegations during  the initial intake interview, the amount of information collected on initial  contact varied significantly by agency. One location collected nothing  beyond the complainant\u2019s name and mailing address, while another  collected up to 80 percent of the level 1 data. However, in none of the test  calls did intake staff collect 100 percent of the level 1 information. While  most agencies appeared to collect the remainder of the critical information  through their intake forms (either the HUD-903 form or state equivalent),  this practice prevents the agency from taking any further action on the  complaint until a signed form is received. According to HUD officials, the  revised Title VIII Handbook contains standards for information that HUD  will collect during initial contact with a complainant. However, these and  other standards may not apply to FHAP agencies since their certification by  HUD does not ensure that they follow identical procedures.", "The time it takes to receive the form can delay the enforcement process,  potentially resulting not only in the loss of a housing opportunity but also in  complainants becoming frustrated with the process and deciding not to  pursue their complaint. In particular, some complainants may need urgent  attention, such as when they are about to become homeless because they  are being evicted from their rental home or apartment, or are losing the  home they own in a foreclosure. HUD has authority under the Act in such  urgent circumstances to take prompt judicial action by authorizing the  Attorney General to initiate a civil action seeking appropriate temporary or  preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint. HUD\u2019s Title  VIII Handbook establishes that intake staff has a critical role in identifying  when a complaint may involve a situation warranting prompt judicial  action. Time is critical, and the efforts of the intake staff are helpful in  gathering sufficient information for determining when prompt judicial  action may be necessary. This is also important for intake by the FHAP  agencies, since they must have substantially equivalent authority to seek  prompt judicial action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Intake Log Data Indicate That TEAPOTS Is of Limited Effectiveness as Management Control of Intake Process", "paragraphs": ["Our prior report noted that while FHEO offices kept records of potentially  Title VIII-related contacts, it had not required FHAP agencies to do so. (For  that reason, when preparing our prior report, we were unable to determine  the extent to which FHAP agencies met the goal of perfecting complaints  within 20 days of initial contacts.) FHAP agencies typically entered  information only for perfected complaints. Accordingly, we recommended  that HUD ensure that the automated case-tracking system (TEAPOTS)  include complete, reliable data on key dates in the intake stage for FHAP  agencies. The latest version of HUD\u2019s Title VIII Handbook (issued in May  2005) requires FHEO intake staff to record in TEAPOTS each inquiry that is  potentially Title VIII-related, regardless of whether it results in a perfected  complaint.", "Our comparison of information from the logs\u2014that intake centers kept, at  our request, during February and March 2005\u2014with TEAPOTS data  highlights the need for reliable information regarding potentially Title  VIII-related contacts and the dates of their occurrence. First, the analysis  showed that a substantial number of potentially Title VIII-related contacts  (68 percent) were not entered in TEAPOTS, and of those that were, about  half resulted in perfected complaints. While there are valid reasons for this  \u201cattrition,\u201d our results suggest that staff are not recording in TEAPOTS a  substantial number of potentially Title VIII-related contacts (inquiries in  which the caller alleges housing discrimination and intake staff believe the  call represents a potential Title VIII violation). Further, we found that, for  those contacts that were entered into TEAPOTS, the initial contact dates  shown in the logs were sometimes earlier than the corresponding date of  first contact shown in TEAPOTS. Thus, HUD\u2019s use of TEAPOTS data is  likely overstating its performance in meeting its 20-day intake timeliness  benchmark. Without assurance that TEAPOTS is being used consistently,  HUD is unable to account for potentially Title VIII-related contacts that do  not appear in the system or accurately measure timeliness of those that are  recorded in the TEAPOTS system, thus limiting TEAPOTS\u2019 utility as a  management control."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Logged Contacts Did Not Appear in TEAPOTS", "paragraphs": ["To determine the volume of intake-related contacts received by fair  housing agencies and the proportion of these contacts that resulted in  perfected complaints, we had 47 sites record all incoming  contacts\u2014telephone calls, walk-ins, and Internet queries\u2014that were  related to fair housing over a 4-week period (February 22 through March  21, 2005). The 32 state FHAP agencies, 5 local FHAP agencies, and 10  FHEO offices that participated in the log exercise represented 78 percent  of the volume of investigations in 2004. Specifically, we asked the sites to  record the date, method, and purpose of each contact; the name of the  person making the contact; whether the contact alleged having  experienced housing discrimination; and whether the intake staff agreed  that the matter pertained to a potentially Title VIII-related complaint.", "During our tracking period, the sites recorded a total of 9,655 contacts. As  shown in figure 6, the majority (80 percent) of contacts for which we had  complete data was by telephone, and 42 percent were new potential  complaints. Furthermore, a sizable number of initial contacts  (approximately 24 percent) did not pertain to fair housing (confirming, as  our prior report noted, that intake analysts receive numerous contacts that  are not related to fair housing.) The time necessary for handling the calls  can place an additional burden on FHEO\u2019s limited resources.", "Our review of the log also showed that a sizable number of new potential  complaints that intake staff believed could involve a Title VIII violation did  not result in perfected complaints in TEAPOTS (see fig. 7):  Agency staff coded 2,000 contacts as coming from a named individual  whose allegations they believed both involved a new potential  complaint and pertained to a potentially Title VIII-related violation.", "Of these 2,000 individuals, we were able to match 631 to a new inquiry  shown in TEAPOTS.", "Of the 631 inquiries, 306 are shown in TEAPOTS as perfected  complaints.", "We sorted these data into two groups: contacts recorded by FHEO offices  and contacts recorded by FHAP agencies. We found that the attrition rates  differed somewhat between these groups. At FHEO sites, intake staff  identified 1,347 unique individuals as having potentially valid new Title VIII  complaints. Of these, 506, or 38 percent, were shown as unique inquiries in  TEAPOTS, and 216 of those\u201416 percent of the original 1,347\u2014resulted in  perfected complaints shown in the automated system at the time of our  analysis. At the same time, FHAP sites identified 620 unique individuals  with potential new Title VIII violations, of which 92, or 15 percent, were  shown as unique inquiries in TEAPOTS and 66, or 11 percent, became  perfected complaints.", "Attrition can occur for a number of reasons. For example, because some  state laws contain additional protected classes, some calls that FHEO  offices receive may be for matters that are covered under a FHAP agency\u2019s  jurisdiction. Also, intake staff may believe that a contact pertains to a valid  Title VIII violation at the outset but may later find out that the respondent is  exempt from Title VIII or that the 1-year statute of limitations has expired.  Furthermore, the intake process is sometimes terminated because a  complainant either does not cooperate with agency staff or resolves the  issue with the respondent and voluntarily discontinues the complaint  process. Finally, it is possible that, during our process of matching names  in the log to TEAPOTS records, a small number of matches were not made,  either due to misspellings of names or timings of entry into the system.  Information in TEAPOTS provides some insight as to the reasons why  inquiries were not perfected during this time period. In 20 percent of all  inquiries for which TEAPOTS had data, the complainant failed to respond;  in 13 percent of the cases, the intake staff found no valid basis for  complaint; and in 8 percent of the cases, the intake staff found no valid  issue. However, TEAPOTS shows that 43 percent of the inquiries that were  not perfected were coded as \u201cOther Disposition,\u201d which means that no  further information is available to indicate why the contact did not result in  a perfected complaint.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, HUD\u2019s General Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity stated that while HUD  considered requiring FHAP agencies to record initial inquiry dates for all  potential complaints, it has not done so because of the way HUD funds  FHAP agencies. Specifically, HUD reimburses the FHAP agencies for each  (actual) complaint that they investigate, and does not reimburse them for  their consideration of inquiries that do not result in complaints. However,  this continues to leave HUD without data or knowledge of a significant  number of potential Title VIII-related inquiries or a means of assessing the  FHAP agencies\u2019 response to such inquiries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Logged Contact Dates Differed from TEAPOTS\u2019 \u2018Date of First Inquiry\u2019", "paragraphs": ["Our prior report questioned the reliability of initial inquiry dates shown in  TEAPOTS.

However, for internal measurement and benchmarking purposes,  HUD begins counting the 20 days on the day the inquiry is entered into  TEAPOTS. Because HUD does not track the actual initial contact dates, it  can not use them to begin measuring the 20-day period. Our analysis of the  contacts recorded in the logs leading to the 306 perfected complaints noted  above indicates that 57 percent of the complaints were perfected within 20  days of initial contact, based on the earliest contact date in the log.  However, using the inquiry date in TEAPOTS as the starting point for the  20-day benchmark, as HUD does, indicates that 79 percent of the  complaints were perfected within 20 days. In fact, the median number of  days to perfect complaints was 11 using TEAPOTS inquiries, but 18 using  the data recorded in our log.

As a practical matter, this  means a FIR is required for investigations that conclude with a  determination of reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred, and  for investigations closed with a determination of no reasonable cause (i.e.,  there is no reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred).  Investigators must also meet a 100-day deadline for completing an  investigation unless it is impracticable to do so.

The high incidence of documentation  addressing jurisdiction may be explained by the fact that jurisdiction  should be verified throughout the complaint process. Consequently, there  is more than one opportunity to identify deficiencies.  FHEO officials at  one location said that in addition to an intake analyst, the intake and  enforcement or compliance branch chiefs also reviewed complaints before  investigations began. However, they also said that in some instances,  complaints for which jurisdiction had not been established had been  inadvertently accepted and later found to lack a required jurisdictional  element. For example, one case we reviewed showed that as the  investigation proceeded, investigators determined that the respondent was  exempt as a result of not owning more than one rental property. The Act  provides that certain properties and property owners are exempt, and  owners who do not have an interest in more than three single-family homes  or condominium units meet the guidelines for exemption.", "Although most files contained evidence that jurisdictional elements had  been addressed, we did not always find evidence that complainants and  respondents received required notifications. As noted above, the Act  requires the fair housing agency handling the complaint to send  complainants an initial notice acknowledging the filing of the complaint.  Further, HUD\u2019s complaint notification letter advises complainants of  certain guidelines of the complaint process. Respondents must be served  by certified mail or personal service with an initial notice of the original  complaint no later than 10 days after the complaint is filed or when the  respondent is identified. Respondents must also be notified whenever a  complaint is amended (complaints may be amended at any time during an  investigation to add or remove parties, and complainants must sign the new  complaints). Complainants and respondents should also be notified when  an investigation is closed. We therefore looked for evidence indicating that  these requirements were followed in all cases.", "HUD regulations require that complainants be notified by certified mail or  personal service, but FHEO officials said that some FHAP agency  procedures do not require this. While we found initial notification letters  addressed to complainants in 97 percent of the files and letters to  respondents in 91 percent for closure types other than reasonable cause,  we frequently did not find evidence that the letters had been received (see  fig. 9). The lack of evidence in case files that complainants and respondents  had received initial notifications does not necessarily mean that they did  not in fact receive the notices.  Some FHEO officials told us that certified  mail receipts were sometimes maintained in separate files. We looked not  only for evidence such as return receipts from certified mail or certificates  of personal service, but also for correspondence indicating receipt or  knowledge of the complaint notification. Fifty-nine percent of these cases  contained evidence that complainants had received initial notifications,  and 67 percent contained evidence that respondents had received initial  notifications. Our survey of complainants that completed the investigation  process also indicates that some may not have received initial notifications.  Specifically, 86 percent said they received a letter informing them whether  an investigation would be conducted. We did not observe a significant  difference in documentation between organizations.

Similarly, FHAP agency-investigated cases did not have  evidence of closure notices addressed to complainants 14 percent of the  time, compared with 2 percent for FHEO-investigated cases. Our survey  of complainants revealed that about 9 percent said they did not receive  notification of the case being closed.

However, the guidance also states that an on-site visit is the  most efficient way to conduct an investigation in most situations involving  fair housing complaints.

For non-cause cases that included an on-site visit, we found that  investigators toured the property in question, collected physical evidence  such as photographs, and interviewed complainants and respondents (see  fig. 15). We saw no statistically significant difference in use of on-site visits  among the non-cause closure types, but we found substantially more  on-site visits documented for cases where HUD had determined reasonable  cause.

Similarly with regard to the discrimination basis, the  information matched 92 percent and 84 percent for race and national  origin, respectively, but the evidence is less clear for color. For familial  status, the information matched 86 percent of the time. When we  compared the date of the last alleged violation and the HUD filing date in  TEAPOTS with the same dates in the source documents, we found that  these matched 91 percent and 84 percent of the time, respectively.

Further, it stated that when these  questions were asked, the case was often remanded to the agency handling  the case with instructions to undertake additional late-stage conciliation  efforts.

One official said  that separating these tasks enabled simultaneous conciliation and  investigation of a complaint, a practice that speeded up the process.  Another official noted that parties might share information with a  conciliator that they would not share with an investigator and that a  conflict of interest might result if one person tried to do both. The same  official said that although investigators were not allowed to use  information they learned as conciliators during investigations, the  information could still influence the questions conciliators posed\u2014and  thus the information they learned\u2014as investigators. Similarly, at one FHEO  location hub, an OGC official told us that information learned as a result of  conciliation efforts should not be included in investigative findings.

Although information discovered during the conciliation process cannot be  factored into the investigator\u2019s recommendation, if this same information is  discovered outside of the conciliation process, it is permissible for  investigators to use this information in their recommendations.

Additionally, some officials at the offices that delayed the investigation  while attempting conciliation told us that this practice increased the  number of calendar days necessary to investigate a case. However, one  FHEO hub official told us that simultaneous investigation and conciliation  could waste resources, as it might not be necessary to obtain further  evidence in a case that would be conciliated.

We also previously reported that without  comprehensive, reliable data on the dates when individuals make inquiries,  FHEO cannot judge how long complainants must wait before a FHAP  agency undertakes an investigation. For this report, our analysis of logged  contacts indicates that FHAP agencies and FHEO hubs did not enter into  TEAPOTS all contacts alleging Title VIII violations. Moreover, the  discrepancies we observed between the dates of logged initial contacts and  the corresponding dates entered into TEAPOTS as the beginning of the  inquiries indicate that FHEO does not have reliable data for measuring the  extent to which its offices and FHAP agencies meet the benchmark of 20  days for completing the intake process.", "Our review of case files and TEAPOTS data showed a lack of evidence that  investigations are consistently as thorough or expeditious as FHEO  guidance requires or recommends. HUD officials have noted their reliance  on TEAPOTS for assurance that cases are investigated in accordance with  applicable requirements and guidance.

However, our review of case files and  TEAPOTS data showed a lack of evidence that conciliation attempts were  consistently made throughout the process, despite HUD\u2019s requirements  that these attempts be documented. The lack of documentation that  conciliation is offered raises questions about HUD\u2019s ability to assure that  such attempts are made as appropriate throughout the fair housing  process. Further, this lack of documentation, along with complainants\u2019  first-hand experience and our observation during mock complaint calls that  conciliation was not discussed, suggest that FHEO and FHAP agencies are  not consistently offering conciliation, as required by the Act. We  recommended in our previous study that FHEO establish a way to identify  and share information on effective practices among its regional fair  housing offices and FHAP agencies. We observed during our previous study  and this study that some FHAP agencies have used independent mediators  and had staff not involved in a particular case attempt conciliation.  Officials who use these techniques point to their benefits in speeding up the  resolution of complaints, while offering the parties a satisfactory outcome.  In our last report, we concluded that FHEO\u2019s human capital challenges  serve to exacerbate the challenge of improving enforcement practices.  However, the identification and use of best practices may help FHEO, as  well as FHAP agencies, more effectively utilize their limited resources.", "Our work does not demonstrate that HUD failed to reach appropriate  decisions regarding any specific fair housing inquiry or investigation.

Individuals who believe  they have experienced discrimination and make the effort to contact a fair  housing agency, but are unable to easily reach an intake staff person or to  expeditiously convey needed information, may simply give up and cease  cooperating. Further, our survey of former complainants shows that some  who successfully filed complaints have a sufficiently negative view of the  process that they would be unlikely to file a complaint again\u2014even if they  were satisfied with the outcome of their case.

First, we  asked intake staff to keep a log of the contacts they had with potential  complainants over a 4-week period and to note the proportion of contacts  alleging housing discrimination.", "We designed an Intake Contact Log for staff to use that enabled us to obtain  never-before-collected data consistently across agencies for a set time  period. We asked the 10 FHEO offices, 36 state FHAP agencies, and 5 local  FHAP agencies with the highest volume (based on number of complaints  filed during fiscal year 2004) to maintain the log over the 4-week period  from February 21 through March 21, 2005. All of the FHEO offices, local  FHAP agencies, and all but 4 of the state FHAP agencies agreed to maintain  our contact log. These offices represented 78 percent of the volume of  investigations in 2004. The log required intake staff to document  the date each contact was received;  the method of each contact (such as telephone, mail, e-mail);   whether the contact involved a new potential complaint or a previously  existing complaint, or was a referral from another agency;  whether the callers claimed that they had experienced housing   whether the intake staff or supervisor believed the contact potentially  involved a jurisdictional Title VIII violation; and  the name of the individual making the contact.", "Once we received the data, we reviewed them for consistency and logic.  Where we identified coding that was apparently not consistent with our  instruction, we called the staff that prepared the log for clarification. In  some cases, we needed to recode the log based on these conversations.", "We focused our analysis on entries that the intake staff indicated pertained  to a potentially valid Title VIII issue, that included names, and that they  coded as new potential complaints. Using entries with names allowed us to  eliminate multiple contacts from the same person and report statistics on  people rather than on contacts. Once we identified the unique names that  met these criteria, we matched the names to records in a TEAPOTS extract  to determine how many of the new potential complaints during the 4-week  recording period were perfected. Specifically, we requested an extract of  the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s TEAPOTS database  for the time period coinciding with the contact log reporting period, plus 5  additional weeks to allow sufficient time for perfecting complaints. We did  not evaluate the judgments of the intake staff in determining whether a  contact should have been pursued. Since FHAP agencies tended not to  enter inquiries into TEAPOTS until the complaint was ready to be  perfected, the results of our name matching are reported both in aggregate  and separately for FHEO office and FHAP agencies. We also reported on  the total number of intake-related contacts received during the reporting  period, the proportion of contacts alleging housing discrimination that the  intake staff determined did not constitute a valid Title VIII complaint, and  percentages for each contact method (telephone, e-mail, and walk-in).", "In order to assess the degree to which intake staff obtained sufficient and  appropriate information to determine whether a contact should become a  Title VIII complaint, we designed a telephone \u201ctest call\u201d program of intake  staff at the 10 HUD hubs and 36 state FHAP agencies. GAO analysts posing  as complainants contacted intake staff to file a mock complaint. We  excluded local FHAP agencies from telephone testing because these  agencies tend to have a low volume of investigations, compared with state  FHAP agencies. We placed one test call to each site using the same case  scenario with different identifying information, such as names and  addresses. Testers were trained to consistently volunteer only certain  information such as the \u201cname\u201d and description of what happened, and to  respond in standardized ways to questions asked by intake staff.  The calls  were recorded and later coded against a list of information that might be  sought as part of the intake process. We developed this list of information  based on requirements and recommended practices derived from multiple  sources. Among these were requirements of the Fair Housing Act, guidance  provided by HUD in the form of policy and training manuals, and training  materials from the National Fair Housing Alliance, as well as discussions  with HUD and FHAP agency officials.  We categorized the information into  four levels: information that (1) should always be gathered at intake, (2) is  potentially applicable to all complaints and should be collected, (3) is  relevant to a particular basis or protected class, and (4) is considered by  officials we spoke with and training materials as a best practice.", "We placed one pretest call to each of the 46 sites we planned to contact to  get a sense of how each location conducts intake. We adjusted the design to  account for differences in the intake process to the fullest extent possible.  For example, we allowed for scheduled intake interviews for locations that  only conducted intake calls on a scheduled basis. We found that  approximately 25 percent of the time we could expect to speak with a  person on initial contact who could complete the intake process. In many  cases, an agency staff member would perform an initial screening before  forwarding the call to the intake staff, and in other cases, the call was  forwarded to a voice mailbox.  Based on our findings during the pretest, we  decided to evaluate not only the information collected by intake staff, but  also the number of attempts required to speak with a live person, hold  times, and the length of time that elapsed before staff responded to voice- mail messages by returning calls. We included information that callers  volunteered and obvious items such as gender.

We originally  sampled 205 cases, but we were unable to locate files or matching  TEAPOTS data records for 8 cases. The sample files included 58 cases  closed administratively, 63 cases that were conciliated without a finding of  reasonable cause, and 90 that were closed with a finding of no reasonable  cause. We oversampled administrative closures to ensure that we had a  sufficient number of files to permit estimates for this subpopulation. The  population of complaints and the sample we used are enumerated in tables  1 and 2. Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates (sampling error), our results have confidence intervals of plus or  minus 8 percentage points or smaller, unless otherwise noted, at a 95  percent level of confidence. In other words, this interval would contain the  true value for the actual population for 95 percent of the samples we could  have drawn.", "We also reviewed files for 12 of the 15 complaint investigations FHEO  concluded with a finding of \u201ccause,\u201d and for which the adjudication  process, including any agency monitoring, had been completed during the  last 6 months of 2004. We could not locate files for the remaining cases. All  12 files were identified by the Department of Justice as having met these  criteria. We did not review files for which a FHAP agency found \u201ccause\u201d  and that completed the adjudication because these could not be identified.", "We examined the documentation in the files, as well as the full TEAPOTS  case summary for each case, to determine whether it demonstrated that the  investigator had met certain requirements and best practices for  conducting fair housing investigations. We identified these requirements  and best practices through reviewing the Fair Housing Act, implementing  regulations, FHEO\u2019s Title VIII Handbook and training material, and other  guidance. In addition, we interviewed FHEO officials at both HUD  headquarters and field offices in Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco. We  also interviewed FHAP agency officials in California, Georgia, Maryland,  South Carolina, and Virginia. We met with the National Fair Housing  Alliance and attended training at the John Marshall Law School on Fair  Housing enforcement and at HUD\u2019s National Fair Housing Training  Academy.

We did  not include cases that proceeded to the adjudication process owing to a  finding of reasonable cause to avoid surveying complainants that may still  be involved in the adjudication process. The survey also provided  supplemental evidence for our analysis of the thoroughness of the intake  and investigation stages of the complaint process and the frequency of  conciliation.", "We determined that there was a population of 4,327 fair housing complaints  (contact information was not provided for 6 of the original 4,333 cases) that  had ended in administrative closure, conciliation without determination of  cause, or a determination of no-cause for the 6-month period between July  1, 2004, and December 31, 2004. The complainants of record were mostly  private individuals, but some were fair housing organizations acting on  their own behalf or on that of one or more individuals. From a list obtained  from HUD\u2019s TEAPOTS database, the PA Consulting Group, a survey firm  under contract to GAO, called the complainants of record selected in the  sample. The total sample of 1,675 was parceled out in seven individual  waves over the field period, in an attempt to use the smallest possible  sample to achieve the quota of 575 completed interviews.  The sample was  allocated across six categories\u2014two agency types by three closure types\u2014 to ensure that enough interviews were conducted in each category to allow  statistically valid comparisons between them. (See table 4 for the  distribution of the population, sample, responses, and response rates  across these categories.) With this probability sample, each member of the  population had a nonzero probability of being included, and that  probability could be computed for any member. Each sampled complaint  for which an interview was obtained was subsequently weighted in the  analysis to account statistically for all the members of the population,  including those who were not selected and those who were selected but did  not respond to the survey.", "Beginning in early May 2005, GAO mailed letters notifying those sampled  complainants with valid mailing addresses of the upcoming survey and  encouraging them to participate. Calling to those complainants typically  began several days after the letters were mailed. The advance letters also  included an address correction form. Recipients were asked to revise any  incorrect information and return the form. A toll-free number also was  provided for recipients to ask any questions or to correct information such  as names and phone numbers. Calling began in early May and continued for  7 weeks, ending on June 20, 2005.", "For institutional complaints drawn into our sample, the interviewer helped  the organization\u2019s representative identify the specific complaint by  describing the issue, basis, and respondent name. Multiple interviews could  be conducted with the same institutional informant if more than one  complaint from that organization was randomly drawn. Thirty-three  interviews were completed on institutional complaints. Proxies (typically  family members, guardians, or other representatives) for the named  complainant were interviewed for 19 of the sampled complaints. Not all  sampled complaints met GAO\u2019s eligibility requirements for the survey:  Some complainants indicated that their cases were still open and  experiencing legal activity. GAO could not have any involvement with such  complaints. For the same reason, other complainants who said they had an  ongoing agreement with the other party resolving the complaint were also  not interviewed. Some complaint cases also became ineligible for the  survey due to the death of the complainant, a complainant\u2019s insistence that  a case was not a fair housing discrimination case, and complaints sampled  multiple times (more than four for institutional complainants and one for  individuals\u2014see table 3).", "Complainants with an issue or basis alleging racial discrimination because  the complainant was Hispanic received letters printed in both English and  Spanish. The survey was also administered by Spanish-speaking  interviewers when the complainant indicated a preference for speaking  Spanish.", "When named complainants could not be found using records provided by  HUD, interviewers used a variety of search techniques to try to locate  complainants, including calling alternate contacts named in the complaint  record and using directory assistance and online tracking services. For  example, if an address was available but no working phone number could  be found, interviewers used reverse directories and contacted neighbors by  phone to ask about the whereabouts of the named complainant. Once  during the fieldwork period, 547 noncontactable records were submitted to  Lorton Data\u2019s National Change of Address and Telephone Append services,  resulting in some updated phone numbers and mailing addresses. To  maximize the possibility of reaching complainants, multiple attempts were  made over a period of time on different days of the week and at different  hours. The number of attempts required to reach subjects ranged from 1 to  34, with an average of 12.", "Results from sample questionnaire surveys are subject to several types of  errors: failure of the sample frame to cover the study population,  measurement errors in administering the questionnaire, sampling errors,  nonresponse errors from failing to collect information from part of the  sample, and data processing error. To limit coverage errors, we used the  most recent available data from TEAPOTS to identify eligible  complainants. At the beginning of the interview, we also confirmed that the  complainant of record had lodged an actual fair housing discrimination  complaint and that the complaint had been closed as TEAPOTS indicated.", "To limit measurement errors, we first took steps in the development of the  questionnaire to ensure that our questions gathered the information  intended. GAO asked knowledgeable representatives of fair housing  organizations and other government agencies to review early versions of  the instrument. We also conducted a pilot test of an early version of the  questionnaire with 26 complainants in December 2004 and seven pretests  with complainants in the study population during March 2005. Finally, the  telephone survey contractor completed nine pretests of the final  instrument in late April 2005.

If those who  did not respond might have answered our survey questions differently from  those who did, our estimates would be biased because we would have  missed the answers from a set of people with fundamentally different  views. In fact, response rates varied widely across the three different  closure types, which were associated with key variables in the survey such  as satisfaction with the complaint process and outcome.  We tended to get  relatively more responses from complainants in conciliation cases than  from complainants in no-cause cases, and those whose cases were  conciliated tended to be more satisfied. However, we could address this  potential bias because we controlled the allocation of our sample across  the closure types. We could statistically adjust, or weight, responses by  closure type to bring them into proportion with the population and thus  account for the different nonresponse rate across those types, which  should compensate for the nonresponse bias. Nevertheless, the possibility  of bias in the results still remains. Our weighting adjustment only  compensates for differences in opinion between those with different  closure types and agency responsibility, not other characteristics that may  have been over- or under-represented in our responses and that may be  related to our survey questions.", "To limit the possibility of data processing errors, the survey firm used a  computer-assisted telephone interviewing system that recorded electronic  data directly from the telephone interviewers\u2019 answers, and also checked  for missing data, inconsistencies, and unlikely answer patterns.
