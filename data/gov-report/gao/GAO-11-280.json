CMS helps assure the adequacy of state complaint processes by issuing guidance, monitoring data that state survey agencies enter into CMS's database, and annually assessing performance against specific standards. Concerns have been raised about the timeliness and adequacy of complaint investigations and CMS's oversight. GAO examined (1) complaints received, investigated, and substantiated by state survey agencies; (2) whether those agencies were meeting CMS performance standards and other requirements; and (3) the effectiveness of CMS's oversight. In addition to analyzing CMS data on complaints and performance reviews, GAO examined CMS guidance and conducted interviews with officials from three high- and three low-performing state survey agencies and their CMS regional offices. GAO addressed data reliability concerns by reporting only data we determined to be reliable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS's complaints data showed that state survey agencies received 53,313 complaints about nursing homes in 2009. The number and types of complaints varied among states. For example, 11 states received 15 or fewer complaints per 1,000 nursing home residents while 14 states received more than 45. State survey agencies assess the severity of a complaint and assign a priority level, which dictates if and when an investigation must be initiated. About 10 percent of complaints were prioritized as immediate jeopardy, requiring investigation within 2 working days of receipt, while 45 percent were prioritized as actual harm-high, requiring investigation within 10 working days of prioritization. State survey agencies investigated all but 102 complaints that required an investigation. Among investigated complaints, 19 percent were substantiated and resulted in the citation of at least one federal deficiency. The percentage of immediate jeopardy and actual harm-high complaints that were substantiated with at least one federal deficiency cited was higher if the investigation was initiated on time. In CMS's performance assessment for fiscal year 2009, many state survey agencies had difficulty meeting some of CMS's nursing home complaint standards, most of which also assess performance with regard to incidents--specific care issues that nursing homes are required to report. In particular, 19 state survey agencies had difficulty investigating actual harm-high complaints and incidents within the required time frame. However, most states were able to meet other CMS standards--timely investigation of immediate jeopardy complaints and incidents and appropriate prioritization of complaints and incidents. Although CMS's performance assessment does not review state survey agencies' communication with complainants, CMS does expect the agencies to convey investigation findings according to CMS guidelines. GAO found state survey agencies had varied interpretations of those guidelines, and some provided limited information to complainants. CMS's oversight of state survey agencies' complaint investigation processes, through its performance standards system and complaints database, is hampered by data reliability issues. While CMS's performance standards are consistent with certain key criteria for performance measures identified by GAO and other audit agencies, performance scores are not always reliable, due in part to inadequate sample sizes and inconsistent interpretation of some standards by CMS reviewers. In addition, CMS has not made full use of the information it collects. For example, in part because of data reliability concerns, CMS does not routinely use data from the complaints database to calculate certain measures that could enhance its understanding of agencies' performance. Although CMS requires state survey agencies that fail performance standards to develop corrective action plans, states' plans do not necessarily address the underlying causes of performance issues, such as staffing shortages."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the CMS Administrator take several steps to strengthen oversight of complaint investigations, such as improving the reliability of its complaints database and clarifying guidance for its state performance standards to assure more consistent interpretation. HHS generally agreed with our recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 1.4 million elderly and disabled residents living in nursing homes are  considered a highly vulnerable population. They frequently depend on  others for assistance with basic activities of daily living such as dressing,  eating, or toileting, and some require skilled nursing or rehabilitative care.  The vast majority of nursing homes that care for these residents  participate in Medicare and Medicaid, and in 2009, nursing homes received  about $89 billion in payments from these programs. Ensuring quality of  care in these nursing homes is a joint responsibility of the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), and state survey agencies. Congress  and CMS set federal requirements, and CMS contracts with state survey  agencies to perform both routine inspections of nursing homes, known as  standard surveys, and complaint investigations, among other activities.", "Complaint investigations offer a unique opportunity to identify and correct  potential care problems. They can provide more timely alerts of potential  problems than standard surveys and target specific areas identified by  residents, their families, nursing home staff, and others. In 2009, half of all  violations of federal requirements that resulted in some level of harm to  nursing home residents were cited during complaint investigations. State  survey agencies generally develop their own investigation procedures but  must follow certain federal procedures and time frames for complaints  that allege a violation of federal requirements. State survey agencies also  must provide certain information about their complaint investigations to  CMS through its national complaints database. CMS oversees state survey  agencies in part by assessing their performance on four standards that  pertain to nursing home complaints. These standards are part of a broader  CMS State Performance Standards System.", "Members of Congress and others have raised concerns about the  timeliness and adequacy of nursing home complaint investigations, as well  as the manner in which the findings are communicated to complainants.  Concerns have focused not only on state survey agencies\u2019 nursing home  complaint investigations, but also on CMS\u2019s oversight. You expressed  interest in learning more about these issues. Specifically, we examined   (1) the number and types of complaints CMS\u2019s database showed as  received, investigated, and substantiated by state survey agencies;   (2) whether state survey agencies were meeting CMS\u2019s performance  standards and complainant communication requirements and steps taken  by the agencies to meet them; and (3) the effectiveness of CMS\u2019s oversight  of state survey agencies\u2019 complaint investigation processes.", "To describe the number and types of nursing home complaints received,  investigated, and substantiated by state survey agencies, we analyzed  CMS\u2019s national complaints data for calendar years 2004 through 2009 for  all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Because concerns have focused  primarily on complaints, we included only complaints in our analysis for  this objective and excluded facility-reported incidents, which nursing  homes are required to self-report to state survey agencies. In addition, we  included only complaints that alleged a violation of federal requirements.  To assess the reliability of the complaints data we received from CMS, we  interviewed officials from CMS and state survey agencies about the quality  of the data, reviewed relevant documentation, and examined the data for  reasonableness and internal consistency. In the course of this assessment,  we found some data limitations. Specifically, CMS officials told us that  they have concerns that some state survey agencies may not have entered  all of the complaints they received into CMS\u2019s national database. We  therefore consider the number of complaints in CMS\u2019s national data to be  a conservative estimate of the total number of complaints received by  state survey agencies. In addition, we analyzed only those variables that  we found to be reliable. We learned that in some cases, data are missing  for certain variables that state survey agencies are not required to enter  into the database\u2014such as the date on which the state survey agency  acknowledged the complaint\u2014and that state survey agencies interpret  certain variables differently from one another. For example, state survey  agencies have differing interpretations of what it means to substantiate a  complaint. Some state survey agencies limit use of the term to complaints  where at least one deficiency is cited while others consider complaints to  be substantiated if they are confirmed, even if no deficiencies are cited. In  this report, we chose to report data about complaints that were  substantiated with at least one federal deficiency cited, as we believe these  data should be more consistent across states than data on all complaints  reported to be substantiated. In addition, the citation of a federal  deficiency demonstrates that the nursing home has failed to meet federal  requirements. After reviewing the possible limitations of the complaints  data, we determined that the data we report were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of our report.", "To determine whether state survey agencies are meeting CMS\u2019s standards  and complainant communication requirements and to describe steps they  have taken to meet the requirements, we analyzed scores for two of the  four nursing home complaint performance standards in CMS\u2019s State  Performance Standards System for fiscal years 2006 through 2009 for all   50 states and the District of Columbia. For our analysis, we reviewed  performance on the two standards we considered the most reliable:   (1) prioritization of complaints based on the severity of the allegations and  (2) timeliness of investigations. Although these standards assess state  survey agencies\u2019 performance with respect to incidents as well as  complaints, we used scores on these standards as measures of  performance with respect to complaints alone. CMS does not calculate  separate scores for complaints. Moreover, on a national level, complaints  considerably outnumber incidents in CMS\u2019s database, and state survey  agencies\u2019 scores on the standards are therefore likely to primarily reflect  their performance with respect to complaints. We analyzed scores from  fiscal years 2006 through 2009 because CMS reorganized its performance  system in 2006, and the most recent data available at the time of our study  were from fiscal year 2009. Because of changes made in the standards\u2019  requirements and scoring during this time period, we have presented trend  data only when scores were comparable over time. We also analyzed  CMS\u2019s national complaints data on the length of time taken by state survey  agencies to investigate complaints in calendar year 2009. In addition, we  reviewed the guidance CMS provided to state survey agencies and its own  regional offices, which are responsible for evaluating state survey  agencies\u2019 nursing home complaint processes. We also conducted  structured telephone interviews with CMS regional office officials in  Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas and state survey agency officials in Arkansas,  Florida, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. We gathered  additional perspectives on CMS\u2019s requirements at a membership meeting  of the Association of Health Facility Survey Agencies (AHFSA), the  organization that represents state survey agencies. Finally, we reviewed  both templates and samples of actual letters to complainants provided by  the six state survey agencies in our sample.", "To assess the effectiveness of CMS\u2019s oversight of state survey agencies\u2019  complaint investigation processes, we drew on information from our data  analyses and interviews, including interviews with officials at CMS  headquarters. We also evaluated the four nursing home complaint  performance standards using key criteria for performance measures  identified by GAO and other audit agencies. These criteria include  whether the standards are comprehensive, limited in number and overlap,  practical, balanced, comparable over time, and reliable. Additionally, to  examine the extent to which CMS has used performance information to  promote improvements in state survey agencies\u2019 nursing home complaint  investigation processes, we reviewed information from our interviews and  data analyses. We also reviewed corrective action plans that state survey  agencies in our sample were required to submit for any performance  standards they failed between fiscal years 2006 through 2009.", "We conducted our review from January 2010 through April 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

State survey agencies receive complaints via phone calls, e-mails,  or letters. At intake, staff review the information provided by the  complainant and, because each complaint can have more than one  allegation, determine the type(s) of allegations involved, such as resident  abuse or poor quality of care.", "Prioritization. Based on the nature of the allegations, staff assign a  priority level to the complaint, which determines if an onsite investigation  is required. Four of the eight priority levels require an onsite investigation.  (See table 1.) For example, investigations for complaints that allege  \u201cimmediate jeopardy\u201d to a resident\u2019s health, safety, or life must be started  within 2 working days of receipt, while investigations for complaints that  allege a high level of actual harm (\u201cactual harm-high\u201d) to a resident must  be started within 10 working days of prioritization.", "Investigation. During the unannounced investigation, state agency  surveyors may conduct a document review and observe nursing home  conditions. Additionally, surveyors interview witnesses, including the  resident about whose care the complaint was filed and other residents  with similar care needs, being careful to protect the anonymity of those  involved in the complaint. Surveyors determine whether the allegations  are substantiated and whether the nursing home should be cited for any  deficiencies (failure to meet federal or state quality standards), which may  be related or unrelated to the complaint allegations. Deficiencies are  categorized according to scope and severity. Scope refers to the number of  residents potentially or actually affected and has three levels\u2014isolated,  pattern, or widespread. Severity refers to the degree of relative harm and  has four levels\u2014immediate jeopardy (actual or potential for death or  serious injury), actual harm, potential for more than minimal harm, or  potential for minimal harm.", "Reporting of Results.

For  example, Florida provides staff with a 44-page manual, with chapters on  intake, prioritization, and investigation of complaints, and created an  automated complaint investigation form that captures information about  each allegation in a complaint, as well as the evidence collected and  findings reached with respect to each.", "Monitoring. Among the state survey agencies in our sample that failed to  meet some of CMS\u2019s standards, officials indicated that their agencies had  implemented or planned to implement additional monitoring efforts. For  example, Texas officials indicated that the agency conducts reviews  throughout the complaint process. For example, after a complaint has  been prioritized, a quality assurance specialist reviews the information to  ensure that the prioritization was appropriate. Similarly, officials from  Tennessee\u2019s survey agency indicated that the agency planned to increase  monitoring. In particular, the officials indicated that each of the state\u2019s  regional offices would track and report quarterly on the timeliness of  investigations for all immediate jeopardy and actual harm-high complaints.  Tennessee officials indicated that surveyors in the state\u2019s regional offices  would be immediately alerted when they are assigned an immediate  jeopardy complaint to investigate, something not always done in the past.", "State survey agencies in our sample that generally passed CMS\u2019s  performance standards indicated that monitoring programs contributed to  the agencies\u2019 success. For example, a Florida official indicated that a  supervisor reviews a sample of complaints received on the previous day to  determine whether they were prioritized appropriately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some State Survey Agencies Provide Limited Information to Complainants about Investigation Findings", "paragraphs": ["Although the CMS performance standards do not assess whether state  survey agencies are providing sufficient information to complainants  about investigation results, CMS\u2019s State Operations Manual indicates that  state survey agencies should provide a written report to complainants in  accordance with certain guidelines specified in the manual. The manual  specifies that the state agency should acknowledge the complainant\u2019s  concerns, identify the agency\u2019s regulatory authority to investigate, provide  a summary of investigation methods and the date of the investigation,  summarize the investigation findings, and identify any follow-up action to  be taken.", "The six state survey agencies in our sample varied in their interpretations  of the manual, particularly the instruction to provide a summary of the  investigation findings. Two of the six agencies consistently provided  detailed information that specifically addressed complainants\u2019 allegations.  For example, one sample letter we received from the Wisconsin survey  agency lists four specific allegations made by the complainant and then  describes the agency\u2019s finding with respect to each, including whether a  deficiency was cited. (See fig. 2 for an excerpt from this letter.) The other  state survey agency that provided detailed information (Michigan) did so  by enclosing the investigation report with the letter, along with the  statement of deficiencies, if any were cited. A Michigan survey agency  official said that staff also make at least one attempt to contact a  complainant by telephone to explain the findings.", "In contrast, four of the state survey agencies sent complainants only  boilerplate descriptions of the complaint investigation, typically sending  one type of form letter if surveyors cited deficiencies and another if they  did not. For example, in the sample letter we received from Florida, the  survey agency varied the middle paragraph of its three-paragraph letter  depending on whether deficiencies were cited (see fig. 3). An official of  this agency said the letter was intended to let complainants know that the  point of an investigation is to determine a nursing home\u2019s compliance with  regulations.", "Of the four state survey agencies that provided boilerplate descriptions of  their investigation findings, two told complainants how to obtain a more  detailed report. For example, a sample letter from the Arkansas state  survey agency noted that the agency\u2019s report on the deficiencies cited and  the nursing home\u2019s plan of correction should be posted in the nursing  home.

In addition, CMS has not made full use of the information it collects about  state survey agencies\u2019 complaint investigation processes.

Specific weaknesses we  identified include a lack of comparability over time in the performance  scores and thus an inability to assess trends; a lack of balance among  some standards; and, most critically, a lack of data reliability, due in part  to inadequate sample sizes and varying interpretations of the standards.", "Consistent with key criteria for performance measures, CMS\u2019s  performance standards are comprehensive and limited in number  and overlap. Officials of all of the state survey agencies and CMS regional  offices in our sample indicated that they considered the four nursing home  complaint standards comprehensive. Although the performance standards  system does not include standards for certain steps in the complaint  investigation process, such as intake, officials indicated that the standards  cover key steps, which include prioritizing complaints, scheduling and  conducting investigations, and documenting any deficiencies identified.  The standards are also limited in number and overlap, with each focused  on different aspects of the nursing home complaint process than the  others.", "Performance trends cannot be easily assessed because scores are  not comparable over time. Because CMS changed the scoring  methodologies for three of the four nursing home complaint standards  during the past 4 years, it is not readily apparent from scores on these  standards whether state survey agencies\u2019 performance improved or  worsened over that time period. CMS officials generally felt that the  changes had enhanced the standards\u2014in the case of the documentation of  deficiencies and quality of investigations standards, by holding state  survey agencies accountable for meeting all of the underlying  requirements or by highlighting specific areas in need of improvement.  Further, they did not identify the lack of trend data as a major concern.  Officials noted that CMS judges state survey agencies\u2019 performance for a  given year, not in relation to prior years, and does not count scores on a  standard in the first year after a significant change in methodology.", "However, a lack of consistent trend data makes it more difficult for CMS  to assess whether the steps that it and the states are taking to improve  performance on the nursing home complaint standards are having the  desired effect.", "The balance among standards may be undermined by how the  prioritization standard is scored. In general, the standards are  balanced, so that the incentives created by one standard are  counterbalanced by the incentives created by other standards. However,  because the prioritization standard requires only that complaints be  assigned a priority level at or above the level assigned by CMS reviewers,  this standard may create an incentive for state survey agencies to assign  higher priority levels than are warranted\u2014which may jeopardize the  timeliness of investigations. As one state survey agency official pointed  out, the staff members who prioritize complaints may not be responsible  for conducting investigations; consequently, these staff may be more  focused on the agency\u2019s meeting the prioritization standard than the  timeliness standard and thus err on the side of caution in prioritizing  complaints. According to CMS headquarters officials, the prioritization  standard is scored this way because the agency was most concerned about  complaints being prioritized at too low a level and did not want to fault  state survey agencies for investigating complaints sooner than necessary.  However, officials of two CMS regional offices noted that assigning  complaints too high a priority level can cause misallocation of resources,  as state survey agencies that prioritize complaints at higher levels than are  warranted must investigate these complaints within shorter time frames  than they otherwise would.", "Some performance scores are unreliable because of inadequate  sample sizes and varying interpretations of standards among CMS  reviewers. For three of the four CMS performance standards, the samples  specified by CMS are in some cases too small to yield reliable data. Scores  on the prioritization of complaints, quality of investigations, and  documentation of deficiencies standards were generally based on a sample  of 10 to 40 cases (10 percent, up to a maximum of 40). With samples this  small, the margin of error around states\u2019 scores on the prioritization of  complaints standard, for example, was as much as 19 percentage points in  fiscal year 2009. Accordingly, at least some of the states that received  passing marks on this standard may actually have failed, and at least five  of the nine states that received failing marks may actually have passed.  Although the small sample sizes CMS requires make the reviews involved  in certain standards more practical, by reducing the documentation CMS  reviewers must examine, the trade-off is a lack of precision in the scores  for these standards.", "Moreover, interpretation of some standards has varied among CMS  reviewers\u2014in terms of both the materials reviewed to assess performance  and how certain requirements were construed by reviewers.", "Materials reviewed. To assess the quality of investigations, some CMS  regional offices reviewed only information surveyors entered into the  complaints database, while other CMS regional offices reviewed more  extensive hard-copy notes from complaint investigations. CMS  headquarters officials indicated that relying solely on the information in  the complaints database to assess the quality of investigations was not  consistent with federal guidance, stating that regional office officials  should follow the guidance for the standard, which calls for reviewers to  examine a variety of documents, including surveyor worksheets and  investigation notes. They also noted that the investigation notes are not  required data elements in the complaints database. Some state survey  agency officials said that their scores on this standard have suffered  because the investigation notes in the database do not always provide a  complete picture of the agency\u2019s complaint investigations.", "How requirements were construed. State survey agency officials we  interviewed also noted differences in how CMS reviewers understood  certain requirements in the standards, particularly in the documentation of  deficiencies standard. For example, officials described differences in  reviewers\u2019 interpretations of what it means to quantify the extent of a  deficient practice, one of the requirements in that standard. One state  survey agency official said that his agency\u2019s scores on the standards  improved from one half of the year to the next simply because the CMS  staff conducting the review changed. Officials in one of the CMS regions  where all state survey agencies failed the documentation of deficiencies  standard acknowledged the 100 percent failure rate was at least partially  due to a change in the regional office\u2019s review\u2014specifically, regional  managers having issued more explicit instructions to staff about how to  assess states\u2019 performance on particular requirements. The clustering of  failing scores on this standard within certain CMS regions also suggests  regional variation in interpretation; in three regions, all of the state survey  agencies failed the documentation of deficiencies standard in fiscal year  2009, while in the other seven regions, half or fewer of the state survey  agencies failed.", "Although some CMS regional offices have tried to ensure consistent  interpretation of the standards within their own regions\u2014for example, by  requiring that multiple reviewers concur on any failing marks given to  state survey agencies and encouraging ongoing dialogue about the  standards\u2014some officials we interviewed believe CMS should do more to  ensure consistency across regions. CMS headquarters officials told us that  the agency has issued additional guidance when officials became aware of  a need for clarification, but some CMS regional office officials said that  parts of the guidance need enhancement and that CMS headquarters  should have more staff dedicated to developing guidance and answering  questions from regional office staff. In addition, some state survey agency  officials suggested that CMS regional offices should have less autonomy in  the performance review process. One official suggested that CMS  headquarters should exert more control over the regional offices with  respect to the review process, and others indicated a need for more  \u201creview of the reviewers\u201d\u2014for example, by having the performance  reviews conducted by each regional office validated by another. Officials  of one state survey agency, noting that state survey agencies can appeal  their performance scores only to the same regional office that conducted  their performance review, suggested that a second regional office should  at least be involved in the appeals process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Not Made Full Use of Performance Information on State Survey Agencies\u2019 Complaint Investigations", "paragraphs": ["CMS has not made full use of the information it collects about state survey  agencies\u2019 complaint investigation processes through its complaints  database and performance standards system.

In part because of data reliability concerns, CMS  does not routinely calculate certain measures that could shed additional  light on state survey agencies\u2019 performance\u2014such as substantiation rates  or additional measures of the timeliness of investigations.", "Substantiation rates, if interpreted by state survey agencies in a consistent  manner, could provide insight into the quality of complaint investigations.  Given the many factors that influence these rates, including whether the  complaints have a basis in fact, it would not be appropriate to require state  survey agencies to achieve a particular rate. However, substantial  variation in rates, either among states or over time, could signal issues  with complaint investigations and prompt further inquiry by CMS. A CMS  headquarters official told us that because some state survey agencies may  consider a complaint to be substantiated even if no federal deficiencies are  cited, CMS headquarters does not systematically monitor substantiation  rates and most CMS regional offices probably do not do so either. The  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), enacted March 23,  2010, requires HHS to post on the Nursing Home Compare Web site  summary information on substantiated complaints, including their  number, type, severity and outcome, by March 23, 2011. Accordingly, a  CMS official told us that CMS headquarters will issue guidance to ensure  that state survey agencies interpret substantiation in a consistent manner.", "Additional measures of timeliness\u2014such as the number of days by which  state survey agencies miss the deadlines for some complaint  investigations\u2014could provide CMS with a more comprehensive picture of  performance in this area. We found that some state survey agencies with  similar scores on CMS\u2019s timeliness standard for actual harm-high  complaints in fiscal year 2009 had very different backlogs of complaint  investigations. For example, looking at two state survey agencies with  performance scores of 82 and 85 percent\u2014which indicates, respectively,  that 18 and 15 percent of their investigations were late\u2014we found that 51  percent of one agency\u2019s late investigations were initiated more than 30  days late in calendar year 2009, compared with 4 percent for the other  agency. Currently, the reliability of timeliness measures such as this is  uncertain because state survey agencies do not necessarily enter all  complaints into CMS\u2019s database or prioritize complaints in the same way.", "Responsibility for training to address performance issues has  generally been left to CMS regional offices. The CMS regional offices  in our sample have used information from the performance standards  system to identify performance issues, but training designed to address  these issues has generally been undertaken by individual CMS regional  offices and, as a result, has varied in content and scope. Complaint  investigation training at the national level has been limited and was not  designed to address specific performance issues identified during  reviews. Officials of most of the state survey agencies in our sample  indicated that CMS\u2019s training and guidance was sufficient, but officials of  two state survey agencies noted that their agencies provide any training  above the basic level. One state survey agency official said that CMS  should offer more comprehensive training, including more material on  complaint investigations, so that states are not \u201csinking or swimming\u201d on  their own and are able to conduct investigations in a more consistent  manner.", "PPACA directed HHS to enter into a contract to establish a National  Training Institute to help surveyors develop complaint investigation  skills. However, as of March 2011, funds had not yet been appropriated to  implement this provision of the act, and CMS estimates that it would cost  about $12 million to establish the institute. As a start, CMS has redirected  about $1 million from other projects to initiate a project which will  provide instruction on all aspects of complaint surveys for all facility  types, including nursing homes.", "Corrective action plans are not timely and may not address the  underlying causes of performance issues. CMS requires state survey  agencies that fail performance standards to submit plans to improve their  performance, but CMS does not require these plans to be submitted until  halfway through the next performance cycle, which allows little time for  corrective actions to take effect before the next performance review. (See  fig. 4.) Moreover, despite CMS regional office input, the plans do not  necessarily address the underlying causes of state survey agencies\u2019 failure  to meet performance standards. For example, all three of the state survey  agencies in our sample that failed the timeliness of investigations standard  for immediate jeopardy complaints, actual harm-high complaints, or both  in all 4 fiscal years from 2006 through 2009 cited staff shortages as a  reason, but two of the three submitted at least one corrective action plan  during that period that did not propose hiring the additional staff needed.", "CMS regional office officials indicated that they had accepted such  corrective action plans because the steps the state survey agencies did  propose\u2014such as developing a graphic analysis tool to track performance  or implementing additional central oversight of regional offices\u2014were  likely to improve performance to some extent, and because CMS does not  have the authority to require state survey agencies to hire or reallocate  staff. Only one of the CMS regional offices in our sample reported ever  having rejected a corrective action plan, and officials of one CMS regional  office told us they preferred that a corrective action plan provide a  realistic account of what a state survey agency was going to try to achieve  rather than propose actions that the agency could not carry out.", "Some CMS officials view the penalties the agency might impose for  failure to meet nursing home complaint standards as  counterproductive or unrealistic. CMS\u2019s regulations provide for  penalties to be imposed on a state survey agency for failure to follow  procedures specified by CMS for complaint investigations, such as  reducing funding or terminating the contract under which the state survey  agency conducts standard surveys and complaint investigations. CMS  headquarters officials noted that while CMS has reduced funding to state  survey agencies for failure to meet requirements for standard surveys,  such as statutory time frames, the agency has not done the same for  complaint investigations. One official said that CMS has not done so  partly because of concerns about the fairness of penalizing states for  failure to meet standards that may vary from year to year, as well as  concerns that reducing states\u2019 funding might make it even more difficult  for them to meet the standards. Some CMS regional office officials said  that reducing state survey agencies\u2019 funding for failure to complete  complaint investigations on time made sense, but others said that taking  resources away from the agencies could be counterproductive, further  hampering their ability to carry out investigations. Although CMS could  terminate its contract with a state survey agency, CMS officials we  interviewed indicated that this was not a realistic option.", "CMS has not publicly reported state survey agencies\u2019 performance  scores. Public reporting of performance information has been advocated  by GAO and other auditors as a critical step in performance management  because it provides policymakers and the public with information needed  to assess progress and may also serve to motivate agency managers and  staff. While CMS has shared state survey agencies\u2019 scores on the  performance standards with all of the other state survey agencies, it has  not made the scores available to other stakeholders, such as residents,  family members, or advocates. According to a CMS headquarters official,  some state survey agencies have made their own scores publicly available,  but CMS has not yet issued any guidance to the states on public disclosure  of scores. This official told us that CMS plans to issue a policy memo  affirming state survey agencies\u2019 right to disclose their own scores and is  also considering making all of the scores publicly available, possibly on  CMS\u2019s Web site. Although some CMS regional office officials questioned  whether performance reports might too easily be misconstrued by the  public and necessarily gloss over details that would provide a more  nuanced picture of performance, GAO\u2019s prior work on performance  management suggests reports can be structured to avoid these potential  pitfalls\u2014for example, by explaining the limitations of the data and using  clearly defined terms and readily understood tables and graphs to convey  information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the past decade, CMS has made several efforts to improve the intake  and investigation of nursing home complaints by state survey agencies,  including (1) implementation of a database that not only helps state survey  agencies track complaints but also helps CMS monitor the state survey  agencies\u2019 performance and (2) establishment of and refinements to its  performance standards related to nursing home complaints. However, our  review indicates that challenges remain.", "CMS\u2019s complaint data have limitations. We found that the lack of  consistency in state surveys agencies\u2019 use of the database\u2014particularly in  terms of which complaints are entered and how certain fields are  interpreted\u2014undermines the reliability of some of the data and limits the  usefulness of the database as a monitoring tool. CMS does not routinely  use the data to calculate measures such as substantiation rates that could  enhance its understanding of complaint investigations partly because of  concerns about the reliability of the data.", "CMS\u2019s performance reviews highlight state workload issues.  Although state survey agencies generally prioritized nursing home  complaints in accordance with CMS\u2019s performance standard, we found  that many agencies had difficulty managing a heavy workload of actual  harm-high complaints. In 2009, state survey agencies prioritized 45 percent  of the more than 53,000 nursing home complaints they received as actual- harm high, which requires initiation of an investigation within 10 working  days of prioritization. In fiscal year 2009, 19 state survey agencies failed to  meet the CMS timeliness standard for these complaints. Staffing shortages  and heavy workloads were cited as key reasons by survey agency officials  we interviewed whose states had failed this standard. CMS\u2019s policy for  scoring the prioritization standard may contribute to these workload  issues by creating an incentive for the agency staff who prioritize  complaints to assign higher priority levels than are warranted. While CMS  is correct in asserting that prioritizing complaints at too high a level is  preferable to the reverse, this practice can have a significant impact on  state survey agencies\u2019 workload and thus on their ability to meet  requirements for timely investigations. Additionally, CMS data for 2009  showed that, among investigated complaints prioritized as either  immediate jeopardy or actual harm-high, the percentage substantiated  with at least one federal deficiency cited was higher if the investigation  was initiated within required time frames than if it was not. Though many  factors can affect whether complaints are substantiated, including  whether there is evidence to support them, considerable variation in  substantiation rates, among the states or over time, could indicate  potential concerns with state survey agencies\u2019 complaint investigations.", "Some performance standards scores are unreliable due to small  samples and varying interpretations of requirements. CMS has also  made efforts to refine its performance standards for nursing home  complaints. However, as with the complaints data, scores on some  standards are unreliable, because of inadequate sample sizes and varying  interpretations of the standards by the CMS regional office officials who  conduct the performance reviews. While we recognize that CMS may have  opted for small samples for some standards in order to limit the amount of  documentation reviewers must examine each year, sample sizes could be  increased without increasing reviewers\u2019 workloads if performance on  certain standards\u2014those that require document review\u2014were assessed  less frequently than once a year. Less frequent reviews could also help  address the issue of state survey agencies receiving their final scores and  submitting their corrective action plans so far into the next performance  cycle that little time remains for them to improve their performance. The  credibility of the scores could be further enhanced by ensuring that the  standards are consistently interpreted by the CMS regional offices.  Clarifying CMS guidance could help in this regard as well as in ensuring  that state survey agencies understand their responsibilities with respect to  each aspect of the complaint investigation process, including the manner  in which investigation results are communicated to complainants.", "CMS is considering making state survey agencies\u2019 scores on the  performance standards publicly available.
