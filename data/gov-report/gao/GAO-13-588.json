These activities include the United States and its trading partners developing and using international standards, recognizing each other's regulations as equivalent, and sharing scientific data. U.S. agency officials GAO interviewed said they cooperate with foreign counterparts because many products they regulate originate overseas and because they may gain efficiencies--for example, by sharing resources or avoiding duplicative work. Cooperation can address both existing and avoid future regulatory differences. Officials also explained how cooperative efforts enhance public health and safety, facilitate trade, and support competitiveness of U.S. businesses. Several U.S. interagency processes require or enable interagency collaboration on international cooperation activities. The Regulatory Working Group (RWG), chaired by OMB and the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) are forums that have different responsibilities related to the regulatory and trade aspects of international regulatory cooperation. U.S. regulatory agency officials said the current processes could benefit from better information sharing among agencies on the implementation of international cooperation activities and lessons learned. Without enhancements to current forums, opportunities to share practices and improve outcomes could be missed. Executive Order 13609, issued in May 2012, tasked the RWG with enhancing coordination and issuing guidance on international regulatory cooperation, which the RWG is developing. Nonfederal stakeholders GAO interviewed reported challenges to providing input on U.S. agencies' international regulatory cooperation activities, in particular that they are not always aware of many of these activities and participation can be resource intensive.", "Officials GAO interviewed said the outcomes from international regulatory cooperation inform all phases of the rulemaking process, from helping an agency decide whether to regulate to implementing and enforcing regulations. U.S. agencies are not required to conduct a separate analysis on the competitiveness impacts on U.S. businesses when developing regulations. However, five of the seven U.S. agencies told GAO they do consider competitiveness. Officials we interviewed also pointed out that any analysis of impacts may not rise to the level of inclusion in the rulemaking record. In addition, U.S. agencies' use of international standards in regulations can lower costs for U.S. businesses and reduce barriers to trade.", "Officials from all of the U.S. agencies GAO interviewed said they consider international standards during rulemaking partly in response to requirements in trade agreements, U.S. statutes, and executive orders. Officials from all of the U.S. agencies GAO interviewed identified seven key factors that affect the success of international regulatory cooperation activities: (1) dedicated resources, (2) established processes, (3) high-level leadership, (4) scientific and technical exchanges, (5) stakeholder involvement, (6) statutory authority, and (7) early and ongoing coordination. When present, these factors can facilitate U.S. agencies' efforts, but they can also act as barriers when absent. GAO found that these factors also reflect the seven key features for implementing collaborative mechanisms previously identified in its September 2012 report on interagency collaboration."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends the RWG include in forthcoming guidance on Executive Order 13609 tools to enhance collaboration, such as mechanisms to facilitate staff level dialogues.

For example, EPA participates in an initiative on pesticides  through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) that has resulted in regulatory efficiencies. OECD also reported  that, by accepting the same test results OECD-wide, unnecessary  duplication of testing is avoided, thereby saving resources for industry  and society as a whole. A 2007 study for the OECD Working Group on  Pesticides estimated resource savings of 33 to 40 percent as a result of  joint review by three to five countries, compared with each country  working alone. The study noted that the savings from reducing duplicative  expert evaluation work significantly outweighed the marginal increase for  project management, coordination, and travel. These tools and  approaches facilitate work sharing for regulators and help avoid costly,  duplicative testing by ensuring that the data developed and submitted in  one country can be used by other countries in reaching their regulatory  decisions.", "Agencies\u2019 efforts to cooperate on regulatory programs through  cooperative activities may also have the effect of facilitating trade and  supporting the competitiveness of U.S. businesses. FDA officials said that  international regulatory cooperation and harmonization has public health  benefits, promotes regulatory efficiency, and both also have indirect  competitiveness advantages for companies. FDA officials said that public  health regulatory and competitiveness goals are often complementary: by  upholding and enforcing scientifically valid standards, public health is  protected and promoted at the same time that companies benefit from a  level playing field that should make their products more competitive.

However,  nonfederal stakeholders told us that high levels of resources are required  to participate in international meetings, which can limit participation in  practice. For informal international cooperation activities, nonfederal  stakeholders said it is even more challenging to track and provide input  into the agencies\u2019 activities because some activities described to us by  regulatory agencies precede the decision to regulate and therefore may  not be transparent to the public. While it is generally challenging for  nonfederal stakeholders to provide input into U.S. agencies\u2019 international  regulatory cooperation activities, it is particularly important that  stakeholders at least have the opportunity to participate and advise  agencies when those activities are anticipated to lead to the development  of regulations.

Agencies and nonfederal stakeholders told  us that the U.S.-Canada RCC has implemented practices to engage  nonfederal stakeholders. For example, the 29 work plans that make up  the RCC were developed in part from the response to a Federal Register  request for public comments concerning regulatory cooperation activities  that would help eliminate or reduce unnecessary regulatory divergences  in North America that disrupt U.S. exports.

An agency official also cautioned it may not be  realistic for agencies to report all international regulatory cooperation  activities as many are informal in nature."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Consider International Regulatory Cooperation and Competitiveness during Rulemaking in Different Ways International Regulatory Cooperation Activities Inform Different Phases of Rulemaking", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials we interviewed reported that the outcomes from  international regulatory cooperation can inform all phases of the  rulemaking process, from affecting an agency\u2019s decision whether or not to  regulate in a particular area to implementing and enforcing regulations.  According to an agency official, there is no bright line that separates  international regulatory cooperation activities from regulatory programs.  For example, U.S. agencies share scientific and technical information with  their foreign counterparts, which can inform all stages of the rulemaking  process. In addition, information sharing can help inform an agency\u2019s  decision on whether or not to regulate a product. When countries have  differences in regulations in a particular area, there are opportunities to  coordinate on the science underlying regulatory decisions in a particular  area. EPA Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP)  officials said that for chemical safety regulations, countries are working  within different statutory and regulatory frameworks and different levels of  acceptance of risk that can make it difficult to reach full agreement on a  regulatory approach. In such cases, sharing information with foreign  counterparts can facilitate agreement on a common understanding of the  issue or on underlying technical or scientific issues. According to officials  that we interviewed, OCSPP also focuses on transparency and good  regulatory practices, which lead to commonality between policies, work  sharing on scientific reviews, and greater harmonization in the long term.", "Some international regulatory cooperation activities, such as the  development of international standards or practices, can inform and  contribute to the development and issuance of a proposed regulation.  Certain U.S. agencies reported that they coordinate with organizations  that develop international standards and may use these standards when  developing domestic regulations. For example, DOT\u2019s Pipeline and  Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) participates in the  United Nations (UN) Transport of Dangerous Goods (TDG)  Subcommittee, which develops UN Model Regulations for the  transportation of hazardous materials. In an effort to align with any  changes to the UN Model Regulations, PHMSA considers these model  regulations in a rulemaking every 2 years. As a result, related U.S.  regulations are more closely aligned with trading partners and there are  fewer country-unique regulations for businesses to comply with, which  leads to improved safety results. According to PHMSA officials that we  interviewed, when regulations are the same in different countries it  enhances compliance and improves the efficiency of the transportation  system by minimizing regulatory burdens and facilitating effective  oversight. Similarly, Commerce officials pointed out that regulators often  use common technical standards as the basis for regulation, which can  reduce the burden on the regulated community.", "Other international regulatory cooperation activities are related to the  implementation of regulations, such as equivalency agreements that  assure compliance with U.S. requirements and capacity building. For  example, USDA\u2019s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) manages  equivalency agreements for organic food labeling. The U.S. equivalence  arrangement with the EU allows organic products certified in Europe or  the United States to be sold as organic in either region. According to AMS  officials, equivalency agreements result in expanded market access,  fewer duplicative requirements, and lower certification costs for organic  products. Previously, businesses that wanted to trade organic products  had to obtain separate certifications for both the United States and EU,  which meant a second set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. Agencies  also engage in capacity building and provide technical assistance to  countries to help foreign businesses comply with U.S. regulations when  exporting to the United States. For example, FDA developed a  comprehensive international food safety capacity-building plan in  response to a requirement in the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act.  The plan establishes a strategic framework for the FDA, describes an  approach that is based on prioritizing risks to U.S. consumers, and  focuses on addressing system weaknesses working with foreign  government and industry counterparts and other stakeholders. Agencies  also engage in work-sharing arrangements with their foreign counterparts  to gain efficiencies in the implementation of regulatory programs. For  example, under the United States-Canada Beyond the Border Initiative,  USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) conducted a  joint foot and mouth disease site visit in Colombia as part of the  evaluation of Colombia\u2019s request to export fresh beef. Coordinated  inspections allow agencies to leverage resources with their foreign  counterparts to fulfill their regulatory responsibilities. OIRA also engages  in activities to strengthen the capacity of developing countries in several  contexts, including APEC and work with Brazil, Vietnam, and Morocco.", "Some international regulatory cooperation activities that U.S. agencies  shared with us are on products that are not regulated by U.S. agencies.  Agencies do not issue regulations through programs where participation  is voluntary but still may coordinate with foreign counterparts. For  example, DOE is working with other countries through the Efficient  Electrical End-use Equipment (4E) Implementing Agreement on efficiency  and performance criteria and metrics, test methods, and qualified testing  laboratories for new technology for solid state lighting. DOE officials said  coordination on solid state lighting is important, because without a  common agreement, it would be more difficult for products to enter the  world market. Standardized labeling also helps customers understand the  product they are buying and how its efficiency compares with other  products."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "While Executive Orders and Guidance Encourage U.S. Agencies to Consider Competitiveness Impacts during Rulemaking, There Is No Requirement to Conduct a Separate Analysis", "paragraphs": ["For regulations deemed significant under Executive Orders 12866 and  13563, U.S. agencies are required to assess the costs and benefits, but  there is no requirement for agencies to conduct a separate analysis on  competitiveness impacts when developing regulations. Among the  general principles of regulation under Executive Order 13563 is that the  U.S. regulatory system should promote economic growth, innovation,  competitiveness, and job creation. Moreover, according to executive  orders on regulatory review, among the possible effects that agencies  should consider are the significant adverse effects on the ability of U.S.  companies to compete in domestic and foreign markets. Moreover, OMB  Circular A-4\u2019s discussion on global competitiveness states: \u201cThe role of  Federal regulation in facilitating U.S. participation in global markets  should also be considered. Harmonization of U.S. and international rules  may require a strong Federal regulatory role. Concerns that new U.S.  rules could act as non-tariff barriers to imported goods should be  evaluated carefully.\u201d Further, these executive orders and related guidance  do not apply to independent agencies. The concept of competitiveness  is a general one, referring to the set of institutions, policies, and human  and natural endowments that allow a country to remain productive.", "Depending on the circumstances, the focus of analysis could vary. Here,  in the context of international regulatory cooperation, improvements to  competitiveness might arise from lowering the cost of a firm\u2019s compliance  with other countries\u2019 standards or expanding access of U.S. products to  foreign markets. However, documenting the effect of the removal of  barriers on firm cost and sales presents challenges because data on  individual firm performance may not be available and because the effect  of the regulatory action may be difficult to isolate. Still, in some cases, it  may be possible to describe effects in terms of magnitude and direction.", "When agencies develop regulations related to international activities,  officials from five of the seven agencies in our study told us that they  consider competitiveness as needed. Officials from two agencies in our  study provided examples of analysis of competitiveness impacts in the  rulemaking record. Agency officials said competitiveness impacts for  some rulemakings are likely to be indirect and may not rise to the level of  inclusion in the rulemaking record. For example, according to officials,  APHIS\u2019s regulations focus on preventing the introduction and spread of  pests and diseases of livestock and plants. The officials explained it is  difficult to point to any APHIS regulations that can be said to have a direct  effect on the ability of U.S. businesses to compete in the marketplace. In  another example, officials from DOT\u2019s PHMSA said their regulations  related to pipeline safety are for pipelines within the United States. When  included in the rulemaking record, competitiveness is likely to be a  secondary or tertiary effect in rulemaking analysis. For example,  according to OAR officials, most OAR rulemakings have few if any direct  impacts on competitiveness. These impacts, if any, would likely be  secondary or indirect. They said that competitiveness analysis, when  appropriate, might examine whether increased production costs for a U.S.  business may put it at a competitive disadvantage compared with a  similar company in a different country that is not required to comply with a  similar environmental regulation.", "Some agency officials we interviewed said competitiveness impacts can  be challenging to identify, difficult to quantify, and resource intensive to  complete and that they do not have tools to consider competitiveness  during rulemaking. According to DOT\u2019s National Highway and Traffic  Safety Administration (NHTSA) officials, NHTSA has never addressed the  competitiveness of U.S. businesses in any of its analyses. NHTSA does  not have tools for analyzing the effects of its safety standards on the  competitiveness of U.S. businesses. For at least 10 years, NHTSA and  DOT\u2019s Volpe Center have attempted to create a consumer-marketing  model to help estimate the impact of the fuel economy program on sales  and have been unsuccessful to date.the impact on competition of a relatively small safety standard, when  NHTSA cannot do it for the enormous fuel economy standard, does not  seem to be a good use of resources.", "They said that trying to determine  However, officials from one agency we interviewed said that  competitiveness impacts are assumed to exist when they are aligning  regulations with trading partners, but agencies do not do a separate  analysis. For example, according to PHMSA officials, PHMSA\u2019s  harmonization rulemakings are premised on the assumption that  harmonized standards reduce costs for businesses and therefore reduce  barriers to trade. Specific cost-benefit analysis, however, is generally  associated with comparing the estimated costs of a regulation with the  safety and efficiency benefits associated with a specific change and not  directly associated with competitiveness of U.S. businesses. Further, the  TBT Agreement explains that using international standards as the basis  of a technical regulation adopted for a specified legitimate objective shall  be rebuttably presumed to not create unnecessary obstacles to  international trade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agencies Report Considering International Standards during Rulemaking", "paragraphs": ["Illuminating Engineering Society, and others. Many of these test  standards are referenced in, or used as the basis for, standards  developed by organizations, such as the International Electrotechnical  Commission, ISO, or other international standards-setting organizations.  Agencies may also consider approaches taken by other countries. For  example, in the development of a crib safety regulation, CPSC staff  reviewed requirements of existing voluntary and international standards  related to cribs. The primary standards currently in effect are CPSC  standards for full-size cribs, which reference the ASTM voluntary  standard; a Canadian standard; a European standard; and an Australian  and New Zealand standard. ASTM considered the existing international  standards in the development of the current ASTM voluntary standard.", "The TBT Agreement includes requirements to use international standards  or their relevant parts as the basis for technical regulation where available  and appropriate; to participate in international standards development,  within the limits of their resources; and to avoid unnecessary obstacles to  trade. Similarly, under the National Technology Transfer and  Advancement Act of 1995, agencies are required to use technical  standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus  standards bodies unless they are inconsistent with applicable law or  otherwise impracticable. If using standards other than voluntary  consensus standards, agencies are also required to provide an  explanation to OMB. Further, Executive Order 13609 on promoting  international regulatory cooperation includes a requirement that for  significant regulations that the agency identifies as having significant  international impacts, agencies consider, to the extent feasible,  appropriate, and consistent with law, any regulatory approaches by a  foreign government that the United States has agreed to consider under a  regulatory cooperation council work plan. DOT, CPSC, FDA, and USDA  have some additional agency-specific documents related to considering  international standards during rulemaking."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Factors Can Positively or Negatively Affect the Outcomes of International Regulatory Cooperation Activities", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials that we interviewed identified seven factors that have the  greatest impact on improving the effectiveness of international regulatory  cooperation. Some of these factors can facilitate agencies\u2019 efforts if  present in international regulatory cooperation activities while others can  also act as a barrier when absent. In an environment of constrained  budgets, agencies may not be able to address the factors equally, so it is  particularly important for agencies to focus on the factors that facilitate  their efforts. Therefore, as part of our evaluation, we ordered the factors  in table 3 below based on discussions and written responses from  agencies.", "As another part of our evaluation of these factors, we found that they  align with each of the key features important for agencies to consider  when implementing collaborative mechanisms. In September 2012, we  identified features that agencies could benefit from considering when  implementing interagency collaborative mechanisms. For example, we  found that: (1) resources are a key feature because collaborative efforts  can take time and resources in order to accomplish such activities as  building trust among the participants, setting up the ground rules for the  process, attending meetings, conducting project work, and monitoring and  evaluating the results of work performed; (2) establishment of agreements  in formal documents can strengthen an agency\u2019s commitment to working  collaboratively; and (3) leadership is important to all collaborative efforts,  but agencies have said that transitions within agencies or inconsistent  leadership can weaken the effectiveness of any collaborative mechanism.  We used those features as criteria to determine whether the seven main  factors that agencies and stakeholders identified as affecting international  regulatory cooperation reflected consideration of each of those issues.  We applied these criteria by comparing agencies\u2019 characterizations of the  seven key factors affecting international regulatory cooperation to the  specific questions identified in our 2012 report for agencies to consider  when implementing collaborative mechanisms. That comparison  demonstrated that one or more of the seven key factors corresponded to  each of the features of effective collaborative mechanisms.", "GAO-12-1022. reoccurring cooperation after implementation of regulations may be less  resource intensive to maintain through monitoring of developments in  foreign countries and by directly participating in formal and informal  meetings. USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) officials also pointed  out that it can take a long time before payoffs or results from resources  invested in international regulatory cooperation become apparent.", "Agency officials that we interviewed also identified some challenges to  securing and sustaining resources for international regulatory cooperation  activities. For example, officials said that international cooperation may be  viewed as too resource intensive to inform each individual regulatory  activity. Officials also said that investment in international regulatory  cooperation is viewed in some agencies as optional if it conflicts with  other priorities and responsibilities when the same staff members are  needed for other regulatory activities. One FAS official said that one of  the greatest resource constraints is securing the availability of regulators  in his department. Agency officials said that their foreign counterparts  also face resource constraints that may affect their participation in two  ways. First, resource constraints may limit their ability to participate in  international regulatory cooperation activities. Second, such constraints  may encourage foreign counterparts to leverage their limited resources  with the United States and other partners when the issues line up with  their own priorities.", "Officials identified some opportunities for leveraging funds from other  agencies to participate in international activities on an ad hoc basis. To  encourage compliance with the TBT Agreement, U.S. law authorizes the  United States Trade Representative and the Secretary concerned to  make grants to and enter into contracts with any other federal agency to  assist that agency in implementing programs and activities such as  participating in international standards-related activities. For instance,  one industry official said that agencies are going to have fewer resources  and therefore should be interested in leveraging their resources with other  countries as early as possible. Agency officials confirmed that there are  opportunities for them to leverage funds from United States Agency for  International Development (USAID) and State to participate in  international meetings. In addition, USTR officials said that their agency is  able to leverage funds that are not available to other U.S. agencies and  can match funds for regulators to meet with their foreign counterparts in  an international setting, such as through APEC meetings. U.S.  participation in international regulatory cooperation can be a multi-agency  effort. However, officials from a different agency also cautioned that such  funds tend to be limited to efforts that involve developing countries and  expressed concern that they are unlikely to be used to support regulators\u2019  participation with the EU. With reductions to the federal budget, the  money available to support regulatory cooperation may shrink.", "Established processes. According to agency officials, having defined  long-term processes and accountability mechanisms in place for working  with foreign counterparts can facilitate international regulatory  cooperation. Officials also said that such established processes can  increase transparency for stakeholders and better enable input. Agencies  said that defined processes developed through international agreements,  including forums, international procedures, and other international  mechanisms, are helpful. Agreements, such as the WTO SPS  Agreement, require members to consider international standards during  their process to develop regulations. The WTO SPS Agreement generally  obligates members to base their regulations on sanitary or phytosanitary  measures on international standards from Codex, OIE, or the  International Plant Protection Convention unless they have scientific  justification or have determined a different level of protection through a  risk assessment. In our September 2012 report, we concluded that the  establishment of agreements in formal documents can strengthen an  agency\u2019s commitment to working collaboratively. Similarly, officials from  DOT\u2019s PHMSA said established processes for the UN TDG  Subcommittee facilitate their cooperative efforts. The OECD also has  established processes on chemicals in their rules. The binding nature of  OECD rules ensures all countries abide by the requirements to accept  data from other OECD members, which helps advance its international  regulatory coordination efforts.", "High-level leadership. Agency officials told us in our interviews that  high-level leadership within an agency and leadership from outside the  agency can facilitate international regulatory cooperation, but a perceived  lack of high-level commitment or changing priorities can serve as barriers.  One academic expert said that the only way that international regulatory  cooperation will work is with high-level attention from the White House,  OMB, USTR, and the State Department. In addition, OMB officials we  interviewed said high-level support and leadership is essential to the  success of international regulatory cooperation. They also stressed that  regulatory agencies must have buy-in themselves, rather than be coerced  into international regulatory cooperation by outside agencies. Similarly,  Commerce\u2019s International Trade Administration (ITA) officials said that  executive orders and presidential initiatives, such as Executive Order  13609, the U.S.-Canada RCC, the U.S.-Mexico High Level Regulatory  Cooperation Council, APEC leaders\u2019 meetings, and the North American  Leaders Summit, have increased visibility, encouraged action from the  regulatory community, and prioritized events related to international  regulatory cooperation. Agency officials said that commitment of  resources is an indicator of top-level support. Agencies also said that  active participation by agency leadership with foreign counterparts can  expedite and facilitate progress at key points. FDA officials said that, in  their experience, when the heads of agencies have an ongoing active  relationship with their counterparts in foreign countries, international  regulatory cooperation is more likely to produce results.", "Agencies told us that it can be challenging when leadership priorities  change, such as when a new administration establishes different  priorities, because international regulatory cooperation activities are long- term efforts. Shifting political priorities can lead to short-term  commitments that can make it difficult for agencies to see projects  through to the end. Officials said that agencies need high-level  commitment, but if it wanes agencies can be left part way into a long-term  project. In our September 2012 report, we concluded that, given the  importance of leadership to collaborative efforts, transitions and  inconsistent leadership can weaken the effectiveness of any collaborative  mechanism.", "Scientific and technical exchanges. Sharing scientific and technical  information facilitates international regulatory cooperation and includes  coordination on testing, enforcement, and compliance issues, but, as  explained later, can also be restricted by statutory authority. The FTC  provides technical assistance to other countries in developing their  regulatory policies. When countries disagree on the appropriate policy or  standards, they can sometimes find agreement on the underlying  scientific and technical basis for regulations. According to FDA officials,  the regulations for medical products are more science based, while those  for food are more culture based, so FDA has more success with  international coordination on medical products. Collaboration and sharing  of data can lay the groundwork for future coordination. An independent  advisory agency developed a report that stated that the mutual trust  between regulators is an opportunity for work sharing because agencies  do not have to duplicate tests or science which allows them to share their  workload with foreign counterparts, move limited inspectors or transfer  other resources to areas of greater need. However, some statutes may  restrict scientific and technical exchanges because of limits on the  disclosure of information with foreign counterparts which is further  discussed within the section on statutory authority.", "Stakeholder involvement. Agencies we interviewed identified  coordination with nonfederal stakeholders, such as industry groups,  academic experts, and consumer groups, as a facilitator of international  regulatory cooperation. An FDA official said that nonfederal stakeholders  may be uniquely positioned to identify unnecessary differences in  regulations and standards between countries and help agencies prioritize  which differences would be most meaningful to address from their  perspective. For example, FTC officials said that in developing the work  products of the International Competition Network (ICN) a significant  number of business users and nongovernmental advisors bring attention  to issues, provide outside perspectives, help produce work products, and  encourage implementation, even though government agencies are the  members that ultimately accept the work by consensus.", "Some agency officials and nonfederal stakeholders reported challenges  to stakeholder involvement. Regulatory cooperation can be more difficult  to resolve when nonfederal stakeholders have conflicting viewpoints  about regulations. For example, USDA officials said there can be  challenges when consumer advocacy groups and business advocacy  groups have different views that lead to lawsuits to prevent international  regulatory alignment. USDA officials said that the support for a U.S.- Canada pilot project for meat inspection was divided between businesses  that supported it and consumer groups that did not. In addition, one  industry group found that some regulatory agencies were unwilling to  actively engage foreign counterparts and U.S. industries to discuss U.S.  regulatory requirements that are adopted by other countries. A different  industry representative said that a regulatory agency he works with  independently created a division dedicated to international telecom issues  to work with foreign counterparts and developed a modular approval,  which gives industry more flexibility and shortens the time for product  approvals.", "In addition, a consumer advocacy stakeholder said that it would be helpful  to set government-wide policies and definitions through a notice and  comment period. For example, federal agencies do not employ the same  definition of \u201cequivalency,\u201d and it would be helpful if there was a specific  government-wide policy that stated that the result of international  regulatory cooperation cannot lower domestic standards.", "Statutory authority. Agencies we interviewed said that statutory  authority may facilitate or limit their international regulatory cooperation  activities. For example, DOT PHMSA officials said that statutory authority  may mandate agency participation in international standards  organizations. An industry stakeholder said it would facilitate cooperation  if the underlying statutory authorities of agencies clearly permitted them to  engage in trade activities. However, when statutes are prescriptive  regarding domestic or rulemaking requirements, they can limit agencies\u2019  ability to make changes to regulations that align with a foreign trading  partner. For example, agency officials said that statutes mandating use of  specific technologies can remove the flexibility to coordinate with foreign  counterparts. EPA officials also said that, in many instances, the Clean  Air Act requirements may limit the degree to which domestic regulations  can be altered to accommodate or conform to foreign or international  standards or approaches. Statutes that mandate completion of  rulemakings within short time frames can also limit agencies\u2019 ability to  engage in harmonization. For example, CPSC officials said it was  challenging to work with other countries to reach consensus when CPSC  had been mandated by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of  2008 to issue a large number of regulations in a short time frame, which  limited the amount of time they had to work with foreign counterparts.", "Some agency statutes may limit disclosure of company-specific  information with foreign counterparts. This can prevent U.S. agencies  from sharing certain reports and scientific information with trusted foreign  counterpart agencies. In a previous report, we stated that, although the  addition of section 29(f) to the Consumer Product Safety Information Act  was intended to encourage information sharing, CPSC expressed  concern that restrictive language in this section hindered its ability to  share information.first step to scientific and technical exchanges with foreign counterparts is  removing existing legal, regulatory, or policy hurdles that limit or prohibit  data sharing between governments. For example, NHTSA officials we  interviewed said that they have many research, testing, and enforcement  activities that include restrictions on the transfer of information, which has  been a barrier to international regulatory cooperation. They said that  when a company discovered defects in tires in Germany, the information  was not immediately available in the United States to prevent injuries  because of an information-sharing restriction. Agency officials also noted  that, in addition to the removal of U.S. agency information-sharing  restrictions, it is essential that the hurdles that exist in other countries also  be removed.", "An official from EPA OCSPP said that an important  Early and ongoing coordination. Early and ongoing coordination with  foreign governments in emerging areas before regulations are in place  may facilitate international regulatory cooperation. Agency officials we  interviewed said early and ongoing efforts are important to maintain  progress. OMB officials said it is easier to prevent unnecessary  differences than remove existing differences in regulations. For example,  CPSC attends multilateral forecasting sessions with other countries to  engage foreign counterparts before the rulemaking and standards setting  process begins. According to agency officials we interviewed, it is more  efficient for CPSC to align and prevent different regulatory approaches  with other jurisdictions before the U.S. notice and comment rulemaking  process begins. In another example, State officials we interviewed said  there is a need for international regulatory coordination to take place as  early as possible, before too many regulations are established in each  country. They said there are opportunities to avoid unnecessary  differences in regulations for nanotechnology, which can be applied to  many types of products. Currently, there are no entrenched regulatory  systems that would hinder cooperation on developing new standards.  Industry officials also said that it is important to coordinate on  requirements early by reviewing countries\u2019 regulatory differences,  because fundamental differences between countries may require  changes on an issue-by-issue basis. They also urged early coordination  because regulatory agencies in other countries are establishing standards  when the manufacturing process has already been developed in the  United States, which does not work well for them within today\u2019s markets.  One academic representative we interviewed said it is much easier for  agencies to coordinate with trading partners on new regulations than on  existing regulations.", "According to agency officials we spoke with, early and ongoing  coordination with foreign counterparts also can identify issues that are not  ready for international regulatory cooperation. It is important to coordinate  early with their counterparts when there are differences between the  openness of the United States\u2019 and other countries\u2019 rulemaking  processes. Officials noted that, while other countries have the opportunity  to comment whenever a U.S. regulation is proposed, U.S. agencies and  nonfederal stakeholders may not have similar opportunities to comment  on foreign regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With trade expanding and regulatory challenges growing, in recent years  the President and U.S. agencies have undertaken multiple initiatives to  focus attention on the importance of international regulatory cooperation.  While the executive order on promoting international regulatory  cooperation focuses on reducing trade barriers by reducing unnecessary  differences in regulations with U.S. trading partners, we found in our  review that U.S. agencies carry out numerous and diverse international  regulatory cooperation activities to improve the effectiveness of  regulations, gain efficiencies, and avoid duplicating work. The examples  agencies shared with us show that their efforts often achieve both trade  and regulatory efficiency goals. Ultimately it is clear that international  regulatory cooperation requires interagency coordination. No one U.S.  agency has the expertise or processes to effectively conduct these  activities. Not only must regulatory agencies collaborate with other U.S.  agencies, but they need to effectively collaborate with their foreign  counterparts and affected nonfederal stakeholders.", "Overall coordination of international regulatory cooperation activities is  now handled by discrete processes with somewhat different focuses. U.S.  regulatory agencies focus primarily on their missions to protect public  health and safety and the environment, while USTR and Commerce,  among others, focus on trade. Therefore, it is important for the U.S.  government to effectively coordinate these interagency activities. Our  work at agencies engaged in regulatory cooperation efforts shows there  are opportunities to augment existing guidance and mechanisms that  could further promote and improve international regulatory outcomes. For  example, U.S. regulatory agency officials emphasized the benefits of  sharing information on lessons learned and best practices with their  peers. However, they believe the current processes are designed for top- level collaboration and do not sufficiently address the day-to-day  implementation of international regulatory cooperation. U.S. agencies and  nonfederal stakeholders also noted the importance of stakeholder input in  the success of international regulatory cooperation. Yet it is challenging  for stakeholders to stay apprised of agencies\u2019 activities and therefore  provide input to agencies. Key next steps could focus on identifying tools  to measure outcomes as well as to document savings from more efficient  use of government resources.

To address these objectives, we selected seven U.S.  regulatory agencies out of 60 U.S. agencies that are included in the  Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified  Agenda), that issued regulations with international impacts and four U.S.  agencies with government-wide international coordination responsibilities.  Based on several sources we identified likely regulatory agencies that  issue regulations related to international trade. For example, we reviewed  the 2010 and 2011 Unified Agenda and data from the 2011 World Trade  Organization (WTO) Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Information  Management System. We also reviewed all major regulations from 2011.  We categorized the regulations with an international impact into  regulatory subject areas such as product safety, environmental, energy,  transportation of products, food, medical devices, drugs, and aviation.  The reason we categorized the regulations was to select groups of  regulations that affect global trade in products. In addition, we excluded  categories from our scope, such as taxation/taxes, patents, arms trade,  international waters, and trade agreements. We also tested the  databases used in agency selection by reviewing related documentation,  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials, and tracing a sample of  entries to source documents. We concluded the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. We also considered  recommendations from federal agency officials in selecting regulatory  agencies. From these varied efforts, for our review we selected the  Department of Energy (DOE), Food and Drug Administration (FDA),  Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA), and Department of Agriculture (USDA) as well as two  independent regulatory agencies including the Consumer Product Safety  Commission (CPSC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
