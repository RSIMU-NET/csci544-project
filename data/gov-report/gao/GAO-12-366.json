The program is using a $4.4 billion fixed-price incentive (firm target) development contract that provides contractor incentives to control costs and limits the government\u0092s liability for increased costs over a certain amount. While estimated development costs are currently $900 million higher than the February 2011 contract award amount, the government\u0092s share of these extra costs is limited to about $500 million. The program has identified key performance parameters, but has not yet fully implemented the metrics for tracking their achievement.", "There is broad agreement that KC-46 schedule risk is a concern. In GAO\u0092s assessment, significant concurrency, or overlap, among development and production activities add risk to the program. The Air Force and contractor have assessed overall schedule risk as moderate, citing concerns about software and the ability to complete development flight testing on time. Further, the DOD\u0092s chief testing official finds the testing schedule not executable as currently planned. While designing a new tanker using a modified commercial platform is not as technically challenging as a more revolutionary weapon system, the program still faces some technical risks, including technologies that have not yet been demonstrated during flight.", "The KC-46 program\u0092s acquisition strategy provides a good framework for meeting GAO\u0092s knowledge-based best practices, and generally adheres to defense policy guidance and recent acquisition reform legislation. DOD waived the requirement for a preliminary design review before the program began system development and demonstration, but this design review is planned for March 2012. Although the program\u0092s three critical technologies have not yet achieved the level of maturity indicated in best practices, they have reached a level of maturity consistent with DOD policy.

Originally fielded in the 1950s, KC-135 aircraft are considered the  mainstay of the tanker fleet, supporting combat air assets, deployment of  airlift aircraft, and nuclear combat refueling missions. With an average  age of nearly 51 years and more than 16,000 flight hours on each aircraft,  the KC-135s will approach over 80 years of age when the fleet is retired  as projected in the 2040 time frame. In 1981, the Air Force began  supplementing its fleet of KC-135s with the procurement of 60 KC-10s (of  which 59 remain in service today), multi-role aircraft that transport air  cargo and provide refueling. Much larger than the KC-135, the KC-10  provides both boom and hose and drogue refueling capabilities on the  same flight and can conduct transoceanic missions. The KC-10s now  average about 27 years of age with more than 26,000 flight hours on  each, and their service life is expected to end around 2045. The Air Force  has upgraded and modified both fleets in recent years, providing  improved avionics and new engines on the KC-135 along with newer  communication systems to comply with international and federal air traffic  requirements.", "In 1996, GAO reported that the aging KC-135s would eventually need to  be replaced. We recommended that DOD consider looking at dual-use  aircraft\u2014which could be used as a tanker or a cargo carrier, depending  on their missions. In 2001, the Air Force reported that the KC-135 fleet  would incur much greater operations and maintenance (O&M) costs  between 2001 and 2040, but that it would be structurally sound to 2040.", "Air Force officials stated in 2005 that engine strut fatigue caused by long- term heat exposure and corrosion posed the greatest threat to the KC- 135 fleet and O&M costs were increasing. These costs, nearly $2 billion  in fiscal year 2010, are expected to grow to $6 billion per year by fiscal  year 2018. The 2012 Air Mobility Master Plan also expresses concerns  that advanced adversary threats pose greater risk to the current tanker  fleet and that the KC-135 fleet lacks defensive capabilities required to  operate and succeed against either current or future threats."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tanker Replacement History", "paragraphs": ["Plans to begin replacing the KC-135 fleet were first developed in 2001  with Congress authorizing a pilot program to lease 100 Boeing 767  aircraft modified for aerial refueling, subsequently called the KC-767A  aircraft.

Boeing, the competing bidder, filed a protest with the Government  Accountability Office (GAO) protesting the Air Force\u2019s decision. In June  2008, GAO determined that the Air Force had made significant errors,  including not assessing the relative merits of the proposals in accordance  with the evaluation rules and criteria set out in the RFP, which could have  affected the outcome of the competition. As a result, the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed the Air Force in September 2008 to  terminate the contract and conduct a new competition.", "On February 24, 2010, the Air Force released a significantly revised KC-X  RFP.

The  development portion of the contract to design and build 4 test aircraft, and  then bring those aircraft to a final production configuration, is valued at  $4.4 billion. The Air Force plans to exercise two contract options for 19  initial production aircraft that are required, in part, for the contractor to  meet the requirement to produce and deliver 18 aircraft by 2017.  Additional contract options can be exercised to allow for production of the  remaining 156 aircraft through year 2027 at a target rate of 15 aircraft per  year.

The specific contract  arrangement used by the KC-46 program is a fixed-price incentive (firm  target) (FPIF) contract. Table 3 provides development contract details  and the current contract and government estimates to complete  development.", "The contract is designed to provide a profit incentive for the contractor to  control or even reduce costs. It specifies target cost, target price, and  ceiling price amounts, with the latter being the maximum amount that may  be paid to the contractor. The target price is $4.4 billion and the ceiling  price $4.9 billion. The contract specifies a 60/40 incentive ratio for sharing  savings in the event of underruns, or sharing cost in the event of  overruns. The government\u2019s share is 60 percent while Boeing\u2019s is 40  percent. Cost sharing ends when the contract price reaches the $4.9  billion ceiling. Thereafter, provided the Air Force is not responsible for any  of the additional costs associated with the overruns, the contractor would  be responsible for all additional costs associated with the overruns and  would be obligated to perform the contract. If the Air Force is responsible  for any of the cost overruns, they may have to renegotiate the terms and  conditions of the contract with Boeing. The KC-46 program\u2019s current  government estimate to complete development is $5.3 billion, which is  about $900 million more than the contract target price and about $400  million more than the ceiling price. The Air Force believes this additional  $400 million may be necessary to cover schedule risk for the remainder of  development, and if it is, Boeing must pay these costs.", "According to program officials, a change in system requirements,  although unlikely, would be a circumstance that could increase the Air  Force\u2019s exposure to additional costs. As stated in a memorandum from  the OSD Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, the  biggest risk to the KC-46 program is the Department\u2019s ability to minimize  changes to the contract. The memorandum maintains that on the whole,  DOD has demonstrated limited ability to maintain stable requirements and  limit changes to program technical baselines on previous complex  weapon system programs, and that minimizing such change is essential  to the success of the KC-46. In view of these concerns, program officials  state it is very unlikely any requirements will be changed, and to help  ensure this, they have instituted a process to control changes.  Specifically, any engineering or contract changes affecting system  requirements or having the potential to impact program cost, schedule,  and performance baselines must be approved by the Air Force Service  Acquisition Executive in consultation with the Secretary and the Chief of  Staff of the Air Force. Moreover, the contract contains options for the 175  production aircraft, establishing firm, fixed pricing for two initial production  lots and not-to-exceed pricing for subsequent full-rate production lots.  Program officials maintain that this pricing will likely stay intact as long as  the contract is not opened to negotiate modifications.", "The KC-46 contract is one of only a few major weapon system programs  in recent years to employ a fixed-price development contract. In the past,  DOD has typically used cost-reimbursement contracts in which the  government pays all allowable incurred costs to the extent prescribed by  the contract. Legislation and defense policy now directs the Milestone  Decision Authority for a major defense acquisition program to select the  contract type for a development program at the time of a decision on  Milestone B that is consistent with the level of program risk for the  program. The Milestone Decision Authority may select either a fixed-price  type contract (including a fixed-price incentive contract); or a cost type  contract. The use of fixed-price contracts, when warranted, limits the  government\u2019s exposure to weapon system cost increases. Defense  officials believe that a fixed-price development contract is appropriate for  this program because KC-46 development is considered to be a relatively  low risk effort to integrate mature military technologies onto a well-defined  commercial derivative aircraft.", "In addition to the type of contract used, there are also provisions in the  KC-46 development contract that further limit the government\u2019s liability  and are intended to help manage performance risk. For example, Boeing  has to correct any deficiencies in the KC-46 discovered during the  development program. The correction of deficiencies shall be  accomplished on the four development test aircraft and all production  aircraft, as appropriate, to bring them to the final configuration at no  additional cost to the government. In addition, there is a special contract  provision that requires each aircraft to demonstrate a certain fuel usage  rate before the government accepts the aircraft. If any aircraft burn fuel  above this rate, Boeing is required to propose a corrective action at no  cost to the government. Boeing is not allowed to propose a relaxation of  contract requirements to resolve any fuel usage issues, but if Boeing  cannot meet the required usage rates, there are contract provisions  allowing for a decrease in the amount paid to Boeing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Performance Goals Have Been Identified but Metrics for Measuring Achievement Are Not Yet Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has identified nine specific KPPs critical to enabling the  KC-46 to meet its primary mission of providing worldwide, day and night,  adverse weather aerial refueling.

For example, in 2005 only 8 KC- 135 aircraft (1.5 percent) had the capability to receive fuel from another  aerial refueling tanker while airborne. This limited capability can prohibit  the extension of aircraft forces and can result in inefficient use of assets.

Funding commitments will be required even sooner; DOD  will present the budget request for KC-46 initial production to Congress in  February 2014.", "The intent of development flight testing is to demonstrate the maturity of  the design and to discover and fix design and performance problems  while the aircraft is being developed. Beginning production before testing  has successfully demonstrated that the design is mature and that aircraft  will work as intended increases the likelihood of discovering deficiencies  during production, when it is most expensive to correct them. Similarly,  systems already built and fielded may require substantial modifications,  resulting in additional program costs.", "The Air Force and Boeing are both concerned about the risks in the KC- 46 development and test schedule. In August 2011, a joint Boeing and Air  Force team completed a detailed review to identify risk associated with  the program\u2019s technology, cost, and schedule. As a result of that review,  the Air Force determined that the schedule, culminating with the delivery  of 18 aircraft by August 2017, contained moderate risk. Other major  areas examined during this review were assessed as low risk.", "According to the KC-46 program office, schedule risk stems from four  primary factors:", "Flight testing. Completing the flight test program on time will require  efficient, synchronized use of DOD, Air Force, and Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) test facilities and resources. The KC-46 program  office is concerned that Boeing will not be able to achieve planned  flight test flying hour rates for military certifications and military testing,  currently set at 50 hours per aircraft per month, given the amount of  coordination and synchronization of test resources required. Boeing is  also continuing to evaluate plans for the flight test program due to  concerns it may contribute to program schedule risk. For these and  other reasons, DOD\u2019s Office of the Director, Operational Test and  Evaluation, has determined that the development test program is not  executable as planned.  In-line provisioning. Boeing typically uses one facility as its  commercial aircraft production line and another to install military  modifications on commercial aircraft. However, on the KC-46  program, Boeing will do extra preparatory work\u2014provisioning\u2014at its  commercial facility to accommodate the military modifications planned  at its other facility. This represents an additional requirement to  prepare the aircraft for military modifications while still on the  commercial production line. According to the program office, this  increases the level of risk for accomplishing the work on time.", "Federal Aviation Administration certification. According to the  program office, two FAA certifications, one for the commercial 767-2C  aircraft and a supplemental one for the military modifications planned  for the commercial aircraft, are required for the KC-46 before it is  deemed airworthy. Boeing intends to accomplish a portion of both of  these certifications concurrently, rather than one at a time, which is  more typical. According to the program office, if problems arise during  this concurrency, not much time will be left in the schedule for Boeing  to recover.", "Software. The program office told us that modifications to commercial  software to separate classified from unclassified information and  enable other military capabilities will increase risk associated with  software development. However, they also stated that they are  focusing on software early in the program to ensure Boeing puts the  proper emphasis on this area and keeps the program schedule on  track.", "Boeing has also identified risks in the program\u2019s software development  effort that could delay the program\u2019s schedule or drive increased cost if  realized. Software development growth can occur because of bad  estimates, poor requirements, and poor execution of the software  development plan. If the amount of software being developed grows,  more staff and more time will be needed. There can also be delays in the  integration of hardware and software if software deliveries from suppliers  are late. Late delivery can result in hardware and software not being  integrated in time to support flight testing, which in turn can mean flight  test schedule delays.", "A further complication to the KC-46 schedule was Boeing\u2019s January 2012  announcement that it was closing its Wichita, Kansas finishing facility at  the end of 2013. When the contract was awarded, Boeing had planned to  militarize the KC-46 at the Wichita facility. Now, that work will be moving  to the Puget Sound facility in Seattle, Washington to be co-located with  the 767-2C development effort. KC-46 program officials stated that they  are working closely with Boeing to understand the impact of this decision  on the KC-46 program but will hold Boeing to its contractual delivery date  of August 2017.", "If the provisions in the current contract remain intact, the government\u2019s  cost liability will be safeguarded should any of the foregoing risks  materialize into problems.

We have  previously reported that holding a preliminary design review prior to  development start can help ensure requirements are well-defined and  feasible. Nonetheless, the program did complete its system functional  review in November 2011 and made no significant changes to program  requirements.

Because senior defense officials are encouraging acquisition programs  across the department to adopt similar arrangements, when appropriate,  it will be both illustrative for the policy and important for future programs  to monitor the KC-46\u2019s progress and its degree of success. Some would  argue that a degree of program success has already been demonstrated  because the government\u2019s cost liability, assuming no system  requirements changes, has been capped and the contractor is still  required to provide full performance of the contract. However, even with  these safeguards, it is important to note that 1 year into development, Air  Force and contractor development cost estimates exceed the  development contract amount and significant schedule risks have been  identified. Although the KC-46 program is still in its early stages, similar  cost and schedule pressures have dogged many past and present  defense acquisition programs. With 5 years of development remaining on  an aggressive schedule with substantial concurrency among  development, test, and production activities, prudence and strong  management attention is warranted. Should costs continue to increase, or  schedule or performance measurement lag, there could be increased  pressure to reopen or renegotiate aspects of the contract.
