Twenty-eight directives addressed threats (e.g., explosives in laptops) and 18 pertained to vulnerabilities identified at foreign airports (e.g., inadequate perimeter fencing).", "TSA reviews directives, but its process does not fully define how to coordinate with industry representatives and TSA has not incorporated the security measures of many longstanding directives into air carrier security programs in accordance with TSA policy. Representatives from four domestic air carriers stated that coordination with TSA on directives has improved. However, representatives from six air carriers and two associations indicated that TSA has issued revised directives that are vague or difficult to implement\u2014which, for example, contributed to TSA officials offering different interpretations of aircraft cabin search requirements\u2014because TSA did not sufficiently include them in the review process. Better defining how TSA coordinates with air carriers and other stakeholders would help ensure that TSA issues directives that enable air carriers to effectively secure their operations against the identified threats or vulnerabilities. In addition, when TSA officials have coordinated with air carriers, they have not documented the input provided. Documenting the input could help ensure that TSA is consistently addressing air carrier concerns and retaining knowledge about who, what, when, where, and why coordination occurred.", "Further, TSA policy states that directives are not intended to be permanent and are expected to eventually be canceled or incorporated into security programs. GAO analysis found that TSA issued more than one half (25) of the directives prior to 2014, meaning they have been in effect for more than 5 years. Several have been in effect for more than 10 years (see figure).", "As of July 2019, TSA officials had begun the process to migrate directives into security programs as deemed appropriate, but had not yet finalized their plans for doing so.

We  summarized information about these directives, including their topic and  applicable locations. We discussed the results of our analysis with TSA  officials.", "To assess TSA\u2019s review process, we reviewed TSA\u2019s management  directive regarding policy issuance and the associated standard operating  procedures to determine how TSA is to coordinate across offices and with  external stakeholders when updating or canceling directives. In addition,  we analyzed TSA internal documentation (e.g., memos and emails) from  January 2017 to March 2019 on how TSA implemented its management  directive and standard operating procedures. Further, we reviewed letters  TSA provided to Congress describing the extent of its consultation with  and notification to trade association representatives, air carriers, and relevant federal agencies prior to making changes to security standards  via directives for air carrier operations at last point of departure airports  since October 2018, when Congress first required such reporting.

We conducted this  analysis to determine the extent to which TSA has updated (including  renewing or consolidating) directives, canceled them, or allowed them to  expire. We also interviewed TSA headquarters and field officials to  determine whether TSA\u2019s practices align with its documented policies and  procedures. Specifically, we met with (1) TSA headquarters offices,  including Policy, Plans, and Engagement; Global Operations; and  Intelligence and Analysis; (2) selected TSA international industry  representatives\u2014TSA\u2019s principal liaisons with air carriers; (3) selected  TSA representatives\u2014TSA\u2019s principal liaisons with foreign government  transportation security experts; and (4) TSA\u2019s liaison to the Department of  State.

Air carriers are responsible for  implementing TSA security requirements predominantly through TSA- approved security programs. These requirements for air carriers include,  among other things, measures related to the screening of passengers,  baggage, and cargo; training of employees in security and screening  procedures; testing employee proficiency in screening; and access to  aircraft. In addition, TSA may impose additional requirements in the form  of security directives or emergency amendments when more immediate  action on behalf of air carriers is necessary. Whereas security programs  include standing regulatory requirements, directives are not intended to  be permanent in nature and are expected to eventually be canceled, for  example, should the threat or vulnerability cease to exist. If TSA  determines that safety and the public interest require the incorporation of  measures from directives into security programs, TSA will amend the  programs after providing affected air carriers with notice and an  opportunity for comment. TSA may impose directives based on the  following:  Threat information. Directives may focus on addressing specific threats.  For example, in June 2017, TSA announced new security requirements in  a directive on international aviation security that included, among other  requirements, heightened screening of personal electronic devices larger  than a cellphone for air carriers operating last point of departure flights to  the United States. The directive was based on intelligence that terrorists  were attempting to smuggle explosive devices in various consumer items  (e.g., laptops).", "Events. Terrorist attacks, both successful and foiled, can also lead to the  issuance of directives. For example, in response to a terrorist plot in July  2017, TSA issued security directives and emergency amendments in  September 2017 requiring air carriers transporting cargo to the United  States from last point of departure airports in Turkey to submit advance  cargo data to DHS.", "Results of foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections.  TSA may issue directives requiring air carriers to implement security  measures to account for vulnerabilities at foreign airports identified during  TSA assessments (e.g., inadequate perimeter fencing). Through its  foreign airport assessment program, TSA determines whether foreign  airports that provide service to the United States maintain and carry out  effective security measures. TSA does not have authority to impose or otherwise enforce security requirements at foreign airports and, therefore,  often seeks to address security vulnerabilities it identifies by working with  domestic and foreign air carriers to implement security measures to  mitigate any identified vulnerabilities, as appropriate, while also working  with the foreign governments to address the vulnerabilities. Measures  required by directives to mitigate vulnerabilities identified during foreign  airport assessments include screening passengers at the boarding gate  and posting guards around parked aircraft.", "Air carriers must implement the security measures set forth in applicable  directives in addition to other requirements imposed and enforced by TSA  to remain compliant with TSA security requirements. However, TSA may  approve the use of an alternative measure used in place of an existing  measure required by a directive if TSA determines the alternative  measure will achieve the required level of security. For example, an air  carrier may request to use a different screening technology than specified  in a directive, which TSA could approve if it determines the security  outcome is commensurate, according to TSA officials. To ensure that air  carriers meet applicable security requirements, including those imposed  through directives, TSA conducts inspections of domestic and foreign air  carriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Directives Most Often Apply to Passenger Air Carrier Operations in Specific Foreign Locations, and Over Half Were Issued Prior to 2014", "paragraphs": ["As of March 2019, there were 46 TSA directives related to air carrier  operations at last point of departure airports in effect.

Our analysis also shows that all directives with 3-year durations  pertain to cargo-related threats, which TSA officials said are unlikely  to change in the near term.

Key  steps of this process include the following:  Initiate review process and create team. TSA initiates the directive  review process because of (1) new intelligence, (2) feedback received  from air carriers, (3) new information received from foreign airport  assessments or air carrier inspections, or about 90 days before a  directive is to expire, according to TSA officials. After initiation, TSA\u2019s  standard operating procedures state that all TSA offices that have equity  in the security policy subject matter are to be invited to participate in the  directive review team. TSA may also include other DHS components or  government agencies in the team. According to our review of TSA  documentation, in all 43 reviews TSA created an interoffice team that  included Policy, Plans, and Engagement; Global Operations; and Chief  Counsel. Our analysis also shows that at least 28 reviews included TSA  Intelligence and Analysis. Further, certain teams reviewing vulnerability- driven directives included TSA field staff, such as TSA international  industry representatives, TSA representatives, and regional operations  center managers who have responsibility for the overall planning and  conduct of assessments and air carrier inspections at foreign airports. In  addition, according to TSA officials and corroborated by TSA  documentation, they coordinated as needed with other federal partners\u2014 including DHS, the State Department, where TSA has a liaison  embedded, and the National Security Council.", "Develop problem statement and options. To understand the  environment and the nature of the threat, the team is to request a threat  summary from TSA Intelligence and Analysis and, based on the  intelligence summary, prepare a problem statement outlining the threat  and vulnerability. The team is also to develop a proposed solution to the  problem statement, and the team may decide to propose to either update  or cancel the directive through an action memo written for TSA  leadership. TSA officials stated that criteria for updating and canceling  directives include whether the threat or vulnerability remains, intelligence,  feedback from air carriers, and the results of air carrier inspections and  airport assessments. Updates can result in a renewal of the policy with no  significant changes or a revision to the security measures. All reviews  developed a problem statement and documented proposed solutions in  action memos that also included draft updates to the directives, as  applicable.

If the team does not  decide to cancel a directive, the completed drafts are to be routed to TSA  offices for review and then to the administrator or assistant administrator  for final approval. After final approval, TSA is to post worldwide  directives to DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Information Network. However, if  the directive is country or region-specific TSA officials stated that they  post an announcement on the network that the affected air carriers should  contact their TSA international industry representatives for more  information. According to our file review, TSA documented interoffice  approval to the updates or cancellations for at least 41 of the 43  reviews.

However, the standard  operating procedures do not explain what \u201cas appropriate\u201d means. Figure  3 shows a TSA international industry representative briefing foreign air  carrier representatives on the 2017 international aviation security  emergency amendment. TSA is also to incorporate key stakeholder input  into the final draft as appropriate. TSA officials stated that they generally  obtain mostly informal feedback from domestic air carriers and their  associations during quarterly meetings with industry or through air  carriers\u2019 regular coordination with TSA international industry  representatives.", "However, TSA officials stated that the extent to which they include air  carriers and aviation associations in the review process varies. For  example, TSA officials may share drafts of the directives with the air  carriers for feedback or decide to only discuss the content of the directive  at a high level, depending on the threat or vulnerability, air carriers  involved, whether the changes needed are time-sensitive, and countries  involved. While TSA\u2019s standard operating procedures state that TSA is to  coordinate with air carriers and other industry stakeholders, the feasibility  of doing so when issuing or updating directives (particularly when the time  frame is short and security measures must reach the industry rapidly due  to a specific threat or recent event) is limited, according to TSA officials.  These officials noted that engagement is more likely to take place when a  directive is up for renewal or is being updated.", "Representatives from domestic air carriers confirmed that TSA has  coordinated with them but also told us that the coordination has been  inconsistent. Officials from four of the five domestic air carriers (three  passenger and one all-cargo air carrier) and two associations  representing domestic air carriers we met with told us that coordination  with TSA on directives has improved since 2017. The air carrier  representatives also stated that coordination with their TSA international  industry representatives on directives was helpful. For example, all three  domestic passenger air carriers we met with stated that TSA international  industry representatives coordinated closely with them during the multiple  revisions of the 2017 directive pertaining to international aviation security  and that TSA made changes based on the feedback or approved  alternative security measures they requested.", "However, representatives from both passenger and all-cargo domestic air  carriers and an association that represents them identified ways that TSA  coordination has been inconsistent when reviewing directives. For  example, representatives from one of these air carriers stated that TSA  sometimes coordinates with them when revising directives but generally  seeks feedback from the same one or two air carriers that fly globally or  operate out of the most last point of departure airports and does not  always coordinate with air carriers that do not have a large global  operation. In addition, a representative from another air carrier told us that  TSA only coordinated with them after they insisted on being included in  the process to revise a security directive; TSA did not proactively seek  their input. Similarly, representatives from an association told us that TSA  did not coordinate with them on the 2018 revision of a security directive  issued to increase security requirements applied to cargo shipments  originating in, transiting through, or transferring from Egypt until the  association first reached out and that the process was not fully  transparent. Although TSA verbally shared anticipated changes,  representatives from the association were not clear what the new  language would say or what it meant.", "While TSA sometimes includes domestic air carriers in the directive  review process, foreign air carriers are generally not included, according  to their representatives. Representatives from four of the five foreign air  carriers we met with told us that they have a productive relationship with  their TSA international industry representative and that TSA has made  changes to emergency amendments based on alternative security  measures they have requested. However, representatives from all five  foreign air carriers noted that TSA generally does not solicit their input  when reviewing emergency amendments. Representatives from the  association that represents foreign air carriers told us that TSA\u2019s  coordination is sporadic; sometimes TSA would coordinate with industry  when revising directives, and other times TSA would not\u2014even though  such coordination was necessary, in their view. For example, the  representatives from this association stated that TSA has not consistently  provided them with draft directives to review prior to issuance. These  officials also stated that TSA coordination usually comes after they  request being included in the process. All three international industry  representative groups responsible for coordinating with foreign air carriers  confirmed that TSA generally does not include their air carriers or the  association that represents them when revising emergency amendments.  Instead of coordinating with TSA, foreign air carriers may provide their  input to domestic code-share partners, according to one TSA international  industry group and representatives from a domestic air carrier.", "Representatives from both domestic and foreign air carriers and their  associations identified negative effects of inconsistent coordination with  TSA during the directive review process and stated that improved  coordination would lead to more efficient and effective security measures.  For example, according to representatives from six air carriers and two  associations we met with, TSA did not include them at all or early enough  in the directive review process. These carriers and associations identified  a number of issues with the revised directives because of this lack of  coordination, such as directives that were vague, less effective, or difficult  for carriers to implement. For example, representatives from an  association and one air carrier noted that cargo directives are not always  effective because they do not fully account for how cargo moves around  the world (e.g., shippers may transport cargo by truck from one country to  another before loading it onto a U.S.-bound aircraft to avoid security  measures specific to certain foreign airports). Representatives from two  air carriers provided an example of vague requirements in directives  related to aircraft cabin search procedures that has led to TSA  international industry representatives and inspectors offering different  interpretations of the same requirement. As a result, representatives of  the air carriers said they do not know how to implement, and have at  times been found in violation of, the requirement.", "In addition, according to representatives from one foreign air carrier, had  TSA included them and other foreign air carriers early on in the review  process, the changes to the 2017 emergency amendment pertaining to  international aviation security measures would have been more efficient  and effective. For example, within 3 months of issuance, TSA revised the  directive twice to, among other things, change screening requirements for  personal electronic devices (e.g., allowing for alternative screening  methods). According to representatives from this air carrier, TSA could  have reduced or eliminated the need for such revisions had TSA officials  better coordinated with air carriers. Moreover, representatives from one  association stated that when TSA does not involve them or the air carriers  in the directive review process, TSA is missing an opportunity to  implement the most effective security measures and may actually  inadvertently create security vulnerabilities.", "TSA\u2019s 2018 Administrator\u2019s Intent states that TSA is to coordinate with  external customers early and often for diverse perspectives and to  develop trusted relationships to grow opportunities for mission success.  Moreover, the Administrator\u2019s Intent has a goal to effectively secure and  safeguard the transportation system through contributions from a diverse  and interconnected community of stakeholders, which includes actively  seeking stakeholder input. The goal further states that coordinating with  industry and other partners will enable timely and well-informed decisions  and increase security effectiveness. In addition, TSA\u2019s Standard  Operating Procedures for Security Policy Development, Coordination, and  Issuance requires TSA officials to obtain input from key stakeholders and  representatives of affected regulated parties (e.g., air carriers), when  developing the problem statement, developing options, and drafting the  directive (as appropriate), as discussed above. TSA is also to  incorporate key stakeholder input into the final draft as appropriate.", "TSA officials identified several reasons why coordination with air carriers  and their association may be inconsistent. For example, TSA does not  have guidelines that are specific as to how it is to coordinate with air  carriers and their associations, and coordination can be difficult to define.  In addition, the level of coordination with industry stakeholders is to some  extent driven by the discretion of TSA administrators and assistant  administrators. As the personnel in these positions change, so too does  the level of expected coordination with industry. According to TSA  officials, they cannot write specific requirements for each of the over 200  air carriers with U.S.-bound operations and necessarily must choose  which air carriers to seek input from. In addition, TSA officials noted that  they coordinate with one or two domestic air carriers that chair the  security committee within the association that represents both passenger  and all-cargo air carriers. Further, TSA officials may decide not to share  much information at all with air carriers owned and operated by certain  foreign governments because of potential security concerns.", "Although TSA\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures for Security Policy  Development, Coordination, and Issuance require TSA officials to obtain  input from air carriers and key stakeholders, the current procedures do  not provide clear guidance on the circumstances under which  coordination should occur. Better defining (e.g., develop guiding  principles) how to coordinate with air carriers and other stakeholders  during the review of directives and implementing such guidance would  help TSA ensure that it more consistently coordinates with air carriers  over time, addresses air carriers concerns, and issues directives that  enable air carriers to effectively secure their operations against the  identified threats or vulnerabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Does Not Document Input Provided by Air Carriers during Its Directive Review Process", "paragraphs": ["When TSA officials have coordinated with domestic and foreign air  carriers, they have not documented the input air carriers provided. Based  on our review of the 43 directive reviews TSA conducted from 2017 to  March 2019, TSA officials did not document the input they have received  from air carriers. TSA did provide us with emails and appointments with  associations and air carriers to obtain their input during revisions to the  2017 directives pertaining to international aviation security, but this  documentation did not capture a summary of the discussions or  stakeholder concerns.", "TSA\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures for Security Policy Development,  Coordination, and Issuance requires that stakeholder and regulated party  input be documented and include the entity consulted, date, location, and  a brief summary of the discussion and specific stakeholder input, to  include any concerns. In addition, Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government states that effective documentation assists in  management\u2019s design of internal control by establishing and  communicating who, what, when, where, and why of internal control  execution to personnel. Documentation also provides a means to retain  organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge  limited to a few personnel, as well as a means to communicate that  knowledge as needed to external parties, such as external auditors.", "According to TSA headquarters officials, TSA does not document its  coordination with air carriers and their associations because the feedback  that it solicits and receives from air carriers and associations is mostly  informal. TSA officials stated that for the 2017 directives pertaining to  international aviation security, for example, they had to adjudicate many  requests through dialogue with air carriers and their associations but the  discussions were not documented, as it would have been too  burdensome. However, TSA officials stated that most directives do not  have the broad scope or apply to as many air carriers as the 2017  directive pertaining to international aviation security. Documenting the  input provided by air carriers during the directive review process, even if  the input is deemed informal, would better ensure that TSA provides  insight on shared air carrier views or concerns, and retains knowledge  about who, what, when, where, and why coordination occurred.

When this  occurs, TSA initiates the directive review process and the directive will be  canceled simultaneously with the security program change taking effect,  according to TSA officials. TSA officials stated that they follow a similar  process when they cancel a directive and include that directive\u2019s security  measures in a new directive. As a result, there is no lapse in security  measure requirements.", "Although TSA has canceled some directives, others are longstanding.  According to TSA officials, they have incorporated threat-based directives  into air carrier security programs but not foreign airport vulnerability- based directives because the latter are site-specific and would not apply  to all air carriers. However, as shown in figure 5, more than half (25 of  46) of directives related to last point of departure airports have been in  effect for more than 5 years, and about one quarter (12) were threat- based. According to TSA officials, the threat pertaining to these directives  still exists.", "Further, certain security measures predate the issuance of the directives  that remain in effect. As shown in figure 4, the security measures within  one-third (12) of the canceled directives were incorporated into new  directives. According to TSA officials, there are security measures in  certain directives that predate the creation of TSA in 2001.", "Representatives of the air carriers and associations we met with identified  directives that have, in their view, persisted for too long, which can create  redundant and confusing security requirements. Specifically, half of the  air carrier representatives we met with told us that some directive  requirements conflict with requirements in the air carriers\u2019 security  programs, are redundant, or could be incorporated into the security  programs. According to representatives from one air carrier, without an  exit strategy or plan to help TSA determine when it can cancel directives,  the directives may be in effect beyond their useful time frame and are in  some instances outdated or redundant. For example, representatives  from this air carrier stated that directives require air carriers to identify  baggage in a manner to thwart an attack in which passengers check their  baggage with explosives in it but do not board the plane. However, given  advancements in screening technology, such security measures are no  longer required, according to these representatives. In addition,  according to representatives from another air carrier, there are often  conflicts between the directives and the security programs, which may  cause confusion and sometimes misinterpretation of security  requirements. Further, representatives from a third air carrier and one  association also told us that there is value in incorporating directives into  air carrier security programs because it removes the uncertainty involved,  and air carriers can better plan for security requirements.", "TSA headquarters and field officials told us that there are directives that  can be incorporated into air carrier security programs. For example, TSA  headquarters officials stated that they have identified several such  directives, including a 2012 emergency amendment and a 2017 security directive and  emergency amendment related to passenger international aviation  security; a 2014 security directive regarding the handling of items containing  liquids, aerosols, and gels (e.g., personal hygiene products) brought  into the aircraft cabin by passengers; and  security directives and emergency amendments pertaining to cargo  from certain Middle Eastern and African countries.", "Further, three groups of TSA international industry representatives told us  that TSA should incorporate certain directives into security programs.  Further, they stated that certain directives overlap, have outdated  requirements, or contradict each other. For example, they highlighted  overlap between requirements found in the 2012 emergency amendment  and 2017 emergency amendments related to passenger international  aviation security, as well as the air carriers\u2019 security programs. Both  emergency amendments have security requirements pertaining to  passenger screening, aircraft security, and catering. According to one  group of international industry representatives, there is confusion among  themselves and air carriers over which emergency amendment  supersedes the other.", "Although TSA officials have identified directives that they may be able to  cancel by incorporating them into security programs, TSA does not have  a defined process for doing so. TSA\u2019s standard operating procedures  provide step-by-step guidance for issuing new or revised security  requirements through the directive review process, but it does not provide  similar guidance for incorporating directives into security programs.", "Specifically, TSA officials have not resolved how they will accomplish key  steps in incorporating certain long-standing directives into the security  programs. For example, TSA officials stated that they are considering  incorporating a 2011 security directive and emergency amendment  pertaining to security measures for cargo from Yemen. However, TSA  officials are unclear how they might request comments from air carriers  because not all air carriers transport cargo from that country.", "Further, TSA officials stated that they have not determined whether or  how they might incorporate vulnerability-driven directives into security  programs. In addition, according to TSA officials, TSA\u2019s reorganizations,  personnel changes, and limited staff availability have delayed efforts to  incorporate longstanding directives into security programs. TSA officials  stated they have been attempting to incorporate the 2012 international  aviation security emergency amendment into the security programs for  foreign air carriers for the past 10 years. Specifically, in 2012 TSA  consolidated over 20 worldwide threat-based emergency amendments  issued from 2001 to 2012 into one emergency amendment covering a  number of different types of security measures with the plan to next  incorporate it into the security program, according to TSA officials.  However, since that time, TSA has renewed the emergency amendment  13 times, each time with a new expiration date. TSA officials stated that it  is easier to renew directives to ensure that the security measures remain  in place than to incorporate them into security programs.", "Despite these challenges, TSA officials stated that they are mapping out  how to incorporate certain directives into air carrier security programs.  Further, they may be able to develop the changes to the programs and  draft action memos for the TSA Administrator to approve by the end of  2019, according to these officials. As of July 2019, TSA officials had  identified the directives it first planned to migrate into security programs  and begun the process. However, these officials had not yet finalized  plans for doing so.", "TSA Management Directive 2100.5 provides high-level TSA policy for the  development, external coordination, and issuance of security programs  and directives. It states that during the creation of all directives (i.e.,  security directives and emergency amendments), a sunset date will be  assigned. This date is to serve as the date where a decision will be made  by the agency to either cancel the directive or convert it into a security  program change. Factors for this decision will include a comprehensive  intelligence review, assessment of risk-based relevance, and operator  performance and compliance. According to the management directive,  this lifecycle analysis will ensure that directives are not permanent in  nature and that the security program change process is routinely used as  the vehicle for long-term regulatory requirements. However, the  management directive does not preclude continuation of a directive, and  TSA may decide to renew the directive, as appropriate.", "Further, according to the standard operating procedures associated with  this management directive, the goal of the policy development process is  to enhance TSA\u2019s ability to make sound and timely policy decisions. In  addition, Standards of Internal Control in the Federal Government states  that management should define objectives clearly to enable the  identification of risks and define risk tolerances. This involves clearly  defining what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be  achieved, and the time frames for achievement.", "By defining the process for cancelling or incorporating directives into  security programs, including expected time frames, and taking actions to  implement this process, as applicable, TSA could better ensure that it  clarifies and streamlines the security requirements for air carriers that  operate at last point of departure airports in a timely manner and in a way  that uses limited resources efficiently. Further, taking these steps would  help ensure that requirements in directives that should become  permanent are incorporated into security programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given that terrorist groups continue to target international aviation, it is  paramount that TSA effectively update and issue security directives and  emergency amendments in response to threats. For the approximately  300 airports in foreign countries offering last point of departure flights to  the United States, TSA may issue directives when immediate action on  behalf of air carriers is necessary and has developed a review process for  these directives, but it has not defined the circumstances under which  TSA is to coordinate with air carriers and other industry stakeholders  throughout the process. Better defining (e.g., develop guiding principles)  how TSA is to coordinate with air carriers and implementing such  guidance would help TSA ensure that it more consistently coordinates  with air carriers over time, air carriers concerns are addressed, and it  issues directives that enable air carriers to effectively secure their  operations against the identified threats or vulnerabilities. In addition,  documenting the input provided by air carriers during the directive review  process would help TSA better ensure that it captures stakeholder views  or concerns and retains knowledge about who, what, when, where, and  why coordination occurred. TSA would also be able to reference  documented information for decision-making purposes, which could help  ensure that TSA is consistently coordinating with air carriers during the  review of directives and addressing their concerns. Further, TSA has not  always canceled longstanding directives or incorporated them into air  carrier security programs. However, according to TSA Management  Directive 2100.5, directives are not meant to be permanent. Recognizing  that threat-driven exigent circumstances may preclude consultation,  better defining the process for cancelling or incorporating directives into  security programs, including expected time frames, and taking actions to  implement this process, as applicable, could better ensure that TSA  clarifies and streamlines the security requirements for air carriers that  operate at last point of departure airports in a timely manner and in a way  that uses limited resources efficiently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following three recommendations to TSA:  The Administrator of TSA should ensure that the Assistant Administrator  for Policy, Plans, and Engagement and the Assistant Administrator for  Global Operations better define (e.g., develop guiding principles) how  TSA is to coordinate with air carriers and other stakeholders during the  review of security directives and emergency amendments, and implement  such guidance (Recommendation 1).", "The Administrator of TSA should ensure input provided by air carriers and  other stakeholders is documented during the security directive and  emergency amendment review process (Recommendation 2).", "The Administrator of TSA should ensure that the Assistant Administrator  for Policy, Plans, and Engagement defines a process for cancelling or  incorporating security directives and emergency amendments into  security programs, including time frames, and take action to implement  this process, as applicable (Recommendation 3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of our report to DHS for review and comment.
