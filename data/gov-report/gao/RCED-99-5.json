The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1998 authorized the program and established the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring (OMHAR) within HUD to administer it. Currently, the rents for many of the HUD-assisted and -insured multifamily housing projects substantially exceed the market level, which results in higher subsidies under the Section 8 program. HUD received $3.8 billion for Section 8 project-based subsidies in fiscal year 1998.", "The act requires us to audit the operations of OMHAR annually during the first 2 fiscal years following the date of enactment and as appropriate after that.

In 1996, a HUD contractor estimated that for approximately 63 percent of these multifamily projects, the rents are higher than those of comparable unassisted rental units in the same housing rental market, which increases the costs of the Section 8 program to the federal government. However, if the Section 8 assistance is reduced, owners of many of the FHA-insured housing projects are likely to default on their mortgage payments, resulting in substantial claims to the FHA General Insurance Fund. In addition to the cost of insurance claims, defaults on mortgage payments could leave tenants without adequate affordable housing.", "The original project-based Section 8 contracts that were entered into in the 1970s and 1980s were typically for 15, 20, or 40 years and began expiring in the early 1990s. The Congress and HUD have worked together to renew expiring contracts for 1 year. As its long-term Section 8 contracts expire and its 1-year contracts are renewed annually, HUD estimates that its annual renewal costs will increase steadily. For example, HUD estimated that if no actions were taken, the annual cost of renewing project-based Section 8 contracts would rise to over $7 billion\u2014or approximately one-third of HUD\u2019s current total budget\u2014by 2007. To address these escalating costs, the Congress appropriated $30 million to conduct a mark-to-market demonstration program in fiscal year 1996. This demonstration was intended to test various methods of restructuring the financing of insured Section 8 properties, generally by adjusting rents to market levels and reducing the mortgage debt to reflect any decline in net operating income resulting from the rent adjustment. Near the end of fiscal year 1996, the Congress repealed the demonstration program but authorized a new demonstration for fiscal 1997.", "To deal with Section 8 contract expirations occurring in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter, the Congress legislated a permanent mark-to-market program in October 1997. This legislation also extended the fiscal year 1997 demonstration program through fiscal 1998 with modifications as a transitional program while HUD developed regulations to implement the permanent program. The intended goals of the permanent mark-to-market program are to reduce the costs of expiring Section 8 contracts, address financially and physically troubled projects, correct management and ownership deficiencies, and preserve the affordability and availability of low-income rental housing. (See app. I for an overview of the mark-to-market process.)", "The act directed HUD to select capable entities to carry out restructuring under the mark-to-market program on behalf of the federal government. These entities are referred to as participating administrative entities (PAE). Entities eligible to apply to become PAEs include public agencies, such as state housing finance agencies, local housing agencies, nonprofit organizations, and these entities in partnership with each other or with private entities. The act specifies selection criteria such as experience in working directly with tenant organizations and other community-based organizations; experience with multifamily housing financing and restructuring; a history of stable, financially sound, and responsible administrative performance; and financial strength."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staffing and Organizational Decisions Not Final Because of Delays in Appointing an OMHAR Director", "paragraphs": ["The act established OMHAR as an entity within HUD and required the Office to be under the management of a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed Director. Section 572(a) of the act specifies that not later than 60 days after its enactment (Oct. 27, 1997), the President should submit a nomination for the Director for OMHAR to the Senate. However, the Director was not nominated until September 29, 1998. The Senate confirmed the nomination on October 21, 1998.", "The act authorizes the Director to hire personnel to carry out OMHAR\u2019s functions. However, because the Director was not appointed until October 21, 1998, HUD staff began formulating organization and staffing plans for OMHAR in the Director\u2019s absence. HUD anticipates very targeted hiring of staff for OMHAR with expertise to carry out critical policy development, oversight, and decision-making functions. Section 574(a),(b) of the act allows the Director to pay OMHAR\u2019s employees (1) without regard to certain provisions of pay schedules used to hire most federal employees and (2) comparably to the officers and employees of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In effect, this authority allows the Director to compensate OMHAR employees at a higher level than other HUD employees to obtain the skills and expertise needed to accomplish the program\u2019s purposes.", "HUD plans to hire these staff in phases. OMHAR will have approximately 75 to 85 staff at its peak; however, this number may increase if additional hiring authority is obtained. Some HUD personnel are expected to be detailed to OMHAR, but according to mark-to-market officials, most will be hired from outside HUD. For the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, the 10 existing HUD staff working on the mark-to-market program will be detailed to OMHAR and additional support will be provided by HUD staff with collateral assignments. HUD envisions that these senior core staff will be assisted by 10 staff hired for 1-year terms. HUD intends on hiring additional staff with 4-year terms in three phases\u2014at the end of October and December 1998 and the end of February 1999. Of the 75 additional staff expected to be hired during fiscal year 1999, approximately 15 will be distributed among five HUD field offices, and the remainder will be located in headquarters.", "Because mark-to-market is a relatively short-term effort\u2014authority for both the program and OMHAR terminates on September 30, 2001\u2014HUD plans to focus staff resources on inherently governmental functions and will generally not hire internal staff to carry out commercial functions that are readily obtainable through private-sector vendors. Instead, HUD expects to obtain capacity for such functions through contracts to support internal staff. While HUD\u2019s plan to oversee the contractors is not yet final, HUD anticipates having several staff dedicated to managing the contractors. These staff would include the chief of a newly created office of contracts, compliance, and controls; three contract analysts/government technical representatives; a records management analyst; two internal review specialists; and a clerical support staff member. Figure 1 illustrates OMHAR\u2019s proposed organizational structure.", "Housing experts involved with mark-to-market issues, including representatives of advocacy groups, whom we contacted were concerned that a Director of OMHAR had not yet been appointed at the time of our discussions. For example, one representative was concerned that the delay in the Director\u2019s appointment limited the Director\u2019s opportunity to participate directly in developing the program\u2019s regulations. In addition, according to some representatives, the delay in appointing the Director and implementing the program sent a negative message to stakeholders about the administration\u2019s support of the program. In response to this concern, HUD mark-to-market officials said that the administration has been supportive of the program and has provided access to any resources necessary to prepare for its implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Made Progress in Preparing for Mark-To-Market Program, but Some Key Tasks Are Behind HUD\u2019s Original Schedule", "paragraphs": ["As mandated in the act, HUD is required to implement the mark-to-market program for Section 8 contracts expiring in fiscal year 1999 (beginning Oct. 1, 1998) and thereafter. Despite delays in hiring a management studies contractor and a voluminous number of tasks to complete, HUD has made considerable progress toward this end. For example, HUD has published interim regulations for the mark-to-market program and is expecting to develop an operating procedures manual and to select its partners (the PAEs) to perform the restructurings in October 1998.", "However, in spite of HUD\u2019s efforts, some of these tasks either have been or will be completed behind their original schedule. For example, in May 1998, HUD had planned to issue the program\u2019s interim regulations by August and to have final regulations in place by October 1998. Now, HUD expects to have only the interim regulations in place by October 1998. Final regulations are to be developed 3 months after the OMHAR Director\u2019s appointment. Also, while HUD originally planned to begin briefing PAEs on their responsibilities in September 1998, because of delays in selecting the PAEs, briefings are not scheduled to begin until October. Of eight key tasks, such as preparing briefing manuals and conducting technical assistance briefings for field office staff, HUD had completed one as of September 8, 1998, the most recent date for which this information was readily available. The remaining seven were in progress, although three of these were behind HUD\u2019s original schedule. Appendix II provides a more detailed description of HUD\u2019s progress in carrying out eight key tasks needed to implement the mark-to-market program.", "In addition to the operational tasks that HUD must perform, the act places some reporting and other requirements related to the mark-to-market program on HUD. For example, the act requires the OMHAR Director to report certain information to the Secretary of HUD and for the Secretary to submit information on OMHAR\u2019s operations to the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget. (See app. III for information on the mark-to-market reporting requirements.) The act also requires that prior to issuing final regulations, HUD seek recommendations on the implementation of the mark-to-market program from individuals and organizations affected by the program and convene at least three public forums so that those individuals and organizations can express their views concerning the proposed disposition of the recommendations. This requirement is discussed in greater detail later in this report.", "While most representatives of the groups involved with mark-to-market issues whom we contacted were generally complimentary of mark-to-market officials\u2019 efforts to implement the program, many expressed concerns about the delays HUD has experienced in issuing the program\u2019s regulations and soliciting and selecting its administrative partners. For example, there were concerns that the delay in publishing the interim regulations could limit the time that affected parties have to review and comment on them before they become effective and that entities that are eligible to serve as PAEs might not be able to develop a sufficient understanding of the regulations before having to decide if they want to participate in the program. According to HUD mark-to-market officials, the public will have 45 days to comment on the interim regulations, which they believe is a sufficient amount of time. Although the regulations become effective 30 days after publication, which will be before the end of the comment period, these officials said that the comments received will be considered in developing the program\u2019s final regulations.

Because many of the functions necessary under the mark-to-market program will be carried out by the PAEs rather than by HUD, it will be particularly important for HUD to establish procedures ensuring that all the parties involved are carrying out their responsibilities in ways that meet the program\u2019s objectives and are in compliance with the program\u2019s requirements. To its credit, HUD has focused on developing oversight procedures prior to the program\u2019s implementation.", "In general, to oversee the operations of the HUD field offices and PAEs in the mark-to-market program, HUD is developing a plan for centralized review and oversight. Within its general oversight system, HUD has either developed or is planning three key components to help ensure that field offices and PAEs carry out the program in a way that meets its objectives and is in compliance with requirements: (1) performance measures to judge the effectiveness of PAEs\u2019 activities and a system of compensating PAEs, (2) an Internet-based tracking system to monitor and analyze actions taken by HUD field offices and PAEs in carrying out mark-to-market functions, and (3) an oversight and audit guide to test compliance with the program\u2019s requirements and objectives.

For project-based Section 8 contracts expiring in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, the Congress again authorized optional demonstration programs to explore approaches to restructuring the debt secured by these properties while minimizing adverse impacts on tenants, owners, and communities. As authorized by the legislation, restructuring transactions were performed by HUD field offices, by HUD in partnership with state and local housing finance agencies (HFA), and by HUD in joint ventures with nonprofit entities.

Specifically, information from the demonstrations was used to help develop process flow charts and an operating procedures manual for the permanent mark-to-market program. These charts and the manual were compiled by mark-to-market officials, with assistance from HUD\u2019s management studies contractor, by reviewing and documenting HUD\u2019s policy and program requirements under the demonstrations, identifying weak policies and procedures in the process, and recommending improvements in the program\u2019s design and delivery.", "In addition, a front-end risk assessment of the fiscal year 1997 demonstration program identified some concerns, which HUD mark-to-market officials told us that they had considered in establishing the permanent program. For instance, the front-end risk assessment noted that concerns over potential tax liabilities kept many owners from participating in the program, owing either to an inability or an unwillingness to handle the tax consequences or a resistance to participating until anticipated changes to the tax legislation became known. (See app. II for more information on resolution of the tax issue.)", "The 1997 front-end risk assessment also identified communication and the coordination of HUD\u2019s functions as an area of concern. For instance, the risk assessment stated that HUD\u2019s information technology staff ideally should have been involved in developing information systems for the fiscal year 1997 demonstration program earlier in the process to ensure that all departmental documentation and other information technology requirements were met. The risk assessment concluded that, in general, the program\u2019s staff should be representative of all applicable areas of HUD or should involve appropriate personnel from the earliest stages of the process to avoid the need to substantially modify processes late in the program. According to HUD mark-to-market officials, they have applied this \u201clesson learned\u201d by involving other areas within HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing, such as Section 8 and Multifamily Claims staff, and other HUD offices, such as the Office of Policy Development and Research and the Office of General Counsel, throughout the development of the permanent program.", "According to mark-to-market officials, the demonstration programs also provided other information useful for working out the details of the permanent program. For instance, mark-to-market officials believe that their efforts in developing agreements with state and local HFAs laid the foundation for HFAs\u2019 participation in the permanent program as PAEs. Similarly, issues raised by the nonprofit partners under the joint venture arrangements have been instructive as mark-to-market officials consider details and policies under the permanent program, such as issues related to adjusting rents to market levels without mortgage restructuring and the compensation structure for nonprofit partners.", "With respect to the lessons learned from the component of the demonstration program carried out by HUD field offices, mark-to-market officials said that they have compiled an ongoing question-and-answer document to respond to the issues raised by the field offices involved. These mark-to-market officials said that they have communicated with the field offices to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of certain approaches and to develop responses to the questions.

For instance, the manual requires a PAE to conduct at least one consultation meeting before a project\u2019s physical needs assessment is completed. The consultation meeting is to provide the PAE with an opportunity to receive oral presentations and comments and respond to tenants\u2019 and communities\u2019 concerns regarding the mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plan, the rental assistance assessment plan, and any proposed sale or transfer of the project.

To seek views concerning HUD\u2019s proposed disposition of these recommendations, the legislation requires HUD to convene at least three public forums involving organizations representing state and local HFAs, other potential PAEs, tenants, project owners and managers, state and local governments, and mortgagees.

We also discussed HUD\u2019s efforts to develop OMHAR and prepare for the program\u2019s implementation with representatives of groups involved with issues related to mark-to-market, including two independent housing consultants, the National Council of State Housing Agencies, the National Leased Housing Association, the National Housing Law Project, the National Alliance of HUD Tenants, and the National Housing Conference. Because OMHAR was not yet established and HUD\u2019s plans for implementing the permanent mark-to-market program were still being developed, we did not attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of OMHAR\u2019s operations or HUD\u2019s implementation plans.", "We performed our work at HUD in Washington, D.C., from March through September 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

This appendix describes the key activities that are to occur during each of the nine phases, as outlined in HUD\u2019s draft operating procedures manual. 1. Screening Owners and Projects for Eligibility: The first phase of the restructuring process is determining a project\u2019s eligibility. To be eligible to participate in the mark-to-market program, a project must be financed by a Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured or Secretary-held mortgage, receive project-based assistance, and have rents that exceed comparable market rents. HUD has established additional criteria for determining if a project is eligible to (1) renew its Section 8 contract at market rents and restructure the project\u2019s debt, (2) renew its Section 8 contract at market rents without restructuring the project\u2019s debt, or (3) renew its Section 8 contract at the lesser of the project\u2019s current rents with an operating cost adjustment factor, budget-based rents with an operating cost adjustment factor, or base rents with an operating cost adjustment factor. HUD will extend the Section 8 contracts for projects with contracts that are due to expire while they are in the mark-to-market \u201cpipeline,\u201d such as projects undergoing eligibility determinations, or while they are participating in the development of a mortgage debt restructuring plan. Under these circumstances, a project\u2019s Section 8 contract may be extended at the project\u2019s current contract rent for up to 9 months, with the option of a further extension of 3 months.", "A project may not be restructured, and its contract may not be renewed if its owner has engaged in material adverse financial or managerial actions or omissions with regard to the project or other federally assisted, financed, or insured projects. Furthermore, a project may not be restructured if its condition is too poor to be rehabilitated at a reasonable cost or if the owner fails to comply with the requirements for restructuring. Such projects are to be directed into HUD\u2019s enforcement program. 2. Assigning Projects for Restructuring: During the second phase of the mark-to-market process, HUD assigns multifamily projects to its administrative partners, who will actually perform the restructuring, which are referred to as participating administrative entities (PAE). Assets are first assigned to state and local housing finance agencies (HFA) that HUD has selected as PAEs. After this first round of assignments, non-HFA entities that HUD has selected to be PAEs can bid for the rights to restructure projects that remain. 3. Preserving Affordable Housing: One of the goals of the act is to preserve the affordability and availability of low-income rental housing through mortgage restructuring. As part of the restructuring process, a mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plan is to be developed for each project. The development of this plan is expected to take, on average, 9 months. One element of the mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plan is a rental assistance assessment plan, which the PAE develops to determine whether Section 8 assistance should be renewed as project-based or tenant-based assistance. The plan must also include a use restriction whereby the project\u2019s owner agrees to maintain affordability for at least 30 years. Other elements required in the mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plan, which will be developed in later phases, include a new rent subsidy level, a plan to restructure the debt, and a plan to finance the rehabilitation needs of the project. 4. Collecting Data: During the fourth phase of the process, the PAE collects and assesses project-specific data from project owners, lenders, servicers, or other third parties to be used during the underwriting and loan approval phases. The PAE is also to collect and analyze market studies, appraisals, and physical needs assessments to determine market rents, expenses, and the projects\u2019 rehabilitation needs. 5. Underwriting: Once the data collection is complete, the fifth phase in the mark-to-market process is underwriting. During the underwriting phase, the size of the restructured first and the new second mortgage will be determined. The existing project mortgage will be restructured to provide a first mortgage that is sustainable at restructured market rents. The second mortgage may not exceed the difference between the restructured or new first mortgage and the current unpaid principal balance and must be an amount that can reasonably be expected to be repaid. The term of the second mortgage shall equal the term of the first mortgage. However, the only payments that need to be made on the second mortgage before repayment of the first are an amount equal to 75 percent of excess project income. 6. Approving the Loan: The sixth phase of the process is the loan\u2019s approval. It is in this phase that the PAE reviews the mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plan to ensure that all required HUD forms have been filled out completely and accurately and then delivers the plan to the OMHAR hub for approval.7. Closing: After the OMHAR hub grants approval of the plan, the seventh phase of the process is loan closing. Closing is the phase during which HUD, the PAE, the owner, and affected lenders or servicers fulfill the legal requirements for (1) executing the mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plan, (2) restructuring the project\u2019s debt, and (3) renewing the project\u2019s Section 8 contract. 8. Distributing Postclosing Documents: During the eighth phase of the process, the postclosing documents are distributed to the parties (such as servicers, asset managers, and Section 8 contract administrators) who are responsible for loan servicing and asset management functions after restructuring. 9. Servicing and Monitoring: The ninth phase is loan servicing and monitoring. During this phase, servicers, asset managers, escrow agents, Section 8 contract administrators, and monitors have responsibilities to oversee the loans. The servicers of the first and second mortgages are responsible for the cash management function, which includes billing and collecting payments, and accurately accounting for and reporting payments. The asset managers of the first and second mortgages are responsible for ensuring that the underlying collateral is maintained in decent condition. The asset managers of the second mortgage are also responsible for ensuring that only eligible expenses have been deducted from project revenue to maximize excess project income, which can be used to pay off the second mortgage. The escrow agents are responsible for managing the accounts that will be used to finance the immediate rehabilitation needs of the projects, identified through the restructuring process. The Section 8 contract administrators are responsible for ensuring that the projects are maintained in decent, safe, and sanitary conditions by the projects\u2019 owners. Monitors, referred to as restructuring use agreement monitors, are responsible for ensuring that the owners or future purchasers of the projects maintain the affordability and use restrictions agreed to during the restructuring process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary and Status of Operational Tasks Needed to Implement the Mark-To-Market Program", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Issue interim and final regulations To implement the", "paragraphs": ["mark-to-market program.
