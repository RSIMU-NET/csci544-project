NWS\u2019 basic mission is to provide weather and flood warnings, public forecasts, and advisories primarily for the protection of life and property. NWS\u2019 operations also support other agencies\u2019 missions and the nation\u2019s commercial interests. For example, NWS provides specialized forecasts to support aviation safety and the agricultural and marine industries. To carry out its mission, NWS uses a variety of systems and manual processes to collect, process, and disseminate weather data to and among its network of field offices and regional and national centers. Many of these systems and processes are outdated. For example, some radar equipment currently in use dates back to 1957. These radars experience frequent and long-lasting outages, and some replacement parts are no longer available.", "During the 1980s, NWS initiated a program to modernize its systems and restructure its field offices. The goals of this modernization program are to achieve more uniform weather services across the nation, improve forecasts, provide more reliable detection and prediction of severe weather and flooding, permit more cost-effective operations, and achieve higher productivity. The modernization program includes four new major system developments: the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD), the Next Generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-Next), the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), and the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS). It also includes upgrades to existing systems and several smaller new system development projects. The total cost of the modernization is estimated to exceed $4.5 billion. We have previously reported on NWS\u2019 modernization.Additionally, we designated NWS\u2019 modernization as a high-risk information technology initiative in our 1995 report series on high-risk programs.", "NWS plans to restructure its field offices in association with the modernization program. This restructuring will consolidate the current field structure of 52 Weather Service Forecast Offices, 204 smaller Weather Service Offices, 13 River Forecast Centers, and 3 National Centers into 118 Weather Forecast Offices, 13 River Forecast Offices,  13 Data Collection Offices, and 9 National Centers.", "Three other agencies are participating with NWS in the modernization. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) are major users of weather data and have formed tri-agency programs with NWS to manage and fund the development and deployment of both NEXRAD and ASOS. Similarly, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is managing the development and procurement of GOES-Next.", "Because of the importance of timely and accurate weather forecasts and warnings to our nation\u2019s commerce and its citizens\u2019 safety, the Congress has been keenly interested in the modernization, particularly in preserving the existing quality of weather service. As a result, the Congress passed Public Law 100-685 in 1988, and Public Law 102-567, Title VII, in 1992. This legislation states that the Secretary of Commerce shall not close, consolidate, automate, or relocate any field office until the Secretary certifies to the Congress that such action will not result in any degradation of weather service to the public."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ASOS: A Brief Description", "paragraphs": ["ASOS is a system of sensors, computers, display units, and communications equipment intended to automate the ground-based observation and dissemination of weather information nationwide.

Figure 1.1 depicts the specified configuration of ASOS sensors and describes their functions.", "According to NWS, ASOS offers considerable advantages over the current manual surface observation practices, including uniform measurements across all sites and times, continuous observation and reporting, and more observing sites nationwide. ASOS is also intended to eventually replace human observers at weather service offices and at airports. However, ASOS is not designed to detect all weather conditions that human observers have historically provided. Weather conditions that ASOS does not observe include thunderstorms, tornadoes, volcanic ash, hail, virga, snow amount and depth, cloud layers above 12,000 feet, ice pellets, drizzle, blowing snow, blowing dust, and blowing sand. NWS plans to continue to provide this information to its users through a combination of remote sensing systems (e.g., radar, satellite, and lightning detection system), additional ASOS sensors, and manual observation by non weather service observers, such as volunteers, on-call cooperators, and/or FAA personnel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ASOS Status and Plans", "paragraphs": ["NOAA, as the lead agency on the ASOS program, has contracted with AAI Corporation to purchase a minimum of 868 units, with an option to buy an additional 832 units.

In these cases, the human observers continue to deliver some of the information ASOS cannot provide (such as thunderstorms and tornadoes), and provide correct observations should ASOS err or fail. (Table 1.1 provides more information on the status and number of ASOS units for each agency).", "NWS plans to purchase and install all 868 units by fiscal year 1997. In June 1993, NOAA estimated that developing and deploying the base ASOS program through fiscal year 1996 for all three agencies would cost about $340 million. NWS now estimates that the base program will cost $351 million through fiscal year 1997 due to FAA changes to the program.

The 1994 results show mean time between critical failures to be 1,200 hours (versus 2,190) and mean time between critical errors to be 2,800 hours (versus 8,760). Furthermore, critical failures and errors that were caught and corrected by weather observers were not included in these results. Once these errors are included, ASOS failure and error rates are 730 and 1,680 hours, respectively (see figure 2.1).", "The ASOS program manager said that the January 1994 results are outdated, and that more recent performance data show that ASOS meets specifications with a mean time between failures on aviation-critical observations of 3,055 hours (versus the 2,190 hours requirement). This claim, however, is not supported by the facts. The data upon which the claim is based are incomplete and insufficient to calculate ASOS reliability. The specification defines system critical failures as the loss of any of the following observations: pressure, sky condition, visibility, wind, freezing rain, and precipitation. NWS\u2019 recent performance data, however, do not include measurements taken during the harshest winter weather when ASOS reliability is poorest. Further, the data do not include failures by the precipitation identification and precipitation accumulation sensors. Therefore, these data alone are not indicative of ASOS\u2019 overall reliability.", "The reason that ASOS\u2019 reliability problems were not discovered during testing and corrected prior to system deployment and operation is that ASOS program management repeatedly chose to defer testing of mean time between failures. Instead, the program office relied on the results of a model run by the contractor to predict system reliability, rather than testing reliability. After production, NWS\u2019 testing branch finally performed a reliability test, but these tests did not include mean time between failures. Instead, it was decided that reliability could be better determined by analyzing actual maintenance actions on operational systems than by testing the preproduction system. While we agree that continuous monitoring of maintenance is important, it does not substitute for predeployment testing of performance specifications as practiced by leading information technology organizations. Further, it does not protect the government from buying production units that do not meet specifications for reliability.", "Low system reliability increases the likelihood that wrong information will be disseminated to system users, again potentially risking aviation safety, impairing environmental research, and misguiding general public decision-making. Low reliability also results in a larger maintenance workload, lower user confidence in ASOS, and continued dependence on human observers for quality control. For example, one commissioned ASOS site reported that on occasion the ceilometer took 5 days to fix. During that time, a human observer had to take and disseminate all cloud height observations in order for airport operations to continue.", "A senior AOMC manager stated that the planned modifications on individual sensors should improve ASOS\u2019 overall reliability.

Comparatively, only about 1 percent of observations transmitted from ASOS sites to the AOMC over NWS\u2019 network are lost. Although NWS has no documented quantitative criteria, the ASOS program manager stated that an acceptable percentage of lost messages would be less than 5 percent.

The FAA ASOS program manager noted that the 16-percent data loss is high because it is an average of new and old ASOS sites. He stated that data communications at new sites are more problematic and therefore raise the average.", "To monitor FAA ASOS sites, the AOMC must use FAA\u2019s wide area network. NWS and FAA officials agree that a major reason for lost data is that the FAA network cannot support ASOS monitoring requirements in some locations. This network is configured such that a microwave signal must travel between as many as 30 points. This number of \u201chops\u201d in the microwave transmission causes signal degradation or loss.

This has led to situations, for example, in which aircraft were routed for an instrument-guided approach because ASOS was reporting low visibility, but the pilot could see the runways on approach from miles away. Also, one controller described an incident in which several small aircraft were allowed to take off based on the ASOS report of 2,500-foot cloud ceilings. A pilot radioed in from the air to say that ceilings were actually at 900 feet. According to the controller, this variance could put small aircraft at risk.", "The ASOS specification does not require that its observations be representative of actual, prevailing weather conditions. In fact, the specification never mentions representativeness. Instead, the specification requires ASOS to perform a time average of weather within a small area (i.e., a sample area) rather than a spatial average as a human would when scanning the entire sky. Thus, when weather is changing rapidly or is patchy, ASOS observations can be accurate for the small area it is viewing, but unrepresentative of prevailing weather conditions in the universe being sampled. According to NWS and FAA program managers, ASOS is not, and never was, intended to replicate the way a human observes weather conditions, and that the aviation community must undergo a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d to accept automated observations.", "Neither NWS nor FAA has reliable data on the extent to which ASOS observations are unrepresentative or the effect of unrepresentative observations on aircraft operations. A senior NWS manager stated that such data have not been systematically collected and analyzed because to date both NWS and FAA management have focused on correcting ASOS where it does not meet specifications rather than enhancing the system to meet users\u2019 needs. Some limited data exist, which although not conclusive, support the users\u2019 statements that unrepresentativeness is a problem. For example, a New York weather office recorded an average of 51 unrepresentative events per month from November 1993 to February 1994 and an average of 32 events per month from March to May 1994. These data are discussed in appendix II.", "The ASOS program office is drafting a plan for systematically collecting and assessing data on unrepresentative ASOS observations, after which it will decide whether or not to enhance or supplement the system to address this concern.

These areas are (1) identifying ice pellets as solid precipitation, (2) correctly identifying rain, snow, or no precipitation more frequently than currently specified in ASOS\u2019 specification, and (3) distinguishing between actual cloud layers and invisible layers of particles in the atmosphere. According to ASOS users, because this information is particularly important to aviation forecasts, incorrect observations could risk aviation safety, inconvenience airport operations, and add to aviation costs. NWS is planning to invest resources in ASOS enhancements to address two of these three unmet needs. Each unmet need is described below.", "The ASOS specification states that solid precipitation shall be correctly detected at least 99 percent of the time (reported as either snow or mixed/other precipitation) and shall be correctly identified at least 97 percent of the time. According to the ASOS Technical Chief, solid precipitation should mean only snow. It should not mean other forms of solid precipitation, such as ice pellets.", "ASOS satisfies the program office\u2019s narrow definition of solid precipitation. However, ASOS tests and operational experience show that the system misidentifies solid precipitation other than snow (e.g., it often identifies ice pellets as rain). According to ASOS users, failure to correctly identify other types of solid precipitation could pose a safety problem should the system report rain in ice pellets, hail, or icing conditions, and the problem is exacerbated at unstaffed ASOS sites where human observers would not be present to correct erroneous reports. The error occurs because the sensor identifies precipitation types on the basis of their size and velocity. The ASOS program office is evaluating alternative technological enhancements that could permit discriminating ice pellets and hail from other forms of solid precipitation.", "The ASOS specification requires that the precipitation identification sensor correctly detect precipitation (liquid and solid) at least 99 percent of the time, and correctly identify at least 90 percent of liquid precipitation and 97 percent of solid precipitation. According to the ASOS program office, ASOS meets this specification. However, NWS\u2019 Office of Systems Operations, which is responsible for the operation and maintenance of commissioned units, reported that current performance levels may not satisfy aviation operational requirements. As stated by a senior testing manager, 1 percent of 24 hours of precipitation is about 15 minutes, and if ASOS does not correctly detect precipitation for 15 minutes while an aircraft is approaching, a significant safety risk could be incurred. The significance of the situation was underscored in the workshops involving NWS, FAA, and aviation industry officials to define aviation industry requirements for weather information. During these workshops, industry officials stressed the importance of having more accurate and available precipitation information. To address this concern, the ASOS program office is assessing technical enhancements to improve this sensor\u2019s accuracy.", "ASOS users cite requirements for accurately identifying cloud ceilings. Because of technological limitations, ceilometers alone (i.e., without human observers) cannot currently provide this. ASOS ceilometers falsely identify weather phenomena such as invisible particles, moist air layers, virga, and precipitation as cloud layers. This can result in observations of broken or overcast ceilings when in fact there are clear or scattered conditions. Broken and overcast conditions are defined by the Federal Aviation Regulations as a ceiling, and ceilings determine legal limits and flight rules for various aircraft operations.", "NWS managers stated that this problem does not risk aviation safety; rather, it inconveniences the aviation community. Moreover, they stated that it occurs too infrequently to be a concern. In contrast, aviation industry officials stated that even infrequent occurrences can be costly to airlines.

In February 1994, NOAA\u2019s Climate Data Continuity Project reported that ASOS\u2019 precipitation accumulation sensor generally reports less precipitation than conventional sensors, with the greatest underreporting occurring in summer and winter months. The report explained that ASOS\u2019 gauge performed reasonably well in rain events that were of light to moderate intensity but did not perform well in snow or freezing conditions or in heavy rain events that are typical in the summer. The project further reported that, from the summer of 1993 through the spring of 1994, ASOS precipitation observations were 94 and 91 percent of conventional observations in fall and spring, respectively, but fell to 86 percent in summer and only 75 percent in winter (see figure 3.1).", "Climatologists stated that incorrect precipitation observations affect not only weather-related decision-making, but also accurate climatological analysis. Specifically, inaccurate precipitation records could affect (1) businesses that rely on this information for everyday decisions, (2) climatological analysis of flood and drought frequencies, intensities, and durations, and (3) long-term national climate research on global and regional precipitation, potentially skewing national environmental policy decisions on global change. To address this climatological need, NWS is developing specifications and plans to procure an all-weather precipitation gauge to better report liquid and frozen precipitation amounts.", "According to the ASOS program manager, ASOS does not meet all climatology needs because it was not originally intended to do so. Rather, it was intended only to meet forecasting and aviation requirements. The program office, however, is now assessing how best to meet climatologists\u2019 requirements.

As a result, FAA and NWS changed the ASOS specification to require enhanced displays that could integrate data from other tower displays with the ASOS data. Currently, FAA is testing the new, integrated display equipment in several towers. If testing is successful, FAA plans to accept and deploy the equipment.
