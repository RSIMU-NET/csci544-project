States pay  qualified health providers for a broad range of covered services provided  to Medicaid beneficiaries, and the federal government reimburses states  for their share of these expenditures. The federal matching share of each  state\u2019s Medicaid expenditures for services is determined by a formula  defined under federal law and can range from 50 percent to 83 percent.  Each state administers its Medicaid program in accordance with a state  plan, which must be approved by CMS. Medicaid is an open-ended  entitlement program, under which the federal government is obligated to  pay its share of expenditures for covered services provided to eligible  individuals under each state\u2019s federally approved Medicaid plan.", "States have considerable flexibility in designing their Medicaid programs,  including certain aspects of eligibility, covered services, and provider  payment rates. But under federal law, states generally must meet certain  requirements for what benefits are to be provided, who is eligible for the  program, and how much these beneficiaries can be required to pay in  sharing the cost of their care.

For many children, particularly those  with special needs related to disabilities or chronic conditions, EPSDT  services can help to identify the need for, and make available, essential  medical and support services.", "State Medicaid programs are required to cover EPSDT services for  Medicaid beneficiaries under 21. These services are defined as screenings,  which must include a comprehensive health and developmental history, a  comprehensive unclothed physical exam, appropriate immunizations,  laboratory tests (including a blood-lead assessment), and health  education. Other required EPSDT services include    dental services, which must include relief of pain and infections,  restoration of teeth, and maintenance of dental health;    vision services, including diagnosis and treatment for vision defects, and    hearing services, including diagnosis and treatment for hearing defects,  and hearing aids; and   services necessary to correct or ameliorate physical and mental illness  discovered through screenings, regardless of whether these services are  covered under the state\u2019s Medicaid plan for other beneficiaries.", "Although state Medicaid programs must cover EPSDT services, states have  some flexibility in determining the frequency and timing of screenings,  including the provision of dental services.

Under a managed care model, states contract with  managed care plans, such as health maintenance organizations, and  prospectively pay the plans a fixed monthly fee, known as a capitated fee,  per Medicaid enrollee to provide or arrange for most medical services.  This model is intended to create an incentive for plans to provide  preventive and primary care to reduce the chance that beneficiaries will  require more expensive treatment services in the future. However, this  model may also create a financial incentive to underserve or deny  beneficiaries access to certain services.", "State Medicaid agencies use a variety of delivery and payment approaches  to provide dental services under Medicaid.

CMS implemented  the CMS 416 to comply with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of  1989 (OBRA), which required that the Secretary of Health and Human  Services establish state-specific annual goals for children\u2019s participation in  EPSDT services. OBRA and implementing regulations mandated state- established periodicity schedules for health, dental, vision, and hearing  screenings and related services.

Therefore, the reports cannot be used to provide national estimates  of the provision of dental and other required EPSDT services to children in  Medicaid or to assess every state\u2019s progress in providing services. We first  reported this problem in July 2001. States were required to submit their  fiscal year 1999 CMS 416 reports by April 1, 2000.

Our July 2001 report found that  states faced challenges collecting data on EPSDT services from both fee- for-service providers and managed care plans. Under the fee-for-service  approach, providers bill the state for each EPSDT service they deliver.  Thus, data on EPSDT services are often collected by the state as part of  the payment process. Most of the states we examined for our 2001 report  had some difficulty obtaining complete and accurate data from fee-for- service providers\u2014for example, due to coding or system issues. States  faced more extensive problems obtaining data from capitated managed  care plans. Unlike fee-for-service arrangements, when capitated managed  care plans pay their participating providers a flat fee per beneficiary  regardless of services provided, the providers do not need to submit  information on each service provided in order to receive payment. Thus  plans have had difficulty reporting on the provision of specific EPSDT  services separately as required by states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Taken Steps to Improve Quality of the Data, but Concerns Remain", "paragraphs": ["CMS officials have reported taking several actions in response to our 2001  recommendation that the Administrator of CMS improve EPSDT  reporting. CMS reported, for example, that it had started assessing states\u2019  CMS 416s as part of periodic focused reviews conducted by CMS regional  offices. We reported in 2001 that CMS regional office reviews of states\u2019  EPSDT programs had been helpful in highlighting policy and process  concerns, as well as innovative state practices. Since 2002, according to  CMS in April 2007, the agency had conducted focused reviews in 11 states.  These reviews have evaluated, among other things, state data collection  and reporting, including the extent to which the state develops its CMS 416  in accordance with instructions and uses the data to measure progress and  define areas for improvement. During these reviews, CMS found  deficiencies, such as incorrect coding and incomplete data. CMS made  specific recommendations to the states that would improve the reliability  of the state-generated CMS 416 data.", "Another step CMS has taken that has improved the quality and  completeness of the data states can use to compile their 416s was to  require states to gather encounter data from Medicaid managed care plans.  The BBA and implementing regulations require states that contract with  managed care plans to implement a quality assessment and improvement  strategy that included procedures for monitoring and evaluating the  quality and appropriateness of services provided under the contracts.  States are also required to ensure that managed care plans maintain a  health information system and report encounter data. CMS also  developed a protocol for states\u2019 use for validating encounter data. Officials  from several states and national health associations we contacted in  preparation for this hearing generally said that, although problems remain,  the quality and completeness of the underlying data, such as managed care  encounter data, that states used to prepare the CMS 416, had improved  since 2001. CMS officials indicated a number of efforts were underway to  evaluate other quality and outcome measures of dental services provided  to children enrolled in Medicaid. For example, one measure CMS is  considering is the Quality Compass developed by the National Committee  for Quality Assurance that provides plan-specific, comparative, and  descriptive information for use as a health plan benchmarking tool.", "But despite these improvements, officials from states and from national  health associations remain concerned that the CMS 416s are unreliable for  developing national estimates of the provision of dental and other required  EPSDT services and therefore insufficient for oversight purposes.  Although some officials cited some uses of the CMS 416, for example, as a  set of basic indicators of the extent to which children use dental services  over time, the officials cited several different problems.", "Inconsistent data collection. Citing differences in how states collected  data on dental EPSDT services, an April 2005 National Oral Health Policy  Center report stated that comparing the number of children receiving  services over time or examining the rate of dental utilization across states  should be done with caution. The Center\u2019s director provided several  examples. For instance, some states inappropriately reported oral health  assessments conducted in group settings, such as those performed by  nurses or other non-dentist health providers in schools, as dental  examinations. Likewise, some states inappropriately reported oral health  assessments provided by hygienists as dental examinations. According to  the director, such assessments should not be considered dental  examinations.", "Coding inconsistencies and anomalies. CMS 416s may not accurately  reflect the provision of dental and other required EPSDT services,  according to an official from the National Academy for State Health Policy  speaking about research she had done in 2002 and 2004. States have  reported that discrepancies exist between managed care plans and state  Medicaid agencies in the definitions of ESPDT services. Similarly, we  reported in 2001 that states faced such issues in collecting CMS 416 data  for the range of EPSDT services that might be provided during a  comprehensive office visit. For example, providers in Florida were  required to use a specific EPSDT code and a claim form to document the  components of EPSDT services they provided. However, according to  state officials, providers often chose to use other codes instead. According  to the officials, some providers submitted claims under a comprehensive  office-visit code for a new patient that paid a higher rate than an EPSDT  screening, or used other comprehensive office-visit codes that required  less documentation. Specific to dental EPSDT services, the George  Washington University Medical Center reported in December 2003 that  several Medicaid program representatives said that it was difficult to  separate specific provided services in EPSDT data reported by managed  care plans to determine the provision of dental screening services because  providers did not always bill for those services separately.", "Changes in beneficiary eligibility. Gaps in children\u2019s eligibility for  Medicaid and movement of children between Medicaid and other health  insurance plans may also cause problems in accurately determining the  extent that Medicaid children received dental and other required EPSDT  services. One official told us that interrupted Medicaid eligibility,  accompanied by the implementation of the State Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Program, has also caused problems in the data on the number  of children eligible for services. As children move between health  insurance programs as their program eligibility changes, officials reported  that it becomes difficult to maintain an accurate count of Medicaid-eligible  children. Without an accurate count, an accurate rate of the provision of  the dental and other required EPSDT services to eligible children cannot  be calculated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS 416s Have Limitations for Oversight Purposes", "paragraphs": ["The type of data collected on the CMS 416 has limited usefulness for  purposes of oversight, as officials from states and national health  associations have noted.

One official who  works with many state Medicaid agencies told us that states do not  generally use the CMS 416 to inform their monitoring and quality  improvement activities, but instead rely on other sources of data. Some  state officials reported using the CMS 416 data, but noted that they  supplement the data with additional information.", "The limitations noted generally fell into three categories. First, while states  report the total number of children enrolled in managed care plans, dental  and other required EPSDT services delivered to managed care enrollees  are not reported separately from fee-for-service enrollees. Consequently,  the data captured by the CMS 416 cannot be used to specifically monitor  the provision of dental and other required EPSDT services under either  fee-for-service or managed care arrangements.", "Second, the information captured by the CMS 416 is limited to summary  statistics, such as age group, eligibility, state requirements, and services  delivered, and does not provide information that would illuminate whether  children have received the recommended number of visits for dental and  other required EPSDT services. For example, a concern raised by a  national health association official was that the CMS 416 did not provide  information about whether eligible children had received the number of  biannual preventive dental visits that are required by the state or  recommended by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. Because  each child is counted only once each fiscal year, regardless of the number  of dental services or preventive dental services the child received that  year, the data do not reflect the total number of dental appointments each  child had in any given year.", "Third, CMS 416s do not contain information that would illuminate any of a  number of factors that may contribute to low use of dental and other  required EPSDT services among children enrolled in Medicaid. Our 2001  report found that children\u2019s low utilization of EPSDT dental and other  services could have been attributed to program-related matters, such as  limited provider participation in Medicaid or inadequate methods for  informing beneficiaries of available services. In addition, some  beneficiary-related factors, such as changing eligibility status or language  barriers, could have limited utilization of services. Also, our 2000 report on  factors contributing to low utilization of dental services by Medicaid and  other low-income populations found that the primary contributing factor  among low-income persons with coverage for dental services was  difficulty finding dentists to treat them. Dentists generally cited low  payment rates, burdensome administrative requirements, and such patient  issues as frequently missed appointments as the reasons why they did not  treat more Medicaid patients.
