As a result of the  assessment, the agency requested additional requirements personnel in  the fiscal year 2019\u20132023 budget cycle.", "Customs and Border Protection requirements officials stated that they last  conducted an assessment in 2013.

Requirements officials told us that the U.S.  Coast Guard initially established training and training-related certification  standards in 2007 to emulate similar changes taking place at the  Department of Defense and address previous U.S. Coast Guard  acquisition challenges. Specifically, the U.S. Coast Guard requirements  development organization assigns end users for a two to three year  rotation and provides them training and certification on requirements  development. The requirements development certification program is two  levels and requires both classroom-based training and on-the-job  experience. The U.S. Coast Guard assigns those who complete a higher  level of certification to develop requirements for more complex and costly  programs. This helps to ensure that requirements personnel can give  timely, relevant end user input but also differentiate between operational  and technical requirements. U.S. Coast Guard requirements officials told  us that the training and certification standardizes the proficiency of the  requirements workforce across the component.

Specifically,  an assessment should include an understanding of the goals and  objectives of the component, the workforce needed to achieve the goals,  and the capacity and capabilities needed to support workforce strategies.  With a better understanding of the needs and current capabilities of the  workforce, management can develop specific strategies to better educate  the workforce and standardize skill levels.

Organizations can use a variety of instruction approaches for training\u2014for  example, classroom based learning; distance learning; or structured on- the-job training.

Customs and Border Protection\u2019s TECS program  had an engineer with requirements development experience.  According to this official, TECS Modernization traced all program  requirements from the operational to the technical level in a matrix to  ensure that they were valid and understood. A trained workforce,  however, is one principle among many needed to provide a program  with a sound start. In this case, a trained requirements official took the  critical step of tracing the requirements to the gap, but his involvement  cannot address the requirements and program executing issues that  may arise throughout the life of a program.

Immigration and  Customs Enforcement re-started the program by bringing in trained  requirements development personnel who worked with the end users  to determine the appropriate operational requirements.

For this program, the U.S.  Coast Guard recently held an assessment of the draft requirements  for the cutter that solicited input from users across the organization.

Without specific timeframes, there is the risk that  management attention will be lost. Further, some components do not  have in place independent requirements development organizations,  separate from their acquisition functions. The overlap in these  responsibilities does not comport with best practices and engenders a risk  that acquisition officials may override requirements developers to procure  a preferred solution as opposed to the one needed by the end user.", "Further, most of the components in our review have not taken steps to  assess their requirements workforces and provide training. Compounding  this problem is a lack of training and certification standards for  requirements personnel at the agency level.
