As required, GAO reviewed the two DOD reports submitted in early 2004 and is, with this report, submitting its views to the Congress on whether (1) the military services met the so-called \"50-50 requirement\" for fiscal years 2002-3 and (2) the projections for fiscal years 2004-8 are reasonable estimates. GAO also identified key limitations in the 50-50 process that affect the department's ability to comply with the 50-50 requirement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Recurring weaknesses in DOD's data gathering, reporting processes, and financial systems prevented GAO from determining with precision if the military services complied with the 50-50 requirement in fiscal years 2002-3. DOD data show all the services to be below the 50 percent funding limit on private-sector work. However, as before, GAO found errors in the data that, if corrected, would overall increase funding of the private sector and move each service closer to the limit on contract maintenance. For example, for fiscal year 2003, the Navy did not include about $410 million in private-sector maintenance work on aircraft carriers and surface ships. Correcting for these and other errors would increase the Navy's percentage of private-sector depot maintenance funds for that year from the 44.5 percent reported to 47.9 percent. DOD reported significant increases in depot maintenance funding from 2002 to 2003, but these did not result in significant increases in the amount of work performed in DOD depots during that period. Because some data errors and omissions in DOD's prior-years report are carried into future years, and changing depot maintenance requirements and fluctuations in budget estimates make projecting out-year data difficult, the future-years report does not represent reasonable estimates of public- and private- sector maintenance funding for fiscal years 2004-8, thereby limiting its usefulness to congressional and DOD decision makers. GAO recommended last year that the Congress consider amending 10 U.S.C. 2466 to require only one report that would cover 50-50 data for the prior year, current year, and budget year. In 2004 the Armed Services Committees proposed changes in title 10 that would adopt GAO's recommendation. Despite the limitations in the 50-50 data, the trend for this period shows that the services are moving close to the 50 percent threshold, yet they have no plan of action in place to prevent exceeding it. Such a plan would allow for timely actions to be taken to mitigate the potential for exceeding the 50 percent limit for private-sector funding. Several limitations in the 50-50 process affect the quality of DOD's 50-50 reporting. First, three of the four military services did not have an independent review and validation of their 50-50 data. Second, training for those who are responsible for collecting, aggregating, and reporting 50-50 data was limited and sporadic. Third, management emphasis regarding the need for accurate and complete 50-50 reporting was lacking."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under 10 U.S.C. 2466, not more than 50 percent of annual depot  maintenance funding provided to the military departments and  defense agencies can be used for work accomplished by private-sector  contractors.

The first  report is to identify the percentage of funds expended by each military  department and defense agency during the preceding 2 fiscal years for the  performance of depot maintenance workloads by the public and private  sectors (known as the \u201cprior-years report\u201d). The second report is to  project the same information for the current and 4 succeeding fiscal years  (known as the \u201cfuture-years report\u201d).

Thus, since it exceeded the  threshold in 2000 and 2001, the Air Force has used a buffer of 2 percent  prior to reaching the 50 percent limitation as a point where it would begin  identifying actions that are needed to influence maintenance sourcing  decisions to help ensure continued compliance. According to the Air  Force\u2019s 50-50 coordinator, 2 percent represents a buffer of about  $160 million and allows sufficient time to make maintenance sourcing  decisions to move workloads or assign new workloads appropriately to  support continued compliance. An OSD representative responsible for the  50-50 guidance agreed that 2 percent appears to be a practicable point to  trigger action from the services to avoid exceeding the 50 percent  threshold.", "With regard to having a point that the services would use to identify  actions to help them remain compliant, OSD does not require the services  to formally establish a plan of action or to notify OSD of the specific  actions and decisions that they would undertake to remain compliant with  the 50 percent threshold for private-sector funding. Thus, OSD has no  formal means for (1) knowing whether the services have recognized the  need to develop plans to remain compliant with the 50 percent limitation  on private-sector funding or (2) encouraging the services to take timely  actions to avoid being noncompliant. The issue of having the services  undertake timely planning and prompt actions to avoid being  noncompliant becomes even more essential, considering that our analyses  historically have generally shown that the services underreported  the percentage of private-sector funding\u2014indicating that the services are  closer to the threshold than they have been reporting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Legislation Would Require a Single Report", "paragraphs": ["Because of the limitations of the future-years report as an accurate  predictor of depot maintenance funding allocation, we recommended last  year that the Congress consider amending 10 U.S.C. 2466 to require only  one 50-50 report.

First, three  of the four military services did not have an independent review and  validation of their 50-50 data prior to submission to the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, while the fourth had only a limited review.

We recommended that, to further enhance  data verification and validation, the Secretary of Defense require the  Secretaries of the military departments to direct the use of service audit  agencies, or an agreed-upon alternate method, for third-party review and  validation of 50-50 data and to ensure that auditor-identified errors in the  data are rectified before reports are submitted to the Congress. While  DOD\u2019s 50-50 guidance for this year\u2019s 50-50 reports directed the military  departments to implement this recommendation, only the Navy took  action for an independent review and validation of its 50-50 data.", "As we previously reported, we believe that independent review and  validation of the 50-50 data could help the military departments improve  their 50-50 reporting. For example, service audit agencies\u2019 involvement  typically identified and corrected substantial errors in the data before the  50-50 reports went to the Congress. However, this year the Air Force Audit  Agency and the Army Audit Agency did not participate. Although the Naval  Audit Service suspended its 50-50 audit because of higher-priority work, its  work resulted in changes to the 50-50 data submitted to the Congress. For  example, in January 2004 the Naval Audit Service identified over  $90 million in errors and inconsistencies in the prior-year 50-50 data for  selected activities at three major Navy commands, resulting in changes to  the reported data. Clearly independent review and validation helps the  military services improve the quality and completeness of the 50-50 data  that are reported to the Congress. The Air Force\u2019s audit service has opted  out of the 50-50 review process, citing recent changes to government  auditing standards regarding auditor independence when performing both  audit and nonaudit management assistance services for the same client.   The Army Audit Agency said it was not asked to review the Army\u2019s 2003  50-50 data. An Army Audit Agency official said that the agency reviewed  the Army\u2019s 50-50 data from 1998 to 2002, and there were open  recommendations from those audits that had not been implemented at the  time the Army\u2019s 2003 50-50 data were developed.", "As we have noted, we recognize that recent changes in government  auditing standards have been made to better address and specify  independence issues arising when an audit organization undertakes both  audit and nonaudit services for the same client.

Improved planning, management involvement, and  documentation of roles and responsibilities may be required, but a process  can be developed to ensure that independence will not be compromised.

In other instances, the  coordinators either answered questions as they arose from the program  offices or, if no questions were asked, accepted the 50-50 data without  further review. For instance, Navy officials generally accepted funds from  performance-based logistics contracts without determining whether all the  funds were used for depot-level maintenance.

We found repeated and significant changes, even though the  estimates were prepared only about 1 year apart. We used this analysis to  further discuss with officials and analyze reasons for changes in reported  data and percentage allocations between the 2003 and 2004 reports  submitted to the Congress.", "Our work has shown that DOD\u2019s 50-50 data cannot be relied upon as a  precise measure of the allocation of depot maintenance funds between the  public and private sectors. However, the mandate in 10 U.S.C. 2466  requires (1) DOD to report the data, which are the only data available and  accepted and used for DOD decision making and for congressional  oversight, and (2) GAO to submit its views to the Congress on whether  DOD has complied with the 50-50 requirement. While DOD\u2019s data cannot  be relied on to provide a precise measure of the funding between the  public and private sectors, the data, along with our adjustments, provide a  rough approximation of the allocations and some trends that may be  useful to the Congress in exercising its oversight role and to DOD officials  in managing the depot maintenance program. Several factors concerning  the validity and completeness of data were considered in our methodology  and approach to reviewing the prior- and future-years reports. One key  factor is the continuing deficiencies we have noted in DOD\u2019s financial  systems and reports that preclude a clean opinion on its financial  statements and that result in limited accuracy of budget and cost  information. Another factor is that documenting depot maintenance  workload allocations between the public and private sectors is becoming  more complicated by the consolidation of maintenance activities and the  performance of depot-level maintenance at field locations. These  complicating factors (1) make it more difficult to identify work that meets  the statutory definition of \u201cdepot maintenance,\u201d (2) complicate workload  reporting, and (3) result in the underreporting of depot maintenance for  both the public and private sectors. In addition, changes in business  philosophy and approach can make analysis more difficult. For example,  many new contracts are performance-based and may not discretely  identify maintenance activities or account separately for their costs. This  can result in the under- and overreporting of depot maintenance work  performed in the private sector. It also forces more reliance on the  contractor for providing information needed in 50-50 reporting and may  result in DOD\u2019s officials using more assumptions and estimating  methodologies in lieu of contract data.
