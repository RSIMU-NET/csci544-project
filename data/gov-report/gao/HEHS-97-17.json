These concerns stem, in part, from frequent allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse in the program. For example, we recently confirmed allegations that some ineligible non-English-speaking applicants were illegally obtaining benefits through the use of middlemen, who provide translation and/or other services for a fee to help individuals apply for benefits. Concerns about the program also stem from sharp increases in the number of SSI recipients in recent years. From 1990 to 1996, the population of disabled SSI recipients increased by over 40 percent, from about 3.4 million to nearly 4.8 million.", "To help ensure that only eligible individuals are receiving SSI benefits, the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 required that the Social Security Administration (SSA) review the disability status of a minimum number of SSI recipients. In August 1996, the Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which amended the Social Security Act to require SSA to conduct continuing disability reviews (CDR) within the first year of life on all low-birth-weight babies receiving SSI benefits and at least once every 3 years on all other SSI recipients under age 18 for whom medical improvement is likely. The 1996 legislation repealed the requirement that SSA conduct CDRs on one-third of SSI recipients attaining age 18 in each of fiscal years 1997 and 1998 and replaced it with the requirement that, starting on the date of the legislation\u2019s enactment, SSA redetermine medical eligibility on the basis of adult criteria for all recipients within 1 year of their 18th birthdays.", "To assist in your oversight of the SSI program, you asked us to examine SSA\u2019s strategy for conducting the legally required CDRs on SSI recipients. In response, we addressed the following questions:", "What steps is SSA taking to conduct legally required SSI CDRs in fiscal years what resources has SSA committed to meeting this requirement and what additional resources, if any, are needed; how does SSA select recipients for SSI CDRs; what are the potential benefits of conducting CDRs on the SSI population; what potential options exist for improving the CDR process?", "In companion reports, we discussed SSA\u2019s general strategy for conducting CDRs, which are also required under the Disability Insurance (DI) program.The DI program provides disability benefits to individuals who have enough work experience to be insured under Social Security.", "To address these questions, we (1) interviewed federal and state officials; (2) reviewed relevant laws, regulations, policies, procedures, and reports; and (3) reviewed SSA data on CDR work plans, budgets, costs, savings, and previously conducted CDRs. Furthermore, we reviewed the process SSA uses in selecting recipients for CDRs and the composition of the formulas used to estimate the likelihood of benefit termination for that process. We estimated savings from benefit terminations after CDRs using assumptions provided by SSA; the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which administers the Medicaid program; and the Congressional Budget Office. In addition, to characterize the population of SSI recipients currently due or overdue for CDRs, we analyzed SSA data from the Supplemental Security Income Record Description (SSIRD) for a 15-percent sample of the SSI disabled population due or overdue for CDRs on the basis of SSA\u2019s current system for scheduling CDRs. We used SSIRD data as provided and did not evaluate its accuracy or the validity of SSA formulas used in the selection process. (App. I contains more details on our scope and methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The SSI program provides financial assistance to disabled people whose income and resources are below specified amounts. As of January 1996, about 2.6 million adults and 1.1 million children were receiving SSI disability benefits and an additional 1.1 million adults were receiving both SSI and DI benefits. Most SSI recipients qualify for Medicaid coverage, and 48 states and the District of Columbia also supplement federal SSI payments with state SSI benefits. In 1995, SSI disability recipients received a total of about $21 billion in federal SSI benefits and $2.6 billion in SSI state supplements.", "Reviewing recipients\u2019 disability status, especially those most likely to improve, is an important component of good program management. Even though the SSI program was created to provide benefits to people who are severely disabled or terminally ill, some people do improve through treatment, surgery, or the passing of time. Amidst concerns about fraud, waste, and abuse in the SSI program, the Congress passed the Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994, which required SSA to conduct CDRs on one-third of SSI recipients attaining age 18 and another 100,000 recipients in each of fiscal years 1996 through 1998.", "The 1996 amendments to the Social Security Act required that SSA conduct CDRs on all low-birth-weight babies within their first year of life and at least once every 3 years on all children under age 18 whose conditions are likely to improve. The amendments single out low-birth-weight babies because historically a relatively high percentage of these babies, about 40 percent, have had their benefits terminated after CDRs. The 1996 amendments replaced the requirement that SSA conduct CDRs on one-third of recipients attaining age 18 with the requirement that SSA redetermine disability eligibility using adult criteria for all recipients attaining age 18.These redeterminations differ from CDRs in that SSA bases decisions for disability eligibility redeterminations on whether recipients meet eligibility requirements; for CDRs, SSA bases eligibility decisions on whether recipients\u2019 impairments have improved since the last determination. Since these disability eligibility redeterminations can be counted as CDRs on SSI recipients, this report examines SSA\u2019s plans to conduct both of these types of reviews. In addition, this report focuses on CDRs of SSI-only recipients because provisions in the 1994 and 1996 laws apply only to recipients who are receiving disability benefits solely under the SSI program, and not under both the SSI and DI programs. Legislation has required CDRs of DI beneficiaries, including those also receiving SSI benefits, since 1980.", "The number of SSI CDRs required by the 1994 and 1996 legislation represent large increases over the number conducted in previous years. In fact, the number of CDRs required in fiscal year 1996 alone exceeds the total of all SSI CDRs conducted in fiscal years 1991 through 1995 (see table II.1). According to SSA, it conducted few CDRs of SSI recipients in those years because the agency had limited resources and no legal requirement existed. However, because SSA had the authority to conduct SSI CDRs, SSA continued to schedule SSI recipients for CDRs and, as a result, about 1.9 million SSI adults and children are now due or overdue for CDRs. Tables II.2 through II.4 present selected characteristics, including age, impairment, and length of time receiving benefits, for the SSI population who were due or overdue for CDRs in fiscal year 1996.", "SSA administers the SSI program with the help of state agencies, called disability determination services (DDS). DDSs make disability determinations for SSA, process initial applications, assess recipients\u2019 potential for medical improvement, and set due dates for and conduct CDRs. DDSs determine when recipients will be due for CDRs on the basis of their potential for medical improvement. On the basis of recipients\u2019 impairments and ages, DDS officials classify individuals into one of three categories: medical improvement expected (MIE), medical improvement possible (MIP), or medical improvement not expected (MINE). Individuals are then scheduled for CDRs at 6- to 18-month intervals if classified as MIE, at least once every 3 years if classified as MIP, and once every 5 to 7 years if classified as MINE.", "In recent years, given limited resources for conducting CDRs and the large backlog of 2.4 million DI CDRs due or overdue, SSA developed new processes in an effort to conduct CDRs in a more cost-effective manner. SSA developed a mailer CDR process to obtain self-reported information on current medical conditions, treatments received, and work activities as a low-cost alternative to full medical CDRs. The full medical CDR process is labor-intensive and generally involves (1) 1 of 1,300 SSA field offices that determines whether disabled recipients continue to meet the financial eligibility requirement regarding income and resources and (2) 1 of 54 state DDSs that determines whether recipients continue to be disabled, which frequently involves medical exams by at least one doctor. The average cost of a full medical CDR is about $1,000, while the average cost of the mailer CDR is between about $25 and $50.", "In addition, on the basis of the outcomes of previously conducted CDRs on DI beneficiaries, SSA developed statistical formulas to estimate the likelihood of benefit termination as a result of CDRs using recipient characteristics, such as age, impairment, length of time on disability rolls, and previous CDR activity. SSA sends mailer CDRs to a portion of individuals who it estimates, on the basis of its formulas, have the lowest likelihood of benefit termination. Cases selected for mailer CDRs are later sent to DDSs for full medical CDRs only if responses to the mail questionnaire and information used in the formulas to estimate the likelihood of benefit termination warrant a more comprehensive review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Plans to Conduct Required SSI CDRs and Test the Use of the Mailer CDR", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 1996, SSA planned to conduct full medical CDRs for the legally required SSI CDRs and to test the mailer CDR process on over 100,000 additional SSI recipients. Table 1 presents, for fiscal year 1996, the number of CDRs SSA specified in planning documents and the number SSA had initiated and DDSs had completed as of June 1996. As of June, DDSs had completed about 60 percent of the required reviews in each category.", "SSA is currently modifying its CDR plan for fiscal years 1997 through 2002, which were developed before the enactment of new SSI CDR requirements under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Under the new requirements, SSA must conduct at least 150,000 SSI CDRs in each of fiscal years 1997 and 1998, which includes disability eligibility redeterminations on 18-year-olds. Prior to the new requirements, SSA\u2019s CDR plan specified more SSI CDRs in fiscal year 1997, but fewer than 150,000 SSI CDRs in fiscal year 1998. Estimates of the minimum number of SSI CDRs that will be required in later years were not available at the time our fieldwork was completed. However, SSA\u2019s plan called for dramatic increases in the number of SSI CDRs in fiscal years 1999 through 2002, ranging from 367,000 to 625,000 per year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resources Appear Sufficient for Required SSI CDRs, but Competing Priorities Pose Challenges", "paragraphs": ["SSA plans to use CDR funds to conduct the legally required SSI CDRs and disability eligibility redeterminations in fiscal years 1996 through 2002. In fiscal year 1996, SSA for the first time set aside regular administrative funds for CDRs, and the Congress took steps to increase funding for CDRs. SSA set aside $200 million for both SSI and DI CDRs and plans to continue that level of funding at least through fiscal year 2002. In addition, the Contract With America Advancement Act of 1996 established a new funding mechanismfor CDRs and authorized up to an additional $2.7 billion for SSI and DI CDRs through fiscal year 2002. This was about $1 billion less than the amount SSA had requested from the Congress and believed would be sufficient, along with regular administrative funds, to conduct CDRs on all SSI recipients who were due or overdue for review and all required DI CDRs through fiscal year 2002. The 1996 amendments to the Social Security Act subsequently authorized an additional $250 million for SSI CDRs and disability eligibility redeterminations in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Combined, regular administrative funding for CDRs and the new budget authority could total over $4 billion in fiscal years 1996 through 2002.", "Competing priorities, such as conducting legally required DI CDRs, which include an enormous backlog of reviews, may pose challenges to conducting all required SSI CDRs in fiscal years 1997 through 2002. Furthermore, the same DDS staff who conduct SSI CDRs also conduct DI CDRs and process initial applications and other reviews of disability eligibility required by law. Although SSA has estimated that funds are sufficient to conduct all required SSI and DI CDRs in fiscal years 1996 through 2002, in our companion reports we question whether CDR funds are sufficient to meet those CDR goals. To the extent that CDR funds are not sufficient to conduct all required SSI and DI reviews, SSI CDRs may be scaled back, since SSA generally considers them to be less cost-effective than DI CDRs. Only SSI CDRs were scaled back when SSA received less CDR funding for fiscal years 1996 through 2002 than it had requested from the Congress.", "Also, according to SSA, the ability to conduct CDRs is always vulnerable to unexpected increases in initial applications and disability eligibility redeterminations. In fact, both of the 1996 laws require work in these areas that may compete with CDRs for DDS staff. First, SSA currently estimates that, because the Contract With America Advancement Act eliminated drug and alcohol abuse as a basis for receiving disability benefits, benefits will be terminated for some of the 196,000 SSI recipients and DI beneficiaries whose primary impairments were drug abuse and/or alcoholism. SSA expects many of those terminated to reapply on the basis of other impairments. Second, in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, the 1996 amendments to the Social Security Act require SSA to redetermine the disability eligibility of between 300,000 and 400,000 children currently receiving SSI benefits. Although these disability eligibility redeterminations can count toward the required 100,000 SSI CDRs in those years, the law gives them precedence over required CDRs on other children. SSA is currently evaluating the impact of this and other required work on its ability to conduct CDRs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA Uses Different Approaches to Select Adult, Child, and 18-Year-Old Recipients for SSI CDRs", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 1996, SSA only conducted SSI CDRs on a portion of recipients it considered to be cost-effective to review. In general, these included MIEs or MIPs, who make up about one-half of all SSI recipients due or overdue for CDRs. For SSI adult recipients, SSA selected from among those who were classified as MIE or MIP and under the age of 59 in that year. SSA\u2019s 1996 fiscal year plan called for conducting about 100,000 full medical CDRs and 107,900 mailer CDRs of adult MIE and MIP SSI recipients. For children, SSA limited its selection to low-birth-weight babies, who totaled about 7,200. According to SSA, it did not select other children in anticipation of the requirement to conduct disability eligibility redeterminations on between 300,000 and 400,000 children receiving SSI. Among 18-year-old SSI recipients, SSA selected 18,000 MIE and MIP recipients, which is about one-third of SSI recipients attaining age 18.", "For adult and 18-year-old recipients, SSA used different approaches to select recipients for CDRs. To select adult recipients, SSA used formulas developed for DI beneficiaries to estimate the likelihood of benefits being terminated as a result of a CDR. As is currently done under the DI program, SSA then selected a portion of those with the highest and lowest estimated likelihood of benefit termination for full medical and mailer CDRs, respectively. SSA did not select recipients in the middle range, which contains the majority of recipients included in the estimation process, because in this range, the formulas are less helpful in identifying recipients who are more likely to have their benefits terminated as a result of a CDR and, therefore, to warrant a full medical CDR. SSA has only developed formulas for use in selecting adult recipients. Among 18-year-old recipients, SSA selected a judgmental sample of those it believed would be most likely to have their benefits terminated as a result of a CDR based on some of the characteristics used to select adult cases for CDRs, such as impairment type and length of time receiving SSI.", "SSA tested the validity of using the DI formulas to estimate the likelihood of benefit termination for adult SSI recipients in its 1995 study of SSI CDRs and its analysis of SSI and DI population characteristics. The SSI and DI programs are subject to the same eligibility requirements, and SSA\u2019s 1995 study of 5,000 adult SSI CDRs found that the formulas differentiated between cases most and least likely to result in benefit terminations about equally well for both disability populations. Since relatively few SSI recipients have ever undergone a CDR, SSA did not use length of time since the last CDR and the number of previous CDRs, which are variables normally included in the DI formulas, when estimating the likelihood of benefit termination for SSI recipients.", "In fiscal years 1997 and 1998, required disability eligibility redeterminations on children will count toward the requirement to conduct at least 100,000 SSI CDRs in each year. In addition, SSA will be required to conduct CDRs annually on (1) low-birth-weight babies and (2) other children under age 18 at least once every 3 years starting on the date of enactment of the 1996 amendments. In fiscal years 1997 and 1998, therefore, CDRs on children could dominate SSI CDRs. SSA plans to continue to develop and modify the formulas and SSI selection process as it learns more about conducting CDRs on this population. SSA\u2019s current plans for broad CDR process improvements include expanding the use of the formulas to children and certain recipients classified as MINEs in order to select individuals for full medical and mailer CDRs from these recipient categories on the basis of their estimated likelihood of benefit termination. SSA also plans to (1) develop a new type of mailer CDR for gathering information on recipients\u2019 medical conditions directly from their physicians and other treating sources and (2) obtain Medicaid data and integrate the data into the statistical formulas to increase the validity of the estimated likelihood of benefit termination. These latter improvements would allow SSA to better predict which recipients in the middle range of estimated likelihood of benefit termination are more likely to have their benefits terminated as a result of a CDR and, therefore, to warrant full medical CDRs. (We discuss these plans further in app. III.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSI CDRs Are Cost-Effective for Certain Categories of Recipients", "paragraphs": ["Reviewing recipients\u2019 disability status, especially those most likely to improve, is one component of a well-managed program. Few recipients voluntarily report medical improvement and leave the rolls. SSA currently estimates that CDRs will remove only about 5 percent of SSI recipients from the rolls in the long run. However, if the CDR process was not in place, recipients\u2019 continuing disability eligibility would be uncertain and the number of ineligible recipients would likely increase over time. On the basis of SSA\u2019s estimate that 5 percent of SSI recipients would have their benefits terminated as a result of CDRs, we estimate that about 95,000 of the approximately 1.9 million SSI recipients currently due or overdue for CDRs are no longer medically eligible for benefits. In fiscal year 1996 alone, these recipients would have received about $481 million in federal SSI benefits and about $418 million in federal and state Medicaid benefits.", "SSI CDRs on some categories of recipients appear to be cost-effective. Benefit terminations result in SSI and Medicaid savings at both the federal and state levels (see app. IV for information on savings). SSA calculates cost-effectiveness for various recipient categories by comparing (1) the estimated present value of benefit savings due to benefit terminations resulting from CDRs on a category with (2) the estimated total costs of conducting CDRs for that category. Because SSA has little experience conducting SSI CDRs, SSA cautions that estimates of savings resulting from SSI terminations are somewhat tentative.", "SSA estimates that CDRs on adults SSA has classified as MIE or MIP save about $3 in federal SSI and Medicaid benefits for every $1 spent conducting CDRs on those categories. State savings increase this ratio to $4 saved for every $1 spent. SSI CDRs on low-birth-weight babies are more cost-effective than CDRs on adults\u2014saving about $14 in program benefits for every $1 spent conducting CDRs; however, these children constitute less than 1 percent of the SSI disabled population.

In companion reports, we identified two options for improving the CDR process\u2014one that could make CDRs more cost-effective and one that would strengthen return-to-work efforts.

The current system, in which periodic CDRs are scheduled for all SSI recipients, including those with virtually no potential for medical improvement, is a costly approach to identifying the approximately 5 percent of recipients who are likely to have improved to the point of being found ineligible for benefits. Furthermore, the frequency of CDRs is currently based on medical improvement classifications that do little to identify those most likely to have their benefits terminated as a result of a CDR. We found that the estimated likelihood of benefit termination was very similar for recipients classified as MIE and MIP. In addition, although millions of dollars are spent annually to conduct periodic CDRs, some individuals, especially DI beneficiaries for whom SSA is not conducting CDRs, have received benefits for years without having any contact with SSA regarding their disability or their ability to return to work despite continuing disability.", "We recommended in these reports a three-pronged approach to increasing the cost-effectiveness of CDRs while maintaining program integrity. Specifically, we recommended that SSA replace the routine scheduling of CDRs with a new process that, if extended by the Congress to all recipients, would (1) be cost-effective by selecting for review individuals with the greatest potential for medical improvement and subsequent benefit termination, (2) correct a weakness in SSA\u2019s current CDR process by reviewing a random sample of all other recipients, and (3) improve program integrity by instituting contact with those not selected for CDRs or financial eligibility redeterminations. As part of this effort, we also recommended that the Commissioner of Social Security develop a legislative package to obtain the authority the agency needs to enact this new process for those portions of the SSI and DI populations that are subject to routinely scheduled CDRs.", "Less rigid requirements regarding the frequency of CDRs are necessary if CDRs are to be conducted primarily on those recipients whose cases are most cost-effective to review\u2014that is, those recipients with the greatest potential for medical improvement. But to maintain program integrity, SSA must keep abreast of the potential for medical improvement of all recipients. Currently, SSA excludes MINE recipients and those aged 59 and older from the selection process altogether. We believe this weakness in the current process could be addressed by conducting CDRs on a random sample of recipients in these or other categories that SSA decides in the future are less cost-effective to review.", "Instituting periodic contact with recipients who are not chosen for CDRs or financial eligibility redeterminations can help protect program integrity by reminding recipients that their medical conditions are being monitored and serving as a deterrent to abuse by those no longer medically eligible for benefits. More specifically, we believe that a new type of brief mailed contact would, at a minimum, allow SSA to contact a majority of recipients with overdue CDRs in the year it is implemented to remind them of their responsibility to report medical improvements. SSA could also use such contact to gather information to support ongoing or planned initiatives, such as SSA\u2019s return-to-work initiatives or planned improvements to the CDR process.", "Some SSA officials expressed concern about the cost of this new type of mailed contact with recipients. Although some administrative funds would be used for the contact that might have been used for CDRs or other activities, the contact should result in significant program savings because of the considerable number of recipients who, on the basis of SSA\u2019s experience, can be expected to refuse repeatedly to provide the requested information and, as a result, have their benefits terminated after a prescribed due-process procedure is followed. On the basis of SSA\u2019s experience with CDRs and financial eligibility redeterminations, we assume that about 1 percent of the SSI recipients who were contacted would have their benefits terminated for noncooperation. This benefit termination rate represents a onetime net federal savings of about $230 million from contacting SSI recipients due or overdue for CDRs in fiscal year 1996.

Currently, through contacts during the CDR process, SSA generally provides little support and assistance to help recipients become self-sufficient. When conducting full medical CDRs, SSA obtains information on VR services received since the initial application or last CDR. However, SSA and DDS staff are neither required nor instructed to assess recipients\u2019 work potential, make recipients aware of rehabilitation services, or encourage them to seek VR services. SSA provides limited encouragement through mailer CDRs by asking respondents to indicate whether they are interested in rehabilitation or other services that could help them obtain work.

For purposes of our analyses, we took a random sample of 15 percent of those recipients stratified by whether the (1) recipient was an adult or a child and (2) DDSs had classified as medical improvement expected (MIE), possible (MIP), or not expected (MINE). We eliminated from our sample recipients whose CDR due dates were after fiscal year 1996 or who were over age 65.

From the SSIRD, we obtained information on age, gender, race, impairment, length of time receiving benefits, and length of time overdue for a CDR. Because information obtained from OD did not always differentiate between adult MIE and MIP recipients, we used SSIRD data to classify adults into the two categories. From OD\u2019s CDR database, we obtained information on (1) medical improvement classifications for all children and for adults classified as MINE and (2) estimates of the likelihood of benefit termination for adult MIE and MIP recipients, the only recipient categories for whom likelihood of benefit termination estimates were available.", "Because we used a sample to estimate characteristics of the universe of recipients due or overdue for CDRs in fiscal year 1996, the reported estimates in tables II.2 through II.4 have sampling errors associated with them.

The size of the sampling error reflects the precision of the estimate\u2014the smaller the sampling error, the more precise the estimate. In appendix II, the tables in which we report recipients\u2019 characteristics contain sampling errors for reported estimates calculated at the 95-percent confidence level. This means that the chances are about 95 out of 100 that the range defined by the estimate, plus or minus the sampling error, contains the true percentage.

We estimated that the number of recipients scheduled for a CDR would be about 236,000 recipients, the number planned for fiscal year 1996.

We estimated that the mailed contact would be responsible for only the first 5 years of savings resulting from terminating SSI recipients\u2019 benefits because of failure to cooperate. We used 5 years for our period of savings because, given SSA\u2019s system for scheduling financial eligibility redeterminations, all SSI recipients would have been contacted at least once within 5 years of the mailed contact.

To develop the formulas to estimate the likelihood of benefit terminations for child SSI recipients, SSA plans to conduct reviews of children by selecting cases from across the range of impairments. According to SSA, this process expansion is not expected to begin until about fiscal year 1998 because of new legislation eliminating the individualized functional assessment (IFA) component of disability eligibility criteria for child recipients. An SSA official explained that the agency is close to validating the use of the formulas for MINEs and plans to begin conducting CDRs on this group in fiscal year 1997. Included in this process expansion will be MINEs who are classified as such because they are older rather than because of their impairment. SSA believes that these age-classified MINEs may be cost-effective to review because some of them may have improved medically to the extent that they are no longer disabled. At this time, SSA does not have any plans to include the MINEs who are classified as such because they are believed to have permanent disabilities.", "SSA also plans to pursue two approaches for the collection of medical treatment information about recipients. First, SSA has plans to develop a new type of low-cost mailer CDR to be sent to recipients\u2019 physicians and other treating sources. At this time, SSA only selects individuals for CDRs from among the groups with the highest and lowest estimated likelihood of benefit termination for full medical and mailer CDRs, respectively. SSA officials explained that they do not conduct CDRs on SSI recipients or DI beneficiaries with likelihood of benefit termination estimates in the middle range because they believe the formulas do not adequately distinguish between these individuals for purposes of determining who in this group should receive full medical CDRs. According to SSA, if it conducted mailer CDRs on the middle group, this would likely result in more beneficiaries being subsequently referred for full medical CDRs than would be cost-effective. Similarly, if it conducted full medical CDRs on the middle group, it would be using a higher-cost process than SSA believes is necessary for some in this group. SSA believes the new mailer CDR to physicians and other treating sources would provide information about medical conditions and treatments received that would help SSA to determine who in the middle group has a likelihood of benefit termination warranting a full medical CDR.", "Second, SSA plans to obtain Medicaid data and integrate the data into the statistical formulas to increase the validity of the estimated likelihood of benefit termination. SSA expects that the additional information will also allow it to better identify the appropriateness of a mailer or full medical CDR for recipients with estimates of the likelihood of benefit termination in the middle range. Given that the majority of SSI recipients and DI beneficiaries for whom likelihood of benefit termination is estimated fall into the middle range of estimates, these CDR process enhancements are particularly critical to SSA\u2019s ability to meet its CDR goals over the next 7 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Savings Resulting From SSI CDRs", "paragraphs": ["Our calculations of present value savings are based on estimates provided by SSA and the Health Care Financing Administration and assumptions provided by the Congressional Budget Office on offsetting Food Stamp and AFDC costs.

Table IV.1 contains the present value of federal savings per CDR termination. As the table indicates, the present value of savings to the federal government per CDR termination is, for adults, $42,000 and for children, $33,000. This means, for example, that for every adult for whom a CDR results in a termination, the federal government could expect to save, on average, $42,000 (in constant 1996 dollars) that it would have paid over the recipient\u2019s lifetime had benefits not been terminated.", "The savings for children are less than those for adults, primarily because, even after being terminated from the SSI program, a majority of children would continue to qualify for Medicaid benefits on the basis of their families\u2019 economic status or their participation in AFDC.
