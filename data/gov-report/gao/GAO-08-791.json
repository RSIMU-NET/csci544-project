The CNMI is subject to most U.S. laws but has administered its own immigration system, including admitting foreign workers, tourists, and foreign investors. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Interior, Labor, and State, and the Attorney General, has the responsibility to establish a transition program. GAO was asked to review how the legislation's implementation may affect the CNMI economy, in particular the CNMI's (1) labor market, including foreign workers; (2) tourism sector; and (3) foreign investment. This report is based on GAO's March 2008 report (GAO-08-466) and analysis of data on the CNMI's labor market, tourism sector, and foreign investment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The potential impact on the CNMI's labor market of the recent legislation applying U.S. immigration law will largely depend on decisions that the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Labor (DOL) make in implementing a required permit program for foreign workers. The interaction of DHS and DOL decisions about, respectively, the number of permits to allocate annually and whether and when to extend the permit program past 2014 will significantly affect employers' access to foreign workers. However, federal agencies have not yet identified an interagency process to coordinate such decisions. Further, the agencies may have difficulty obtaining relevant data on the CNMI labor market. Given foreign workers' prominence in key CNMI industries, any substantial and rapid decline in permits for foreign workers would have a negative effect on the CNMI economy. However, federal agencies may reduce permits more modestly, resulting in minimal effects on the economy. At the same time, continuing declines in the garment industry, challenges to the tourism industry, and the scheduled increases in the minimum wage may reduce demand for foreign workers, lessening any potential adverse impact of the legislation on the economy. Although the legislation and the CNMI government have stated goals of preparing CNMI residents to replace foreign workers, factors such as the limited number of available CNMI residents may impede these efforts' effectiveness. Any impact of the recent legislation on the CNMI's tourism sector will depend largely on federal regulations specifying the countries to be included in a joint CNMI-Guam visa waiver program required by the legislation. For countries likely to be included in this program, such as Japan and South Korea, the impact is likely to be minimal. For countries that may not be part of the joint visa waiver program, possibly including China and Russia, applying for a visa from U.S. embassies or consulates will likely be more costly and more time-consuming than obtaining a visitor entry permit under CNMI immigration law. To the extent that any increase in the cost and time required to obtain a visa discourages tourists from visiting the CNMI, the legislation could negatively affect CNMI tourism. The recent legislation's impact on CNMI foreign investment will depend in part on DHS decisions regarding the application of U.S. nonimmigrant treaty investor status--\"grandfathering\"--for investors with CNMI foreign investor entry permits. However, lack of data on foreign investment in the CNMI makes it difficult to assess the likely impact of these decisions and may hamper DHS's ability to make informed decisions. Because long-term business entry permits account for a large proportion of CNMI foreign investor entry permits, more CNMI foreign investors will be grandfathered if DHS applies the status to these permit holders. Any impact on foreign investment in the CNMI will likely affect the labor market and tourism sector, and any impact on the labor market or tourism sector may also affect foreign investment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States recently enacted legislation applying U.S. immigration  law to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI),  ending decades of the CNMI\u2019s control over its own immigration system.

However, since 1978, the CNMI has administered its own immigration  system under the terms of its 1976 Covenant with the United States. The  CNMI has applied this flexibility to admit substantial numbers of foreign  workers from China, the Philippines, and other countries through a permit  program for non-U.S. citizens (noncitizens) entering the CNMI. In 2005,  these workers represented a majority of the CNMI labor force and  outnumbered U.S. citizens in most industries, including the garment  manufacturing and tourism sectors, which have been central to the CNMI\u2019s  economy. The CNMI has also admitted tourists under its own entry permit  and entry permit waiver programs and has provided various types of  admission to foreign investors. The CNMI faces serious economic  challenges, including a decline in the garment industry and fluctuation in  the tourism industry.", "The recent legislation amends the U.S.-CNMI Covenant to establish federal  control of CNMI immigration on June 1, 2009, with several CNMI-specific  provisions affecting foreign workers and investors during a transition  period that ends in 2014. The recent legislation also amends U.S.  immigration law to add the CNMI to an existing visa waiver program for  Guam visitors. The legislation\u2019s stated intent is to ensure effective border  control procedures and protect national and homeland security while  minimizing the potential adverse economic and fiscal effects of phasing  out the CNMI\u2019s own foreign worker permit program and maximizing the  CNMI\u2019s potential for economic and business growth. During the transition  period, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the  Secretaries of the Interior, Labor, and State, and the Attorney General, has  the responsibility to establish, administer, and enforce a transition  program to regulate immigration in the CNMI. Some federal decisions  require consultation with the CNMI Governor. In addition, the legislation  requires the CNMI government to provide the Secretary of Homeland  Security all immigration records or other information that the Secretary  deems necessary to assist its implementation. The transition program  includes a program providing foreign workers temporary permits to work  in the CNMI (CNMI-only work permits); the number of these permits must  be reduced to zero by the end of the transition period or the end of any  extensions of the permit program. Federal agency decisions will include,  among others, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s determination of  the numbers of CNMI-only work permits to issue annually and of the  countries to include in a joint CNMI-Guam visa waiver program for visitors  and the Secretary of Labor\u2019s determination of whether and when to extend  the CNMI-only work permit program for up to 5 years at a time past 2014.", "We were asked to examine factors that will affect the impact of the recent  legislation\u2019s implementation on the CNMI economy, in particular the  CNMI\u2019s (1) labor market, including foreign workers; (2) tourism sector;  and (3) foreign investment.

We did not review the extent to which CNMI or  U.S. laws were properly enforced or implemented. We interviewed  officials from the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), the  Interior (DOI), and Labor (DOL). In addition, we interviewed CNMI  government officials in the CNMI and in Washington, D.C., as well as  representatives of the CNMI private sector and foreign workers. We  analyzed available CNMI administrative and survey data, primarily from  2002 through 2007, related to the CNMI\u2019s labor market, tourism sector, and  foreign investment. In particular, we analyzed CNMI data on the numbers  and wages of workers from the Labor and Immigration Identification and  Documentation System (LIIDS); the 2005 Household, Income, and  Expenditures Survey (HIES); and the CNMI Department of Finance\u2019s tax  returns to compare the foreign worker labor force with that of resident  workers. We analyzed tourism data from the Marianas Visitors Authority  (MVA) and the Border Management System (BMS) to study trends in  tourist arrivals, demographic information such as tourists\u2019 countries of  origin, and the cost of tour packages from certain countries. In addition,  we analyzed foreign investment entry permit data from the CNMI  Department of Commerce. To examine the possible range of effects from  differing rates of reductions in foreign workers on the CNMI economy  under the legislation, we simulated the effect on CNMI gross domestic  product (GDP) under a number of scenarios. We did not receive some data  requested from the CNMI government, including data from LIIDS on  foreign investors and on other permit holders apart from one category of  foreign workers. Moreover, some relevant data are not collected by either  the CNMI or the federal government. While the data provided by the CNMI  government had some limitations, and we did not receive all data  requested, we determined that the available data were adequate and  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review. In addition, to describe  CNMI economic and political conditions, we consulted data from several  U.S. government sources. The scope of our study does not include foreign  workers whose documentation is not current or valid or those working in  any underground economy. In addition, we did not review federal  agencies\u2019 expected costs or operational needs in implementing the  legislation. We conducted this performance audit from June 2007 to  August 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Later, the Northern Mariana Islands  sought self-government and permanent ties to the United States. In 1976,  after almost 30 years as a trust territory, the District of the Mariana Islands  entered into a Covenant with the United States establishing the island  territory\u2019s status as a self-governing commonwealth in political union with  the United States. The Covenant grants the CNMI the right of self- governance over internal affairs and grants the United States complete  responsibility and authority for matters relating to foreign affairs and  defense affecting the CNMI.

In 1995, these two industries  accounted for about 80 percent of all employment. In addition, a 1999  study found that garment manufacturing and tourism accounted for about  85 percent of CNMI\u2019s total economic activity and 96 percent of its  exports. (See app. III for more detailed information regarding the CNMI\u2019s  economy). However, several recent developments in international trade  have caused the CNMI\u2019s garment industry to decline dramatically. In  January 2005, in accordance with World Trade Organization agreements,  the United States eliminated quotas on textile and apparel imports from  other textile-producing countries, exposing CNMI\u2019s apparel industry to  greater competition. Subsequently, the value of CNMI textile exports to  the United States dropped from $1.1 billion in 1998 to $317 million in 2007  (see fig. 1), and the number of licensed CNMI apparel manufacturers  decreased rapidly, from 34 firms in 1999 to 6 firms as of July 2008.", "In addition, the CNMI economy has been negatively affected by recent  external events\u2019 impact on the tourism industry.

Also, available services could diminish,  lessening the CNMI\u2019s attractiveness to tourists.", "Likewise, any impact on the labor market or tourism sector will likely  affect investment, including foreign investment, in the CNMI. For example,  if DHS and DOL decisions about the CNMI-only work permit decrease  employers\u2019 access to foreign workers, investors may have less incentive to  open or operate businesses in the CNMI. In addition, some foreign  investors may be reluctant to commit to long-term business plans when  future access to foreign workers is uncertain. Similarly, if excluding any  countries from the CNMI-Guam visa waiver program causes tourism from  those countries to drop, reduced demand for tourism-related products and  services in the CNMI could lessen investors\u2019 incentive to operate  businesses that provide such products and services.", "Moreover, any reduction in access to foreign workers may negatively  affect tourism and vice versa. For example, reduced access to foreign  workers to perform tourism-related tasks, such as hotel housekeeping,  could negatively affect tourism if CNMI residents were unwilling to take  such jobs, according to CNMI tourism sector representatives.

However, while the legislation states that it intends to  minimize potential adverse economic and fiscal effects on the CNMI and  to maximize its potential for future economic growth, the actual impact of  the legislation on the CNMI\u2019s labor market, tourism, and foreign  investment will depend on decisions made by federal agencies in  implementing the legislation. For example, federal decisions about how  many foreign workers to admit under the CNMI-only work permit program  and whether and when to extend the program will be important in  determining the extent of the legislation\u2019s impact on the CNMI labor  market and economy. In addition, the impact of the legislation on any one  of the sectors\u2014labor market, tourism, and foreign investment\u2014depends,  in part, on changes in the other sectors. For example, changes in access to  foreign workers could affect the viability of the tourism sector, which in  turn could affect foreign investment.", "Given the serious challenges already facing the CNMI economy, it is  critical that federal agencies implement the legislation in ways that  minimize potential adverse effects to the CNMI economy and maximize  the CNMI\u2019s potential for economic and business growth, following the  legislation\u2019s stated intent. Because the interaction of key federal decisions  involving different departments will have a significant impact on the CNMI  economy, coordination of these decisions is critical and necessitates an  established interagency process, which currently does not exist.

While the Interagency Group on  Insular Areas is one coordinating process available, we believe that DHS  should lead other relevant agencies in identifying the most effective and  sustainable process possible for coordinating implementation decisions.  DHS provided new information noting that department officials, in  collaboration with DOI officials, already have taken steps toward meeting  the recommendation\u2019s intent by sending an interagency delegation to the  CNMI to consult with government officials and the private sector on  implementing the law and addressing the related economic impact. DHS  also agreed with the intent of our recommendation on developing  strategies for obtaining critical data on the CNMI labor market and foreign  investment and said that it planned to collaborate with DOL on these  matters.", "DOI generally agreed with our findings in its written comments, saying  that the report presents a realistic picture of the uncertainties faced by  both the federal and CNMI governments and provides a good summary of  the mandates of the law. DOI noted that it had already begun discussions  with DHS, DOL, and the Departments of Justice and State to assist with  development of the CNMI\u2019s transition program. In addition, it noted that  coordination among federal agencies must also consider the duties and  responsibilities of the CNMI\u2019s local government agencies. DOI identified  two technical areas of the report in which it believed clarification was  necessary. First, it questioned the report\u2019s finding that the CNMI\u2019s  exemptions from H visa caps under the legislation would not apply past  the end of the transition period in 2014 and said it had concluded that the  transition period end does not apply to the cap exemptions. The  department said it would request that DHS coordinate with other federal  agencies and obtain a final legal determination. Our interpretation of the  law in this report is consistent with our March 2008 report and consistent  with the interpretation of the law by officials of DHS, the agency  responsible for implementing and administering the provisions of the  transition period under the legislation. In addition, we note that the  subsequent report of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources on H.R. 3079 states that the Committee intends that the H  exemptions for the CNMI and Guam be extended along with any extension  of the 5-year transition period. However, we are constrained in our  analysis to the language in the bill as is, unless amended. Second, DOI  commented that our current report should note that the law mandates that  the CNMI produce and provide required information to DHS and DOL. We  revised the report to indicate that the legislation requires the CNMI  government to provide the Secretary of Homeland Security all immigration  records or other information that the Secretary deems necessary to assist  its implementation; however, the relevant provision does not specifically  mention DOL.", "The CNMI government raised several concerns or issues about aspects of  our report methodology and analysis, which we have summarized in four  areas. First, the CNMI government commented that the GDP simulation  methodology used in the report is inadequate. It also contended that the  report\u2019s assessment of future demand for foreign workers in the CNMI is  faulty and ignores recent evidence of economic recovery. We disagree. We  believe our methodology is a sound approach for analyzing and illustrating  the potential impact of federal implementation decisions on the CNMI  economy. We explained our GDP simulation methodology in appendix VI  of the draft report. We further explain our methodological choices,  assumptions, and limitations in our response to the CNMI government\u2019s  letter (see app. XII). However, in response to the CNMI government\u2019s  comments, we clarified the report to further describe our methodology  and analysis. We also incorporated updated data provided by the CNMI  government in the report as appropriate. Second, the CNMI government  stated that this report should not be published in its present form because  its discussion of possible consequences to the CNMI economy could itself  harm the CNMI. We believe it is essential to report the key decisions facing  federal agencies and to illustrate a range of potential impacts those  decisions could have on the CNMI economy. Fully informed and  coordinated federal agencies will be best capable of making decisions that  minimize any potential adverse consequences for the CNMI economy.  Third, the CNMI government inaccurately stated that the report predicts a  substantial decline in the CNMI economy as a result of the legislation,  misstating our message that the impact of the legislation on the CNMI  economy will depend on various federal decisions. Our report\u2019s GDP  simulations illustrate a range of possible outcomes of federal decisions  regarding the CNMI-only work permit program, ranging from minimal to  substantial impact on the economy. The actual extent of the legislation\u2019s  impact on the CNMI economy will depend on the key federal decisions  related to foreign workers, tourists, and foreign investors identified in our  report, as well as other factors in the economy. In addition, our report  clearly states that the GDP simulations should not be considered  predictive of future GDP. Fourth, the CNMI government provided  alternative data to that in the draft report related to foreign investor entry  permits, and we have incorporated the new data in the report.

For that report and the current report, to  examine U.S. immigration law, we reviewed the U.S. Immigration and  Nationality Act (INA) and related regulations. To examine the relationship  between the CNMI and the United States, we reviewed the CNMI-U.S.  Covenant and the law applying U.S. minimum wage to the CNMI. We did  not review the extent to which CNMI or U.S. laws were properly enforced  or implemented. We also reviewed the recent legislation, including H.R.  3079, passed by the House of Representatives, and S. 2739, passed by the  House and Senate and signed into law as P.L. 110-229.

We also interviewed representatives of the  CNMI private sector and foreign workers.", "Additionally, to describe the CNMI\u2019s political and economic conditions, we  consulted data from U.S. government sources, such as the Department of  Commerce and the Census Bureau.", "Labor market. For information on the current numbers and wages of  foreign workers, we mainly relied on data from the Labor and Immigration  Identification and Documentation System (LIIDS) on foreign workers  with 706K permits, provided by the CNMI government. We used the LIIDS  data to determine the number of foreign workers directly affected by the  minimum wage increases. However, we did not assess the overall impact  of the minimum wage increases on the CNMI economy, including the  impact on the living standards in the CNMI, as our scope was limited to  the possible effects of the minimum wage increases on the demand for  foreign workers. When possible, we determined that average values from  this data set were consistent with other sources, such as the 2005 CNMI  Household, Income, and Expenditures Survey (HIES). However, although  we used the most recent data available from the LIIDS system, from  December 31, 2007, the CNMI government informed us that some of the  data may not be current owing to administrative backlogs; therefore, these  data do not reflect the extent to which current wages comply with recent  changes in the minimum wage laws in particular cases. In addition, we did  not receive some data requested from the CNMI government, including  data from LIIDS on permit holders apart from 706K foreign workers, such  as workers with temporary work authorization (706P) and holders of the  CNMI government employee entry permit (706B). As a result, our analysis  covers 706K foreign workers, which represent the large majority of CNMI  foreign workers according to data on entries to the CNMI contained in the  Border Management System (BMS). For other information on the foreign  worker population, and for comparison with CNMI residents and other  workers, we mainly relied on the most recent household survey conducted  in CNMI, the 2005 CNMI HIES. We identified foreign workers in the HIES  survey by those who identified their status as \u201cnot a U.S. citizen,  temporary resident.\u201d However, in addition to foreign workers, survey  respondents who identified themselves as temporary non-U.S. citizens may  include other groups, such as holders of CNMI foreign investor permits.  To determine the reliability of the survey data, we obtained written  responses to questions regarding the survey methods. To compare wages  earned by U.S. citizens and noncitizens in the CNMI, we used tax return  data provided by the CNMI Department of Finance. Because a limitation of  this data source was that we could not distinguish between noncitizens  who were permanent and temporary residents, we did not use it to obtain  information about temporary residents. In general, we determined that  available data on CNMI foreign workers were adequate and sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our review. = FWF - (t+1)*  FWF, where t is the number of periods since the beginning of the reduction  (beginning with zero), FWF is the number of CNMI-only permits at the beginning of the  period, and months is the number of months in the period until permits should be equal to  zero.  In the case of the first period (May 31, 2009, to December 31, 2014), there were 67  months; in the case of the other periods, there were 60 months (5 years).  Using this  function, higher values of b cause the decline to be larger at the end of the period.  When b  is equal to 1, the function is linear.

Based on the  intersection of DHS and DOL decisions, the date at which the permits  would have to be zero could change, resulting in a new rate of reductions  in permits available. This analysis assumed that the number of permits  would not increase, and it did not incorporate the possible effect of an  increase of fees on the number of permits sought by employers.", "To examine the possible range of effects from a reduction in foreign  workers, we calculated the effect on GDP under a range of assumptions  (see app. VI). Specifically, we varied the assumptions regarding the ability  of CNMI resident workers to substitute for foreign workers and the effect  of a reduction in labor on total production.", "Tourism. To assess the importance of each tourist market and the trends  in tourist arrivals, we analyzed visitor arrival data from 1997 through 2007  from the MVA. MVA data are generated from scanned customs forms and  do not identify visitors by CNMI entry permit type (including the 703A  tourist entry permit). We determined that MVA data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. We did not receive sufficient BMS data from the  CNMI government on visitors to allow us to analyze the size of each tourist  market and related trends. We interviewed MVA representatives, who  explained to us the process they use to collect the data. We also compared  the aggregate visitor numbers to the ones from BMS, and the two are  generally consistent. MVA also provided us with information on the cost of  tour packages from Japan, Korea, and the People\u2019s Republic of China. In  addition, we reviewed visa interview wait times reported by the U.S.  Department of State. We previously found that these data are not  sufficiently reliable to determine the number of posts with 30 or more days  of wait time. However, we report these data to illustrate the ranges of  possible wait times.", "Foreign investment. We analyzed foreign investor entry permit data  from the CNMI Department of Commerce. The department provided data  tables on foreign investor and business entry permits issued, based on  administrative information maintained by department staff. Although the  data were limited to entry permits issued, did not give any information on  the value of investment other than category of permit issued, and did not  reflect whether entry permit holders were present in the CNMI, we  determined that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  review. We did not receive some data requested from the CNMI  government, including data from LIIDS on foreign investors. This  information would have included the current numbers of foreign investors  holding each type of entry permit and would have allowed us to compare  numbers of entry permit holders with CNMI Department of Commerce  data. Without LIIDS data on foreign investors, we were unable to verify  whether the holders of foreign investor entry permits issued were present  in the CNMI, nor did we know the total number of holders of perpetual  foreign investor permits. However, in its comments on a draft of this  report, the CNMI government said that our analysis of data on permits  issued conflicted with CNMI Department of Commerce data. The CNMI  government provided the number of active and valid long-term business  and perpetual foreign investor entry permits, as well as the numbers of  businesses associated with these permits, as of July 8, 2008, based on the  CNMI Department of Commerce\u2019s manual review of its files. These data  were not previously provided to us. The new data do not include  information on issued entry permits and do not include complete  information on country of origin and other characteristics. The  information provided on the numbers of long-term business and perpetual  foreign investor entry permit holders is generally consistent with the data  on permits issued; therefore, we have replaced the information in the draft  report with the new data provided. In addition, some data on CNMI foreign  investment, including overall levels of foreign investment, are not  collected by either the CNMI or the federal government.", "In general, to establish the reliability of the data that we used for reporting  trends and statistics for the CNMI labor market, tourism, and foreign  investment, we systematically obtained information about the way in  which data were collected and tabulated.

The CNMI\u2019s unique trading relationship with the United States during this  time period, its appeal as a tourist destination, and its proximity to tourists  and inexpensive foreign labor from Asia helped the CNMI build a  prosperous economy based on its garment and tourist sectors.  Specifically, as long as certain conditions were met, garments  manufactured in the CNMI could be sold to buyers in the United States  without incurring import tariffs, and there were no quotas on imports of  garments to the United States from the CNMI. In addition, these garments  could bear labels identifying them as having been made in the United  States. These features gave garment manufacturers in the CNMI greater  access to the U.S. market and, therefore, an advantage over garment  manufacturers from neighboring countries. In addition, the CNMI\u2019s local  authority over immigration and the minimum wage, as well as other  factors, meant that CNMI industry had access to a large supply of  inexpensive foreign labor.", "Fueled by a rapidly growing tourism and garment industry, the CNMI had  one of the fastest growing economies in the world since 1978 and had an  employment growth rate of 12.7 percent annually between 1980 and 1995,  which was eight times that of the U.S growth rate over that period. The  number of visitors to the CNMI rose from 100,000 in 1980 to almost  700,000 in 1995. Both the garment and tourist industries contributed  directly to the economy by generating employment and bringing revenue  from outside the CNMI via exports. In 1995, these two industries  accounted for about 80 percent of all employment. In addition, a 1999  study found that garment manufacturing and tourism accounted for about  85 percent of CNMI\u2019s total economic activity and 96 percent of its exports.  In 1999, the garment industry directly employed about 16,000 workers,  including 13,500 foreign workers and 2,500 local residents. The tourist  industry directly employed about 9,600 workers in 1995, including 6,900  foreign workers and 2,700 local residents.", "However, several recent developments in international trade have caused  the CNMI\u2019s garment industry to decline dramatically. In January 2005, in  accordance with World Trade Organization agreements, the United States  eliminated quotas on textile and apparel imports from other textile- producing countries, leaving CNMI\u2019s apparel industry to operate under  stiffer competition, especially from low-wage countries such as China.  With its trade advantage lessened, the CNMI\u2019s garment industry has  shrunk. The value of CNMI textile exports to the United States decreased  from $1.1 billion in 1998 to $317 million in 2007. As a result, the number of  employees working in the garment industry has fallen from 21,000 garment  workers in 2001 to 14,000 in 2006. According to CNMI government  officials, the number of garment workers has fallen to 1,751 as of July  2008. In addition, there were 34 licensed CNMI apparel manufacturers in  1999; however, as of July 2008, only 6 firms remained in operation.", "In addition to the garment industry, the CNMI economy depends heavily  on the tourism industry, which has also been negatively affected in recent  years by various external events. For example, due to the CNMI\u2019s  proximity to Asia, Asian economic trends have a direct impact on the  CNMI\u2019s economy. For example, tourism in the CNMI experienced a sharp  decline in the late 1990s due to the Asian financial crisis and due to the  cancellation of Korean Air service to the CNMI following an airplane crash  on Guam in August 1997 (see fig. 11). In addition, the tourism industry in  the CNMI faltered again with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on  the United States. In 2003, according to CNMI officials, tourism slowed in  reaction to the SARS epidemic, which originated in Asia, and the war in  Iraq. Tourism in the CNMI is also subject to changes in airline practices.  For example, Japan Airlines withdrew its direct flights between Tokyo and  Saipan in October 2005, raising concerns because roughly 30 percent of all  tourists and 40 percent of Japanese tourists arrive in the CNMI on Japan  Airlines\u2019 flights, according to CNMI and DOI officials. A mitigating factor is  Northwest Airlines\u2019 new daily nonstop flights between Osaka and Saipan,  which are expected to replace about 40 percent of the seats lost from  Japan Airlines\u2019 action. In addition, according to press reports, Northwest  Airlines recently announced that it will double its direct flights between  Saipan and Tokyo starting in July 2008, which is expected to bring an  additional 60,000 Japanese tourists to the CNMI. Furthermore, the CNMI  government noted in its comments on a draft of this report that Asiana  Airlines has also recently increased service capacity to the CNMI.", "Total visitor arrivals to the CNMI dropped from a peak of 736,117 in 1996  to 389,345 in 2007, a decline of nearly 47 percent (see fig. 11). The number  of visitors from Japan\u2014which accounts for the highest percentage of  visitors\u2014decreased 23 percent from 2005 to 2006 and 26 percent from  2006 to 2007. At the same time, the CNMI has experienced an influx of  Chinese tourists in recent years, with the potential to re-energize the  industry. The Chinese share of the CNMI\u2019s visitors increased significantly  from 0.4 percent in 1997 to 10 percent in 2007. CNMI officials are  optimistic that the number of Chinese visitors will continue to increase in  the future, especially on the island of Tinian, which already has gambling  and hotel facilities owned and operated by Chinese interests from Hong  Kong.", "According to business groups, the CNMI retains certain advantages in  attracting foreign investment compared with nearby competitors, as well  as the United States. The CNMI\u2019s relationship with the United States  provides the CNMI with political stability and the protections afforded to  businesses under the U.S. federal court system. In addition, the CNMI\u2019s tax  structure has enabled the CNMI to maintain low individual and corporate  income tax rates. For example, residents of the CNMI pay no federal  income tax on income derived from sources in the CNMI. In addition,  corporations organized in the CNMI are generally treated as foreign  corporations for U.S. tax purposes and do not pay federal tax on income  earned in the CNMI, but they are generally subject to federal tax on any  income earned in the United States. Finally, the tropical climate and  natural beauty of the CNMI, as well as its close proximity to major Asian  markets, also create unique investment opportunities, particularly for  tourism. However, the CNMI government has identified addressing  infrastructure challenges as key to attracting new foreign investment.
