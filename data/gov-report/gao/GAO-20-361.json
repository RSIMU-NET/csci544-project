However, selected GSA regional officials and brokers expressed concerns about the accuracy of the market reports used to calculate these cost savings. Additionally, while GSA has identified various outcome-based metrics related to its leasing program, these metrics do not indicate whether using brokers to supplement its leasing workforce has enabled GSA to complete leasing work it would have otherwise been unable to complete. For example, GSA sets targets for and tracks the number of leases assigned to brokers each year, but this measure is not an indicator of the effectiveness of using brokers.

Based on that analysis,  GSA concluded that contracting for brokers to negotiate leases  nationally represented the best option available and formalized the  program as the National Broker Contract program.

For example, in 2007, we found that  GSA was unable to quantify savings from the program and recommended  that GSA develop processes for doing so. In response to our  recommendation, GSA conducted a comparative analysis of prior agency  contracts and broker contracts; this analysis demonstrated program cost  savings. However, GSA\u2019s subsequent efforts to demonstrate continued  cost savings were less conclusive. For example, in 2012, when GSA  attempted to compare rental rates negotiated by brokers with those  negotiated by in-house staff, the agency found little difference between  the two and noted that the data were insufficient to conduct a meaningful  comparison. In 2013, we found that GSA had not linked its goals and  metrics for evaluating the broker program to the anticipated cost savings  in rental rates. As a result, GSA had no means of evaluating and  reporting on this aspect of the program, and the value of the broker  program in terms of cost savings continued to be unclear. We  recommended that GSA link program goals to anticipated cost savings  and develop and implement a means of evaluating and reporting program  results.

In 2015,  GSA changed the program\u2019s name to the GSA Leasing Support Services  program (GLS). Under this version of the program, GSA moved from  using four brokers on a nationwide basis to designating brokers within  four geographical zones. GSA awarded contracts to two or three brokers  for each zone (see table 1). Thus, each GLS contract covers a zone  rather than the entire country, as was previously done under the National  Broker Contract. Currently, there are six GLS brokers, and each broker  can serve up to two zones. Of the six GLS brokers, five participated in  the National Broker Contract programs.", "According to GSA officials, modifying the program to operate by zone  provided a greater opportunity to involve more brokers, increase  competition and local market specialization, and strengthen relations  among brokers and GSA regional offices. In addition, awarding contracts  by zones rather than the entire country has allowed small businesses to  participate as brokers, and GSA selected two small-business brokers as  prime contractors: Carpenter Robbins Commercial Real Estate, Inc., and  Public Properties LLC. Multiple GSA regional offices oversee and  monitor brokers within each zone, except for the National Capital region,  which is its own zone. In early 2020, GSA plans to announce the brokers  that will be involved in the fourth iteration of the program. In this iteration,  called GLS Plus, the zones and number of brokers within each zone will  remain the same.", "In addition to establishing the zones, GSA has also allowed its regional  staff to have more flexibility in deciding how to use brokers. During the  past two iterations of the National Broker Contract, brokers had to be involved during the entire leasing process. In the GLS program, regional  GSA officials choose broker services for specific parts of the leasing  process based on the needs of the region. For example, several regional  officials said they could now request brokers to perform market research  or negotiate a lease, while GSA staff performs other tasks to complete a  lease. Officials in three of the six regional offices we interviewed said  this change provided additional flexibility in how GSA involves the brokers  in the leasing process and helped balance the workload of GSA staff.

GSA officials told us they typically task brokers to negotiate  these high-to-moderate value leases because brokers are paid through  commissions as a percentage of the lease\u2019s value. Since they earn more  money with high value leases, they have a greater incentive to participate  in the program. Consistent with what GSA officials said, the agency\u2019s  leasing data showed that leases involving brokers tended to have large  square-footage and higher rents than the rents for leases that did not  involve brokers, as shown in table 2. According to GSA\u2019s leasing data  from October 2005 to July 2019, the agency used brokers in about 37  percent of all leases.", "Available data did not clearly demonstrate the extent to which brokers  negotiated lower lease rates than GSA\u2019s in-house staff for similar types of  properties. Although there are differences in rental rates and other  outcomes of leases involving brokers compared to those that do not, it is  difficult to determine whether these differences are due to having brokers  involved in the process as opposed to the characteristics of the leases  themselves. Various factors affect rental rates in federal leases, such as  local market areas, type of facility, square footage, and unique  requirements, among other issues. According to the Public Buildings  Service\u2019s Commissioner, brokers are more successful at negotiating  lower lease rates relative to the market than GSA in-house staff and using  brokers provides savings to the government. GSA officials said they  believe this result is in part because brokers negotiate what are called  \u201ccommission credits\u201d\u2014a percentage of the total commission that goes  back to the federal tenant agency in the form of a reduction in rent\u2014 which can result in lower costs for federal tenant agencies. In contrast,  several lessors (property owners) said that when GSA uses brokers to  negotiate leases, broker commissions have to be paid by the lessor and  that this cost is ultimately passed on to GSA\u2019s federal-agency-tenant  clients. Furthermore, three real estate economists we interviewed  indicated that real-estate sale prices and rental rates are driven primarily  by competitive market forces and thus would not be heavily influenced by  broker negotiation. These economists were not aware of any research  indicating that brokers could affect commercial real estate rental rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Broker Leases Include Commissions to the Broker and Credits to Tenant Agencies", "paragraphs": ["As previously noted, GSA typically tasks brokers to negotiate high-to- moderate value leases. A broker-negotiated GSA lease includes a total  commission negotiated between the lessor and the broker that represents  a percentage of the aggregate lease value. This total commission is  comprised of the standard commission paid to the broker and commission  credits given back to the federal tenant agency. In the GLS program, the  total commission sometimes includes a \u201cbest value\u201d commission that a  broker may earn on top of the standard commission. This total  commission includes the following three components:  Standard Commissions. The standard commission a broker earns is  normally a percentage of the total lease value. Our analysis showed that  brokers earned about $390 million in standard commissions since fiscal  year 2006 (see table 3). For the GLS program, brokers had earned just  over $35 million as of July 2019. At the time of our review, the program  was ongoing, and brokers were still completing leases.", "Best Value Commission. Under the GLS, in addition to the standard  commission that a broker always earns, the broker can be paid an  additional commission, called the \u201cbest value commission,\u201d by negotiating  a lease rate below an established market rate target and earning high  evaluation ratings from GSA. Specifically, the best value commission was  expected to incentivize brokers to negotiate lower rental rates. This best  value commission is paid out of the commission credit the tenant agency  would otherwise receive and does not increase the total cost of the  commission. As of July 2019, brokers had collected about $3.5 million in  best value commissions during the GLS program. GSA plans to eliminate  the best value commission in the new iteration of its broker program, GLS  Plus. Officials said determining whether brokers met the best value  criteria was burdensome for regional officials and that brokers prefer a  steady volume of future government leases as an incentive. Similarly, two  real estate economists we interviewed said that the best value  commission was unnecessary to incentivize brokers to seek the best  rates for their GSA client, and that the prospect of additional future  business negotiating government leases was a sufficient incentive.", "Commission credits. The commission credit is a percentage of the total  commission that goes back to the federal tenant agency in the form of a  reduction in rent. As part of the total commission, brokers have negotiated  over $340 million in commission credits. GSA estimates that its future  GLS Plus program will generate $129 million in commission credits  throughout the duration of the program.", "Lessors and real estate economists we interviewed highlighted various  issues about GSA\u2019s commission structure, including commissions paid to  the broker and commission credits paid back to the tenant agency. The  interviewees had different perspectives on whether GSA\u2019s broker  program and the current commission structure are beneficial to the  federal government.", "Some questioned whether the use of brokers saves the federal  government money. As previously noted, according to GSA officials,  lessors, through the commission, pay the brokers, which is customary  in commercial real estate. Although GSA does incur some costs from  appropriated funds because GSA officials oversee the work of  brokers, GSA officials noted that GSA does not currently use its own  appropriated funds to compensate brokers for services performed as  a part of the broker program. However, four lessors that we  interviewed said that broker commission costs are passed through to  federal tenants in their leases. These lessors questioned the benefits  of using brokers for federal leases.", "In contrast, two real estate economists we interviewed said that GSA  could potentially be missing cost-saving opportunities when brokers  are not used because rental rates are generally set by competitive  market forces, also GSA\u2019s in-house staff may not negotiate  commission credits. GSA officials, however, disagreed with this  statement, saying in-house staff generally seek to receive credit or  concessions for leases they negotiate since there is no commission to  be paid to a broker.", "Another real estate economist we interviewed indicated that paying  brokers based on a fixed price basis, versus a commission basis,  could result in lower costs to the government because this type of  payment structure could involve GSA brokers\u2019 bidding for lease  acquisition assignments in fixed-price terms only.

According to this metric, as reported by GSA, over  the last 3 years, brokers have negotiated 303 leasing deals, 60 percent of  which were below the market rate (17.8 percent below the market rate, on  average), which helped GSA avoid $676 million in costs. In addition, GSA  found that brokers negotiated better rental rates than GSA in-house staff,  on average. For example, GSA reported that in fiscal year 2018, 56  percent of leases negotiated by brokers were below the market rate  compared to 38 percent of leases negotiated by GSA in-house staff. As  discussed previously, however, there are various factors, including the  type of lease that may account for these differences.", "This metric is calculated primarily using market lease rates that GSA  determines using a tool it developed called the \u201cBullseye\u201d report. To  develop the report, GSA gathers available market data from commercial  real estate databases and compiles these data to identify local  information, analysis, and insight regarding the local real estate  submarket. According to GSA guidance, the success of the GLS  program is dependent on the brokers\u2019 negotiating competitive lease rates  through full utilization of the Bullseye report and standardized negotiation  objectives. The guidance further states that the Bullseye report should  be utilized by GSA regional offices as a tool to make informed leasing  decisions on behalf of the U.S. government and can provide the  necessary backup documentation to aid leasing personnel in their  negotiation with an offeror.", "While GSA headquarters officials noted that this tool is adequate for this  use, other GSA officials and brokers had concerns about whether the  Bullseye report accurately reflects market rates and conditions. GSA  regional officials we interviewed had mixed views on the accuracy of the  Bullseye report. For example, several officials questioned the accuracy or  noted limitations to the Bullseye report. In addition, four of the six brokers  found the Bullseye report to be rarely or only sometimes accurate. As a  result, brokers told us that they found it difficult to negotiate a rental rate  at or below the target Bullseye rate. In addition, two lessors we  interviewed agreed that the gap between the Bullseye report and local  market rates potentially affected negotiations with GSA. Furthermore,  brokers publicly questioned the accuracy of Bullseye reports in written  responses to GSA\u2019s draft solicitation for the 2020 GLS Plus program.  They also suggested that the new broker program should include an  adjudication process for revisiting Bullseye target rates.", "Selected GSA regional officials and brokers in our review identified  several factors that may affect the accuracy of the Bullseye reports:  Geography. According to GSA officials, the Bullseye report includes  market rates from over 85 major markets in the U.S. However, GSA  regional officials and brokers we interviewed said that the Bullseye report  provides limited submarket rental rates for specific areas or  neighborhoods within large metropolitan areas. This can be problematic  because there can be significant rental differences among different areas  within a given market. For example, in response to GSA\u2019s draft solicitation  for the new broker program, brokers stated that they found the Bullseye  target rates to be an obstacle in the rapidly moving West Coast urban  markets, and there can be significant discrepancies between Bullseye  rates and actual market rates. One selected GSA regional office in our  review provided examples of the Bullseye target rate being below the  market rate in several instances. For example, the average asking rent for  office space in San Diego, CA, was 36 percent higher than the Bullseye  rate.", "Federal requirements. According to GSA regional officials and to  brokers, the Bullseye report does not take into account the unique  building requirements for federal leases. For example, GSA officials and  brokers reported that the Bullseye report develops a target rental rate  based on certain classes of buildings (A, B, and C). Although the  government generally accepts A and B class buildings, C buildings are  generally unacceptable for federal leases. Brokers we interviewed said  including these C building rates could lower the market rates identified by  the Bullseye market report for certain areas. GSA officials said they are  not able to remove the C building rates from the Bullseye report because  the data are purchased from a private-sector data source that includes  various building rates from a local area. In addition, brokers said the  Bullseye report does not take into account the unique requirements of  federal buildings. For example, federal law enforcement agencies require  certain security measures, such as special entrances. Brokers reported  that landlords may increase their pricing to account for these factors.  Brokers also identified these issues in the draft solicitation for the new  broker contract, noting that the Bullseye does not use comparable  buildings that take into account the uniqueness of a specific space  requirement.", "Lag time. Several brokers and GSA officials told us that federal leases  generally take significantly longer than commercial leases due to the  federal leasing acquisition process. As a result, GSA officials and brokers  found that by the time a lease was awarded, which could be years later,  the initial target market rate provided by the Bullseye report was outdated.  GSA headquarters officials told us if the Bullseye report is over a year old,  then an updated report should be requested, although it\u2019s not mentioned  by the 2016 Bullseye guidance memo. Officials from selected GSA  regional offices varied on whether those updates occurred or not.  Furthermore, several brokers in our review told us that they found that the  Bullseye report is not always updated after a year. One broker told us that  there have been several instances when a lease is about to be  awarded\u2014which can be 1 to 2 years after the initial Bullseye report was  generated\u2014and the tenant agency is not willing to accept the rental rates  negotiated in the lease. Or GSA\u2019s leasing staff is hesitant to execute the  lease due to differences between the Bullseye rate and the actual lease  contract rate. This can cause significant delays or result in the project  being canceled all together.", "Concerns about the reliability of the Bullseye report call into question  whether the Lease Cost Relative to Market metric can accurately  demonstrate how brokers\u2019 efforts lead to cost savings, either through  achieving rental rates below market or better rates than GSA in-house  staff. Even though GSA provided us cost-savings data in November 2019  based on this metric, at other times during our review, GSA officials  described limitations and questioned the efficacy of using this metric.  Specifically, in April 2019, GSA headquarters officials told us that GSA  had stopped using this metric because GSA found it unreliable. For  example, GSA found the comparison was not indicative of broker  effectiveness or ability to negotiate low rental rates. At that time, GSA  officials cautioned against using the Lease Cost Relative to Market data  for comparative purposes, such as comparing broker performance to in- house GSA staff performance. The officials said it is impossible to assess  the financial information of a lease transaction and evaluate a specific  procurement method\u2014using brokers or not\u2014without talking directly to the  GSA in-house staff responsible for overseeing the procurement.  Furthermore, GSA officials told us in April 2019, that leases negotiated by  brokers were not comparable to leases negotiated by in-house staff  because they work on different types of leases. In December 2019,  however, GSA officials told us that GSA does still track this metric, uses it  for GSA\u2019s Lease Cost Avoidance Plan, and that the agency believes  brokers can achieve better deals for the government than in-house staff.", "Nonetheless, GSA officials told us that they have not assessed the  reliability of or made any changes to how they calculate the Bullseye  report. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, management should use quality information to achieve the  entity\u2019s objectives and to inform decision-making.

During this review, a  key goal consistently stated by GSA officials we interviewed was the use  of the broker program as a workforce multiplier\u2014providing additional  people that enable GSA to complete leasing work it would otherwise be  unable to complete. The effectiveness of the broker as a workforce  multiplier is significant to GSA because leasing staff has decreased by  over 50 percent since the late 1990s, from over 800 personnel to less  than 400 in 2019. Consequently, GSA staff rely on brokers to deliver  leased space to federal agencies. GSA officials told us that a broker may  not accomplish a lease faster or cheaper than GSA staff but that the  agency does not currently have the personnel to complete its leasing  work. GSA\u2019s Strategic Plan 2018-2022 also states that GSA will use  brokers where appropriate to improve efficiency in awarding leases.", "Although GSA has set target goals for utilizing brokers and tracks the  number of leases regional officials assign to brokers, we found that GSA  had limited ability to track how using brokers to augment the GSA\u2019s  leasing workforce achieves results for GSA\u2019s leasing efforts. For example,  GSA has increased its broker utilization targets in recent years, as  described in figure 2, requiring regional offices to award more lease  projects to brokers. Moreover, GSA tracks performance relative to these  targets, and regional officials in our review told us that they are evaluated  based on the number of leases they task to brokers.", "Additionally, in April 2019, GSA developed a model to project, on  average, the number of hours a broker saves the GSA\u2019s lease-contracting  officer and project manager. The project estimated the broker saved  roughly 175 to 125 hours, respectively, per project over a 3-year period.  GSA then multiplied the hourly salary of GSA leasing personnel by the  potential number of hours saved to generate their reported personnel  savings of $3 million per year.", "However, tracking these outputs alone does not provide GSA with a  means to measure the effectiveness of the broker program as a  workforce multiplier. An output measure tracks the direct product or  activity delivered by a program, while an outcome measure tracks the  progress the program is making toward achieving its goal. Tracking the  number of hours a broker saves for GSA officials provides limited  information to help GSA understand the overall benefits of the broker  program as a workforce multiplier. For example, this goal does not  demonstrate if brokers are more productive than in-house staff or if they  are completing leases more efficiently, such as brokers completing an  additional number of leases on an annual basis.", "According to GSA officials, the principal way they measure broker  program outcomes is through its Lease Cost Avoidance Plan, which, as  we previously discussed, aggregates cost savings from a number of GSA  leasing efforts, including the broker program. The plan identifies realized  cost avoidance through various metrics such as leases negotiated below  market costs and reductions in rental square footage and vacant space.  However, aside from the negotiated rental rates, GSA does not currently  have specific metrics that allow it to distinguish the particular role brokers  play in achieving those results. For example, GSA officials said that the  more leases that can be replaced by using brokers, the more GSA can  tackle its expiring lease inventory and right size leases with rental square  foot reductions. Specifically, GSA officials said that brokers contributed to  a 2.5 percentage square footage reduction in fiscal years 2018 and 2019.  However, since this metric applies to the leasing program in general and  is not specific to the brokers, GSA is unable to demonstrate the extent to  which such reduction is attributable to the use of brokers.", "GSA officials also told us that using brokers allows GSA to replace more  leases on time and thus avoid extending leases, which is more costly and  can lead to agencies renting space under less favorable terms. GSA  measures this through its lease replacement rate, which tracks the  percentage of expiring leases that are replaced in a timely manner. For  example, GSA reported that in fiscal year 2019, it replaced 61 percent of  its lease inventory, which represented $481 million of its $791 million  lease inventory. However, while GSA tracks the number of lease  extensions brokers have worked on, GSA is unable to demonstrate the  extent to which the use of brokers helps GSA avoid lease extensions and  holdovers. Furthermore, similar to the Lease Cost Avoidance Plan, this  metric applies to the leasing program in general and is not specific to the  brokers. As a result, GSA has limited information on the extent to which  brokers contributed to leasing program outcomes.", "GPRA, as amended, creates a framework for articulating unified goals  and outcome measures that can provide federal agencies with a clear  direction for successful implementation of program activities and improve  the efficiency and accountability of agencies\u2019 efforts. We have  previously reported that the GPRA framework can serve as a leading  practice at other organizational levels, such as component agencies,  offices, programs, and projects. GPRA calls for outcome-based metrics  that are linked to goals, which allow a program to track the progress an  organization is making toward achieving its intended outcome. Because  GSA lacks outcome-based metrics that demonstrate the broker\u2019s role in  achieving the program\u2019s goal for being a workforce multiplier, GSA is  hindered in its ability to distinguish the role brokers played in its reported  program results. Furthermore, having such a metric could help GSA make  better decisions about the balance of brokers versus in-house leasing  staff since GSA received $34 million dollars for fiscal year 2020 to hire an  additional 34 GSA lease-contracting officers and specialists. GSA officials  said they plan to complete this hiring in 2020."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["GSA has developed a program that allows the agency to utilize expertise  and personnel from leading commercial real-estate brokers to help it  complete thousands of federal leases. GSA has stated cost savings and  workforce goals for the broker program but lacks the information  necessary to assess if the program is achieving its intended results. If  GSA envisions that the use of brokers is to save money, then having  quality, reliable data and information is critical to demonstrating this  result. If using brokers to augment GSA\u2019s workforce were also a goal,  then having outcome-based metrics would allow GSA to show whether it  is achieving that goal. This information is especially critical as the  program has changed over time and could provide GSA insight on what  has been successful in the past. This information would also inform  GSA\u2019s decision-making as it launches another version of its broker  program and uses millions of dollars in appropriated funds to increase the  agency\u2019s leasing personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to the Administrator of  GSA:  GSA should assess and address the reliability of the information used to  calculate reported cost savings for the broker program.

(Recommendation 2)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to GSA for review and comment. GSA  provided written comments, which are summarized below and reproduced  in appendix I. GSA said it did not agree with our main conclusions and  findings because it believed our report did not acknowledge brokers\u2019  demonstrated benefits. We noted throughout the report that brokers play  an important role in helping GSA achieve various leasing-related goals.  Our position is that the lack of quality data and outcome-based metrics  inhibit GSA\u2019s ability to demonstrate the brokers\u2019 specific effect in  achieving GSA\u2019s goals as compared to other factors.", "With regard to the first recommendation about data used to calculate  reported cost savings from the broker program, GSA said it concurred  with the recommendation and is making changes to its data systems that  it believes will improve its data on brokers.", "GSA said it did not agree with the second recommendation as it was  originally worded about having outcome-based measures to evaluate the  effectiveness of using brokers. In providing technical comments on our  report, GSA officials raised concerns that this recommendation gave the  impression that GSA had no metrics to assess the brokers. The agency  said that it has several outcome-based metrics in place that it believes  can be correlated with the value of the brokers, including achieving cost  savings, replacing leases on time, and reducing the need to hire more  GSA staff. In GSA\u2019s letter, it referenced these statistics, several of which  we had included in our report as well. For example, our report discusses  GSA\u2019s Lease Cost Relative to Market measure, which is a comparison of  the negotiated rental rate to a target market rate. We also noted,  however, that this metric is calculated primarily using data, that GSA staff  and other stakeholders we interviewed expressed concerns about as  unreliable. These concerns resulted in our first recommendation.", "Further, other metrics, such as reducing square footage and replacing  leases, that GSA pointed to relate to GSA\u2019s leasing efforts in general and  are not designed in a way to distinguish the brokers\u2019 contributions  specifically. Specifically, GSA officials said that brokers contributed to a  2.5 percentage square footage reduction in fiscal years 2018 and 2019.  This metric, however, applies to the overall leasing program, and GSA is  unable to demonstrate the extent to which such reduction is attributable to  the use of brokers.  In addition, GSA does not have a means to measure  the effectiveness of the broker program in supplementing its workforce to  achieve these goals, a result that GSA staff in headquarters and regional  offices consistently told us was the primary reason GSA uses brokers.  Tracking the number of hours a broker saves for GSA officials provides  limited information to help GSA understand the overall benefits of the  broker program. Such information does not demonstrate if brokers are  more productive or efficient than in-house staff, such as whether brokers  are completing an additional number of leases on an annual basis, for  example. Additional metrics focused on evaluating the outcomes of  GSA\u2019s use of brokers would benefit the agency because it has lost over  50 percent of its leasing personnel since the 1990s. Furthermore, GSA  received $34 million to hire additional agency lease-contracting officers  and specialists in 2020. Consequently, it is imperative that it has  information and data that could inform the right mix of brokers and GSA  leasing personnel as the agency moves forward with its leasing work.", "In response to GSA\u2019s concerns and to make our recommendation more  specific, we clarified the recommendation. Specifically, we focused it  more narrowly on the need to evaluate the effectiveness of using brokers  to supplement the GSA leasing workforce.
