To send a consult  request, providers log on to the system and complete an electronic  consult request template that may be customized by the VAMC\u2019s  applicable specialty care clinic. The template requires the requesting  provider to provide specific information, such as a diagnosis and a reason  why the specialty care is needed, and may require additional information  as determined by the specialty care clinic. For example, a gastroenterology template for abdominal pain used at one VAMC asked  the requesting provider whether the treatment should be provided in  person, reminded the provider about specific lab tests to be completed,  and asked the provider to provide a brief history of the patient\u2019s  symptoms. (See fig. 2.) This specialty care clinic had specific templates  depending on the patient\u2019s symptoms.

When reviewing a consult request, a specialty care provider  may decide not to accept it, and will send the consult back to the  requesting provider. This is referred to as discontinuing the consult, which  a specialty care provider may decide to do for several reasons, including  that the care is not needed, the patient refuses care, or the patient is  deceased. In other cases the specialty care provider may determine that  additional information is needed before accepting the consult; in such  cases, the specialty care provider will send the consult back to the  requesting provider, who can resubmit it with the needed information.", "If the provider accepts the consult, an attempt is made to contact the  patient and schedule an appointment.

Additionally, VHA could not accurately determine whether  patients actually received the care they needed, or if they received the  care in a timely fashion.

However, VHA did not require VAMCs to document these decisions or the  processes by which they were made, only to self-certify the task had been  completed. Further, VHA did not require VISNs to independently verify  that the task was completed appropriately. VAMC officials told us their  reviews indicated that for many of the consults, care had been provided,  but an incorrect clinical progress note was used. Therefore, officials had  to select the correct note that corresponded to each consult, which  completed the consult in the system. In addition, officials also told us that  they discontinued many other consults because they found that patients  were deceased or that patients had repeatedly cancelled appointments  and thus, they determined that care was no longer needed. However,  none of the five VAMCs in our review were able to provide us with  specific documentation of these decisions and rationales. At one VAMC,  for example, we found that a specialty care clinic discontinued 18  consults the same day that a task for addressing unresolved consults was  due. Three of these 18 consults were part of our random sample, and we  found no indication that a clinical review was conducted prior to the  consults being discontinued. The lack of documentation is not consistent  with federal internal control standards, which indicate that all transactions  and other significant events need to be clearly documented and stress the  importance of the creation and maintenance of related records, which  provide evidence of execution of these activities.", "In addition to monitoring VAMC performance in completing the consult  business rules initiative tasks, VHA officials told us they are continuing to  monitor VAMCs\u2019 performance in addressing unresolved consults. In 2012,  VHA estimated that approximately 2 million consults in its system were  unresolved for more than 90 days. According to a VHA June 2014 consult  tracking report, 285,877 consults were unresolved. attributed this reduction in the number of unresolved consults to  implementation of the consult business rules initiative and their continued  monitoring of VAMC performance in meeting VHA\u2019s consult timeliness  guideline. Given the thousands of consults that have been closed by  VAMCs, the lack of documentation and independent verification of how  VAMCs addressed these unresolved consults raises questions about the  reliability of VHA consult data and whether the data accurately reflects  whether patients received the care needed in a timely manner, if at all.", "VHA officials told us that this number changes daily and expects it to continue to decline  as VAMCs continue to resolve consults open more than 90 days.", "VAMCs were instructed to track future care consults either by developing markers so  such consults could be identified in the consult system, or by using existing mechanisms  outside of the consult system such as an electronic wait list. The electronic wait list is a  component of the VistA scheduling system designed for recording, tracking, and reporting  veterans waiting for medical appointments. completing this task, we found that each of the five VAMCs initially  implemented strategies for managing future care consults that were,  wholly or in part, non-approved VHA options. For example, one VAMC  reported to us that initially its staff entered consult requests for future care  into the consult system without the use of a future care flag, and  subsequently discontinued these consults if they reached the 90-day  threshold. Discontinuing future care consults closed them in the consult  system, and thus prevented the consults from being monitored, which  may have increased the risk of the VAMC losing track of these requests  for specialty care. Further, during the course of our work, officials from  three VAMCs reported revising their initial strategies for managing future  care consults. (See table 3.) Some of these VAMCs continued to  implement strategies that were non-approved VHA options and could  have resulted in consult data that failed to distinguish future care consults  from those that were truly delayed.", "According to federal internal control standards, managers should perform  ongoing monitoring, including independent assessments of  performance. However, because VHA officials relied on self- certifications submitted by VAMCs, they were not aware of the extent to  which VAMCs implemented strategies that were not one of VHA\u2019s  approved options, nor would they be aware of the extent to which VAMCs  have since changed their strategies. As of June 2014, VHA officials told  us they did not have detailed information on the various strategies  VAMCs have implemented to manage future care consults, and they  acknowledged that they had not conducted a system-wide review of  VAMCs\u2019 strategies.", "Furthermore, VHA does not have a formal process by which VAMCs  could share best practices system-wide. control standards, identifying and sharing information is an essential part  of ensuring effective and efficient use of resources. We found that  VAMCs may not be benefiting from the challenges and solutions other  VAMCs discovered when implementing strategies for managing future  care consults. For example, during our review, we found that one VAMC  revised its initial strategy in a way that another VAMC had already found  ineffective. Officials at that VAMC stated that they were implementing a  new strategy to manage future care consults in a separate electronic  system. However, another VAMC opted not to use a similar electronic  system it piloted after finding that it confused providers and required  extensive training; that VAMC opted instead to use future care markers in  its consult system. A more systematic identification and sharing of best  practices for managing future care consults would enable VAMCs to more  efficiently implement effective strategies for managing specialty care  consults.", "Officials from VAMCs in our review described sharing best practices with colleagues at  other VAMCs in their VISN on an ad hoc basis. standardized data needed for conducting oversight. Additionally,  according to federal internal control standards, management is  responsible for developing the detailed policies, procedures, and  practices to fit their agency\u2019s operations and to ensure that they are built  into, and an integral part of, operations.", "However, we found that VHA has not developed a detailed, system-wide  policy on how to address patient no-shows and cancelled appointments,  two frequently noted causes of delays in providing care. Instead, VHA  policies provide general guidance that state that after a patient does not  show for or cancels an appointment, the specialty care clinic staff should  review the consult and determine whether or not to reschedule the   VHA officials told us that they allow each VAMC to  appointment. determine its own approach to managing these occurrences. However,  such variations in no-show and cancellation policies are reflected in the  consult data, and as a result, this variation may make it difficult to assess  and compare VAMCs\u2019 performance. For example, if a specialty care clinic  allows a patient to cancel multiple specialty care appointments, the  consult would remain open and could inaccurately suggest delays in care  where none might exist. In contrast, if the specialty care clinic limited the  number of patient cancellations, the consult would be closed after the  allowed number and would not appear as a delay in care, even if a delay  had occurred.", "See VHA Directive 2010-027, VHA Outpatient Scheduling Processes and Procedures  (June 9, 2010) and VHA Directive 2008-056, VHA Consult Policy (Sept. 16, 2008). varied in its requirements.we found that specialty care providers had scheduled appointments for  127 of the consults, and that patient no-shows and cancelled  appointments were among the factors contributing to delays in providing  timely care for 66 of these consults (52 percent)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Providing our nation\u2019s veterans with timely access to medical care,  including outpatient specialty care, is a crucial responsibility of VHA.

Our review of a  sample of consults found that VAMCs did not always provide veterans  with requested specialty care in a timely manner, if at all. In other cases,  VAMCs were able to provide the needed care on a timely basis, but  specialty care providers failed to properly complete or document the  consults, making it appear as though care for veterans was delayed, even  when it was not.", "Limitations in VHA\u2019s oversight of the consult process have affected the  reliability of VHA\u2019s consult data and its usefulness for oversight. Although  VHA officials cited VAMCs\u2019 progress in reducing the backlog of consults  unresolved for more than 90 days, they have not independently verified  that VAMCs appropriately closed these consults, calling into question the  accuracy of these data. Due to their lack of oversight, VHA officials are  not aware of the various strategies VAMCs implemented to manage  future care consults, and thus when monitoring consult data, cannot  adequately determine if future care consults are distinguishable from  those that are truly delayed. Additionally, VHA has not developed a  system-wide process for identifying and sharing VAMCs\u2019 best practices  for managing future care and other types of consults; thus, VAMCs may  be implementing strategies that others already have found ineffective or  may be unaware of strategies that others have successfully implemented.  Further, VHA\u2019s decentralized approach for handling patient no-shows and  cancelled appointments, as well as other issues, makes it difficult to  compare timeliness of providing outpatient specialty care system-wide.", "Ultimately, this decentralized approach may further limit the usefulness of  the data and VHA\u2019s and VISNs\u2019 ability to assess VAMCs\u2019 performance in  managing consults and providing timely care to our nation\u2019s veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve VHA\u2019s ability to effectively oversee the consult process, and  help ensure VAMCs are providing veterans with timely access to  outpatient specialty care, we recommend that the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs direct the Interim Under Secretary for Health to take the following  six actions:", "Assess the extent to which specialty care providers across all VAMCs,  including residents who may be serving on a temporary basis, are  using the correct clinical progress notes to complete consults in a  timely manner, and, as warranted, develop and implement system- wide solutions such as technical enhancements, to ensure this is  done appropriately.", "Enhance oversight of VAMCs by routinely conducting independent  assessments of how VAMCs are managing the consult process,  including whether they are appropriately resolving consults.
