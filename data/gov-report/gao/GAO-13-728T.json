Also, GAO reported that the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense (DOD) components' officials were aware of the need to keep the number of security clearances to a minimum but were not always required to conduct periodic reviews and validations of the security clearance needs of existing positions. GAO recommended that, among other things, the Director of National Intelligence, in coordination with the Director of Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and other executive branch agencies as appropriate, issue clearly defined policies and procedures to follow when determining if federal civilian positions require a security clearance, and also guidance to require executive branch agencies to periodically review and revise or validate the designation of all federal civilian positions.

In February 2012, GAO reported that OPM received over $1 billion to conduct more than 2 million background investigations in fiscal year 2011. GAO raised concerns that OPM may be simultaneously investing in process streamlining technology while maintaining a less efficient and duplicative paper-based process. In 2012, GAO recommended that, to improve the efficiency of suitability and personnel security clearance background investigation processes that could lead to cost savings, the Director of OPM direct the Associate Director of Federal Investigative Services to take actions to identify process efficiencies that could lead to cost savings within its background investigation process.

OPM audits, however, found inconsistency  in these position designations, and some agencies described problems in  implementing OPM\u2019s tool. In an April 2012 audit, OPM reviewed the  sensitivity levels of 39 positions in an agency within DOD and reached  different conclusions than the agency for 26 of them. Problems exist, in  part, because OPM and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  did not collaborate on the development of the position designation tool,  and because their roles for suitability\u2014consideration of character and  conduct for federal employment\u2014and security clearance reform are still  evolving. In our July 2012 report, we concluded that without guidance  from the Director of National Intelligence, and without collaboration  between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and OPM in  future revisions to the tool, executive branch agencies will continue to risk  making security clearance determinations that are inconsistent or at  improper levels.", "In July 2012, we recommended, among other things, that the Director of  National Intelligence, in coordination with the Director of OPM and other  executive branch agencies as appropriate, issue clearly defined policy  and procedures for federal agencies to follow when determining if federal  civilian positions require a security clearance.

Furthermore, our recent reviews of OPM\u2019s investigations show reasons  for continuing concern. For example, in May 2009 we reported that, with  respect to initial top secret clearances adjudicated in July 2008,  documentation was incomplete for most OPM investigative reports.

As of March 2013, however, OPM had not implemented our  recommendation to measure how frequently investigative reports meet  federal investigative standards. Instead, OPM continues to assess the  quality of investigations based on voluntary reporting from customer  agencies. Specifically, OPM tracks investigations that are (1) returned for  rework from the requesting agency, (2) identified as deficient using a  web-based survey, and (3) identified as deficient through adjudicator calls  to OPM\u2019s quality hotline. In our past work, we have noted that the number  of investigations returned for rework is not by itself a valid indicator of the  quality of investigative work because adjudication officials have been  reluctant to return incomplete investigations in anticipation of delays that  would impact timeliness. Further, relying on agencies to voluntarily  provide information on investigation quality may not reflect the quality of  OPM\u2019s total investigation workload.", "In February 2011, we noted that one of OPM\u2019s customer agencies, DOD,  had developed and implemented a tool known as Rapid Assessment of  Incomplete Security Evaluations to monitor the quality of investigations  completed by OPM.

Although the Rapid Assessment of Incomplete  Security Evaluations was one tool the reform team members planned to  use for measuring quality, according to an OPM official, OPM chose not  to use this tool.

OPM officials explained that, to date, they have chosen to address  investigation timeliness and investigation backlogs rather than the  identification of process and workforce efficiencies. To its credit, OPM  helped reduce the backlog of ongoing background investigations that it  inherited from DOD at the time of the 2005 transfer. However, only  recently has OPM started to look at its internal processes for efficiencies.  Further, while OPM invested in an electronic case-management program,  it continues to convert submitted electronic files to paper. In November  2010, the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management  and Budget testified that OPM receives 98 percent of investigation  applications electronically, yet we observed that it was continuing to use a  paper-based investigation processing system and convert electronically  submitted applications to paper. OPM officials stated that the paper- based process is required because a small portion of their customer  agencies do not have electronic capabilities. As a result, OPM may be  simultaneously investing in process streamlining technology while  maintaining a less efficient and duplicative paper-based process. In 2012,  we recommended that, to improve transparency of costs and the  efficiency of suitability and personnel security clearance background  investigation processes that could lead to cost savings, the Director of  OPM direct the Associate Director of Federal Investigative Services to  take actions to identify process efficiencies that could lead to cost savings  within its background investigation process.

OMB concurred with our recommendation. As of  March of this year, however, OMB has not expanded and specified  reform-related guidance to help ensure that reform stakeholders identify  opportunities for cost savings.
