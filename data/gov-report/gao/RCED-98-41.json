This program\u2014administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u2014is the nation\u2019s largest food assistance program and provided about $22.5 billion in benefits for a monthly average of more than 25 million low-income participants in fiscal year 1996. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the changes to the Food Stamp Program, brought about by the Welfare Reform Act, will reduce the program\u2019s expenditures by a projected total of more than $23 billion over 6 years, from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal 2002.", "Among other things, the Welfare Reform Act reduced food stamps for many participants and eliminated them, except under certain conditions, for two groups\u2014able-bodied adults without dependents and legal immigrants. Able-bodied adults without dependents can receive benefits only for 3 months in a 3-year period unless they meet work or training requirements. Legislation made most legal immigrants ineligible for food stamps as of August 22, 1997. While these two groups of individuals represented only 10 percent of all Food Stamp Program participants for fiscal year 1995, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the savings realized from these actions represent over 37 percent, or about $8.8 billion, of the over $23 billion in net savings expected in the Food Stamp Program from welfare reform.", "You asked us to study several issues concerning the impact of welfare reform on the Food Stamp Program. This report is the second in a series responding to that request. It focuses on the two groups of individuals that were the most likely to lose their food stamp benefits\u2014able-bodied adults without dependents and legal immigrants. Specifically, we describe the (1) actions, if any, that states have taken to assist those individuals who lose eligibility for the Food Stamp Program and (2) related actions, if any, taken by other organizations in selected localities\u2014local governments and nonprofit organizations\u2014to assist those individuals who lose their eligibility for the Food Stamp Program.", "As part of our review, we surveyed the 50 states and the District of Columbia on the actions they are taking, if any, in response to the changes in the Food Stamp Program. All 50 states and the District of Columbia responded to our survey. (See app. I for the results of the survey.) In addition, we visited with government officials and representatives of nonprofit organizations in five localities to obtain their views on what effect the changes to the Food Stamp Program may have on their agencies\u2019 or organizations\u2019 ability to meet demand for their food assistance services. Appendix II discusses our methodology in more detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Food Stamp Program helps low-income households (individuals and families) obtain a more nutritious diet by supplementing their income with food stamp benefits. In fiscal year 1996, the average monthly food stamp benefit was $73 per person. These benefits are generally provided through coupons or electronically on a debit card (similar to a bank card) that may be used to purchase food at stores authorized to receive food stamps.", "The Food Stamp Program is a federal-state partnership, in which the federal government pays the full cost of the food stamp benefits and approximately half of the states\u2019 administrative costs. USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)\u2014formerly, the Food and Consumer Service\u2014administers the program at the federal level. The states\u2019 responsibilities include certifying eligible households, calculating the amount of benefits, and issuing benefits to participants who meet the requirements set by law.", "The Welfare Reform Act overhauled the nation\u2019s welfare system and significantly changed the Food Stamp Program. In addition, the Fiscal Year 1997 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 105-18, June 12, 1997) included new authority allowing the states to purchase federal food stamps to provide state-funded food assistance for legal immigrants and able-bodied adults without dependents who are no longer eligible for federal food stamps under the Welfare Reform Act. Under the supplemental act, states are required to receive approval from FNS to distribute additional food stamps and to fully reimburse the federal government in advance for all costs associated with providing the benefits. In addition, the states\u2019 food stamp programs must be cost-neutral to the federal government.", "Changes to the Food Stamp Program included imposing time limits on those able-bodied individuals between the ages of 18 and 50 without dependents who were not working at least 80 hours a month or participating in certain kinds of employment and training programs. This work requirement was effective not later than November 22, 1996. States were required to terminate food stamps for these nonworking able-bodied adults without dependents after 3 months within any 36-month period. Disabled individuals, if they meet eligibility requirements, can still receive assistance. The act allows FNS to grant waivers to states for exempting able-bodied adults without dependents from the work requirement if they live in an area where unemployment is over 10 percent or in an area with an insufficient number of jobs. FNS generally grants waivers for a 1-year period. Once approved, these waivers may be renewed if the areas covered continue to have high unemployment or insufficient jobs. Once the waivers are approved, the states or localities can choose to either implement them in whole or in part, or choose not to implement them at all. In addition, The Balanced Budget Act (P.L. 105-33, Aug. 5, 1997) gives states the discretion to exempt certain types of able-bodied adults without dependents from the work requirement\u2014up to 15 percent of those not otherwise waived. The Balanced Budget Act also provided an additional $131 million for each of the next 4 years to the Food Stamp Program\u201480 percent of it is designated for employment and training opportunities for these adults. According to data from FNS for fiscal year 1995\u2014the latest year for which data were available\u2014in an average month, the Food Stamp Program provided benefits for 27 million people. Of these, 2.5 million were able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 50 without dependents. An estimated one-half of these adults, about 1.3 million, are subject to the 3-month time limit.", "In addition, the Welfare Reform Act and the Supplemental Appropriations Act allowed immigrants with legal status as of August 22, 1996, to retain food stamps up to August 22, 1997. However, if legal immigrants have 40 quarters or more of work history in the United States or are veterans or active duty members of the U.S. military, they may continue to retain food stamps. Spouses and minor children of veterans are also eligible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most States Taking Actions to Address Changes in Food Stamp Program", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our survey of states in the summer of 1997, the states were pursuing a variety of options to address changes in the Food Stamp Program that affected able-bodied adults without dependents and legal immigrants. Some state actions, such as job training assistance, although primarily intended to move individuals toward self-sufficiency, may have the effect of allowing some able-bodied adults without dependents to retain food stamps by meeting the act\u2019s work requirements. Twenty states provided legal immigrants with information on how to become citizens so that they can be eligible for food stamps. Other state actions are intended to replace the food stamp benefits that individuals have lost."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Are Pursuing Several Options That Allow Some Individuals to Keep Benefits", "paragraphs": ["According to our survey results, when the states notified able-bodied adults without dependents that they were subject to the work requirements in order to retain food stamps, many states told us that they chose to also notify these adults of job placement and/or training services that were available. Although these programs are intended primarily to move individuals toward self-sufficiency, participants may still receive food stamps if income and other requirements are met. For example, our survey indicated that Texas provided information on jobs and/or employment resources and training. Thirty-two states provided information about jobs and/or employment resources; 29 provided information on training; 19 provided information on workfare. In addition, 20 states helped assess an individual\u2019s employment skills. The states also offered one or more ways to meet the work requirements: 25 states counted volunteer work, 25 counted workfare, and 33 counted employment training that leads to a job.", "In addition, as allowed under the Welfare Reform Act, our survey indicated that 43 states had applied for, and 42 received, authority to waive the work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents in areas where unemployment exceeded 10 percent or in areas with insufficient jobs. (See app. III for the waiver status of each state.) FNS estimated that as many as 35 percent of the affected able-bodied adults without dependents would retain their eligibility through a waiver.", "However, 8 of the 43 states were not planning to implement their waivers\u2014either in their entirety or in part. In seven states\u2014California, Indiana, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia\u2014waivers were approved for selected regions but the local governments, which are authorized to implement the waivers, did not plan to do so. Texas planned to implement its waiver only in localities with an unemployment rate of over 10 percent. Two of the eight states or their localities had not fully implemented the waivers because they believed that it was unfair to exempt able-bodied adults without dependents from the work requirement while single mothers receiving federal assistance, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), are required to participate in work activities.", "At the time of our survey, 20 states provided or planned to provide legal immigrants\u2014who were scheduled to lose their food stamps\u2014with information on how to become U.S. citizens. In May 1997, we reported that it took between 112 and 678 days (with an average of 373 days) to process applications for citizenship at INS between June of 1994 and June of 1996. For example, it took just over 1 year to process a request for citizenship in Los Angeles\u2014a city with one of the largest immigrant populations in the nation\u2014and almost 2 years to process an application in Houston. INS officials told us that among the reasons for the significant increase in the number of applications that INS has received since fiscal year 1989 is that there are incentives to becoming a citizen because of the benefits that can be derived. Because it takes an average of over 1 year to process applications for citizenship and legal immigrants were not eligible to receive food stamps after August 22, 1997, many legal immigrants have lost their federal food stamp benefits. FNS\u2019 most current estimate is that 935,000 legal immigrants lost their federal food stamps under the welfare reform provisions. However, as of December 1997, estimates are that over one-quarter, or about 241,000, of these individuals are receiving food stamps funded by the states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Are Taking Some Actions to Offer Food Assistance to Those Losing Benefits", "paragraphs": ["For those individuals who lose federal food stamp benefits, 20 states were taking one or more actions to provide state-funded food assistance. (App. IV identifies the 20 states with food assistance programs that serve able-bodied adults without dependents and/or legal immigrants.) Ten states decided to purchase federal food stamps with their own funds for certain legal immigrants\u2014primarily children and the elderly. According to FNS and the states, 9 of the 10 states have estimated that about 241,000 legal immigrants are now receiving state-funded food stamps. Among these states are California, Florida, New York, and Texas, which, according to an FNS report, had about 70 percent of the legal immigrants receiving food stamps in fiscal year 1995\u2014the latest year for which data were available. These states will generally use the Food Stamp Program\u2019s infrastructure and benefit structure to deliver food assistance, according to FNS. For example, Washington State appropriated just over $60 million for fiscal years 1998-99 to fully restore benefits to an estimated 38,000 legal immigrants\u2014all of whom were slated to become ineligible for federal food stamps. Households eligible for participation receive the same benefits that they did under the federal program. However, FNS also told us that, unlike Washington State\u2019s, most states\u2019 eligibility standards are likely to apply to only certain categories of legal immigrants. California, for example, recently appropriated $34.6 million to provide food stamps for legal immigrants who are children or elderly.", "Thirteen of the 20 states reported that they were using their own state-funded food assistance programs, and 2 of the 13 states created programs in response to welfare reform. These two states\u2014Colorado and Minnesota\u2014developed state-funded food assistance programs to aid those legal immigrants losing their federal food stamp eligibility as a result of welfare reform. Colorado, for example, has appropriated $2 million to provide emergency assistance, including food, for legal immigrants. Minnesota has allocated just over $4.7 million for two programs to provide food assistance for legal immigrant families in that state.", "The remaining 11 states had food assistance programs\u2014created before the Welfare Reform Act was passed\u2014that ranged from those that provide individuals with cash directly to those that provide funds for local food banks and food pantries that serve, among others, both able-bodied adults without dependents and legal immigrants. A program with significant funding is Pennsylvania\u2019s State Food Purchase Program, which provided about $13 million in fiscal year 1997 and $13.6 million in fiscal 1998 to counties for the purchase of food. This program is intended to supplement the efforts of food pantries, shelters for the homeless, soup kitchens, food banks, and similar organizations to reduce hunger.", "Two states with state-funded programs are also providing existing state or local programs with additional funding to assist able-bodied adults without dependents and legal immigrants. Rhode Island appropriated $250,000 in fiscal year 1998 for a community-run food bank. Massachusetts increased the funding it provides for local food banks and food pantries from just under $1 million to $3 million in fiscal year 1998 in anticipation of an increased need by both groups.", "Seven of the 20 states reported that they had allocated additional money to federally funded programs that assist groups of individuals, which may include those losing food stamp benefits.

This program\u2019s objective is to enhance the state\u2019s economy by helping to match the needs of businesses with workers\u2019 skills. The Connecticut Works System brings together state, regional, and local organizations to provide job listings, job search assistance, access to training and education programs, resume assistance, interviewing, and networking assistance.", "In Detroit, Michigan, able-bodied adults without dependents can participate in a new state employment and training assistance program that specifically targets this population; about one-half of these adults live in the greater Detroit area. For fiscal year 1998, the state will receive $13.4 million from FNS to expand work programs for this population.", "For legal immigrants, three out of the five localities\u2014Denver, Houston, and Los Angeles\u2014had plans to offer limited food assistance through state-funded programs. California passed legislation to provide food stamps for legal immigrant children and the elderly by purchasing federal food stamps. Similarly, Colorado passed legislation that provides legal immigrant families with special emergency assistance. As a result, families in Denver can receive, among other things, food coupons redeemable at designated food pantries. Finally, Texas is planning to offer food assistance to elderly and disabled legal immigrants.", "In addition, Los Angeles County launched two special efforts on behalf of legal immigrants after the passage of welfare reform. First, Los Angeles initiated a countywide citizenship campaign that brought together 200 public and nonprofit organizations whose goal was to assist legal immigrants in obtaining citizenship. Los Angeles County coordinated the efforts of these organizations, worked with the local district office of the INS, and directly contacted 400,000 potentially affected legal immigrants. However, Los Angeles officials told us that (1) because of the time it takes to process applications for citizenship\u2014including the fact that criminal background checks are required on all applicants\u2014and (2) because many of the applications remain unprocessed owing to the volume of applications received by the INS, they estimate that about 91,000 legal immigrants lost their food stamps. Los Angeles County officials said they continue to encourage legal immigrants to become U.S. citizens and, for those who do become citizens, hope to restore benefits to those who meet the Food Stamp Program\u2019s requirements. Second, Los Angeles County and the local United Way jointly sponsored the efforts of a local referral service to provide information on food assistance. Information on how to contact this referral service was enclosed with termination notices to legal immigrants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonprofit Organizations Expect an Increased Need That They Cannot Meet", "paragraphs": ["In every locality that we visited, nonprofit organizations\u2014including food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and religious organizations\u2014generally serve anyone who needs their services, including able-bodied adults without dependents and legal immigrants. Historically, these organizations provide supplemental food assistance on an emergency basis, perhaps once or twice a month. According to these nonprofit organizations, food stamp recipients\u2014even before welfare reform\u2014had turned to them for assistance.", "These organizations generally expect an increase in the need for their services\u2014both in terms of the numbers of people and frequency of visits\u2014as a result of welfare reform. For example, in Denver, one organization was getting 40 to 50 more applicants for food assistance per week in August 1997. Furthermore, the organizations were generally concerned that they could not replace the long-term, sustained assistance that food stamps provided.", "At the time of our visits in the late summer of 1997, however, most organizations had not experienced this anticipated increase. Our visits occurred before benefits were cut off for legal immigrants and before the usual increase in the need for food assistance in the winter months.", "The organizations are unsure how they will meet the expected increase because they have limited resources. Furthermore, these organizations are competing for these limited resources, and officials told us that they do not anticipate larger contributions as a result of welfare reform. While most organizations were waiting to see the full impact of welfare reform, some were developing contingency plans to handle the expected increase. For example, in Detroit, a kosher food pantry surveyed its existing clientele to determine which individuals would lose their benefits. The pantry learned that it would need about $100,000 the first year to serve its existing population. According to officials from the food pantry, this effort is not likely to be duplicated by other organizations because, unlike most other organizations, the kosher food pantry serves a known group of legal immigrants. More typically, most organizations are unsure how they will sustain a long-term increase in the number of people needing their services because they typically provide assistance on an emergency basis for anyone in need, and their resources are already limited. These organizations are considering strategies that would restrict eligibility, such as limiting eligibility to serve children or the elderly, in order to accommodate the anticipated increase and/or reduce their existing levels of service in order to accommodate the needs of more individuals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["It is too soon to assess how able-bodied adults without dependents and legal immigrants will fare in the long term under welfare reform.

USDA officials indicated that about one-quarter of the 935,000 legal immigrants that they estimated would lose food stamp benefits are now being covered under state funded programs. The USDA officials also pointed out that while many states are offering employment and training services for able-bodied adults without dependents, often, the services offered are job search activities, which do not satisfy the work requirements under the Welfare Reform Act and, thus, do not qualify these individuals for food stamps.
