Risk scores should be the same among all beneficiaries with the same health conditions and demographic characteristics. Policymakers raised concerns that differences in diagnostic coding between MA plans and Medicare FFS could lead to inappropriately high MA risk scores and payments to MA plans. CMS began adjusting for coding differences in 2010. GAO (1) estimated the impact of any coding differences on MA risk scores and payments to plans in 2010 and (2) evaluated CMS\u0092s methodology for estimating the impact of these differences in 2010, 2011, and 2012.

The higher risk scores were equivalent to $3.9 billion to $5.8 billion in payments to MA plans. Both GAO and CMS found that the impact of coding differences increased over time. This trend suggests that the cumulative impact of coding differences in 2011 and 2012 could be larger than in 2010.", "In contrast to GAO, CMS estimated that 3.4 percent of 2010 MA beneficiary risk scores were attributable to coding differences between MA plans and Medicare FFS. CMS\u0092s adjustment for this difference avoided $2.7 billion in excess payments to MA plans. CMS\u0092s 2010 estimate differs from GAO\u0092s in that CMS\u0092s methodology did not include more current data, did not incorporate the trend of the impact of coding differences over time, and did not account for beneficiary characteristics other than age and mortality, such as sex, health status, Medicaid enrollment status, beneficiary residential location, and whether the original reason for Medicare entitlement was disability.", "CMS did not update its coding adjustment estimate in 2011 and 2012 to include more current data, to account for additional years of coding differences, or to incorporate the trend of the impact of coding differences.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the agency that administers Medicare, pays MA plans a monthly  amount to provide health care services for each beneficiary enrolled in  these plans. CMS adjusts the payment to account for a beneficiary\u2019s  health status, a process known as risk adjustment. For example,  beneficiaries in poorer health are generally expected to use more health  care services relative to beneficiaries in better health. Therefore, CMS\u2019s  risk adjustment tends to increase payments to those plans serving  beneficiaries in poorer health to compensate for the expected higher  health care spending by those plans. Risk adjustment helps ensure that a  plan\u2019s financial incentive to enroll and care for beneficiaries is similar for  all beneficiaries regardless of their health status or the resources they are  likely to consume.", "To risk adjust payments, CMS calculates a risk score for every Medicare  beneficiary, including those in MA plans and the FFS program. A  beneficiary\u2019s risk score is the ratio of expected health care expenditures  for that beneficiary under Medicare FFS relative to the average health  care expenditures for all Medicare FFS beneficiaries. Information on a beneficiary\u2019s age, sex, Medicaid enrollment status, original reason for  Medicare entitlement (i.e., age or disability), and major medical conditions  all factor into the calculation of the risk score. To gather information on  medical diagnoses for beneficiaries in Medicare FFS, CMS analyzes the  claims that FFS providers submit for payment. For beneficiaries enrolled  in MA plans, instead of submitting claims, CMS requires plans to submit  certain diagnosis codes for each beneficiary.", "Risk scores for beneficiaries with the same health conditions, age, and  other characteristics should be identical, regardless of whether the  beneficiaries are in an MA plan or Medicare FFS. This will be true if MA  plans and FFS providers code medical diagnoses with the same level of  reliability and completeness. However, MA plans and FFS providers may  code medical diagnoses differently. Since 2004, when CMS transitioned  from using only a beneficiary\u2019s principal inpatient diagnosis to using a  larger set of major medical conditions to risk adjust MA payments, MA  plans have had a financial incentive to ensure that all relevant diagnoses  are coded, as this can increase beneficiaries\u2019 risk scores and ultimately  the payment plans receive. In contrast, CMS pays many Medicare FFS  providers for services provided rather than beneficiaries\u2019 diagnoses. providers that are paid based on services provided have less of a  financial incentive to code all relevant diagnoses. If patterns of diagnostic  coding differ systematically between MA plans and Medicare FFS, it is  possible for beneficiaries in MA plans to be assigned higher risk scores,  and appear to be sicker, than identical beneficiaries in Medicare FFS.  Because payment adjustments are estimated using FFS data, higher MA  risk scores due to diagnostic coding that is more comprehensive than  FFS would result in MA plan payments that are too high.", "One important exception is hospital acute inpatient services, for which Medicare payment  is based on Medicare severity diagnosis related groups rather than services. such growth. Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, CMS was required  to adjust risk scores for MA beneficiaries in 2008, 2009, and 2010 to take  into account differences in treatment and diagnostic coding between MA  plans and Medicare FFS providers to the extent that the impact of such  differences on risk scores could be identified. CMS did not adjust MA risk  scores in 2008 or 2009. However, for 2010, CMS estimated that   3.41 percent of MA beneficiary risk scores were attributable to differences  in diagnostic coding over the previous 3 years and reduced MA  beneficiaries\u2019 2010 risk scores by 3.41 percent. This adjustment, intended  to ensure that individuals with identical health conditions and other  characteristics have the same risk score regardless of whether they were  in an MA plan or FFS, resulted in an estimated $2.7 billion in savings to  Medicare.", "The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA)  required CMS to continue adjusting risk scores for coding differences until  CMS implements risk adjustment using MA diagnostic, cost, and use  data. CMS reduced 2011 MA beneficiary risk scores by 3.41 percent, the  same amount that the agency estimated and used for 2010, and will use  for 2012. In addition, HCERA required CMS to reduce MA risk scores by  at least 1.3 percent more than the 2010 adjustment (a total of   4.71 percent) in 2014 and that the annual minimum percentage reduction  gradually increase to not less than 5.70 percent in 2019 and subsequent  years.", "The accuracy of the adjustments to risk scores can have important  consequences for both Medicare spending and MA plans. If CMS does  not accurately estimate the effect on MA beneficiary risk scores of coding  differences between MA plans and Medicare FFS, then payments to MA  plans will not accurately reflect the health status of MA beneficiaries. For  example, if the adjustment to account for differences in coding is too  small, then MA payments would be set too high and plans would be  overpaid due to differences in coding patterns. In contrast, if the  adjustment is larger than the actual impact of coding differences on risk  scores, then payments to MA plans would be set too low and MA plans  would be underpaid for the beneficiaries they served.", "You asked us to analyze differences in diagnostic coding practices  between MA and Medicare FFS and review CMS\u2019s methodology for  quantifying differences in coding practices and associated payment  adjustments.

Coverage for beneficiaries in  HMOs is generally restricted to services from providers within a network, while  beneficiaries in PPOs are covered for services from both in-network and out-of-network  providers but must pay higher cost-sharing amounts if they use out-of-network services.

CMS believes that MA coding patterns may have been  less comprehensive than FFS when the CMS-Hierarchical Condition  Categories (CMS-HCC) model was first implemented, and that coding  pattern differences caused MA risk scores to grow faster than FFS;  therefore, there may have been a period of \u201ccatch-up\u201d before MA coding  patterns became more comprehensive than FFS coding patterns. While  the length of the \u201ccatch-up\u201d period is not known, we evaluated the impact  of assuming the actual \u201ccatch-up\u201d period was shorter, and that MA and  FFS coding patterns were similar in 2005.", "To evaluate CMS\u2019s methodology for estimating the percentage of MA  beneficiary risk scores in 2010, 2011, and 2012 that was attributable to  differences in diagnostic coding between MA plans and Medicare FFS,  we reviewed documentation on CMS\u2019s methodology and interviewed  CMS officials.

First, CMS did not include data  from 2008. CMS initially announced the adjustment for coding differences  in its advance notice for 2010 payment before 2008 data were available.  While 2008 data became available prior to the final announcement of the  coding adjustment, CMS decided not to incorporate 2008 data into its  final adjustment. In its announcement for 2010 payment, CMS explains  that it took a conservative approach for the first year that it implemented  the MA coding adjustment. Incorporating 2008 data would have increased  the size of CMS\u2019s final adjustment. Second, CMS did not take into  account the increasing impact of coding differences over time. However,  without 2008 data, the increasing trend of the annual impact of coding  differences is less apparent, and supports the agency\u2019s decision to use  the average annual impact from 2004 to 2007 as a proxy for the annual  impact from 2007 to 2010. Third, CMS only accounted for differences in  age and mortality between the MA and FFS study populations.

CMS did not include 2008 data in its  2010 estimate due to its desire to take a conservative approach for the  first year it implemented a coding adjustment, and the agency did not  update its estimate for 2011 or 2012 due to concerns about the many MA  payment changes taking place. While maintaining the same level of  adjustment for 2011 and 2012 maintains stability and predictability in MA  payment rates, it also allows the accuracy of the adjustment to diminish in  each year.

While CMS stated in its announcement for 2011 payment that it  would consider accounting for additional years of coding differences,  CMS officials told us they were concerned about incorporating additional  years using a linear methodology because it would ignore the possibility  that MA plans may reach a limit at which they could no longer code  diagnoses more comprehensively. We think it is unlikely that this limit has  been reached. Given the financial incentives that MA plans have to  ensure that all relevant diagnoses are coded, the fact that CMS\u2019s   3.41 percent estimate is below our low estimate of 4.8 percent, and  considering the increasing use of electronic health records to capture and  maintain diagnostic information, the upper limit is likely to be greater than  the 3 years CMS accounted for in its 2011 and 2012 estimates.", "In addition to not including more recent data, CMS did not incorporate the  impact of the upward trend in coding differences on risk scores into its  estimates for 2011 and 2012.

In addition, for beneficiaries who were enrolled in Medicare FFS and  switched to MA in 2005, 2006, or 2007, we included data for 1 year of Medicare FFS enrollment immediately preceding their MA enrollment.Our MA study population included three types of beneficiaries, each of  which we analyzed separately for each period:", "MA joiners\u2014beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare FFS for the entire first  year of each period and then enrolled in MA for all of the following  year,", "MA plan stayers\u2014beneficiaries enrolled in the same MA plan for the  first and second year of the period, and", "MA plan switchers\u2014beneficiaries enrolled in one MA plan for the first  year of the period and a second MA plan in the following year.", "Our control population consisted of a retrospective cohort of FFS  beneficiaries who were enrolled in FFS for all of 2007 and 2006. We  followed these beneficiaries back to 2004 and included data for all years  of continuous FFS enrollment. For both the study and control populations,  we excluded data for years during which a beneficiary (1) was diagnosed  with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during the study year; (2) resided in  a long-term care facility for more than 90 consecutive days; (3) died prior  to July 1, 2008; (4) resided outside the 50 United States; Washington,  D.C.; and Puerto Rico; or (5) moved to a new state or changed  urban/rural status.", "We calculated the actual change in disease score\u2014the portion of the risk  score that is based on a beneficiary\u2019s coded diagnoses\u2014for the MA study  population for the following three time periods (in payment years): 2005 to  2006, 2006 to 2007, and 2007 to 2008.disease scores that would have occurred if those MA beneficiaries were  enrolled continuously in FFS, we used our control population to estimate  a regression model that described how beneficiary characteristics   To estimate the change in  influenced change in disease score.

We also included one urban and one rural  variable for each of the 50 United States; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto  Rico as independent variables to identify beneficiary residential  location.

To convert these estimates  of disease score growth due to coding differences into estimates of the  impact of coding differences on 2010 MA risk scores, we divided the  disease score growth estimates by the average MA risk score in 2010.  Because 2010 risk scores were not available at the time we conducted  our analysis, we calculated the average MA community risk score for the  most recent data available (risk score years 2005 through 2008) and  projected the trend to 2010 to estimate the average 2010 MA risk score.", "We projected these estimates of the annual impact of coding difference  on 2010 risk scores through 2010 using two different assumptions. One  projection assumed that the annual impact of coding differences on risk  scores was the same from 2008 to 2010 as it was from 2007 to 2008. The  other projection assumed that the trend of increasing coding difference  impact over 2005 to 2008 continued through 2010 (see fig. 2).", "To calculate the cumulative impact of coding differences on MA risk  scores for 2007 through 2010, we summed the annual impact estimates  for that period and adjusted each impact estimate to account for  beneficiaries who disenrolled from the MA program before 2010.

CMS believes that MA coding patterns may have been  less comprehensive than FFS when the CMS-HCC model was  implemented, and that coding pattern differences caused MA risk scores  to grow faster than FFS; therefore, there may have been a period of  \u201ccatch-up\u201d before MA coding patterns became more comprehensive than  FFS coding patterns. While the length of the \u201ccatch-up\u201d period is not  known, we evaluated the impact of assuming the actual \u201ccatch-up\u201d period  was shorter, and that MA and FFS coding patterns were similar in 2005.
