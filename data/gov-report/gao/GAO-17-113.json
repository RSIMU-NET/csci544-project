GAO also found that while selected HHS and USDA subagencies generally followed certain other required and recommended practices established in the Uniform Guidance for providing specific information in their notices of public funding opportunity (public notices) announcing grants, selected Interior subagencies did not. Specifically, the Uniform Guidance recommends that public notices include (1) the merit-based criteria that will be used to assess grant applications, (2) the relative weights that will be applied to those assessment criteria, and requires (3) whether and how cost sharing will be used as a factor in assessing an application. GAO found that for several grant programs in selected Interior subagencies, public notices either did not state merit-based selection criteria, did not state the relative weights assigned to selection criteria, or did not clarify how cost sharing would be used to assess an application. Omitting this information from the public notices limits transparency for potential applicants.", "OMB's Uniform Guidance does not direct agencies to review applicants for duplicative funding, but federal standards for internal control state that management should use quality information to achieve objectives and that management should document its policies.

During the application  review, the Uniform Guidance recommends that applications should be  rated against pre-established criteria found in the public notice used to  evaluate merit. This rating can be either quantitative (i.e., percentages or  points) or qualitative (e.g., identifying applications as highly  recommended or not recommended). The Uniform Guidance directs that  agencies disclose in their public notice the relative weights or point values  assigned to the merit based criteria, providing applicants with information  about how the criteria will be applied.

We  found that common review criteria at these four selected subagencies  included the merit of the project design, previous organizational  experience with the type of program, and whether the financial and  budget support seemed appropriate. For example at USDA, NIFA\u2019s  Hispanic Serving Institutions Education Programs and the three FNS  programs we reviewed clearly articulated the review criteria and related  point values in the public notices. At NIH, all four research grant  programs we reviewed included the same general criteria in their public  notices and the same scoring values. In addition, we found that all three  CDC grant programs included the same general review criteria in their  public notices and clearly articulated the related point values.", "However, at the selected Interior subagencies (NPS and FWS), we found  several public notices in which the criteria for evaluating applications or  the related point values for each criterion were not clearly stated. One of  the three public notices for grant programs we reviewed from NPS did not  inform the applicants of the review criteria or their related weights.  Specifically, we found in our review that the public notice for NPS\u2019s  Historic Preservation Fund Grants to Underrepresented Communities  (HPF) requested standard grant application information from applicants,  but it did not include the evaluation criteria or the related points. NPS  officials explained, and we confirmed, that this had been corrected in the  public notice for HPF fiscal year 2016 grants, which included both the  criteria and scoring. Further, two of the three public notices from FWS did  not inform applicants of weights related to each criterion used to evaluate  grant applications. Specifically, FWS\u2019s Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS)  grant program clearly identified the criteria by which applicants would be  evaluated in the public notice. However, the AIS program public notice did  not include maximum point values related to each criterion. Similarly,  FWS\u2019s Conservation Program to Introduce Youth to Natural Resource  Conservation included all review criteria within the public notice, but it did  not include the related weights of the evaluation criteria. The program  staff agreed that the criteria point values should have been explained to  the applicants in the public notice, and they said the point values would  be included in the grant public notice for subsequent years. Unless the  criteria and value that will be assigned to those criteria are made  transparent to the applicant before an application is submitted, the  applicant may not know whether their proposal will meet the review  criteria or how to best focus their efforts.

We determined that four of the six subagencies we  reviewed clearly articulated cost sharing requirements in their public  notices for selected grant programs. For example, the public notices for  all NIH and CDC grant programs in our review stated either that cost  sharing was not required or that it would be used in the grant review  process and described how it would be used. NIFA and FNS clearly  explained cost sharing requirements and how they would be used in the  grant review process.", "In contrast, the public notices for grant programs at the two selected  Interior subagencies discussed cost sharing and matching but did not  clarify when or how this factor would influence the subagency\u2019s final grant  award decisions.

AIS grant staff told us that  they had planned to use cost sharing or matching only to break tie scores  for applicants, but that it was never used in the evaluation of applicant  proposals since no ties in the scoring occurred. The use of the cost  sharing or matching statement in the public notice\u2014without explanation  for how this factor would be used to evaluate applicants\u2014reduced the  transparency of the grant review process because the way in which this  information was to be assessed was unclear to applicants.

After listing all support, applicants  must also summarize for each individual any potential overlap with active  or pending projects and for the overall application any overlap in terms of  the science, budget items covered, and any individual\u2019s time commitment.", "According to NIH officials, the review of the applicant\u2019s \u201cother support\u201d  documentation is recorded in NIH\u2019s grant management and program  checklist, a tool NIH grant managers use to ensure grant applications  meet all requirements. If the research plan in the application duplicates  other pending applications or an active award, the grant applicant must  negotiate with NIH staff concerning which grant will be funded. If NIH staff  conclude partial duplication exists, then modification of the application,  other pending applications, or the active award is necessary before NIH  will make the grant award. Depending on the amount of scientific overlap,  staff might choose not to fund the pending application. If scientific,  budgetary, or commitment overlap has been identified, NIH staff are  required to document concerns along with specific recommendations for  resolution.", "NIFA\u2019s grant programs have taken different approaches to implement the  subagency\u2019s guidance regarding identifying duplication and overlap in  grant awards. For example, NIFA\u2019s Agriculture and Food Research  Initiative has its own grant policy manual that offers detailed instructions  on identifying duplication and overlap prior to making a grant award.  Grant managers for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative review  applicants\u2019 self-identified current and pending support when they apply for  funds. Additionally, NIFA\u2019s grant managers review the Current Research  Information System\u2014USDA\u2019s primary system containing project-level  information on its ongoing and completed research projects\u2014to identify  any other NIFA grants that may have funded the same project. The  program staff log the date of this search and the key words used to  demonstrate how they looked for duplication.

For  example, officials for NIFA\u2019s Hispanic Serving Institutions grant program  explained they ask whether a grant applicant has submitted a similar  application to another federal agency. If so, the applicant must report it  under \u201ccurrent and pending support,\u201d and prior to making an award  decision, NIFA officials review the key personnel section of the  application to determine if anyone affiliated with the grant application is  being funded at greater than 100 percent (i.e., a review to identify  commitment overlap)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four Selected Subagencies Rely Primarily on Informal Processes for Identifying Potential Duplication and Overlap in Grant Funding", "paragraphs": ["Four of the six selected subagencies we reviewed relied on informal  mechanisms to identify duplication and overlap of grant funding rather  than establish guidance for a formal process, but officials from these  subagencies acknowledged the importance of trying to identify potentially  duplicative and overlapping grant funding.

While CDC  officials explained that their process used the same grant review tools  and followed the same guidelines as NIH, they acknowledged they did not  use a formal mechanism to identify potential duplication of awards. CDC  officials explained that CDC did not have a methodology to ensure that its  grant awards did not duplicate funding for the same or similar work at the  individual grantee level. According to CDC officials, grant management  staff are responsible for being knowledgeable of their programs and  therefore should know what other funding sources their grantees receive.

NPS officials said they lacked a consistent process to assess  potential overlap in funding across different federal agencies or even  across different subagencies within Interior (e.g., between NPS and  FWS). NPS officials acknowledged that such a process could be helpful  to identify potential duplication and overlap across NPS grant programs.  FWS officials explained they did not have an official policy to review grant  applications for duplication and overlap, but it is a common topic that  comes up at pre-award grant panel review meetings. Officials from NPS  also pointed out that grants may intentionally fund the same type of  project in order to provide grant funding to applicants in different  geographical locations. While these officials said it is not likely that  unintended duplication occurs, they acknowledged it is possible that grant  applicants could receive unintended duplicate funding due to the lack of  formal written guidance requiring grant award panels to look for  duplication and overlap of funding sources as part of their reviews.", "Within USDA, we found that FNS lacked a formal guidance mechanism  instructing grant management staff to review grant applications for  duplication and overlap.

Achievement of these objectives is in part dependent on  effective implementation of merit-based processes for grantee selection.  The importance of a fair and transparent process to review grant  applications and appropriately assess grantee risk is essential to make  competitive award decisions. The merit-review process for competitive  grants can take different forms such as internal agency review or external  peer review panels. The Uniform Guidance establishes requirements and  guidelines that offer some opportunities to standardize the review process  as well as the risk assessment framework agencies apply to grantees  prior to making an award.", "Our review determined that selected subagencies all had merit-review  processes in place for competitive awards and all had risk assessment  processes established to identify potential grantee risks related to their  ability to implement the proposed grant project while also having  appropriate financial controls in place to appropriately account for federal  funds. However, we found that not all subagencies identified in their  public notices the merit selection criteria they would use, the weighted  values that would be applied to those criteria, or how cost sharing would  be considered, limiting the transparency of the application and review  process for both the applicant and the reviewing agency. Similarly, review  processes at two subagencies routinely incorporated a check for  duplication and overlap at the grant award level\u2014a useful tool to promote  stronger oversight of federal grant dollars. The other four subagencies  took a less formal approach to identifying potential duplication or award  overlap, although they acknowledged the importance of having  information about applicants\u2019 other funding sources, if any. Requiring  reviews for duplicative or overlapping awards and establishing the  requirement in agency guidance would promote stronger controls to  ensure federal grant funds are efficiently awarded and avoid potential  duplication or overlap when necessary.", "In 2013, we identified certain challenges related to COFAR\u2019s priorities  and its lack of an implementation schedule.

COFAR continues to lack a publicly available detailed implementation  schedule and a method to evaluate and monitor its progress toward its  priorities. The absence of assigned roles and responsibilities for COFAR  members and a means to include all grantee stakeholder communities in  grant policy development indicate that action is still needed to fully  implement our prior recommendations.
