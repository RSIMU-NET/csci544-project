These actions were part of an effort to find better and less costly ways of meeting Defense information processing needs.

In addition, we met with consultants who advise computer center managers on improving services and with the General Services Administration\u2019s Office of Governmentwide Policy and Federal Systems Management Center. We conducted numerous interviews with DOD officials to discuss their approach to consolidating and modernizing computer centers. We also discussed with OMB officials the OMB Bulletin governing computer centers and their views on DOD responses.

These comments are presented and evaluated at the end of this letter and are reprinted along with our more detailed evaluation in appendix II. The Office of Management and Budget provided oral comments on a draft of this report which are incorporated in the report as appropriate and discussed at the end of this letter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government owns hundreds of computer centers that perform such services as processing agency software programs, providing office automation and records management, and assisting in the management of wide area computer networks. In recent years, the federal government has recognized that most of these centers operate below optimum capacity, use outdated technology, and perform redundant services. It has concluded that it can achieve significant dollar savings and operational efficiencies by consolidating computer centers or by acquiring its information processing services from the private sector.", "In 1993, the Vice President\u2019s National Performance Review recommended that the federal government take advantage of evolving technology and begin consolidating and modernizing its computer centers to reduce the duplication in information processing services and decrease information processing costs. To help implement this recommendation, a committee formed by the Council of Federal Data Center Directors recommended that the Office of Management and Budget establish operating capacity targets for the consolidated centers and that federal agencies follow an approach successfully used by private-sector companies and other government agencies to plan, implement, and optimize their own computer centers.", "The Committee\u2019s recommendations formed the basis of OMB guidance to promote computer center improvements and consolidations, which was issued in October 1995. This guidance, OMB Bulletin 96-02, Consolidation of Agency Data Centers, called on agencies to (1) reduce the number of their computer centers, (2) collocate small and mid-tier computer platforms in larger computer centers, (3) modernize their remaining centers in order to improve the delivery of services, and (4) outsource information processing services to other federal or commercial computer centers when aggregate computer center capacities were below minimum target sizes. Table 1 lists OMB\u2019s specific requirements.", "OMB allowed agencies considerable discretion as to which data centers they chose to retain and close so long as their consolidation scenario was cost-effective and minimal data center target sizes were met. The target sizes OMB set were based on a standard industry measure for information processing: millions of instructions per second, or MIPS. OMB asked that centers using IBM mainframe computers operate at 325 MIPS and centers using UNISYS operating systems operate at 225 MIPS. Further, OMB permitted agencies to justify not consolidating centers that fell below the target size if a particular center had a staff of less than five full-time employees, housed scientific processors and would otherwise be at least 90 percent of the minimal target size, or housed a large number of small and mid-tier processors and would otherwise be at least 90 percent of the minimal target size.", "OMB\u2019s guidance is in keeping with recent congressional initiatives that focus on strengthening the planning and management of information technology efforts. In implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Clinger-Cohen Act, OMB requires that information technology investments support core/priority mission functions and that they be undertaken by the requesting agency because no alternative private-sector or governmental source can efficiently support the function. These laws and OMB guidance also require agencies to establish an enterprisewide investment approach to information technology that includes selecting, controlling, and evaluating investments as part of an integrated set of management practices designed to link investments to organizational goals and objectives. Further, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 requires the Secretary of Defense to report the Department\u2019s plan for establishing an integrated framework for management of information resources within the Department by March 1, 1997.", "OMB\u2019s guidance is also in keeping with the approach private-sector companies have taken in successfully consolidating and modernizing their own computer processing centers. We analyzed successful consolidation and modernization efforts carried out by three corporations and learned that they believed it was necessary to implement their strategies from a corporatewide perspective, rather than have separate components of their companies consolidate and modernize their own centers.", "These companies also ensured that from the outset of their consolidation efforts, they had clear and consistent policies and procedures governing how computer center services would be improved. This guidance spelled out such things as what constitutes an optimum computing center in terms of capacity and staff, what skills were needed to operate the centers, what cost and performance goals were relevant for the centers, and which services could be outsourced. In setting capacity goals, the private-sector companies we visited also generally attempt to reach targets that are substantially higher than the ones set by OMB\u2014from 1,000 to 3,500 MIPS.", "In addition, we learned that private-sector companies we visited during this review established strong oversight processes for ensuring that their computer center decisions were based on accurate, complete, and current information on cost, schedules, benefits, and risks; that all valid options for their computer center services were fully addressed; and that their current services were correctly benchmarked against comparable services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Recognizes Benefits of Further Consolidating, Modernizing, and Outsourcing Computer Centers", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, Defense reported to OMB that it owned 155 computer centers that perform a variety of information processing related services for the services and components. Among other things, the centers run software programs developed by the military services and various Defense components and provide information security services, customer help desk services, and records management services. Sixteen of these centers are central processing facilities known as megacenters and are owned by DISA. The remaining 139 centers are service- or component-unique centers.", "DOD also reported that it was continuing to further optimize and standardize its computer centers operations as part of departmentwide and intra-agency consolidations that had started in 1990 and continue today. Defense has recognized that these computer centers have been operating inefficiently and that they need to adopt new technologies and address the increasing loss of in-house technical expertise in order to continue supporting the Department\u2019s large and complex information infrastructure. We agree with DOD that there are still many opportunities for savings. In fact, table 2 shows that many of these reported centers operate below the minimum processing capacity targets established by OMB for government-owned computer centers and thus are good candidates for consolidation or outsourcing.", "As table 2 indicates, 62 of DOD\u2019s 155 computer centers\u2014about 40 percent\u2014met OMB criteria for possible consolidation based on processing capacity targets. However, we believe that these numbers could be higher. As indicated in the table notes, many small or mid-tier centers were not considered as candidates for consolidation. According to OMB officials responsible for implementing the Bulletin, these centers should have been included unless otherwise exempted. Further, private-sector and government-sector studies have found that larger facilities allow organizations to economize on floor space, staff, and operating expenditures, and smaller centers tend to be cost-inefficient.", "Before OMB issued its computer center Bulletin 96-02, DOD had determined, based on industry practices, that consolidation would \u2019\u2019position DOD to more effectively support common data processing requirements across services by leveraging information technology and resource investments to meet multiple needs.\u2019\u2019 Since 1990, the Department has initiated and completed multiple intra-agency consolidations. In 1993, the megacenters were established as a result of (1) DOD\u2019s base closures and (2) other consolidation and cost reduction efforts. In establishing these centers, DOD expected to change its information processing environment from one that was stovepiped, or confined to individual military services and components, to one that supported information sharing DOD-wide. Accordingly, since 1990, DOD consolidated its computer center operations by moving the workload and equipment from 194 DOD computer centers into 16 DISA megacenters by fiscal year 1996, reporting a reduction in processing costs of over $500 million.", "After these consolidations, DOD initiated several studies that looked into the question of whether the remaining megacenters should be further consolidated, modernized, or outsourced. One study\u2014done by the Defense Science Board on the question of outsourcing DOD functions in general\u2014reported in August 1996 that processing at computer centers was more expensive than at private-sector computer centers and it recommended that DOD computer center services be outsourced.", "A second study\u2014done by a private contractor on the question of outsourcing, modernizing, and consolidating DISA\u2019s megacenters for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) in 1996\u2014concluded that further consolidation and outsourcing of megacenter operations was feasible. The contractor reported that the megacenters\u2019 life cycle (10 years) cost could be cut by more than a billion dollars if the megacenters were consolidated to 6 from 16 and if certain computer center services\u2014such as the customer help desk and those services associated with day-to-day operation of the centers\u2014were fully outsourced.", "The Undersecretary of Defense, Comptroller, was also directed to submit a report on the feasibility of outsourcing DOD\u2019s megacenters to the House Appropriations Committee by January 1, 1996. In this report, which was submitted to the Congress on December 26, 1996, the Comptroller largely agreed with the recommendations made by the contractor study described above and supported DISA\u2019s proposed management plan to implement those recommendations. Some of our concerns with this plan, which is DISA\u2019s consolidation strategy, are discussed in more detail in the next section of this report. In addition, as noted in the beginning of this report, we will be reporting separately on our detailed review of DISA\u2019s plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidation Strategies Are Inconsistent and Fall Short of Meeting OMB Requirements", "paragraphs": ["While DOD and its components have made progress in consolidating and finding opportunities to optimize and outsource many of the functions of its computer center operations, DOD is still missing opportunities to achieve even greater savings under its current approach. The Defense leadership has chosen to allow the individual military services and components to carry out their computer center consolidation and modernization efforts independent of any departmentwide framework. In fact, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I, as part of his guidance when forwarding the OMB Bulletin, stated \u201cthat each Service and Defense Agency has the flexibility to reduce its data centers in a manner that is consistent with the DOD Component\u2019s goals, management philosophy, and environment as long as such reductions occur within the framework of the OMB guidelines.\u201d This decision has resulted in inconsistent and contradictory strategies which fall short of meeting OMB\u2019s requirements and what we believe to be the intent of OMB\u2019s Bulletin. We also learned that some of the inconsistency and incompleteness of reported plans and strategies was caused, in part, by DOD\u2019s broad and inconsistent interpretations of the OMB Bulletin. Appendix IV provides a detailed analysis of how the military services and components responded to OMB\u2019s Bulletin. The following discussion highlights our findings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strategies Vary Widely", "paragraphs": ["As shown in the two tables that follow, the computer center consolidation plans of the individual military services and components submitted to OMB to date vary widely. For example, the Air Force, the Army, three Navy commands, and three Defense components plan to further consolidate in-house, while other parts of the Army and Navy, as well as the Defense Investigative Service, are choosing to keep their computer center operations in-house without further consolidation. Many of the strategies reflect a move toward mid-tier solutions without considering the potential for consolidation. Only the National Imagery and Mapping Agency and parts of the Navy chose to outsource (to DISA) their center operations. Further, just two services\u2014the Air Force and the Army\u2014considered inter-service consolidation of their respective computer centers within the Pentagon, and this action was already underway prior to the OMB Bulletin. Table 3 describes the approaches the services and components have decided on. Table 4 compares the strategies.", "We found that some of these strategies had contradictions that might well have been prevented had Defense better coordinated its computer center efforts. For example, as table 3 notes, the Department\u2019s primary information processing service provider, DISA, intends to modernize and consolidate its megacenters and begin to offer mid-tier processing services to attract additional business from the services and components. DISA believes that significant reductions in the cost of operations could be achieved and that much of DOD\u2019s computer processing is well suited for consolidation to DISA\u2019s computer center operations.", "However, it is clear from the strategies described above that most of the services and agencies are not considering sending additional business to DISA, and DISA has no authority to require the services and components to make such transfers. The Army, the Air Force, and the Defense Logistics Agency, for example, do not plan to increase their use of DISA services. Together, about $385,000 of the reported $915,500 spent on computer center operations is outside of DISA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidation Strategies Do Not Meet OMB Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Most of the consolidation strategies submitted by the military services and components to OMB failed to fully address all of the planning elements addressed in the Bulletin. For example, some services and components did not provide sufficient information to show that they had (1) performed thorough analyses of their planned options, (2) demonstrated that they had ensured that they have the correct technical solutions to their computer center operations, (3) prepared even a high-level implementation approach to the major tasks associated with consolidation, or (4) provided estimates on how much it will cost to consolidate and modernize. Therefore, DOD and OMB do not have assurance that the services and components are addressing these critical planning elements in carrying out their strategies or that the approaches they have chosen are sound.", "Table 5 summarizes how the individual services and components responded to the OMB Bulletin. (\u201cN\u201d meaning they didn\u2019t respond, \u201cY\u201d meaning they did respond, \u201cP\u201d meaning they partially responded, and \u201cN/A\u201d meaning not applicable.) The table illustrates that the Defense Intelligence Agency, Defense Investigative Service, and Defense Special Weapons Agency were the only DOD components in compliance with all of the OMB requirements. The Army was the only other component to have submitted a complete alternatives analysis for its computer centers. The table also shows that the Air Force, DISA, the Defense Commissary Agency, and the Defense Logistics Agency either partially addressed or did not address the requirements. As noted earlier, a more detailed analysis of the responses is provided in appendix IV.", "As reflected in table 5, we determined that the DOD submissions did not always comply with the OMB requirements. When we discussed this with DOD officials, they said that their submissions did not always describe their consolidation plans for their non-mainframe computer centers because some of the components believed that the guidance only applied to mainframes and others believed that the guidance did not apply to actions already underway and approved through DOD\u2019s life cycle management process. These officials had interpreted the Bulletin as requiring that non-mainframe computer centers be included in the inventory but not in the consolidation strategies, unless they affected the center\u2019s meeting the minimum target size. When we discussed this with OMB officials, they disagreed with DOD\u2019s interpretation. They stated that the Department\u2019s non-mainframe centers also should have been addressed in both the inventories and the consolidation strategies.", "We also asked OMB officials why they required submissions from each of the military departments and one from DOD. OMB officials told us that they required four separate submissions based on their interpretation of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, which defined DOD as the Department of Defense and the three services. However, they further stated they would have preferred to receive from DOD a departmentwide inventory, consolidation strategy, and implementation plan that clearly reflected a departmentwide analysis and direction for DOD decisions on computer centers. We believe such a departmentwide approach is consistent with the intent of the Bulletin and the Clinger-Cohen Act to ensure that opportunities to consolidate centers among services and components were maximized. Instead, these officials stated that OMB received separate and conflicting responses that failed to provide a clear view of consolidation across components. OMB officials further stated they had difficulty determining how many centers DOD currently had and planned to have after the consolidations.", "When we discussed the multiple submissions from DOD with Defense officials, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I acknowledged that the military services and DOD components had developed individual plans. However, he believed that separate plans were allowed by the OMB Bulletin and that OMB did not request a departmentwide strategy or plans. However, the Assistant Secretary agreed that the Department needs a departmentwide policy guidance and framework as DOD seeks additional opportunities for economies and efficiencies in its data center operations. The Assistant Secretary also agrees that future decisions should be based on sound business analyses and that the Clinger-Cohen Act provides a context and leverage for these guidelines."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Critical Decision-making Tools for Consolidation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD has been consolidating its computer centers since 1990, we found, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I agreed, that DOD lacks several decision-making tools that are imperative to any computer consolidation and modernization effort. First, it has not set targets or established policy for basic things, such as how many computer centers the Department actually needs, the numbers and skill mix of staff that are required to operate the centers, and what constitutes an optimum computer center. It also has no mechanism for ensuring that the best money-saving opportunities have been considered by the individual services and components or that consolidation efforts will conform to federal requirements or even the needs of the Department as a whole. As discussed earlier in this report, private companies we visited during our review found that setting such targets\u2014through policies and procedures\u2014and oversight mechanisms were key to the success of their consolidation efforts. Without them, DOD will have difficulty identifying problematic strategies and preventing some of its computer center investments from being wasteful."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Has No Departmentwide Policies and Procedures on Computer Centers", "paragraphs": ["The private companies we visited during our review found it necessary to direct their computer center consolidation efforts from a corporatewide perspective and to clearly delineate the makeup and number of centers that the companies were aiming for. More specifically, these companies established policies that defined what constituted an optimum computer center in terms of processing capacity and the numbers and skill mix of its staff; how many centers the corporation needed; what computer center functions were so critical to carrying out the company\u2019s mission that they could not be outsourced; what cost and performance goals were relevant for the centers; and how the centers should be compared, or benchmarked, to more successful operations. They also established corporatewide procedures for implementing these policies.", "During our review, we also learned that DOD visited private companies, including the ones we visited. DOD officials benchmarked this industry experience to determine how best to prepare, justify, and implement prior departmentwide efforts to consolidate and standardize computer centers from 1990 to 1994. For example, DOD learned examples of private-sector criteria that could be used to select megacenters and the level of processing capacity and expandable floor space these centers should have. However, it did not use the lessons learned from these visits to prepare departmentwide policies and procedures.", "As a result, individual services and components do not have a consistent basis for determining what constitutes an optimum center; what their performance or staffing targets should be; or which functions are inherently governmental or can be outsourced. For example, these services and components do not have departmentwide targets that they can set as goals for the processing capacities of their mainframe or mid-tier centers.", "In a March 1996 report on DOD\u2019s acquisition of computer centers, DOD\u2019s inspector general specifically noted that Defense lacked complete \u201cpolicies and procedures on acquiring and managing the proper mix of mainframe and mid-tier computers to process corporate data\u201d and that without such policies and procedures\u2014especially those for mid-tier processors\u2014DOD\u2019s potential for acquiring excess computer processing capabilities increases. The Inspector General also noted that if DOD would coordinate its processing needs it could, among other things, (1) take advantage of the open systems infrastructure concept to resolve operational problems, (2) better track and report information management costs on a DOD-wide basis, (3) better manage the transition from existing outdated systems to migration systems, and (4) improve management of computer security. DOD agreed with the Office of the Inspector General that it should establish procedures for evaluating and providing corporate information processing and storage requirements on a DOD-wide basis rather than on an individual program basis. However, DOD noted that it should proceed with care in implementing this recommendation because of its implications for centralized management and control. According to officials in the office of the Assistant Secretary for C3I, DOD plans to determine if, and to what extent, it has a mid-tier computing problem before issuing policies and procedures to address that problem.", "Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act, passed in 1996, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, as DOD\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO), is supposed to develop and implement management policy and procedures to ensure that major information technology related efforts conform to departmentwide goals. In a memorandum dated November 6, 1995, the Assistant Secretary expressed an intent to monitor the consolidation initiatives to (1) ensure consistent interpretation and implementation of OMB Bulletin 96-02 across the Department, (2) ensure that consolidation efforts are consistent with the DISA plans, and (3) identify issues and develop strategies for resolving them quickly. Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary set up an advisory group to provide policy guidance for the Department\u2019s efforts to consolidate and outsource computer center operations.

In its guidance to agencies on evaluating information technology investments, OMB suggests that such a mechanism take the form of an investment review board, or senior management team, that would review information technology funding decisions. In their decision-making process, the team would consider such things as strategic improvements versus maintenance of current operations, new projects versus ongoing projects, risks, opportunity costs, and budget constraints. The Assistant Secretary C3I also charged the advisory group discussed above with the responsibility for providing oversight for computer center consolidation efforts. Yet, to date, neither the advisory group nor any other DOD component has provided this oversight. The Assistant Secretary C3I believes that his authority as DOD\u2019s chief information officer for providing such oversight has been strengthened by the Clinger-Cohen Act. However, he also believes that his office lacks the staff and departmentwide support to establish such oversight.", "Without this important oversight mechanism, DOD does not have a means for assessing whether the individual services and components considered the cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility of their computer center alternatives from a departmentwide perspective and whether their implementation approaches, schedules, and funding plans are realistic.

Moreover, millions of dollars in computer center investments and operating expenses may well end up being wasted since individual components and services are planning without departmentwide information processing needs in mind and without the benefit of clearly defined organizationwide policies and procedures for the consolidation efforts and effective oversight mechanisms.

DOD also questioned the need for an integrated consolidation and outsourcing plan since the Department has already consolidated many of its computer centers, with significant reported savings, without such a plan. However, during our review, DOD officials acknowledged that unlike prior consolidation efforts, DOD has allowed the components considerable flexibility in their current consolidation efforts, without strategic direction from the Department. Thus, we continue to believe that an integrated, departmentwide plan is needed to show that the Department\u2019s computer center decisions reflect sound choices for meeting departmentwide processing needs and not just those of the individual components.", "In discussing our recommendation on developing policies and procedures for making consolidation and outsourcing decisions, DOD agreed that these are necessary. However, DOD believed that it should complete its development of an integrated management framework for implementing the Clinger-Cohen Act before developing the specific policies and procedures we recommended.

We identified these corporations through discussions with private-sector consultants and Defense computer center officials. The corporations contacted were", "Boeing Computing Service, Belleview, Washington;", "Electronic Data Systems, Plano, Texas; and", "GTE Corporation, Fairfax, Virginia.", "Through these interviews and related documentation, we analyzed how these companies strategically direct and oversee their decisions on alternatives and how they determine the cost and measure the performance of their computer center operations.", "We also met with consultants who advise computer center managers on improving their services. The consultants contacted were the Center for Naval Analyses, Compass America, Inc., Coopers and Lybrand, and the Gartner Group. In these discussions, we identified best practices and important performance measures that they believe well managed computer centers should use to benchmark their performance with other computer centers. In addition, we interviewed senior officials at the Defense Science Board to discuss the Board\u2019s high-level study done for DOD management on the outsourcing of select DOD activities, including its computer centers.", "Finally, we met with DOD officials in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence to discuss their actions to implement a departmentwide decision-making framework for making computer center investment decisions. To assess the effectiveness of DOD\u2019s framework, we compared the framework with best practices used by leading organizations and the Clinger-Cohen Act. Also, through this office, we obtained and analyzed DOD\u2019s submissions to OMB in compliance with OMB Bulletin 96-02 to determine whether these submissions met OMB\u2019s requirements and had been prepared to meet departmentwide information processing needs. We did not validate the accuracy of the numbers provided by DOD on its computer centers.", "Our work was performed from March 1996 through January 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

(See section entitled, DOD Recognizes Benefits of Further Consolidating, Modernizing and Outsourcing Computer Centers.) As appropriate, we also expanded the report to acknowledge DOD\u2019s use of industry practices to help make these reductions. (See section entitled, DOD Lacks Critical Decision-making Tools for Consolidation Efforts.) 2.We agree that DOD needs to determine whether further economies and efficiencies are possible and, if so, what strategies should be employed to reap these savings. The recommendations to DOD and OMB contained in this report are intended to facilitate and guide these determinations. 3.The report fully describes the differing views of DOD and OMB officials for interpreting OMB Bulletin 96-02 in two broad areas: (1) DOD\u2019s consolidation plans for its non-mainframe small and mid-tier computer centers and (2) the number of DOD plan submissions required by OMB. In the report, we pointed out that OMB officials did not agree with DOD\u2019s interpretation that non-mainframe computer centers should only be included in their inventories but not their consolidation strategies. OMB\u2019s position, which we support, is that non-mainframe centers should have been described in DOD\u2019s inventories and consolidation strategies, as the purpose of OMB Bulletin 96-02 is to look for ways to consolidate all DOD\u2019s computer centers, not just its mainframe computer centers. We made our recommendation that OMB clarify the Bulletin with regard to its mid-tier consolidation criteria in order to preclude any future confusion.", "We further recommended that OMB clarify in the Bulletin that while DOD has previously been permitted to provide separate submissions for the three services and for DOD, it should be required to provide a single, integrated submission for the entire Department. 4.We provided and discussed an earlier draft of this report with DOD officials and have incorporated their comments as appropriate to improve the accuracy of the report. The reference in DOD\u2019s letter to our handling of the Army\u2019s centers in table 2 refers to wording that was provided by the Army. However, note b to table 2 has been expanded to reflect Army\u2019s views that some of its centers provide unique missions (for example, command and control, and National Guard). 5.We did not include DOD\u2019s second enclosure in appendix II because it is an annotated copy of this report.
