The Fallon area averages less than 5 inches of rain  per year. Since the 1950s, the Navy has maintained a \u201cgreenbelt\u201d at the air  station that consists of acreage leased to local farmers who grow irrigated  crops on the land. In the Navy's view, having a \u201cgreenbelt\u201d serves to protect  the operational capability of the facility by reducing the risk of fire,  lowering the chance of bird strikes or other damage to aircraft from foreign  objects, and controlling dust. Since 1990, the Navy, on average, has  annually used approximately 1.6 billion gallons of surface water supplied  by the local irrigation project to irrigate this land. According to Fallon NAS  officials, the average annual water consumption for the balance of Fallon  NAS has been 219 million gallons, which is drawn from wells. Other  military facilities and commercial airports located in similar environments  have opted for land use approaches that are less water intensive.", "At your request, we gathered information on (1) the aviation safety and  operational requirements for the runway protection zone at Fallon NAS,  (2) the alternative land use strategies Fallon NAS identified in response to  congressional direction and how it evaluated them, and (3) the current  land use strategies at five military facilities and two commercial airports  that operate in similar environments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Fallon NAS was constructed in the 1940s on land that previously had been  farmed using water provided by the Bureau of Reclamation's Newlands  Reclamation Project. Prior to the project, which was authorized in 1903,  early settlers irrigated about 20,000 acres using simple diversions from the  Truckee and Carson rivers. The Newlands project nearly quadrupled the  amount of irrigated land to 78,000 acres, and the land surrounding the  airfield has been irrigated farmland since. In the 1950s, the Navy obtained,  as a buffer against encroachment, land surrounding the airfield that had  been irrigated farmland. It has since leased the bulk of that land to farmers.  Fallon NAS officials believe that continued use of the land for agriculture is  of value to the local community as well as to the air station. They point out  that the City of Fallon and Churchill County are concerned that any  reduction in Fallon NAS' irrigation could have a negative impact on the  recharging of the underlying aquifer, cause the manifestation of noxious  weeds in fields, and have an impact on the economics of neighboring  ranches and farms.", "The Navy currently holds water rights under the Newlands project for  approximately 2,900 acres of the land at Fallon NAS. Of this acreage, the  Navy has active water rights to about 1,900 acres of land. Water rights are  attached to specific parcels of land, and Fallon NAS is entitled to 3.5 acre- feet of water per acre of water-righted land from the Newlands project. An  acre-foot is the volume of water sufficient to cover an acre of land to the  depth of 1 foot, which is about 325,900 gallons. The water rights for the  remaining 1,000 acres are inactive. The active water rights, which would  equal about 2.2 billion gallons, are used to obtain irrigation water to  support the Navy's 3,595-acre greenbelt surrounding Fallon NAS' airstrip  areas. The greenbelt has consumed an average of 1.6 billion gallons of this  irrigation water each year since 1990. This figure includes drought years in  which less water than the normal allocation was available and other years  in which water over and above the acreage's entitlement was made  available.", "As can be seen in figure 1, about a third of the greenbelt acreage lies inside  the runway protection zone.", "Under Public Law 101-618, enacted in 1990, officials at Fallon NAS were  required to develop an alternative land management plan that would  control dust, provide for fire abatement and safety, and control damage to  aircraft from foreign objects, while at the same time reducing the use of  irrigation water. The law also required Fallon NAS to select and implement  land management plans without impairing the safety of air operations.  Under this act, the Navy has discretion to determine what constitutes  operational air safety for Fallon NAS. In addition, the Secretary of the Navy  was required to consult with the Secretary of Agriculture and other  interested parties to fund and implement a demonstration project and test  site at Fallon NAS for the cultivation and development of grasses, shrubs,  and other native plant species. The project's goal was to help with the  restoration of previously irrigated farmland in the Newlands project area to  a stable and ecologically appropriate dryland condition.", "In responding to the act's requirements, the Navy studied various land  management strategies, consulted with the Secretary of Agriculture and  interested parties, and selected a strategy for the greenbelt that combines  conventional farming with water conservation practices. Fallon NAS  officials have started to implement this strategy for the runway protection  zone. When fully implemented, the strategy would use approximately 1.4  billion gallons of water per year, somewhat of a decrease from the average  of 1.6 billion gallons used annually in recent years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aviation and Safety Requirements for the Runway Protection Zone at Fallon NAS", "paragraphs": ["Fallon NAS is governed by aviation safety and operational standards  established by DOD for runway protection zones. DOD's standards for  military facilities and the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA)  standards for commercial airports require runway protection zones to  protect lives and property. Under these standards, airports can obtain  sufficient authority to restrict the use of the land for the runway protection  zones in three primary ways. First, an airport can purchase the approach  areas outright. Second, an airport can seek zoning requirements to control  the way land owned by others is used. Third, an airport can purchase  easements proscribing the incompatible use of land owned by others.", "Outright ownership is preferable because it gives an airport maximum  control.", "It is DOD's and FAA's policy to oppose incompatible land uses that are  proposed for property within the runway protection zones. Incompatible  land uses include residences and places of public assembly such as  churches, schools, hospitals, office buildings, and shopping centers.  Compatible land uses within the runway protection zones are generally  uses such as agriculture or golf courses that do not involve concentrations  of people or the construction of buildings or other structures. DOD and  FAA also allow other land uses that do not attract wildlife and that do not  interfere with navigational aids. Neither policy requires the establishment  of a greenbelt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fallon NAS Limited Its Detailed Consideration to Three Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["In arriving at the land management strategy for Fallon NAS, the Navy  considered three alternatives in detail. Each involved continued irrigation  of land in Fallon NAS' greenbelt.", "As many as 11 different land management strategies were identified by  Fallon NAS officials at the outset. Three strategies were eliminated from  consideration before the initial screening was conducted. These three  included covering the greenbelt with asphalt, cement, or rocks, or allowing  the irrigated fields to go fallow. These strategies were eliminated because  the officials believed that they would be environmentally or economically  unacceptable or would cause unacceptable operational or safety  impairments. They also felt that the strategies would be expensive to  maintain and would not provide a \u201csoft\u201d landing for any aircraft accident.", "The remaining eight land management strategies were subjected to an  initial screening on the basis of how they would contribute to the Navy's  policy of zero accidental aircraft mishaps and at the same time fulfill the  requirements of P.L. 101-618. Four evaluation criteria were used to assess  the viability of the strategies: controlling dust and damage from foreign objects, including bird strikes; minimizing fire hazards; establishing a high probability of achieving safety objectives and  contributing to zero-mishap management; and reducing the direct surface deliveries of irrigation water.", "Of the eight land management strategies, five were eliminated because  Fallon NAS officials believed those strategies did not meet the evaluation  criteria. These five strategies ranged from changing the plants allowed to  be grown in the area to using drainwater for irrigation.", "The remaining three land use strategies were then subjected to detailed  consideration. Table 1 presents a comparison of the features of the three  strategies Fallon NAS officials considered in detail.", "The first and second strategies considered in detail included water  conservation practices. The methods considered for saving water included  lining canals, leveling fields for proper drainage, establishing windbreaks,  and improving irrigation scheduling. The third strategy would not have  required any changes to the way Fallon NAS officials had been managing  the greenbelt land but would have reduced the use of water by irrigating  fewer acres. Fallon NAS officials believed that, over time, this strategy  would result in land degradation and that there was a low probability that it  would control safety hazards such as dust, fire, and damage to aircraft from  foreign objects and bird strikes.", "In considering these strategies, Fallon NAS officials made no distinction  between the greenbelt areas that lie within the runway protection zone and  the areas that lie outside the zone. Approximately 1,145 acres of the  greenbelt lie within the runway protection zone, while 2,450 acres are  outside of it. We found no analysis that had determined whether the 2,450  acres of the greenbelt outside the runway protection zone required the  same level of prevention of foreign objects, bird strikes, or dust as the 1,145  acres within the zone. Fallon NAS officials confirmed that no such  distinction had been made in conducting their analyses.", "Fallon NAS officials selected the first strategy: conventional farming with  water conservation practices. At the time, these officials believed that the  advantages of this strategy were the very high probability that it would  satisfy the safety goals for the greenbelt for the long term and provide  moderate water savings. They believed that the disadvantage would be the  substantial capital, operations, and maintenance costs of the water  conservation methods.", "When fully implemented, the chosen strategy would encompass 1,914  water-righted acres of land, using approximately 1.4 billion gallons of water  per year. Navy officials believed that the plan would be costly to implement  because it included lining irrigation canals with concrete, leveling fields for  proper drainage, and other measures. According to Navy officials, the total  cost to implement all these measures could be as much as $3.5 million.", "Since selecting the strategy of conventional farming with water  conservation practices in 1995, Fallon NAS officials have undertaken  efforts to implement it. As of May 1999, Fallon NAS had lined 16,419 linear  feet of irrigation ditches and leveled 347 acres of fields at a cost of about  $655,000. This cost was in addition to an estimated $817,000 spent on  studies and pilot projects. According to the officials, the implementation of  this strategy has stalled because of excessive costs and a shortage of funds.  In 1998, Fallon NAS advertised a contract to line another 45,000 linear feet  of ditches with concrete and level another 800 acres of fields. Fallon NAS  originally estimated the cost of the additional work to be $1.4 million, but  the lowest bid it received for the work was $1.9 million. According to  Fallon NAS officials, because of the excessive costs, a shortage of funds,  and concern that the work would save what they believed would be a  relatively small amount of water, this contract was not awarded. Hence,  Fallon NAS' chosen land management strategy is not currently being fully  implemented.", "After the completion of our field work, Fallon NAS officials took action to  comply with the Fiscal Year 2000 National Defense Authorization Act,  which was enacted on October 5, 1999. The act included a provision  concerning water usage at Fallon NAS. To comply with their understanding  of the law, Fallon NAS officials informed us that they have decided to  reduce the irrigated land by about 700 acres. They will cease irrigation in  areas farthest from the airfield and the runway protection zone. Fallon NAS  officials expressed misgivings about this action but said that it would allow  them to comply with the new law. While they pointed out that the affected  land is not \u201ctechnically within the runway protection zones,\u201d they were  concerned that \u201cimproper management could impair operational safety and  create negative environmental impacts\u201d and that Fallon NAS may incur  added costs \u201cto properly manage the land for , fire,  weed and dust control.\u201d They also expressed concern about possible \u201clong- term degradation of the land.\u201d On balance, however, they said that the  strategy meets the requirement of the new law, and they also pointed out  that the action will serve as \u201can excellent pilot study\u201d of what happens  when irrigation ceases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Land Management Strategies Varied at Military Facilities and Commercial Airports Visited", "paragraphs": ["The land management strategies varied at the seven other military facilities  and commercial airports we visited. All were located in environments  similar to Fallon NAS'. Two military facilities used greenbelts, while the  other five did not. Officials at all seven facilities said their current land use  strategies provided a safe environment for their aircraft operations. The  strategies varied because of differences in land formation, history, access  to established irrigation facilities, and ownership. For example, at the two  Navy and one Marine Corps facilities we visited, the government owned  outright the areas surrounding the airfields as it does at Fallon NAS.  According to Navy officials, it has been the Navy's practice to purchase  land surrounding airfields to reduce possible encroachment and, where  possible, to lease this land for agricultural purposes- an activity compatible  with aircraft operations. One of the two Navy facilities and the one Marine  Corps facility we visited had greenbelts that were being farmed. Like Fallon  NAS, Lemoore NAS in Lemoore, California, and Yuma Marine Corps Air  Station in Yuma, Arizona, were constructed on land that was originally used  for irrigated farming. These three facilities maintain agricultural outlease  programs through which the Navy or Marine Corps leases the land adjacent  to the airfields to farmers. The farmers maintain the land and grow the  irrigated crops specified by the leases. The third naval location we visited,  China Lake Naval Weapons Station in Ridgecrest, California, does not have  a greenbelt and does not plan to have one. The station was constructed in a  desert area where crops are not grown and where the vast, sparsely  populated area is considered to be an ideal location for testing weapons  and conducting research and development.", "Neither of the two Air Force bases nor the two commercial airports we  visited had an agricultural program like the Navy and Marine Corps  facilities', nor did they try to maintain green areas around their runways  and taxiways. None has returned substantial acreage of well-established  agricultural land to native conditions. Officials from these facilities told us  that their research had not uncovered any reports equating the safety of air  operations with vegetation at the end of runways. In addition, they said that  the cost to maintain and water green areas in the absence of available  irrigation facilities would be substantial. At present, their water usage for  the runway protection zones was minimal.", "Officials at the facilities we visited expressed a strong desire to hold down  their water costs and believed that maintaining green areas around  runways was inconsistent with this objective. For example, Sky Harbor  International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona, used rock to landscape areas  surrounding the airport that were once irrigated. Additionally, Sky Harbor  officials have converted a significant amount of the airport's surrounding  area to desert landscaping and have adopted other water conservation  measures such as using a computerized irrigation system. According to the  officials, these efforts helped the airport save about 70 million gallons of  water during 1997. Similarly, at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada,  the terrain around the runways is mostly disturbed desert (regrown native  plants, thistle, or weeds). Because of the base's increased emphasis on  desert landscaping, water consumption has dropped by almost half, from  about 1.4 billion gallons of water in fiscal year 1996 to about 760 million  gallons of water in fiscal year 1999.", "The facilities we visited without green areas around their runways used  several techniques to maintain their land for safety purposes. These  techniques include (1) mowing their fields to maintain them as open space,  (2) covering specific areas within and surrounding the airstrip with asphalt  or cement, and (3) allowing their fields to go fallow and applying a soil  cement sealant in strategic locations to control dust and damage to aircraft  from foreign objects. Fallon NAS officials said that, while they are aware of  these other land management strategies, to date they have not studied them  in detail.

It should consider adopting different strategies that  recognize the distinction between areas within the runway protection zone  and those beyond the zone.

Approximately 190 F-16 aircraft are  housed at Luke.", "The runways are surrounded by the base's infrastructure on the east and  part of the south and by roads, fences, golf courses (both civilian and  military), and agricultural land where flowers and vegetables are grown on  the north, west, and the remainder of the south. The vegetation growing  immediately around the runways is mostly weeds. The area between the  runways is a combination of old asphalt and disturbed desert. The unused  portions of the airfield have gone untreated, and as a result, weeds are  growing in the cracks. Air Force officials at Luke have a program to mow  the vegetation so that it does not exceed 14 inches in height. Sections of the  airstrip have been sprayed with a soil sealant that helps control dust and  foreign objects.", "The irrigation of the green areas maintained on the base for aesthetic  purposes, such as recreation areas and at base housing, uses treated  effluent from the base's wastewater treatment plant piped to automatic  sprinkler systems. A new golf course will be irrigated using a similar  system.
