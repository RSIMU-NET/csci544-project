During this same period, the number of SNFs requesting and being granted payments for routine services higher than those normally allowed has also grown. The main reason cited by the SNF industry for the requests for higher rates is that some SNFs are caring for more complex and costly patients and, therefore, higher payments are justified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare and SNFs", "paragraphs": ["Medicare, authorized by title XVIII of the Social Security Act, is a federal health insurance program that covers almost all citizens 65 years of age or older and certain disabled people.

Part B, a voluntary program financed by enrollee premiums and general revenues, covers physician services and a wide range of other services such as laboratory tests and medical equipment used in the home. Medicare is administered by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).", "To qualify for SNF services, a Medicare beneficiary must have been hospitalized for 3 or more days, be admitted to the SNF on a medical professional\u2019s order for a condition related to the hospitalization, and need daily skilled nursing or therapy services. When the beneficiary meets these conditions, Medicare covers all necessary services, including room and board, nursing care, and ancillary services such as drugs, laboratory tests, and physical therapy. Medicare pays the full amount for the first 20 days. For the 21st through the 100th day of covered care, the beneficiary pays coinsurance of up to $92 per day (in 1996), and Medicare pays the remainder. Medicare coverage ends after the 100th day.", "To be eligible to receive payment under the Medicare program, SNFs must meet a set of 15 requirements, each of which consists of a number of elements. These requirements are designed to ensure that the SNF is capable of providing quality care to patients in a safe environment and cover such areas as fire safety, cleanliness, nursing staff, and medical records. HCFA contracts with state health agencies to survey nonstate-owned SNFs to determine whether they meet the requirements, a process known as survey and certification.

These contractors are called intermediaries, and their functions for SNFs include paying claims, reviewing the necessity of care, and auditing cost reports. The intermediaries pay SNFs during the year on the basis of interim rates, which are designed to closely approximate reasonable costs. After reviewing, and perhaps auditing, a SNF\u2019s cost report, the intermediary makes a final settlement, either paying any underpayment or recovering any overpayment.", "Under authority granted by section 223 of the Social Security Amendments of 1972, HCFA has established a limit on the amount of costs for routine services (room, board, general nursing, and administration costs) Medicare will recognize as reasonable. This routine cost limit (RCL) is set separately for freestanding urban, freestanding rural, hospital-based urban, and hospital-based rural SNFs. For freestanding SNFs the RCL is set at 112 percent of mean routine costs. Cost limits for hospital-based SNFs are set at the limit for freestanding SNFs plus 50 percent of the difference between the freestanding limit and 112 percent of mean routine costs of hospital-based SNFs. In 1996, this resulted in the RCL for urban hospital-based SNFs being about $39 per day higher than that for urban freestanding SNFs and about $26 per day higher for rural hospital-based versus rural freestanding SNFs.

The exemptions can last as long as 3 years and 11 months depending on when during the SNF\u2019s cost-reporting year the exemption becomes effective. The reason for the exemption is that new providers often have higher than usual costs as they hire staff and gradually increase their occupancy rates. During the exemption period, SNFs are paid their full reasonable costs whether or not those costs exceed their RCLs.", "Any SNF that is not exempt from the RCL can request an exception if its routine costs exceed its limit. While there are five circumstances for exceptions, about 98 percent of exception requests are for the atypical services criterion. As defined by regulation (42 C.F.R. 413.30), atypical services are items or services furnished because of the special needs of the Medicare patients treated and necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health care. For example, a common claim by SNFs seeking exceptions for atypical services is that they have high nursing care costs.", "Regulations governing exemptions and exceptions were in existence when RCLs were first established in 1979. In 1994, HCFA issued Transmittal 378, the agency\u2019s first written guidelines on the exception process.

He also asked us to ascertain whether there were differences between the Medicare patients treated by facilities that received higher rates and those that did not. To respond to this request, we addressed the following questions:", "How have SNF costs and use grown in relation to hospital use?", "How do Medicare patients in SNFs granted exceptions compare with Medicare patients in SNFs that have not received exceptions, including whether patients in SNFs granted exceptions need more intense or complex care?", "How do services provided by SNFs granted exceptions compare with services provided by SNFs that have not received exceptions (for example, nurse staffing levels, physician coverage, and therapy services)?", "Do patients in SNFs granted exceptions receive appropriate care?", "What information does HCFA gather to assess RCL exception requests, and does its process ensure that SNFs are furnishing atypical services before granting RCL exceptions?", "To identify growth in SNF use and its relation to hospital use, we obtained and analyzed HCFA data on Medicare beneficiary use of services in both settings. We also reviewed a number of studies and reports related to this area. To assess whether hospital length of stay was different when hospitals have SNF units, we examined changes in length of stay between fiscal years 1991 and 1994 for all Medicare patients and for 12 diagnoses that are likely to result in posthospital care.

In particular, we reviewed the current SNF exception request review process that was set out in HCFA\u2019s Transmittal 378 instructions issued in July 1994. We also discussed the SNF exception process with HCFA officials in the Bureau of Policy Development.", "We visited 10 intermediaries to determine the SNF exception request review process employed by each and verify that their reviews complied with the guidance laid out in Transmittal 378 and subsequent written correspondence. In November 1995, HCFA provided us with a database that contained information on 1,379 approved exception requests. The 10 intermediaries processed 789, or 57 percent, of these exceptions. The intermediaries we visited included five that processed more than 50 exception requests, two that processed fewer than 20 requests, and three participating in HCFA\u2019s experiment giving final approval authority to intermediaries. Two of the five selected high volume intermediaries also participated in the pilot project.", "To answer the questions about SNF patient characteristics and facility services, we analyzed (1) a compilation of HCFA-required resident assessment data (known as the Minimum Data Set (MDS)) about each nursing home resident in Maine, Missouri, Ohio, and Washington for calendar year 1994 and (2) Medicare claims file data for 1992 and 1994. In addition, for Maine and Ohio, we applied a HCFA method for classifying nursing home patients into homogenous groups according to common health characteristics and the amount and type of resources they use. To provide additional information on patient and facility characteristics, we visited five SNFs that had received exceptions in the past and continue to apply for exceptions. We chose these SNFs, located in California, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Washington, with input from state officials and local nursing home ombudsmen.", "To assess whether the care Medicare beneficiaries received in SNFs granted exceptions was appropriate, we asked officials in the SNFs we visited to identify a universe of their Medicare patients who they believed needed or likely needed more intense or complex care. We then randomly selected 20 of these patients\u2019 records from each facility that were sent to the peer review organization (PRO) located in the SNF\u2019s state, where they were reviewed by registered nurses and physicians using HCFA evaluation guidelines for quality and appropriateness of care.

HCFA subjects its data to periodic reviews and examinations and relies on the data obtained from these systems as evidence of Medicare-covered services and expenditures and to support its management and budgetary decisions. We did however, assess the reliability of the data by testing multiple data elements to confirm their expected relationships to one another, and individual data elements for specific attributes. The state-specific data we analyzed and the information from the site visits cannot be projected to the nation as a whole.

Each additional day of hospital stay meant more reimbursement. PPS changed financial incentives for hospitals by paying them a fixed amount per discharge that differs on the basis of the patient\u2019s diagnosis. This encouraged hospitals to be more efficient and to control costs. One way for hospitals to control costs is to reduce the average length of patient stay, and one way to reduce the length of stay is to transfer patients to SNFs as soon as medically appropriate. As a result, it was expected that SNF use would increase after PPS.", "Table 2.1 shows for fiscal years 1983 through 1995 the number of discharges from hospitals and admissions to SNFs along with the average length of stay in each setting. Hospital average length of stay decreased by about 29 percent, and discharges per 1,000 beneficiaries also decreased by about 24 percent. The reduction in discharges per 1,000 beneficiaries can be explained in large part by the substitution of ambulatory and outpatient surgery for inpatient surgery. For example, in 1981, the base year for PPS, about 332,000 Medicare discharges were for cataract surgery, accounting for over 1 million days of care. Today, almost all cataract surgery is done on an outpatient basis.", "Even though the complexity of hospital cases, as measured by the mean hospital case mix index, has increased on average by almost 28 percent since PPS began, average length of stay has gone down. Some of the decrease can probably be explained by the substitution of SNF care for what would in the past have been the last few days of hospital care. Beneficiary use of SNF services has increased from 10 admissions per 1,000 beneficiaries in 1983 to 42 per 1,000 based on preliminary data for 1995, and the percentage of hospital discharges resulting in SNF admissions has increased from 2.7 percent to 13.3 percent.", "PPS\u2019 effect on SNF use was initially smaller than expected and sometimes contrary to expectations. Medicare SNF admissions increased from 309,000 in 1983 to 353,000 in 1985. During the same period, Medicare SNF payments increased 5 percent, from $456 million to $480 million. However, between 1985 and 1987, this trend reversed. Medicare SNF admissions fell to 327,000, a 7 percent decline. Any PPS effect on Medicare SNF utilization was offset by intensified utilization review by Medicare intermediaries.", "Several events occurred in the late 1980s that resulted in increased SNF usage. In 1988, HCFA implemented revised SNF coverage guidelines in response to a lawsuit (Fox v. Bowen, 1987). The intent of these new guidelines was to make it easier for beneficiaries to obtain SNF coverage and to increase the consistency of coverage determinations. Enactment of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in 1988 also had a major effect by increasing coverage and reducing beneficiary cost sharing. These changes provided a strong incentive for providers to become certified as Medicare SNFs. Over 1,600 new SNFs and nearly 75,000 new beds were certified between December 1988 and December 1990.", "The combined effects of increased coverage and increased provider resources produced rapid growth in the use of the Medicare SNF benefit during calendar year 1989, the only year the catastrophic coverage provisions were fully in effect. Covered days of care more than doubled over the previous year, from 11.8 million to 28.6 million, while program payments increased from about $1 billion to $2.8 billion.", "With the repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in 1989, the SNF benefit structure returned to that in effect in 1988 after settlement of the lawsuit.

Historically, over 20 percent of SNFs with new provider exemptions received exceptions after their exemption period ended.

Medicare patients typically have been recently discharged from hospitals after treatment for acute conditions. The majority of non-Medicare patients in nursing homes are Medicaid patients with chronic conditions and long-term and custodial care needs.

For each type of facility, the base data included substantial time under the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 coverage criteria, which, as discussed, substantially liberalized Medicare coverage criteria for SNFs.

HHS said this suggestion failed to take into account the fact that Medicare patients are often the most resource-intensive patients a SNF treats and that the proportion of Medicare patients in a SNF is a valid indicator of case mix. HHS added that the RCLs are based on the average cost of all patients and that use of data on only Medicare patients would be inappropriate.", "We discuss in the report the differences between Medicare and other SNF patients and the rationale for using data on all patients in establishing the benchmarks used in evaluating exception requests. We did not recommend that HCFA substitute data on only Medicare patients for the current benchmark.

HHS considers the methodology flawed because it compared only Medicare patients in SNFs with exceptions with Medicare patients in SNFs without exceptions, which does not consider HCFA\u2019s proxy for case mix\u2014the facility\u2019s percentage of Medicare patients. First, our suggestion was based primarily on our review of HCFA\u2019s exception process discussed in chapter 4. We found that in general the only factor that affected a determination of whether a facility met the atypical services criterion was its proportion of Medicare patients, but a higher than average proportion in itself does not mean a SNF furnishes atypical services. Thus, we recommended that the review process be revised and suggested several types of information that might be useful to differentiate SNFs that furnish atypical services from those that merely have higher than normal costs. Second, as stated in chapter 1\u2019s scope and methodology section, our analysis of SNF patients was designed to answer questions about the characteristics of and services received by Medicare patients in facilities with and without RCL exceptions. The analysis is valid for these purposes. Moreover, we would expect that at least some differences between patients in the two SNF groups would be shown by such an analysis, and the fact that no differences emerged lends additional support to our suggestion to look at using Medicare-only data during the exception review process.", "HHS also noted that, in concert with the Congress, it is working on development of a PPS for SNFs that is expected to be sensitive to a facility\u2019s case mix. HHS believes that such a payment method would eliminate the need for an exception process. A SNF PPS that is sensitive to case mix might lessen the need for an exception process, but we suspect that some exception-type process would remain either for individual cases or facilities. Prospective payment methods generally retain such features. For example, Medicare\u2019s inpatient hospital PPS provides for paying sole community hospitals differently because of their special circumstances and provides a way for hospitals to receive additional payments for outlier cases that are extremely costly."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
