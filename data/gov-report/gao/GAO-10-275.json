To better protect these sites against attacks, DOE has sought to transform its protective forces protecting SNM into a Tactical Response Force (TRF) with training and capabilities similar to the U.S. military. DOE also has considered whether the current system of separate contracts for protective forces at each site provides sufficiently uniform, high-quality performance across its sites. Section 3124 of PL 110-181, the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, directed GAO to review protective forces at DOE sites that possess Category I SNM. Among other things, GAO (1) analyzed information on the management and compensation of protective forces, (2) examined the implementation of TRF, and (3) assessed DOE's two options to more uniformly manage DOE protective forces."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over 2000 contractor protective forces provide armed security for DOE and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) at six sites that have long-term missions to store and process Category I SNM. DOE protective forces at each of these sites are covered under separate contracts and collective bargaining agreements between contractors and protective force unions. As a result, the management and compensation--in terms of pay and benefits--of protective forces vary. Sites vary in implementing important TRF requirements such as increasing the tactical skills of protective forces so that they can better \"move, shoot, and communicate\" as a unit. While one site has focused on implementing TRF requirements since 2004, other sites do not plan to complete TRF implementation until the end of fiscal year 2011. In addition, broader DOE efforts to manage postretirement and pension liabilities for its contractors have raised concerns about a negative impact on retirement eligibility and benefits for protective forces. Specifically, protective force contractors, unions, and DOE security officials are concerned that the implementation of TRF's more rigorous requirements and the current protective forces' personnel systems threaten the ability of protective forces--especially older members--to continue their careers until retirement age. Efforts to more uniformly manage protective forces have focused on either reforming the current contracting approach or creating a federal protective force (federalization). Either approach might provide for managing protective forces more uniformly and could result in effective security if well-managed. Although DOE rejected federalization as an option in 2009 because it believed that the transition would be costly and would yield little, if any, increase in security effectiveness, the department recognized that the current contracting approach could be improved by greater standardization and by addressing personnel system issues. As a result, NNSA began a standardization initiative to centralize procurement of equipment, uniforms, and weapons to achieve cost savings. Under a separate initiative, a DOE study group developed a number of recommendations to enhance protective forces' career longevity and retirement options, but DOE has made limited progress to date in implementing these recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Contractor guard forces, or protective forces, are a key component of  security at Department of Energy (DOE) sites with special nuclear  material (SNM), which the department considers its highest security risk.

The risks associated with Category I SNM include  theft and the potential for sabotage through the use of a radioactive  dispersal device, also known as a \u201cdirty bomb.\u201d Currently, DOE and its  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a agency within DOE  responsible for the safety, security, and reliability of the U.S. nuclear  weapons stockpile, has six contractor-operated sites that possess\u2014and  will possess for the foreseeable future\u2014Category I SNM (sites with  \u201cenduring\u201d missions). The six sites include the Los Alamos National  Laboratory, in Los Alamos, New Mexico; the Y-12 National Security  Complex (Y-12), in Oak Ridge, Tennessee; the Pantex Plant, near Amarillo,  Texas; the Nevada Test Site, outside of Las Vegas, Nevada; the Savannah  River Site, near Aiken, South Carolina; and the Idaho National Laboratory,  near Idaho Falls, Idaho.", "In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, DOE  embarked on a multifaceted effort to better secure its sites with Category I  SNM against a larger and more sophisticated terrorist threat by changing  policies, such as its Design Basis Threat (DBT)\u2014a classified document  that specifies the potential size and capabilities of adversary forces that  the sites must defend against. Protective forces have been an important  focus of DOE security improvements. Initially, DOE deployed a larger  number of protective force members at its sites. More recently, DOE has  sought to improve the effectiveness of its protective forces by deploying  security technologies, such as sensors capable of detecting adversaries at  long ranges, and through the use of advanced weaponry, such as belt-fed  machine guns and grenade launchers. In addition, DOE has sought to  enhance protective forces\u2019 tactical skills\u2014the ability to move, shoot, and  communicate in a combat environment\u2014through its Tactical Response  Force (TRF) initiative. Among other things, this initiative directed the  development of new training curricula at DOE\u2019s National Training Center,  revised the application of DOE\u2019s existing protective force categories to  emphasize tactical skills, and instituted more rigorous weapons and  physical fitness qualifications for many of DOE\u2019s protective forces.", "However, protective force unions have been concerned that the planned  implementation of TRF\u2014with its potentially more demanding  requirements\u2014threatens the ability of protective forces to work until  retirement age. These concerns contributed to a 44-day protective force  strike at the Pantex Plant in 2007. The strike raised broader issues in DOE  and Congress about the continued suitability of DOE\u2019s model for managing  its protective forces. Unionized protective forces can strike when their  collective bargaining agreement ends and strikes may create security  vulnerabilities at DOE\u2019s sites with Category I SNM. In addition, DOE\u2019s  practice of managing its protective forces through separate contracts at  each site could create disparities in protective force performance, pay, and  benefits. A coalition of unions that represent a large number of DOE  protective forces has supported federalizing contractor-operated  protective forces to provide a federal personnel system that better  supports a TRF through standardized pay and retirement benefits. The  coalition noted that DOE\u2019s Office of Secure Transportation\u2019s (OST) federal  agents, who are responsible for transporting Category I SNM among DOE  sites and to military bases and who have a unique federal job  classification, could serve as a template for federalization. In January 2009,  DOE rejected federalization of contractor protective forces on the grounds  that it would be costly and would likely provide little, if any, increase in  security effectiveness.

We selected these sites because  each represented one of the three different types of protective force  contracts currently in place. In addition, we distributed a data collection  instrument to protective force contractors and federal site office officials  at each of these sites and at the other three sites with enduring Category I  SNM missions\u2014Y-12, the Nevada Test Site, and the Idaho National  Laboratory. From this instrument, we received site information about the  protective forces, the status of TRF and DBT implementations, views on  DOE options for managing the protective forces, and the reliability of site  data.

To identify and assess options for the more uniform  protective force management through federalization, we met with the  NNSA Service Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) on cost and job classification of protective  forces. We developed criteria for options for more uniform management  by reviewing past and ongoing DOE protective force and federal agent  studies that HSS, NNSA, and OST provided.

Specific elements vary from site to  site but almost always include, in addition to protective forces,    a variety of integrated alarms and sensors capable of detecting intruders;    physical barriers, such as fences and antivehicle barriers;    numerous access control points, such as turnstiles, badge readers, vehicle  inspection stations, radiation detectors, and metal detectors;    operational security procedures, such as the \u201ctwo-person\u201d rule\u2014which is  designed to prevent only one person from having access to SNM ; and    hardened facilities and storage vaults to protect SNM from unauthorized  access.", "Increasing security at DOE sites since the terrorist attacks of September  11, 2001, has been costly and challenging.

Protective forces\u2014the single most costly element of DOE security, as well  as one of the most important \u2014have been a major focus of DOE security  efforts. The need to increase security at DOE sites as rapidly as possible  following the 2001 attacks meant that DOE protective forces worked large  amounts of overtime for an extended period. DOE\u2019s Inspector General and  Office of Independent Oversight, as well as GAO, reported on the potential  for extended overtime to increase fatigue and reduce readiness, and  training opportunities for protective forces. Since then, DOE has sought  to control protective force costs by increasing the use of security  technology and advanced weaponry and by consolidating material into  fewer and better protected locations.", "Since September 11, 2001, DOE security policies, including the DBT, have  been under almost constant examination and have undergone  considerable change. For example, DOE issued new DBTs in 2003, 2004,  and 2005, and, most recently, in November 2008. In its latest iteration, the  DBT was renamed the Graded Security Protection (GSP) policy. The GSP  is conceptually identical to DOE\u2019s previous DBTs. However, compared  with the 2005 DBT, the GSP identifies a generally smaller and less capable  terrorist adversary force for DOE sites with Category I SNM.", "DOE has also sought to increase the tactical effectiveness of protective  force performance. Specifically, according to a 2004 classified DOE  review, the then-current organization and tactics of DOE protective forces  needed improvement to deal with possible terrorist threats. The review  found that, historically, DOE protective forces had been more concerned  with a broad range of industrial security and order-keeping functions than  with preparing to conduct a defensive battle against a paramilitary  attacker, as described in DOE\u2019s previous DBTs and GSP. To address this  situation, the review recommended shifting to an aggressive militarylike,  small-unit, tactical defense posture, which included enhanced tactical  training standards to allow protective forces to move, shoot, and  communicate effectively as a unit in a combat environment. It also  recommended more frequent, realistic, and rigorous force-on-force  performance testing and training for the department\u2019s protective forces.", "On the basis of this review, DOE has sought to transform DOE\u2019s protective  forces who safeguard special nuclear material into an \u201celite force\u201d\u2014a  TRF\u2014with training and capabilities similar to military units.

Since the early  1990s, the department has intermittently considered federalization  because of variety of security challenges, often involving actual or  potential strikes by contractor protective forces:    A 1992 DOE review concluded there was no clear evidence that  federalization of protective forces would significantly save costs or  improve security. DOE reviewed the issue of federalization in response to  a 1990 GAO report that examined a protective force strike at Los Alamos  National Laboratory in 1989.", "A 1997 DOE report raised concerns about the potential deterioration of an  aging protective force\u2019s physical and combat capabilities; the increasing  difficulties in meeting the sudden demand for additional personnel in the  event of a strike; and cost pressures, such as more overtime pay after the  department had downsized the protective forces.

Under these strategies, DOE  requires that adversaries be denied \u201chands-on\u201d access to nuclear weapons  and nuclear test devices at fixed sites, as well as all Category I SNM in  transit. For other Category I SNM at fixed sites, DOE requires that  adversaries be prevented from having enough time to complete malevolent  acts. If adversaries gain access to Category I SNM, DOE requires that  protective forces engage in recapturing the SNM on site or recovering the  material if it leaves the site. As required by the Fiscal Year 2006 National  Defense Authorization Act, DOE reported to Congress in 2007 that all its  sites could meet the 2003 DBT.", "To verify the information DOE reported, we examined whether the sites  had approved Site Safeguards and Security Plans and whether they had  undergone an Office of Independent Oversight Inspection to test those  plans. We found that all sites (except for the one DOE site that had  implemented the 2005 DBT) had approved Site Safeguards and Security  plans for the 2003 DBT, and almost all had undergone inspections by the  Office of Independent Oversight to test those plans. In most cases,  protective forces performed effectively in these inspections. However, in a  2008 inspection, one site\u2019s protective forces received a \u201cneeds  improvement\u201d rating\u2014that is, it only partially met identified protection  needs or provided questionable assurance that identified protection needs  were met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of Secure Transportation Federal Agents and Protective Forces Differ Significantly in Several Respects", "paragraphs": ["Although they are both responsible for protecting SNM, OST federal  agents substantially differ from site protective forces in terms of numbers,  organization, management, pay, benefits, mission, and training:    OST forces totaled 363 as of September 30, 2008, or less than one-seventh  the total number of protective forces members at DOE sites with enduring  Category I missions.", "OST forces are geographically dispersed, but unlike protective forces,  management is centralized. OST operations are organized into three  commands, which are collocated at two DOE sites and a Department of  Defense military base. These commands report to a central command in  Albuquerque, New Mexico, which is under a single organization, NNSA. In  contrast, the protective forces at six sites have decentralized management  and are overseen by one of three DOE organizations.", "Federal managers directly operate the OST organization and supervise  federal agents.", "Unlike protective forces, OST federal agents cannot collectively bargain  and are covered by a single pay system. Effective in March 2008, the  NNSA\u2019s Pay Band Demonstration is a pay system for most NNSA federal  employees\u2014including OST federal agents. Table 6 shows the differences  between the protective forces\u2019 many negotiated pay rates and the  nonsupervisory federal agents\u2019 single pay band, which is linked to federal  pay grades that are established governmentwide.", "In addition, while OST\u2019s pay system is designed for more flexible pay,  protective forces\u2019 pay rules generally do not provide for any variation in a  position\u2019s pay rate after a few years of service. Specifically, OST agents\u2019  pay rates can vary more when they are hired and in later years because the  NNSA pay system is designed to give OST managers more flexibility to  offer exceptional candidates higher entry salaries and to provide faster or  slower annual pay progression, depending on individual performance. In  contrast, fixed pay rules allow a contracted SPO to start at the top pay rate  or to reach or closely approximate it after only about 1 to 3 years of  service. However, as table 6 shows, both protective forces and federal  agents receive significantly higher pay for overtime hours.", "Concerning benefits, OST federal agents generally receive those that are  broadly available to other federal employees, such as through the Federal  Employee Health Benefit program and the Federal Employee Retirement  System (FERS), which has a defined benefit component and a defined  contribution component. In contrast, at each site, protective force unions  negotiate for benefits such as medical insurance and retirement plans, and  new hires in protective forces generally do not receive defined benefits for  retirement. In addition, in 1998, Congress made OST federal agents eligible  to retire earlier (at age 50 after 20 years of service) with a higher monthly  retirement annuity (defined benefit) than is typical for other federal  employees. This early retirement provision contrasts with the provisions  for the two defined benefit plans open to new protective force hires as of  September 2008, which provides for retirement with more years served or  at older ages.", "OST federal agents\u2019 mobile mission also differs significantly from that of  protective forces that guard fixed sites. OST agents operate convoys of  special tractor trailers and special escort vehicles to transport Category I  SNM. These agents travel on U.S. highways that cross multiple federal,  state, tribal, and local law enforcement jurisdictions. They also travel as  many as 15 days each month. Agents may also provide security for  weapons components that are flown on OST\u2019s small fleet of aircraft. In  contrast to the public setting of agents\u2019 work, protective forces that guard  Category I SNM at fixed sites typically have elaborate physical defenses  and tightly restricted and monitored public access.", "Finally, the training for OST federal agents and protective forces differs.  Although both OST and protective force contractors must comply with  DOE orders and regulations when developing and executing training, OST  agents undergo longer, more frequent, and more diverse training than do  most protective forces. For example, newly hired OST trainees undergo  longer basic training, lasting 21 weeks at OST\u2019s academy in Fort Chaffee,  Arkansas. To operate OST\u2019s fleet of vehicles, federal agents must also  complete the requirements for a commercial driver\u2019s license. In addition,  all agents must meet DOE\u2019s offensive combatant standard throughout their  careers. Overall, OST officials estimate that OST federal agents spend  about a third of their time in training, which, according to an NNSA  official, is much more frequent than most contractor protective forces.  Much of the training is tactically oriented, and OST convoy elements are  organized into tactical units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Protective Forces and Office of Secure Transportation Federal Agents Do Not Routinely Use Their Federal Law Enforcement Authority to Make Arrests", "paragraphs": ["In the performance of their official duties, both protective forces and OST  federal agents have limited arrest authority for a variety of misdemeanors  and felonies, though neither routinely exercises this arrest authority.  Both protective forces and OST federal agents are also authorized to use  deadly force to protect SNM and may pursue intruders in order to prevent  their escape and to arrest those they suspect have committed certain  misdemeanors or felonies or have obtained unauthorized control of SNM.  DOE\u2019s Federal Protective Force manual (DOE M 470.4-8) and DOE\u2019s  Contractor Protective Force manual (DOE 470.4-3A) set guidelines and  direct DOE sites to develop policies for using deadly force and for fresh  pursuit, which involves pursuing suspected criminals who flee across  jurisdictional boundaries, such as leaving the property of a DOE site.  These actions include developing memorandums of understanding that  establish, among other things, fresh pursuit guidelines with other law  enforcement agencies.", "DOE protective forces and OST federal agents have limited authority to  make arrests for specific misdemeanors and felonies, such as trespassing  on, or the theft or destruction of, federal property. Other offenses against  government property subject to arrest include sabotage, civil disorder,  conspiracy, and the communication of or tampering with restricted data.  For the covered misdemeanors and felonies, protective forces and OST  federal agents have authority to arrest if they observe the offenses while  they are performing their official duties; for the covered felonies, they may  also make arrests if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the  person has committed a felony. If other federal law enforcement agencies,  such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), are involved in the  apprehension of suspected criminals, even on DOE property, protective  forces and OST federal agents must relinquish arresting authority to the  other federal agencies. While both protective forces and OST federal  agents receive initial and annual refresher training in law enforcement  authorities and duties, we found that protective forces at the six sites last  made an unassisted arrest using their federal authority more than 25 years  ago. The protective forces at Pantex arrested nine individuals, six in 1981  and three in 1983, for trespassing on site property. In both instances, the  offenders were convicted and sentenced to a federal detention facility.", "According to OST officials, federal agents do not routinely make arrests  because they have not encountered individuals attempting to steal SNM  from their shipments, which is the focus of their legal concerns. Protective  forces do not routinely use their federal authority to make arrests for  several reasons, in addition to limited authority. First, one contractor site  official told us, federal courts, which have jurisdiction for all arrests made  by protective forces using their federal authority, are reluctant to pursue  what may be considered minor cases associated with a DOE site. Instead,  this official said, the site had more success prosecuting crimes in state and  local courts. In these cases, arrests are made by local and state law  enforcement agencies. Second, DOE security officials told us that sites  may be concerned about the legal liability of using contractor employees  to make arrests and potential lawsuits that could ensue. Finally, both  DOE and site contractor officials told us that routine law enforcement  duties may distract protective forces from performing their primary duty  to protect Category I SNM.", "Rather than make arrests when witnessing possible crimes, protective  forces may gather basic facts, secure the crime scene, and notify  management, which decides whether to refer the matter to local law  enforcement agencies, DOE\u2019s Inspector General, the U.S. Marshall, or the  FBI for arresting and transporting suspects. However, we could not  determine how often the forces take these actions because sites do not  typically document detainments or have facilities in which to hold such  detainees.", "While protective forces and OST federal agents seldom use their federal  arrest authority, protective forces have used other legal authorities to  make arrests. For example, specially designated protective force officers  at the Savannah River Site (SRS), are authorized under South Carolina law  to make arrests and investigate crimes.

Overall, in comparing these criteria against the two principal options, we  found that neither contractor nor federal forces seem overwhelmingly  superior, but each has offsetting advantages and disadvantages. Either  option could result in effective and more uniform security if well-managed.  However, we identified transitional problems with converting the current  protective force to a federalized force.

First,  both options\u2014maintaining the current security force structure or  federalizing the security force\u2014have offsetting advantages and  disadvantages, with neither option emerging as clearly superior. For  example, one relative advantage of a contractor force is the perceived  greater flexibility for hiring, disciplining, or terminating an employee; one  relative disadvantage of a contractor force is that it can strike. In contrast,  federalization could better allow protective forces to advance or laterally  transfer to other DOE sites to meet protective force members\u2019 needs or  DOE\u2019s need to resize particular forces.", "Second, key disadvantages, such as potential strikes, do not preclude  effective operations if the security force is well-managed. According to  one protective force manager, a well-managed protective force is less  likely to strike. In addition, a 2009 memo signed by the NNSA  administrator stated that NNSA had demonstrated that it can effectively  manage strikes through the use of replacement protective forces. With  respect to federal protective forces, a 2004 department work group on  protective force issues observed that even federal operations like OST had  experienced difficult labor-management relations that had to be carefully  managed in order to ensure effective performance.", "Third, as can be seen in the following examples, distinctions between the  two options, each of which could have many permutations, can be  overstated by comparing worse- and best-case scenarios, when similar  conditions might be realized under either option.", "While federalization might improve effectiveness and efficiency by driving  standardization, NNSA recently announced initiatives to increase  standardization among contract protective forces to achieve some of the  same benefits, including cost savings.", "Federalization could potentially provide early and enhanced retirement  benefits, which could help to ensure a young and vigorous workforce.  However, such benefits might also be provided to contractor protective  forces.", "Although more centralized federal control might impede both protective  forces\u2019 support of a site\u2019s operations and the coordination between  contractors and federal managers, this concern presumes a scenario in  which the department would choose a highly centralized organization,  whereas it might delegate responsibility for day-to-day operations to its  site managers.", "Either option could be implemented with more or less costly features. For  example, adding the early and enhanced retirement benefits would  increase costs for either contractor or federal protective forces.", "Reliably estimating the costs of protective force options proved difficult  and precluded our detailed reporting on it for two broad reasons. First,  since contractor and federal forces could each have many possible  permutations, choosing any particular option to assess would be arbitrary.  For example, a 2008 NNSA-sponsored study identified wide-ranging  federalization options, such as federalizing all or some SPO positions at  some or all facilities or reorganizing them under an existing or a new  agency. Second, DOE will have to decide on the hypothetical options\u2019 key  cost factors before it can reasonably compare costs. For example, when  asked about some key cost factors for federalization, an NNSA Service  Center official said that a detailed workforce analysis would be needed to  decide whether DOE would either continue to use the same number of  SPOs with high amounts of scheduled overtime or hire a larger number of  SPOs who would work fewer overtime hours. Also, the official said that  until management directs a particular work schedule for federalized  protective forces, there is no definitive answer to the applicable overtime  rules, such as whether overtime begins after 8 hours in a day. The amount  of overtime and the factors affecting it are crucial to a sound cost estimate  because overtime pay can now account for up to about 50 percent of pay  for worked hours."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transition to a Federalized Security Workforce Creates Difficult Issues Either under Current Laws or with Special Provisions for Enhanced Retirement Benefits", "paragraphs": ["If protective forces were to be federalized under existing law, the current  forces might face a loss of pay or even their jobs.

Under the applicable  rules for federal security guards, transitioning protective forces would not  become eligible to retire with immediate federal annuities until at least age  55, and only after accruing sufficient years of federal service. For example,  transitioning protective forces could begin receiving a federal annuity at  age 62 with 5 years of service or, with reduced benefits, at age 55 to 57  (depending on birth year) with 10 years of service.", "In addition, transitioning force members may receive lower pay as federal  employees, according to our analysis of two tentative federal pay levels for  protective force positions at SPO levels of I, II, and III.

OPM had determined that OST federal agents did not meet the  definition for law enforcement officer that would have made them eligible  for early and enhanced retirement benefits. Consequently, at DOE urging,  Congress enacted legislation to give OST federal agents the special 20-year  retirement provisions.", "Although a coalition of unions has supported federalization to get early  and enhanced retirement benefits, provisions associated with these  benefits could create hiring and retirement difficulties for older force  members. Older members might not be rehired because agencies are  typically authorized to set a maximum age, often age 37, for entry into  federal positions with early retirement. In addition, even if there were a  waiver from the maximum age of hire, older protective forces members  could not retire at age 50 because they would have had to work 20 years to  meet the federal service requirement for \u201cearly\u201d retirement benefits. These  forces could retire earlier if they were granted credit for their prior years  of service under DOE and NNSA contracts. However, OPM officials told us  OPM would strongly oppose federal retirement benefits being granted for  previous years of contractor service (retroactive benefits). According to  these officials, these retroactive benefits would be without precedent and  would violate the basic concept that service credit for retirement benefits  is only available for eligible employment at the time it was performed.  Moreover, retroactive benefits would create an unfunded liability for  federal retirement funds.

They concluded  that, among other things, the transition to a federal force would be costly  and would be likely to provide little, if any, increase in security  effectiveness. However, these officials recognized that the current  contractor system could be improved by addressing some of the issues  that federalization might have resolved. In particular, they announced the  pursuit of an initiative to better standardize protective forces\u2019 training and  equipment. According to these officials, more standardization serves to  increase effectiveness and cost efficiency as well as to better facilitate  responses to potential work stoppages. In addition, in March 2009, the  Chief HSS Officer commissioned a study group, which included DOE  officials and protective force union representatives and had input from  protective force contractors, to recommend ways to overcome the  personnel system problems that might prevent protective force members  from working to a normal retirement age, such as 60 to 65, and building  reasonable retirement benefits.", "Both of these initiatives might benefit the department and its programs.  For example, the initiative to standardize protective forces has started  focusing on the inefficiencies arising from having each contractor  separately choose and procure security equipment and support services;  one identified inefficiency is that smaller separate orders hinder  contractors from negotiating better prices. In NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2010  budget request, NNSA predicted that standardizing procurement and  security equipment, such as vehicles, weapons, and ammunition, could  save NNSA, cumulatively, 20 percent of its costs for such equipment by  2013. With respect to the career and retirement initiative, the DOE study  group reported, among other potential benefits, that improving career  incentives for individuals to enter a protective force career and then  remain in the DOE security community for a lifetime of service could help  the department minimize the significant costs associated with hiring,  vetting, and training protective force members.", "NNSA has established a Security Commodity Team\u2014composed of security  and procurement professionals from NNSA, some DOE sites, and other  DOE organizations\u2014to focus first on procuring ammunition and  identifying and testing other security equipment that can be used across  sites. According to NNSA officials, NNSA established a common  mechanism in December 2009 for sites to procure ammunition. Another  effort will seek greater standardization of protective force operations  across sites, in part by HHS or NNSA clarifying protective force policies  when sites do not have the same understanding of these policies or  implement them in different ways. To move toward more standardized  operations and a more centrally managed protective force program, NNSA  started a broad security review to identify possible improvements. As one  result of this security review, according to NNSA officials in January 2010,  NNSA has developed a draft standard for protective force operations,  which is intended to clarify both policy expectations and a consistent  security approach that is both effective and efficient.", "For the personnel system initiative to enhance career longevity and  retirement options, in June 2009, a DOE-chartered study group made 29  recommendations that were generally designed to enable members to  reach a normal retirement age within the protective force, take another  job within DOE, or transition to a non-DOE career. The study group  identified 14 of its 29 career and retirement recommendations as involving  low- or no-cost actions that could conceivably be implemented quickly.  For example, some recommendations seek to ensure that protective force  members are prepared for job requirements through expanding fitness and  wellness programs and reviewing the appropriateness of training. Other  recommendations call for reviews to find ways to maximize the number of  armed and unarmed positions that SPOs can fill when they can no longer  meet their current combatant requirements. Other recommendations focus  on providing training and planning assistance for retirement and job  transitions.

The study group had worked with the assumption that DOE  security budgets will remain essentially flat for the foreseeable future, and  may actually decline in real dollars. Nevertheless, it identified 15 of its 29  career and retirement recommendations as challenging because they  involve additional program costs, some of which are likely to be  substantial, and may require changes to management structures and  contracts. For example, to provide some income security when  protective officer members must take a lower-paying position because of  illness, injury, or age, one recommendation would include provisions in  collective bargaining agreements to at least temporarily prevent or reduce  drops in pay. Among the more challenging recommendations is a call to  enhance retirement plans and to make them more equivalent and portable  across sites\u2014the types of changes that a coalition of unions had hoped  federalization might provide.", "Progress on the 29 recommendations has been limited to date. When  senior department officials were briefed on the personnel system  recommendations in late June 2009, they took them under consideration  for further action but immediately approved one recommendation\u2014to  extend the life of the study group by forming a standing committee. They  directed the standing committee to develop implementation strategies for  actions that can be done in the near term and, for recommendations  requiring further analysis, additional funding, or other significant actions,  to serve as an advisory panel for senior department officials. According to  a DOE official in early December 2009, NNSA and DOE were in varying  stages of reviews to advance the other 28 recommendations.

However, in making  these changes, DOE and its protective force contractors through their  collective bargaining agreements have not successfully aligned protective  force personnel systems\u2014which affect career longevity, job transitions, and  retirement\u2014with the increased physical and other demands of a more  paramilitary operation. Without better alignment, in our opinion, there is  greater potential for a strike at a site, and potential risk to site security, when  protective forces\u2019 collective bargaining agreements expire. In the event of a  strike at one site, the differences in protective forces\u2019 training and equipment  make it difficult to readily provide reinforcements from other sites. Even if  strikes are avoided, the effectiveness of protective forces may be reduced if  tensions exist between labor and management. The potential for a strike and  for declines in protective forces\u2019 performance have elevated the importance  of finding the most effective approach to maintaining protective force  readiness, including an approach that better aligns personnel systems and  protective force requirements.

The intent  of this recommendation and the next is to provide positions to be filled  by PF members who can no longer meet either the offensive or the  defensive combatant standards.  3.  Unarmed PF-related work should be identified as part of the career  path for PF members.", "4.  Measures should be adopted to minimize the impact of current  physical fitness standards upon career longevity, and these standards  should be reviewed against current job requirements.  5.  Revisions to current medical requirements should be developed to  ensure that existing medical conditions do not represent (given the  current state of the medical arts) unreasonable barriers to career  longevity.  6.  So long as the department expects PF personnel to meet explicit  medical and fitness standards, it should provide reasonable means to  prepare for testing and evaluation.  7.  Existing \u201cfitness/wellness\u201d programs should be expanded to help SPOs  maintain and prolong their ability to meet physical fitness  requirements and to achieve medical cost savings that result from  maintaining a well-managed program. According to the study group,  this recommendation is not cost-neutral.  8.  Retirement/transition planning should be integrated into PF training.  9.  The capabilities of the National Training Center should be used to  facilitate career progression and job transition training.  10. PF organizations should be encouraged to appoint \u201cCareer  Development/Transition\u201d officers to assist personnel in career path  and transition planning.  11. The Human Reliability Program (HRP) monitors employees to ensure  they have no emotional, mental, or physical conditions that impede  them from reliably conducting their work. Under this program, if a  reasonable belief or credible evidence indicates that employees are not  reliable, they should be immediately removed from their duties as an  interim precautionary measure. The study group recommended taking  strong actions to correct HRP administrative errors and to rigorously  enforce existing prohibitions against using HRP in a punitive manner.  This recommendation and the next arise from a concern that some  protective force members may be punished without the opportunity  for timely recourse.  12. Contractor policies and actions that lead to placing PF members in  nonpaid status without appropriate review or recourse should be  closely monitored (and, where necessary, corrected).", "13. DOE M 470.4-3A, Contractor Protective Force, should be reviewed to  ensure that requirements are supportable by appropriate training.  14. To encourage future communication on the issues considered in this  study, the life of the present study group should be extended as a  standing committee, and union participation in the DOE HSS  Protective Force Policy Panel should be ensured.", "The study group thought the following 15 recommendations would require  currently unbudgeted resources or changes to existing contracts.  15. Existing defined contribution plans should be reviewed in order to  identify methods to improve benefits, to ensure greater comparability  of benefits from one site to the next, and to develop methods to  improve portability of benefits. This recommendation, and those  through number 19, involve changes to retirement plans that could  enhance benefits and allow protective force personnel to transfer  benefits more easily when moving to other sites.  16. Consistency in retirement criteria should be established across the  DOE complex (e.g., a point system incorporating age and years of  service or something similar).  17. The potential for incorporating a uniform cost-of-living allowance into  defined benefit retirement programs based on government indexes  should be examined.  18. Portability of service credit between PF and other DOE contractors  should be explored. This could be directed in requests for proposals  for new PF contracts.  19. Potential actions should be explored to create a reasonable disability  retirement bridge for PF personnel when alternate job placement is  unsuccessful.  20. Job performance requirements (such as firearms proficiency) should  be supported by training sufficient to enable PF members to have  confidence in meeting those requirements.  21. A retraining fund should be created to assist personnel with job  transitions and second careers.  22. A centralized job registry should be established to facilitate  identification of job opportunities across the complex.", "23. Consideration should be given to sponsoring a student loan program to  assist PF members in developing second careers.  24. The department, as a matter of policy and line management procedure,  should establish the position that SPOs be considered for job  placement within each respective site\u2019s organizational structure before  a contractor considers hiring personnel from outside of the site.  25. \u201cSave pay\u201d provisions should be included in collective bargaining  agreements to cover specified periods when a PF member must be  classified to a lower-paying position because of illness, injury, or aging.  26. DOE should explore the potential for facilitating partnerships among  the various contractor organizations in order to broaden employment  opportunities for aging or injured personnel and to encourage PF  personnel seeking alternative career paths to actively compete for  those opportunities.  27. Where possible, the department should review its separate PF prime  contracts and convert them to \u201ctotal\u201d security and emergency  management contracts. The intent of this recommendation is to permit  protective force personnel to better compete for emergency  management positions when they lack the ability or desire to continue  with their security positions.  28. PF arming and arrest authority should be reviewed with the objective  of enhancing the capabilities of SPOs. The intent of this  recommendation is to, among other things, ease SPOs\u2019 postretirement  path into law enforcement positions.  29. Where possible, equipment, including uniforms, weapons, and badges,  should be standardized throughout the department. According to the  study group, more standardized uniforms might improve protective  forces\u2019 morale and could offer some offsetting cost savings for the  department."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jonathan Gill, Assistant Director;  John Cooney; Don Cowan; Cindy Gilbert; Terry Hanford; Mehrzad Nadji;  Cheryl Peterson; and Carol Herrnstadt Shulman made key contributions to  this report.
