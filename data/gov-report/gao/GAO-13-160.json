Physician organizations concur that a standardized set of metrics would be less administratively complex.", "Most private entities in GAO's study provide financial incentives tied to meeting absolute benchmarks--fixed performance targets--or a combination of absolute benchmarks and performance improvement. Physician organizations prefer incentives tied to absolute benchmarks over those based on how physicians perform relative to their peers. Physician organizations also favored incentives that reward improvement because baseline levels of performance vary.", "While private entities' incentive payments vary in size and in method, private entities typically provide such payments within 7 months of the end of the performance measurement period. Physician organizations stated that financial incentives should be distributed soon after the measurement period to have the greatest effect on performance.", "The efforts of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)--the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program--to transform the physician payment system in Medicare reflect, to varying degrees, the themes that GAO identified among selected private entities with physician payment incentives.

The Medicare physician fee schedule is updated  annually by the SGR system, with the intent of limiting the total growth in  Medicare spending for physician services over time. Because of rapid  growth in Medicare spending for physician services, the SGR has called  for fee reductions since 2002. However, congressional action has  temporarily averted such fee reductions for 2003 through 2012.  Payments under the physician fee schedule totaled about $67 billion in  fiscal year 2011, accounting for about 12 percent of total Medicare  spending.", "Because physicians both directly and indirectly affect total health care  spending, many private health care purchasers, such as insurers, have  initiated programs to reward high-performing physicians and encourage  patients to obtain care from these physicians, and these programs have  evolved to reflect the increased sophistication of payers and providers.  Since the late 1990s, some purchasers have provided financial incentives  to physicians for meeting certain performance measures for quality and  efficiency, an initiative known as pay-for-performance. As these efforts  have evolved, some private purchasers have sought to improve quality  and efficiency using models of coordinated care delivery that may  incorporate elements of an accountable care organization (ACO) or a  patient-centered medical home (PCMH).", "In 2007, we reported on various ways that several health care purchasers  profiled the performance of physicians in their networks to draw  comparisons between efficient and inefficient providers, and linked their  performance evaluation results to a range of financial incentives. We  recommended that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS)\u2014the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) that administers the Medicare program\u2014start a physician profiling  system with a focus on efficiency to help control Medicare spending. In  2008, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act required  HHS to implement a Physician Feedback Program that includes  distribution of confidential feedback reports to physicians on the  resources used to provide care to Medicare beneficiaries, with the option  of including quality measures. In 2011, we reported on CMS\u2019s efforts and  the challenges that the agency faced in developing the methodology and  distributing physician feedback reports. In 2010, the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) directed HHS to establish a Value- based Payment Modifier (Value Modifier) program under which Medicare  physician payments are to be adjusted for quality and efficiency of care.  HHS is required to phase in the Value Modifier beginning in 2015 and  plans to do so using performance data derived from the Physician  Feedback Program; it is required to cover all physicians under the Value  Modifier program by 2017. PPACA also established a number of  coordinated care delivery models and gave CMS the authority to test  others through its Innovation Center.", "The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required that  GAO examine private-sector initiatives that base or adjust physician  payment rates on quality and efficiency and assess their applicability to  the Medicare program.

(See table 1.) To identify such entities, we interviewed academic and  industry experts on physician performance measurement and payment  reform. We also reviewed health care policy research literature and a  transcript from CMS\u2019s National Provider Call organized to provide input  on best practices from pay-for-performance in the private sector. The  private entities identified from these sources vary by geography, size, and  type, and have initiatives that include pay-for-performance, PCMH, and  ACO models. The initiatives referenced in this report are sponsored by  two national health plans, three Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, one  multistate plan, two substate plans, and one multistakeholder association,  comprised of health plans, physician groups, and hospital systems,  among others. The themes that we discuss in this report reflect the  initiatives of the nine entities we studied and may not be generalizable to  all private entities that provide financial incentives to physicians for quality  and efficiency. Also, we did not conduct independent analyses of the  effectiveness of the incentive initiatives.", "To obtain physicians\u2019 perspectives on the common themes that we  identified, we interviewed physician groups associated with particular  initiatives and other organizations representing physicians with  knowledge of the initiatives. The physician groups varied in size\u2014with  as many as 1,600 physicians\u2014and structure. We spoke with physician  leaders of two independent practice associations, a large primary care  group practice, medical staff at a hospital, and an alliance of medical  groups.

Its use of financial incentives for  reaching performance targets can, in effect, set standards that private  payers may adopt. However, statutory requirements for the Medicare  program limit the types of changes that CMS can implement. For  example, Medicare must pay for health care delivered by any eligible  physician willing to accept Medicare payment and follow Medicare  requirements, and must pay uniform Medicare rates to all physicians.  Therefore, unlike private health care purchasers, CMS cannot exclude  poor-performing providers from participating in the program and cannot  negotiate different reimbursement rates with different providers.", "In recent years, in response to legislation, HHS has taken steps to  transition Medicare physicians from a fee-for-service system in which only  the volume of services is rewarded, to one in which value\u2014as measured  by the quality and the efficiency with which that care is delivered\u2014also  determines payment. CMS has worked with physician groups in designing  and implementing the following physician initiatives, among others.", "Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS). PQRS collects  physician-reported data on quality measures for covered services  furnished to beneficiaries. CMS provides an incentive payment to  physicians who satisfactorily report quality data. The agency  announced that, in 2013, physicians who do not satisfactorily meet  PQRS submission requirements will have their fee schedule amount  reduced by 1.5 percent for services furnished in 2015.", "Value Modifier Program. PPACA directed HHS to establish a Value  Modifier to adjust Medicare payments to some physicians in 2015 and  to all physicians in 2017 on the basis of the quality and cost of care  provided. To develop the Value Modifier, CMS plans to use  performance information on quality and cost metrics derived from  Medicare claims and data submitted under PQRS. Because the  Value Modifier program must be budget neutral, upward adjustments  will depend on the total sum of negative adjustments in a given year.", "Shared Savings Program. CMS has finalized rules under which  physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers may work  together to better coordinate care for Medicare beneficiaries through  an ACO. While individual physicians continue to be paid under the  Medicare fee schedule, the agency plans to develop a benchmark for  each ACO against which its performance is measured to assess  whether it qualifies to receive shared savings or in some cases be  held accountable for losses.", "Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative and Multi-Payer Advanced  Primary Care Practice. Eligible primary care practices may receive  shared savings rewards under some of CMS\u2019s demonstrations related  to operating a PCMH. Under the Comprehensive Primary Care  Initiative, CMS intends to pay 500 primary care practices in seven  markets for improved and comprehensive care management, and  after 2 years offer them the chance to share in any savings they  generate. For the Multi-Payer Advanced Primary Care Practice  demonstration, CMS intends to award payment incentives through  existing PCMH initiatives that are currently being conducted by states  to make medical home practices more broadly available.", "Physician Compare Website. This Internet tool serves as a directory  for beneficiaries, allowing them to search for a physician by specialty,  location, hospital affiliation, and other factors. The profile pages also  indicate if a physician satisfactorily participated in the PQRS. PPACA  requires that CMS make quality and patient experience measures  publicly available on the website by January 1, 2013. Publishing  comparable performance results can encourage physicians to  improve their performance in order to attract more beneficiaries.", "These legislated changes, along with market forces, have potential  implications for the way many physicians practice. For example, emerging  delivery models such as ACOs may lead physicians to join larger groups,  more closely align with hospitals, and take on financial risk for managing  patient care. Although many physicians who serve Medicare beneficiaries  work in small practices, more are increasingly employed by hospitals and  health care systems. As of 2008, nearly one-third of U.S. physicians  worked in solo or 2-physician practices, 15 percent worked in groups of 3  to 5 physicians, 19 percent worked in practices of 6 to 50 physicians, and  13 percent practiced in hospital settings.

These included the importance  of focusing on physician groups rather than individual physicians, the  desire for a standardized performance measurement set, the use of  absolute performance and improvement targets, the timely distribution of  incentive payments, an emphasis on care coordination to improve quality  and efficiency, and the use of other strategies to improve quality and  efficiency. For the most part, physician organizations familiar with these  themes expressed their support."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholders Largely Agreed That Performance Measurement and Incentive Payment Should Be at the Physician-Group Level", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Entities", "paragraphs": ["Private entities in our study generally based incentive payments on the  performance of physician groups rather than individual physicians largely  because of methodological issues and the importance of reinforcing  group-wide accountability. Most of the private entities we spoke with  pointed out that individual-level measurement often does not generate  sufficient performance data to produce credible results. For instance, for a  condition-specific performance metric, a physician may see too few  patients with the relevant condition to be measured reliably. Integrated  Healthcare Association (IHA) noted that using physician organizations as  the unit of analysis in the California Pay-for-Performance (CA P4P)  program helps to overcome small sample sizes that impede valid  measurement of efficiency at the individual physician level, although  sometimes even sample sizes at the physician organization level may not  be adequate. A representative at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan  (BCBS MI) stated that this methodological issue is especially relevant  when measuring performance in specialty care practices. Because  subspecialists may provide distinct services within their specialties, they  can look like outliers when compared with their specialty peers at the  individual level. Several private entities told us that group-level  measurement also promotes group-wide accountability. For example,  representatives at Dean Clinic said that measuring performance at the  group level allows each of its clinical divisions to leverage each  physician\u2019s strengths, and keeps them engaged in performance  improvement. In addition, BCBS MI believes that group-level  measurement and payment may prevent physicians with particularly  complex patients from being resistant to participating in the initiative.", "Because many primary care physicians work in small, independent  practices, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield (CareFirst) PCMH program  has developed a strategy for including them in its initiative. CareFirst  physicians do not need to be a part of a formal medical group to  participate in the program. Rather, they may organize voluntary, \u201cvirtual\u201d  panels for the purpose of performance measurement and incentive  payments. Established physician groups may also participate, provided  that they form subgroups of between 5 and 15 physicians\u2014the panel size  requirement for participation. As an incentive to join the program,  CareFirst increases the fees paid under its physician fee schedule by   12 percentage points. It offers additional financial incentives to physician  panels for bringing care costs within a budget target and for improving  quality on a variety of metrics. CareFirst representatives believe that the  primary care physician is in the best position to comprehensively  understand a patient\u2019s needs\u2014in particular, the needs of chronically ill  patients\u2014but that no one physician has a large enough patient pool for  reliable performance measurement. They said that not only does panel  formation allow for reliable performance measurement, but it also  provides a structure for peer pressure given that all physicians in a panel  have an economic stake in high performance.", "Many of the private entities we spoke with were also consistent in their  view that it is the responsibility of physician group management to drive  individual physician performance improvement. Therefore, they not only  provide physician groups with feedback reports at the group level, but  most also provide supporting data at the individual physician level that  can be used to generate individualized physician feedback reports. For  example, under the Alternative Quality Contract (AQC), Blue Cross Blue  Shield of Massachusetts (BCBS MA) sends performance data and reports  in electronic format to each physician group\u2019s central leadership, who are   Similarly,  responsible for sharing the results with individual physicians.under the Physician Group Incentive Program (PGIP), BCBS MI expects  physician organizations to create appropriate reports at the practice unit  and individual physician level to identify areas for improvement, as well as  to track performance over time and guide focused system-transformation  and performance improvement interventions. Some entities noted that  peer pressure and competition within an organization can provide an  incentive for physicians to improve their relative performance. For  example, Rocky Mountain Health Plans shares relative performance data  on resource use with certain physicians to facilitate communication about  clinical quality and cost. Also, Dean Clinic representatives mentioned that  reporting performance at the individual level within each specialty division  instills peer pressure, which can help facilitate the improvement process.", "Furthermore, many private entities we spoke with said that physician  groups have complete discretion over how their incentive payments are  used and therefore may not distribute their entire incentive payments to  frontline physicians. For example, BCBS MI reported that, in general,  physician groups distribute roughly one quarter of PGIP incentive  payments directly to front-line physicians, and invest the remainder in  systems improvements that benefit the practices and the physician group.  Several other private entities also stated that physician group managers  use their incentive payments for shared practice improvements, such as  investing in new or additional information-technology capabilities, hiring  case managers, and rewarding nonphysician staff. A BCBS MA  representative noted that physician groups undertake these types of  shared practice investments to help make the improvements in care  quality and efficiency called for in the AQC.", "Physician organizations in our review agreed that measurement at the  physician group level for incentive pay is statistically more accurate than  measurement at the individual physician level. They noted that one  physician is unlikely to have a patient population large enough for  statistical reliability, making it difficult for private entities to validate  individual physician-level data. They also said that attributing patients to  one physician for measurement purposes is difficult because physicians  often work as a team to provide care. On the other hand, they noted that  physician groups are likely to have the patient sample sizes needed to  ensure accurate calculations and minimize the attribution problem.  According to a letter to CMS from the American College of Cardiology,  the physician group level provides sufficient data to ensure statistical  significance but is still a level at which individual physician actions can  improve quality.", "Physician organizations in our study also agreed that it is their  responsibility to drive individual physician performance improvement.  They noted that when private entities provide information on individual  physician performance, managers can develop tailored physician  feedback reports using their own analytical tools. For example, physician  groups can use the performance reports they receive internally to  aggregate data across their entire patient population. They told us that  these reports can be helpful because physicians are inclined to trust the  data provided by their groups\u2019 managers, react to internal peer pressure,  and want to examine their entire patient population.", "In addition, physician organizations we contacted cited different  approaches for distributing financial incentives. For example, Mesa  County Physicians Independent Practice Association (IPA), Inc., receives  incentive payments on a quarterly basis from Rocky Mountain Health  Plans. It then pays its physician practices, each of which may decide to  distribute the incentive payments in a different manner. Some physician  practices in the IPA distribute the money equally to individual physicians;  others distribute the money to individual physicians on the basis of their  relative performance scores; and still others retain the money for capital  improvement projects. A different approach is that used by ProHealth  Physicians, Inc. (ProHealth), a 200-member physician group in Cigna\u2019s  Collaborative Accountable Care (CAC) initiative. ProHealth reported  setting aside a portion of the incentive payments to cover personnel and  overhead costs associated with administering the initiative. About half of  the remainder is distributed to individual physicians on the basis of their  performance, with the highest performers receiving the most money and  the lowest performers receiving no money. The rest of the incentive  payment is considered profit and may be paid to its physician  shareholders."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Private Entities Select from among Nationally Endorsed Metrics; Stakeholders Noted the Need for a Standard Set of Metrics across Payers", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Entities", "paragraphs": ["In choosing performance metrics for their initiatives, the private entities  we interviewed largely draw from those nationally endorsed by such  groups as the National Quality Forum (NQF), which has endorsed over   Many of the entities cited difficulties in developing sound  700 metrics.quality metrics for their initiatives as the reason for selecting nationally  endorsed metrics. However, some entities in our study supplement  nationally endorsed quality-of-care metrics with others. For example, a  representative of BCBS MA told us that, in collaboration with physicians,  experimental measures can be used to provide evidence on the sample  size needed to generate reliable data for certain measures. Physician  organizations participating in BCBS MA\u2019s AQC have the opportunity to  work on the development of up to three experimental measures of their  choosing each year on the basis of a list provided by the health plan. The  rest of the AQC metrics are largely NQF-endorsed and are supported by  entities such as CMS or the National Committee for Quality Assurance  (NCQA). To measure efficiency of care, many entities reported using a  risk-adjusted total cost of care metric that captures all services provided  to physicians\u2019 entire patient population. HealthPartners, for one, uses its  own NQF-endorsed total cost of care and resource use metrics calculated  on a per-member basis to help identify potential overuse and underuse of  services. Some private entities measure efficiency through metrics that  are more specific than total cost of care. For example, Dean Health Plan\u2019s  Practitioner Incentive Model has efficiency metrics that include generic  drug prescription patterns and emergency room visits per 1,000  members, a metric also used by CMS for Medicare beneficiaries.", "While NQF fosters agreement on national standards for measuring health  care performance, no national consensus exists on a single best set of  quality metrics. Most private entities that we spoke with were in  agreement that use of a standardized set of performance metrics across  payers would be ideal. Standardization may include uniformity in the  metric selected, the benchmark against which performance is assessed,  and the relevant patient population. As expressed by HealthPartners representatives, a standardized set of metrics would send strong and  consistent messages to providers, and make it easier for physician  groups to focus on defined areas for quality improvement. California\u2019s IHA  accomplished this by arranging for its health plans and physicians to work  together to develop a uniform but dynamic set of performance metrics for  statewide use. IHA reported that, until then, California physicians found it  challenging to focus on performance improvement when many health  plans provided incentives based on different metric sets. As of 2011, the  CA P4P metric set included 85 metrics related to clinical quality, patient  experience, meaningful use of health information technology, and  appropriate resource use.", "Several of the private entities in our study commented on the dearth of  reliable specialty care metrics. For example, a representative from  UnitedHealth Group noted inconsistency in the number of quality metrics  across specialties. Nevertheless, most private entities that we spoke with  included specialists in their incentive initiatives despite their limited  performance data. Dean Clinic representatives discussed how they  created a list of specialty care metrics for their pay-for-performance  program in collaboration with their physicians. Over the course of 1 year,  they offered each care division the opportunity to develop relevant,  specialty-specific metrics, a process described as resource-intensive. To  be formally adopted, these metrics required consensus among physicians  that the new metrics applied to the majority of specialists within that  department, and they had to be measureable through billing or electronic  health record data. For example, physicians in the cardiovascular surgery  division are measured on the percent of cardiovascular surgeries  performed without a blood transfusion. Dean representatives surmised  that, if a similar process were undertaken at the national level\u2014whereby  CMS would ask each specialty society to agree on 5 to 10 clinically  relevant measures\u2014it could be a step towards developing a robust,  standardized set of metrics for specialty care.", "Physician organizations in our review indicated that they generally prefer  quality metrics that have been endorsed by national groups, but are open  to the inclusion of experimental metrics. They stated that standardization  across payers would reduce the administrative burden associated with  tracking distinct requirements of multiple metric sets among various  initiatives. For example, a physician leader at ProHealth reported that,  among the 21 value-based payment initiatives in which ProHealth  participates, private insurers vary not only by which metrics are selected  but by how the metrics are used. Representatives of the Massachusetts  Medical Society added that, as a result, physicians may become  overwhelmed and may not spend time to distinguish differences between  the components of each initiative. Physician organizations also noted that  some experimental metrics used in private-entity initiatives can be useful  for filling in clinical areas that lack strong nationally endorsed metrics,  although others may lack a significant medical rationale or be difficult to  measure.", "Furthermore, physician organizations in our study noted the importance of  using specialty-specific metrics to ensure that performance is accurately  attributed to specialty care providers for the care they furnish. To develop  relevant metrics for specialty care providers, the Mesa County Physicians  IPA organizes a team of local physicians each year to create more  metrics for specialty care on the basis of new clinical evidence, similar to  a process done for primary care metrics. However, according to a letter to  CMS from the American Medical Association, value-based payment  initiatives do not currently include all medical specialties because the  tools for distinguishing value across specialties are inadequate. National  medical societies have taken action to meet the need for more specialty  metrics. For example, according to letters to CMS from national physician  organizations, the Community Oncology Alliance has identified 16 key  metrics of quality and value in cancer care delivery, and the American  Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons has identified metrics for total knee  replacements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Private Entities Largely Reward Physicians for Meeting Absolute Targets and Improving Performance, an Approach That Physicians Favor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Entities", "paragraphs": ["Most private entities in our study base financial incentives on absolute  performance targets or a combination of absolute targets and on  improvement over time. Absolute targets are fixed and known to their  physician groups during the performance measurement period, offering  greater certainty regarding the efforts required to become eligible for  payment. As such, they serve as a guide for high performers to maintain  their quality and efficiency standings. Some entities reward physicians on  a set of graduated absolute targets, whereby higher performance within  the set of targets receives a greater reward. For example, under the AQC,  physician groups are rewarded on the basis of performance targets (or  \u201cgates\u201d) between 1 and 5. On a measure of colorectal cancer screening  for members aged 51 to 75 years, AQC physician groups achieving a  screening rate of roughly 65 percent met the minimum (\u201cgate 1\u201d) level of  good performance on that measure, while those who screened about   83 percent met the maximum (\u201cgate 5\u201d) level of performance on that  measure. Aggregating \u201cgate\u201d scores across the roughly 5 dozen  measures in the AQC contract determines the overall performance and  quality incentive payment. The effectiveness of the absolute  benchmarking approach in motivating providers depends on where the  performance targets are set. If the target is set too high and perceived to  be too difficult to reach, physicians may not respond to the incentive. If it  is set too low, the entity will be making incentive payments for  performance already being delivered and will not encourage  improvement.", "Several private entities in our study combine absolute performance  targets and improvement over time in their benchmarking strategies.  Benchmarking based on performance improvement provides an incentive  for lower performers as well as higher performers, as it rewards the gains  achieved since past performance.

IHA representatives told us that, as of 2012, six of  the seven health plans in the CA P4P program have adopted this  benchmarking methodology.", "Some of the entities we spoke with reward high relative performance  along with improvement. Using a relative benchmark approach,  physicians do not know their numerical target at the start of the  performance period because their benchmark is based on the future  performance of their peers. None of the entities we spoke with based  incentive payments exclusively on relative performance. For instance,  physician groups in Cigna\u2019s CAC initiative must perform at a rate equal to  or above the market average for each quality metric, or they must show  improvement in their rate.", "Physician organizations in our review preferred tying incentives to  absolute performance or improvement rather than relative performance.  Some organizations saw merit in rewarding physician groups for  achieving high performance rates; others favored incentives based, at  least in part, on improvement because not all physician groups are at the  same starting point. Selected organizations cautioned against using  relative benchmarks, asserting that without prior knowledge of the level of  performance needed to earn incentive pay, physician groups might not be  willing to participate in an incentive initiative. Regardless of which  benchmarking approach is used, frontline physicians might not know all  the details of the incentive initiatives they work under. According to  representatives of the Massachusetts Medical Society, frontline  physicians likely know the performance targets that the physician group\u2019s  management sets but may not be aware of key details of payers\u2019  incentive structures, such as the thresholds for achieving a higher  incentive payment under BCBS MA\u2019s AQC initiative."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "While Private Entities Offered Varied Payment Sizes and Methods, Physicians Say Timeliness Can Enhance the Incentive", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Entities", "paragraphs": ["The incentive payments under the initiatives we reviewed varied in their  size and method, but were similar in their timing.

Physicians can only benefit from meeting  quality and cost targets under this type of incentive; if they fail to meet  those targets, physicians would still receive the full fee-for-service  payment. Generally, in such cases, the payer is at risk for high costs,  not the physicians. For example, on the basis of primary care  physicians\u2019 overall cost and quality performance, CareFirst\u2019s PCMH  program offers a potential increase of 20 to 60 percent in its fee  schedule.", "Other initiatives implement the incentive through a bonus, such as a  per-member-per-month bonus payment, which also does not carry  significant physician risk.

BCBS  MI\u2019s PGIP has an incentive pool that provides for a bonus payment  depending on performance on specific subinitiatives in which  participating physician organizations choose to participate.", "Still other initiatives implement the incentive payment through a  withhold\u2014whereby a portion of the payment due to a physician is  withheld until the status of their performance is determined at the end  of the measurement period. The amount withheld is returned only to  physicians who meet performance targets, putting some cost risk on  the physicians. HealthPartners representatives told us that their  Partners in Progress program applies a withhold from market-based  payment that can range from 1 to 5 percent of revenue. Under Rocky  Mountain Health Plans\u2019 incentive program, physician groups negotiate  with the health plan to determine the amount withheld.", "In addition to providing bonuses to physician organizations, BCBS MA\u2019s  AQC provides incentives to physician organizations through global  budgets. Under a 5-year contract, each participating physician  organization begins with a fixed budget that covers costs for all patient  care on the basis of the population it serves; annual adjustments are  made to manage the risk faced by the physician organization, such as  adjustments to account for any changes in patient population health  status. Physician organizations share any money with BCBS MA that is  saved by spending less than the budgeted amount for the patient  population, but they also share the risk when more money is spent than is  budgeted. BCBS MA also rewards physician organizations with a per- member per-month bonus for high performance as compared with fixed  targets on a set of quality metrics.", "The private entities in our study generally distributed incentive payments  to physician group managers during the year immediately following the  performance period. Specifically, most private entities paid incentives  within 7 months of the end of the performance period. For instance,  BCBS MI distributes PGIP incentive payments to physician organizations  2 months after the end of the 6-month performance period. BCBS MA  provides AQC groups interim incentive payments monthly, and these  payments are reconciled during the year after the annual performance  period ends to reflect actual performance.", "According to the physician organizations in our review, the  responsiveness of physicians to payer initiatives is often tied to the size,  method and frequency of the incentive payment. Regarding the  appropriate size of the incentives, physician organizations noted that the  larger the potential payoff, the larger their performance improvement is  likely to be. Although financial considerations are not the sole motivation  for seeking high performance, physician organizations said they would  like incentive payments to cover the costs of participating in the  initiative\u2014including the cost of data collection and the cost of improving  performance.", "Physician organizations in our review generally found the various types of  incentive payments to be fair and useful from a management perspective.  For instance, MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, reported that  physicians are attracted to CareFirst\u2019s PCMH add-on to the fee schedule  because it provides up-front capital that could be used to enhance  productivity. In addition, according to a physician leader at ProHealth, the  per-member per-month incentive payment under Cigna\u2019s CAC initiative  helps with forecasting revenue and planning infrastructure improvements.  Finally, representatives from the Mesa County Physicians IPA said that  the withhold incentive structure established by Rocky Mountain Health  Plans\u2019 Incentive Program works to keep physician groups attentive to  performance improvement by knowing that some payment is at risk.", "From the physicians\u2019 perspective, timely incentive payment cycles from  private entities can be helpful for monitoring and adjusting performance.  Physician organizations included in our review stated that incentive  payments should be distributed soon after the achievement of  performance to make the most difference.
