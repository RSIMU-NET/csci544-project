These programs are designed to reduce defendants' repeated crime (that is, recidivism), and substance abuse behavior by engaging them in a judicially monitored substance abuse treatment. However, determining whether drug court programs are effective at reducing recidivism and substance use has been challenging because of a large amount of weak empirical evidence. he 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act requires that GAO assess drug court program effectiveness. To meet this mandate, GAO conducted a systematic review of drug court program research, from which it selected 27 evaluations of 39 adult drug court programs that met its criteria for, among other things, methodological soundness. This report describes the results of that review of published evaluations of adult drug court programs, particularly relating to (1) recidivism outcomes, (2) substance use relapse, (3) program completion, and (4) the costs and benefits of drug court programs. DOJ reviewed a draft of this report and had no comments.

GAO's analysis of evaluations reporting these data for 23 programs showed the following: (1) lower percentages of drug court program participants than comparison group members were rearrested or reconvicted; (2) program participants had fewer recidivism events than comparison group members; (3) recidivism reductions occurred for participants who had committed different types of offenses; and (4) there was inconclusive evidence that specific drug court components, such as the behavior of the judge or the amount of treatment received, affected participants' recidivism while in the program. Recidivism reductions also occurred for some period of time after participants completed the drug court program in most of the programs reporting these data. Evidence about the effectiveness of adult drug court programs in reducing participants' substance use relapse is limited to data available from eight drug court programs. Evaluations of these eight drug court programs reported mixed results on substance use relapse. For example, drug test results generally showed significant reductions in use during participation in the program, while self-reported results generally showed no significant reductions in use. Completion rates, which refer to the percentage of individuals who successfully completed a program, in selected adult drug court programs ranged from 27 to 66 percent. Other than participants' compliance with drug court program procedures, no other program factor (such as the severity of the sanction that would be invoked if participants failed to complete the program) consistently predicted participants' program completion. A limited number of evaluations--four evaluations of seven adult drug court programs--provided sufficient cost and benefit data to estimate their net benefits. Although the cost of six of these programs was greater than the costs to provide criminal justice services to the comparison group, all seven programs yielded positive net benefits, primarily from reductions in recidivism affecting judicial system costs and avoided costs to potential victims. Financial cost savings for the criminal justice system (taking into account recidivism reductions) were found in two of the seven programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Drug court programs were established in the late 1980s as a local response  to increasing numbers of drug-related cases and expanding jail and prison  populations.

Under  this concept, in exchange for the possibility of dismissed charges or  reduced sentences, defendants are diverted to drug court programs in  which they agree to participate in judicially monitored substance abuse  treatment. Title II of the 21st Century Department of Justice  Appropriations Authorization Act reauthorizes the award of federal grants  for drug court programs that include court-supervised drug treatment.  The award of federal grants to drug court programs was first authorized  under Title V of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of  1994.", "Drug court programs have become popular nationwide in the criminal  justice system. As of September 2004, there were over 1,200 drug court  programs operating in addition to about 500 being planned.

We identified 117 evaluations of adult drug court  programs in the United States that were published between May 1997 and  January 2004 and reported recidivism, substance use relapse, or program  completion outcomes. Of these 117, we selected 27 evaluations that met  additional criteria for methodological soundness. Most of the evaluations  we selected used designs in which all drug court program participants  were compared with an appropriate group of similar offenders who did  not participate in the drug court program. In order to ensure that the  groups are similar in virtually all respects aside from the intervention, we  selected evaluations in which the comparison group was matched to the  program group as closely as possible on a number of characteristics or  that used statistical models to adjust, or control for, preexisting  differences between the program and comparison groups. Five of the   27 evaluations were experiments in which participants were randomly  assigned to groups.

We systematically collected  information from these evaluations about the methodological  characteristics of the evaluations, the participants and components of the  drug court programs, the outcomes, and, where available, the costs of the  drug court programs. To assess the methodological strength of the  evaluations, we used generally accepted social science principles.  Additionally, we used standard cost-benefit criteria to screen and assess  the eight evaluations that reported cost and benefit information. Four of  these contained sufficient data on costs and benefits to allow us to assess  net benefits. We selected the evaluations in our review according to the  strength of their methodologies; therefore, our results cannot be  generalized to all drug court programs or their evaluations.

The primary purpose of these programs is to use a court\u2019s  authority to reduce crime by changing defendants\u2019 substance abuse  behavior. In exchange for the possibility of dismissed charges or reduced  sentences, eligible defendants who agree to participate are diverted to  drug court programs in various ways and at various stages in the judicial  process. These programs are typically offered to defendants as an  alternative to probation or short-term incarceration.", "Drug court programs share several general characteristics but vary in their  specific policies and procedures because of, among other things,  differences in local jurisdictions and criminal justice system practices. In  general, judges preside over drug court proceedings, which are called  status hearings; monitor defendants\u2019 progress with mandatory drug  testing; and prescribe sanctions and rewards as appropriate in  collaboration with prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers,  and others. Drug court programs also vary in terms of the substance abuse  treatment required. However, most programs offer a range of treatment  options and generally require a minimum of about 1 year of participation  before a defendant completes the program.", "In order to determine defendants\u2019 eligibility for participation, drug court  programs typically screen defendants based on their legal status and  substance use. The screening process and eligibility criteria can vary  across drug court programs. According to the literature, eligible drug  court program participants ranged from nonviolent offenders charged with  drug-related offenses who have substance addictions to relatively medium- risk defendants with fairly extensive criminal histories and failed prior  substance abuse treatment experiences. Participants were also described  as predominantly male with poor employment and educational  achievements. Appendix IV presents additional information about the  general characteristics of drug court programs and participants in the  evaluations we reviewed.", "Research on drug court programs has generally focused on program  descriptions and process measures, such as program completion rates,  and presented limited empirical evidence about the effectiveness of drug  court programs in reducing recidivism and substance use. In 1997, we  reported on 12 evaluations that met minimum research standards and  concluded that the evaluations showed some positive results but did not  firmly establish whether drug court programs were successful in reducing  offender recidivism and substance use relapse. More recently, two  syntheses of multiple drug court program evaluations have drawn positive  conclusions about the impact of drug court programs. One synthesis  concluded that criminal activity and substance use are reduced relative to  other comparable offenders while participants are engaged in the drug  court program, and that program completion rates ranged from 36 to   60 percent. Further, the other synthesis reported that drug offenders  participating in a drug court program are less likely to re-offend than  similar offenders sentenced to traditional correctional options, such as  probation.", "Some of the evaluations included in these two syntheses had  methodological limitations such as, the lack of strong comparison groups  and the lack of appropriate statistical controls. Some did not use designs  that compared all drug court program participants\u2014including graduates,  those still active, and dropouts\u2014with similar nonparticipants. For  example, they compared the outcomes of participants who completed the  program with the outcomes of those who did not (that is, dropouts). These  evaluations, upon finding that program graduates had better outcomes  than dropouts, have concluded that drug court programs are effective.  This is a likely overestimation of the positive effects of the intervention  because the evaluation is comparing successes to failures, rather than all  participants to nonparticipants. Additionally, other evaluations did not use  appropriate statistical methods to adjust for preexisting differences  between the program and comparison groups. Without these adjustments,  variations in measured outcomes for each group may be a function of the  preexisting differences between the groups, rather than the drug court  program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["In most of the evaluations we reviewed, adult drug court programs led to  recidivism reductions during periods of time that generally corresponded  to the length of the drug court program\u2014that is, within-program. Our  analysis of evaluations reporting recidivism data for 23 programs showed  that lower percentages of drug court program participants than  comparison group members were rearrested or reconvicted. Program  participants also had fewer incidents of rearrests or reconvictions and a  longer time until rearrest or reconviction than comparison group  members. These recidivism reductions were observed for any felony  offense and for drug offenses, whether they were felonies or  misdemeanors. However, we were unable to find conclusive evidence that  specific drug court program components, such as the behavior of the  judge, the amount of treatment received, the level of supervision provided,  and the sanctions for not complying with program requirements, affect  participants\u2019 within-program recidivism. Post-program recidivism  reductions were measured for up to 1 year after participants completed  the drug court program in several evaluations, and in these the evidence  suggests that the recidivism differences observed during the program  endured. A more detailed description of the recidivism reduction results is  included in appendix V.", "Evidence about the effectiveness of drug court programs in reducing  participants\u2019 substance use relapse is limited and mixed. The evidence  included in our review on substance use relapse outcomes is limited to  data available from eight drug court programs. The data include drug test  results and self-reported drug use; both measures were reported for some  programs. Drug test results generally showed significant reductions in use  during participation in the program, while self-reported results generally  showed no significant reductions in use. Appendix VI presents additional  information about the evaluations we reviewed that reported on substance  use relapse outcomes.", "Completion rates, which refer to the number of individuals who  successfully completed a drug court program as a percentage of the total  number admitted, in the programs we reviewed that assessed completion  ranged from 27 to 66 percent. As might be expected, program completion  was associated with participants\u2019 compliance with program requirements.  Specifically, evaluations of 16 adult drug court programs that assessed  completion found that participants\u2019 compliance with procedures was  consistently associated with completion. These program procedures  include attending treatment sessions, engaging in treatment early in the  program, and appearing at status hearings. No other program factor, such  as the severity of the sanction that would be invoked if participants failed  to complete the program and the manner in which judges conducted status  hearings, predicted participants\u2019 program completion. Several  characteristics of the drug court program participants themselves were  also associated with an increased likelihood of program completion. These  characteristics include lower levels of prior involvement in the criminal  justice system and age, as older participants were more likely to complete  drug court programs than younger ones. Appendix VII presents additional  information about the evaluations we reviewed that reported on program  completion.", "A limited number of evaluations in our review discussed the costs and  benefits of adult drug court programs. Four evaluations of seven drug  court programs provided sufficient cost and benefit data to estimate their  net benefits (that is, the benefits minus costs). The cost per drug court  program participant was greater than the cost per comparison group  member in six of these drug court programs. However, all seven programs  yielded positive net benefits, primarily from reductions in recidivism  affecting both judicial system costs and avoided costs to potential victims.  Net benefits ranged from about $1,000 per participant to about $15,000 in  the seven programs. These benefits may underestimate drug court  programs\u2019 true benefits because the evaluations did not include indirect  benefits (such as reduced medical costs of treated participants). Financial  cost savings for the criminal justice system (taking into account recidivism  reductions) were found in two of the seven programs.

These results are consistent with those of past reviews  of drug court evaluations. Positive results concerning recidivism are  closely associated with program completion. Specifically, while drug court  participation is generally associated with lower recidivism, the recidivism  of program completers is lower than for participants in comparison or  control groups. Thus, practices that encourage program completion may  enhance the success of drug court programs in relation to recidivism.", "While our review sheds little light on the specific aspects of these  programs that are linked to positive recidivism outcomes, both participant  compliance with drug court procedures and some participant  characteristics seem to be related to success. To the extent that research  can help to discern best practices for drug courts, the models for effective  programs can be enhanced. Specifically, to the extent that drug court  program managers can learn more about methods to retain participants for  the duration of the program, they may be able to further enhance the  positive impacts of drug court programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Attorney  General and the Director of ONDCP.

If random assignment was not used, in an  attempt to ensure that the groups were similar, aside from program  participation (the intervention), the comparison group(s) should have  been as alike as possible on a range of important characteristics.  Statistical analyses can be used to further minimize differences between  the program and comparison groups. Typically, statistical analyses to  control for differences such as these are not necessary when study  participants are randomly assigned to groups.", "To assess program completion, we also selected evaluations that  compared the outcomes of participants (such as program graduates and  those who dropped out) within a drug court program in order to determine  what factors, if any, are associated with program completion.

For example, we assessed  elements such as whether data were collected during or after program  completion and the appropriateness of outcome measures, statistical  analyses, and any reported results. Each evaluation was read and coded by  a senior social scientist with training and experience in evaluation  research methods. A second senior social scientist and other members of  our evaluation team then reviewed each completed data collection  instrument to verify the accuracy of the information included.

Systematic difference between comparison groups and  treatment groups, called selection bias, threatens the validity of evaluation  findings. Though design and analysis strategies differed, each of the quasi- experimental evaluations in our review used some combination of design  and statistical methods to address the issue of selection bias. Approaches  to address selection bias in design generally included attempts to choose  comparison groups that share key commonalities with treatment groups  (usually including likelihood of eligibility to participate in a drug court  were it available) and therefore were less likely to differ on observed and  unobserved characteristics related to recidivism.

For  example, if successful drug court participants differed systematically in  their substance abuse addiction problems from the members of the group  against which they are compared, and if the differences in substance abuse  addiction are not explicitly assessed in the evaluation, these differences,  and not necessarily participation in the drug court program, could explain  any observed recidivism differences. Similarly, if participants differed  from comparison group members in their motivation to complete the drug  court, recidivism differences could arise from these. Evaluations generally  do not have measures of variables, such as motivation, that can be  explicitly included in the analysis of drug court outcomes.", "One way to address issues of selection bias is in the design of the  comparison groups. Generally, random assignment of eligible participants  to treatment and control groups addresses selection bias by randomly  distributing individual differences between the treatment and control  group. Another way to address selection bias is statistically\u2014by forming  comparison groups that consist of individuals that are as similar as  possible to drug court participants and by using statistical techniques to  control for observed differences, including sophisticated two-step  procedures that attempt to address differences in selection into the drug  court program.

A key  presumption of random assignment is that any individual factor that could  be associated with the outcome of interest (recidivism) is randomly  distributed between the experimental and control groups. Hence, if none  of these factors are correlated systematically with assignment into groups,  then the threat of selection bias is reduced. Presuming that the  randomization is complete and that the experiment was carried out  without high levels of attrition of subjects from either group, the observed  differences in recidivism between the two groups would likely arise from  the intervention, rather than observed or unobserved individual factors.", "Several of the evaluations used quasi-experimental designs in which the  comparison group members were chosen from defendants who appeared  before the court during a period of time shortly before the drug court  program was introduced and, based on certain observable characteristics,  were deemed to be eligible to participate in the drug court program.  Theoretically, if there were no significant changes in processes that led to  defendants appearing in a court during the pre- and drug court periods,  and if their eligibility for drug court participation could be determined, a  historical comparison group would consist of individuals that share  characteristics with drug court defendants. Alternatively, if there were a  significant difference in processing between the pre-drug court and drug  court periods (for example, such as a shift in prosecution priorities toward  particular types of offenses or a change in the nature of a community\u2019s  drug problem), then the historical comparison group could consist of  defendants that differed systematically from the drug court participant  group.", "The historical comparison group in the evaluations we reviewed generally  consisted of defendants who were arrested and arraigned in the court that  offered the drug court program in a period immediately prior to the  implementation of the drug court.

The extent to which they reduce bias depends upon the richness  and quality of the control variables that are used to estimate the models.", "These methods essentially use statistical models to predict individual  probabilities of participation in the drug court program (regardless of  actual participation). The models predict the probability, sometimes called  a propensity score, based on variation in individual level characteristics  (for example, criminal histories and demographic attributes) that  offenders in a given group would participate. Some of the evaluations that  we reviewed incorporated this technique as the first stage of a two-stage  model that estimated recidivism differences. Others used it to identify the  individuals to include in a comparison group.", "Other studies matched comparison group members to drug court  participants on a more limited set of demographic and criminal justice  variables (such as type of charge and prior criminal history) and then,  post-matching, used various methods to control for differences on  unmatched variables. A presumption behind these matching methods is  that by selecting for inclusion in the comparison group only those  defendants who matched drug court participants on these observed  characteristics, the evaluation would create a comparison group that was  similar in composition to the drug court participants. A limited set of  matching variables that is based largely upon demographic variables may  be unlikely to capture all of the individual-level sources of variation in  recidivism that could account for differences between the drug court  participants and comparison group members. Therefore, these evaluations  attempted to control for differences in key, nonmatch variables (such as  criminal justice risk-level differences) in their analysis.", "Some of the evaluations attempted to control for individual-level  differences between the drug court participants and the comparison group  members using various linear and nonlinear (e.g., logistic) regression  methods. This approach relies on the assumption that the observed  characteristics included in the regression are the key variables that predict  recidivism. The regression models adjust the results for differences  between the two samples on these characteristics and allow the  researcher to avoid making incorrect inferences about recidivism  differences because one group (either treatment or comparison) differs  systematically from the other in the presence of the key variables that are  associated with recidivism. Evaluations that used regression methods  generally made efforts to control for variables that are known to be related  to recidivism, such as criminal history, type and number of charges, and  age.

Additionally, these benefits may  underestimate drug court programs\u2019 true benefits because the evaluations  did not include indirect benefits (such as reduced medical costs of treated  participants)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Evaluations Found Drug Court Programs More Expensive than Conventional Case Processing", "paragraphs": ["All but one of the evaluations we reviewed found drug court programs  more expensive than conventional case processing.

Rather than relying on administrative records  and budgets, the program\u2019s evaluation used a methodology that closely  followed participants through treatment and court adjudication. It  calculated the amount of time that each drug court participant and  comparison group participant spent in different activities, such as  treatment and court hearings. The evaluation found that the judge spent  less time with offenders in the drug court program than in normal court  processing and that this led to the estimated decreased costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug Court Programs\u2019 Net Benefits Derived from Reductions in Recidivism", "paragraphs": ["The monetary benefits of reduced recidivism can be placed in two  categories: (1) reduced future expenditure by criminal justice agencies  and (2) reduced future victimization. Any arrest is a cost to a number of  criminal justice agencies, including police, prosecutors, courts,  corrections departments, and probation agencies. Reducing arrests by  reducing recidivism would benefit these agencies. The justice system\u2019s  benefits in the seven drug court programs we reviewed ranged from none  to about $3,800 per participant. Some of the range is due to  methodological differences among the evaluations, but some may be due  to differences among the communities served by the courts. A reduction in  recidivism also benefits people who might otherwise be victimized. The  costs to potential victims of crime that are thus avoided include direct  monetary costs, such as the value of property that is not stolen and  expenses for health care that are not incurred, and quality-of-life costs,  such as costs for pain and suffering that are not experienced. Benefits to  potential victims reported in the evaluations we reviewed ranged from  about $500 to $24,000 per participant.", "The evaluations we reviewed monetized the benefits from averted crime  inconsistently, but the differences in method do not explain the range of  benefits. For example, excluding the cost of pain and suffering from  victimizations that do not occur underestimates the true cost of crime.  However, the two evaluations that did not include these costs\u2014D.C.  Superior Court and Breaking the Cycle\u2014found the highest and lowest per  participant dollar values of reduced recidivism, at $24,000 and $500,  respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All Seven Drug Court Programs Reported Positive Net Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Although six of the seven drug court programs were more costly than  conventional case processing, the monetary value of the benefits from  reduced recidivism\u2014to the justice system and potential victims\u2014was  greater than the costs, producing positive net benefits in all seven  programs. The net benefits of the seven drug court programs we reviewed  ranged from about $1,000 to about $15,000 per participant. Table 14  presents benefits to the justice system and to potential victims, the net  costs of the programs (costs of the drug programs above conventional  case processing), and net benefits, or benefits minus net costs.", "However, as shown in the last two columns of table 14, the financial cost  savings due to reductions in recidivism for the criminal justice agencies  were not always positive.

Indirect  benefits might include costs avoided because treated drug addicts did not  use medical services that would otherwise have been required. After  successful drug treatment, such individuals might have fewer periods of  unemployment and might be more productive, earning higher wages.
