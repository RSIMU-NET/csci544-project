To standardize and strengthen agencies' security, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), launched the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) initiative in 2007. GAO was asked to (1) identify the goals, objectives, and requirements of the initiative; (2) determine the status of actions federal agencies have taken, or plan to take, to implement the initiative; and (3) identify the benefits, challenges, and lessons learned in implementing this initiative. To accomplish this, GAO reviewed policies, plans, and other documents at the 24 major executive branch agencies; reviewed OMB and NIST guidance and documentation; and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The goals of FDCC are to improve information security and reduce overall information technology operating costs across the federal government by, among other things, providing a baseline level of security through the implementation of a set of standard configuration settings on government-owned desktop and laptop computers (i.e., workstations). To carry out the initiative, OMB required that executive branch agencies take several actions, including: (1) submit an implementation plan to OMB; (2) apply all configuration settings to all applicable workstations by February 2008; (3) document any deviations from the prescribed settings and have them approved by an accrediting authority; (4) acquire a specified NIST-validated tool for monitoring implementation of the settings; (5) ensure that future information technology acquisitions comply with the configuration settings; and (6) submit a status report to NIST. While agencies have taken actions to implement these requirements, none of the agencies has fully implemented all configuration settings on their applicable workstations. Specifically, most plans submitted to OMB did not address all key implementation activities; none of the agencies implemented all of the prescribed configuration settings on all applicable workstations, though several implemented agency-defined subsets of the settings; several agencies did not fully document their deviations from the settings or establish a process for approving them; six agencies did not acquire and make use of the required tool for monitoring FDCC compliance; many agencies did not incorporate language into contracts to ensure that future information technology acquisitions comply with FDCC; and many agencies did not describe plans for eliminating or mitigating their deviations in their compliance reports to NIST. Until agencies ensure that they are meeting these FDCC requirements, the effectiveness of the initiative will be limited. FDCC has the potential to increase agencies' information security by requiring stricter security settings on workstations than those that may have been previously in place and standardizing agencies' management of workstations, making it easier to manage changes such as applying updates or patches. In addition, a number of lessons can be learned from the management and implementation of the FDCC initiative which, if considered, could improve the implementation of future versions of FDCC or other configuration efforts. At the same time, agencies face several ongoing challenges in fully complying with FDCC requirements, including retrofitting applications and systems in their existing environments to comply with the settings, assessing the risks associated with deviations, and monitoring workstations to ensure that the settings are applied and functioning properly. As OMB moves forward with the initiative, understanding the lessons learned as well as the ongoing challenges agencies face will be essential in order to ensure the initiative is successful in ensuring public confidence in the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of government information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The frequency of information security incidents at federal agencies, the  wide availability of hacking tools, and steady advances in the  sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology all contribute to the  urgency of protecting the federal government\u2019s information and systems.

Ten of the agencies in our review attributed either  increased security or increased security awareness to implementation of  the settings and were generally supportive of a stricter configuration for  the agency.", "FDCC implementation also enabled agencies to reap the benefits of having  more standardized configurations within agency computing environments.  For example, a more secure enterprisewide Windows configuration and  consistent workstation profile (i.e., the set of configuration settings and  other software applied to a workstation) across the agency can not only  improve security but can also make it easier to manage changes to the  security features of workstation software, such as applying updates or  patches. Updates or patches can be applied more expeditiously because  there are fewer workstation profiles that they must be tested on, which  also reduces the amount of necessary supporting documentation. Agency  officials we spoke to confirmed that FDCC provided an improved  understanding of their computing environment as well as a consistent  desktop image across the department. Another official stated that adopting  and implementing the configuration settings would raise awareness of the  importance of workstation configuration management across the  government.", "Beyond the benefits to enhancing security within agency computing  environments, there are other potential, if unanticipated, benefits to  implementing particular settings and standardizing them across the federal  government. For example, while settings related to activating and  password-protecting screen savers can provide added security by locking  the workstation while the user is not present, they could also reduce  power consumption and lead to savings in utility costs. One agency official  said his agency was anticipating saving between $10 million and $15  million a year by implementing the power settings, and would be  deploying a tool to track this data. In addition, an agency official from the  Chief Information Officers Council\u2019s FDCC Change Control Board said the  board was working on recommending what it considered \u201cgreen settings\u201d  to OMB, which would also potentially reduce consumption of power and  the paper used to print documents. Officials at one agency also told us  that because they had observed several benefits\u2014 including improved  security, cost avoidance through acquisition of workstations with settings  already implemented, and a simplification of the software development  process\u2014by implementing their agency FDCC baseline, they were in the  process of developing or finalizing configuration settings for other  operating systems and servers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["There are a number of lessons to be learned from the management and  implementation of the FDCC initiative which, if considered, could improve  the implementation of future versions of FDCC or other configuration  efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Having Realistic and Established Time Frames for Completion Is Needed to Ensure Successful Implementation", "paragraphs": ["OMB did not provide a realistic time frame for agencies to meet the  requirements of the initiative and complete implementation of FDCC by  February 2008.

In  addition, we held discussions with OMB and NIST representatives to  further assess the initiative\u2019s requirements and confirm that the material  posted on their Web sites that we considered was current and accurate.", "To address our second and third objectives, we obtained and analyzed  polices, plans, artifacts, status reports, and other documentation relative  to the requirements of the initiative from each of the 24 federal agencies in  our review. We obtained information through interviews with officials  from each of the 24 agencies, industry officials, security experts, officials  from General Services Administration\u2019s Policy Utilization Assessment  Program, and members of the Chief Information Officers Council and  FDCC Change Control Board. We also met with staff from all 24 Offices of  the Inspector General regarding their FDCC audit work performed as part  of Federal Information Security Management Act fiscal year 2008 and 2009  reporting to obtain information on their audit methodology, findings, and  related documentation. Based on our review of the adequacy of work  performed, we have sufficient assurance to rely on work completed by the  inspectors general in the context of our audit objective related to whether  the agency had documented deviations and had incorporated language  related to the use of FDCC settings into its contracts. We also analyzed the  information we obtained from all sources to determine the benefits,  challenges, and lessons learned from implementation of FDCC.", "For our second objective, in order to determine the status of FDCC  implementation at federal agencies, we developed a data collection  instrument to obtain information on the number of workstations that had  FDCC settings applied, either with no deviations or with deviations  established at these agencies. To develop our data collection instrument,  we reviewed the requirements of the initiative as well as the results from a  previous data collection instrument used by NIST to collect status  information on FDCC as of March 2008. We designed the draft collection  instrument in close collaboration with subject matter experts and  participated in refining subsequent drafts of the instrument. We sent the  data collection instrument to the officials at the Office of Chief  Information Officer at the 24 federal agencies and asked the agencies to  provide status information as of June 30, 2009, and as of September 30,  2009.", "We e-mailed our first data collection instrument, to collect FDCC status  data as of June 30, 2009, to all 24 agencies in early June 2009. When our  collection ended in July 2009, we had received 19 usable responses. After  examining the results from this data collection to identify inconsistencies  and other indications of error, we concluded that the extent of response  error and the overall low level of participation precluded the use of these  data in our report.", "To refine the data collection instrument to collect September 2009 data,  we conducted pretests with officials from 3 agencies to clarify any  ambiguous or potentially biased questions. These pretests were conducted  by telephone with the 3 agencies, which were chosen to represent the  variety of characteristics across the 24 agencies we would survey. These  characteristics included the operating system used, type of workstation,  composition and size of the agency, and method used to collect status  information.", "We sent this instrument to agency officials in mid-September 2009. We  conducted follow-up contacts by e-mail and phone to encourage response  and clarify individual answers. We received usable responses from 22  agencies, and ended the data collection period in November 2009. While  our evaluation of the instrument data indicates that it is usable for the  purposes of this report, the information may not be complete due to the  inability of some agencies to provide information in the categories we  requested, including some of the data supporting our estimates of  contractor-owned workstations with FDCC compliance, and possibly  some other estimates.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2008 to March 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Percentage of Agency Workstations with FDCC Settings Implemented as of September 2009", "paragraphs": ["The table below shows, for the 24 agencies from which we collected data  using our data collection instrument, the percentage of applicable  Windows XP and Vista workstations that have all FDCC settings  implemented with no deviations, workstations with an agency baseline  implemented and deviations documented, and workstations that do not  have the settings implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Recommendations to Departments and Agencies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["To improve the department\u2019s implementation of FDCC, we recommend  that the Secretary of Agriculture take the following three actions:    complete implementation of the agency\u2019s FDCC baseline, including  establishing firm milestones for completion;
