Significant actions remain to be completed to build on this progress.", "Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assign 35 key responsibilities to agency CIOs to help address longstanding IT management challenges. In August 2018, GAO reported that none of the 24 selected agencies had established policies that fully addressed the role of their CIO. GAO recommended that OMB and the 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIOs' implementation of their responsibilities. Although most agencies agreed or did not comment, none of the 27 recommendations have yet been implemented.", "CIO IT acquisition review . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 covered agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight for these acquisitions. Since then, 23 of the recommendations have been implemented.", "Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers. In August 2018, 22 agencies reported that they had achieved $1.94 billion in cost savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, while two agencies reported that they had not achieved any savings. GAO has made 196 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets. As of November 2019, 121 of the recommendations have been implemented.", "Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. As of November 2019, all but 19 of the recommendations had been implemented.", "Ensuring the nation's cybersecurity . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, GAO has consistently identified shortcomings in the federal government's approach to cybersecurity.

Among other things, the guidance required agencies to  consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve  their security posture, and achieve cost savings.", "According to the 24 agencies covered by the initiative, data center  consolidation and optimization efforts had resulted in approximately $4.7  billion in cost savings through August 2018. Even so, additional work  remains to fully carry out the initiative.

Six agencies reported that they did not plan to meet their goals for tiered data centers. In addition, as of August 2018, 11  agencies reported that they had already met the goal for closing 60  percent of their non-tiered centers, three agencies reported that they  planned to meet the goal by the end of fiscal year 2018, and nine  agencies reported that they did not plan to meet the goal by the end of  fiscal year 2018.", "In all, the 24 agencies reported a total of 6,250 data center closures as of  August 2018, which represented about half of the total reported number  of federal data centers.

Federal agencies engage  in thousands of software licensing agreements annually. The objective of  software license management is to manage, control, and protect an  organization\u2019s software assets. Effective management of these licenses  can help avoid purchasing too many licenses, which can result in unused  software, as well as too few licenses, which can result in noncompliance  with license terms and cause the imposition of additional fees.", "As part of its PortfolioStat initiative, OMB has developed a policy that  addresses software licenses. This policy requires agencies to conduct  an annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce  commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could include software  licenses.", "In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies\u2019 management of software  licenses and determined that better management was needed to achieve  significant savings government-wide. Of the 24 selected agencies we  reviewed, only two had comprehensive policies that included the  establishment of clear roles and central oversight authority for managing  enterprise software license agreements, among other things. Of the  remaining 22 agencies, 18 had policies that were not comprehensive, and  four had not developed any policies.", "Further, we found that only two of the 24 selected agencies had  established comprehensive software license inventories, a leading  practice that would help them to adequately manage their software  licenses. The inadequate implementation of this and other leading  practices in software license management was partially due to  weaknesses in agencies\u2019 policies. As a result, we concluded that  agencies\u2019 oversight of software license spending was limited or lacking,  thus, potentially leading to missed savings. However, the potential  savings could be significant considering that, in fiscal year 2012, one  major federal agency reported saving approximately $181 million by  consolidating its enterprise license agreements, even when its oversight  process was ad hoc.", "Accordingly, we recommended that OMB issue a directive to help guide  agencies in managing software licenses. We also made 135  recommendations to the 24 agencies to improve their policies and  practices for managing licenses. Among other things, we recommended  that the agencies (1) regularly track and maintain a comprehensive  inventory of software licenses and (2) analyze the inventory to identify  opportunities to reduce costs and better inform investment decision  making.", "Most agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no  comments.
