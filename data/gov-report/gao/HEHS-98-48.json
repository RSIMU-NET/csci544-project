VA receives approximately $17 billion annually for delivering health care services to veterans. Applying lessons learned from the private sector\u2019s experiences with managed health care, VA began emphasizing certain managed care practices, such as primary, outpatient, and preventive care, and de-emphasizing practices such as inpatient care. VA implemented two key management changes to support its health care reform efforts. First, it decentralized the management structure of its Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to coordinate the organization of hospitals, outpatient clinics, and other facilities into 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN). VA expected the VISNs to improve efficiency by reducing unnecessarily duplicative services and shifting services from costly inpatient care to less costly outpatient care. VA expected that this reform, along with an emphasis on primary care, would also improve veterans\u2019 access to care because existing resources could then be redirected to serve more patients. Second, VA began phasing in a new national resource allocation method, the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system as part of its broader efforts to provide incentives for the networks and medical centers to improve operational efficiency and access.", "VA has testified before your Subcommittee that these reform efforts have unleashed unprecedented changes in its health care system. This report, which expands upon preliminary information in our May 1997 statement for the record for a hearing held by your Subcommittee, discusses examples of the efficiencies achieved and improvements in veterans\u2019 access to health care. It also discusses VA\u2019s monitoring of the health care that its networks are providing.", "For this report, we interviewed officials at VA headquarters, networks, and medical centers and reviewed documentation they provided. We visited three networks and seven of the medical centers located in them, interviewed officials there, and collected information from four other networks. (See app. I for more detail on our scope and methodology.) From our work, we created profiles of the seven VISNs we reviewed, which appear in appendix II. We also reviewed policy and planning guidance, monitoring procedures, and performance data.

In fiscal year 1997, VA received a medical care appropriation of about $17 billion to provide inpatient, outpatient, nursing home, and domiciliary services to 2.6 million of the nation\u2019s 26 million veterans. VA services include care to veterans with special needs such as spinal cord dysfunction, blindness, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and serious mental illness.", "In 1995, VA shifted management authority from its headquarters to new regional management structures\u2014VISNs. VA created 22 VISNs, each led by a director and a small staff of medical, budget, and administrative officials. (See fig. 1 for a map of the VISNs.) The VISNs have been configured around historic referral patterns to VA\u2019s tertiary care medical centers. These networks have substantial operational autonomy and now perform the basic decision-making and budgetary duties of the VA health care system. The network office in each VISN oversees the operations of the medical centers in its area and allocates funds to each of them. VISNs vary in several ways, including geographic size, ranging from about 10,000 square miles in VISN 3 (Bronx) to 885,000 square miles in VISN 20 (Portland); the number of hospitals in each, ranging from 5 in VISN 5 (Baltimore) and VISN 10 (Cincinnati) to 11 in VISN 4 (Pittsburgh); and the extent of services provided, reflecting, for example, historically longer inpatient and nursing home stays in the Northeast."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Established Incentives to Encourage Efficiency and Access", "paragraphs": ["When VA reorganized its health care system into 22 VISNs, it gave network and medical center directors the authority to realign services to increase efficiency and improve access. One aspect of VA\u2019s reorganization was establishing two incentives to encourage network and medical center directors to reach these objectives. First, VHA established organizationwide goals for improving efficiency and access and created performance measures to hold network directors accountable for achieving them. Second, it implemented VERA, a new workload-based allocation system that encourages networks to identify and implement efficiencies and serve more veterans.", "The performance measures emphasize organizational priorities, such as increasing outpatient surgeries and reducing inpatient care, and they enable VA to gauge each network\u2019s performance. VA has incorporated these measures into each network director\u2019s performance contract and required each VISN to have a strategic plan explaining how it intends to improve efficiency and access.", "VERA, introduced in fiscal year 1997, allocates budget resources to the networks and provides them incentives for achieving cost efficiencies and serving more veterans. VERA is intended to improve the equity of resource allocations to networks. It provides more comparable levels of resources to each network for each high-priority veteran served than the system it replaced, which allocated resources primarily on the basis of facilities\u2019 historical budgets.", "Networks that increase their patient workload compared with other networks gain resources under VERA; those whose patient workloads decrease compared with other networks lose resources. More efficient networks (that is, those whose patient care costs are below the national cost) have more funds available for local initiatives. Less efficient networks (whose patient care costs are above the national cost), however, must increase efficiency to have such funds available.", "By directly funding the networks, rather than the medical centers as in the past, VERA clearly conveys that each facility is a part of a larger regional network that must facilitate veterans\u2019 equitable access to services. VERA recognizes that networks are responsible for fostering change, eliminating duplicative services, and encouraging cooperation among medical facilities. Network officials have the authority to tailor their VERA allocations to facilities and programs within parameters set by national policy and guidelines and to integrate services among facilities for achieving equitable access to care and other purposes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Efforts Have Increased Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["In the mid-1990s, VA, recognizing that its health care system was inefficient and in need of reform, followed the lead of private-sector health care providers and began reorganizing its system to improve efficiency and access. Like other federal health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, that are adopting managed care practices to control program expenditures, VA recognized that it could improve its health care system by adopting selected managed care practices. Consequently, in 1995, VA introduced substantial structural and operational changes in its health care system to improve the quality and efficiency of and access to care by reducing its historical reliance on inpatient care. VA shifted its focus from a bed-based, inpatient system emphasizing specialty care to one emphasizing primary care provided on an outpatient basis. In addition, the Congress enacted legislation in October 1996 eliminating several restrictions on veterans\u2019 eligibility for VA outpatient care, which allowed VA to serve more patients on this basis.", "These actions accelerated VA\u2019s shift in delivery of health care services from expensive hospital-based inpatient care to less costly outpatient care.

At the Brockton/West Roxbury, Massachusetts, medical center, the number of outpatient visits increased by about 5 percent from fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 1996.", "Medical center officials told us that they increased outpatient visits by shifting resources from inpatient to outpatient care, increasing marketing and conducting outreach efforts, extending clinic hours to evenings and weekends, and reassigning staff. Outreach efforts included health fairs conducted at various community locations, flu vaccinations, and cancer screenings. In VISN 4 (Pittsburgh), medical center officials said that when appropriate, they move patients to outpatient locations. They also use educational programs to inform people of alternatives to expensive inpatient care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Is Emphasizing Preventive Care", "paragraphs": ["As part of its emphasis on outpatient care, VA has promoted preventive measures to keep veterans healthier and out of the hospital to improve efficiency, access, and quality of care. Preventive measures consist of periodic health assessments that provide screening, counseling, risk assessment, and patient education. To encourage preventive care, VA assesses network and medical center directors on their facilities\u2019 progress in implementing nationally recognized health prevention standards for eight diseases with major social consequences.", "All of the medical centers we visited provided preventive care services and education programs. An example of a preventive measure is VA\u2019s guideline for examining the feet of diabetic patients during an outpatient visit to detect circulatory problems. In addition, the centers conduct classes in smoking and alcohol abuse cessation, stress management and hypertension reduction, and a wide variety of other disease prevention measures.", "Prevention efforts vary by medical center. The Pittsburgh medical center is piloting a prevention clinic in conjunction with one of its primary care teams. Clinic visits involve patients arriving 1 hour early for appointments with their primary care provider. During this time, a nurse or nurse practitioner discusses prevention issues with the patient and writes orders for prevention activities that will then be reviewed and signed by the patient\u2019s primary care provider during the scheduled appointment. The Brockton/West Roxbury medical center offers smoking cessation clinics, which are held in the evenings to improve veterans\u2019 access to them. Beginning in fiscal year 1997, nurses at the Clarksburg, West Virginia, medical center started making follow-up telephone calls to recently treated patients to answer questions and ensure that patients are following post-treatment instructions, taking their medications, and following dietary instructions. As a result, the medical center expects fewer return visits by these patients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outpatient Surgeries Have Increased", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with the changes in other health care sectors, VA has used advances in diagnostic, therapeutic, surgery, and rehabilitative services to increase its use of outpatient surgery. VA\u2019s goal is for its medical centers to perform at least 65 percent of selected surgical procedures on an outpatient basis. Outpatient surgical units require less extensive staffing levels because patients are typically discharged in less than 12 hours and do not need around-the-clock nursing care. In addition, because patients spend less time in the hospital, costs for housekeeping, nutrition, linens, medical, and administrative services are lower.", "Most VA medical centers now have outpatient surgery capability, and the percentage of such surgeries has increased nationwide from 34 to 66 percent between fiscal year 1993 and mid-fiscal year 1997. During this same time period, each of the seven networks we reviewed increased the percentage of outpatient surgeries. (See fig. 3.)", "Each of the medical centers we reviewed that performed surgery increased the number of outpatient surgeries performed. Officials at four of the six medical centers we reviewed that had inpatient surgery reported that increasing outpatient surgeries has lowered hospital admissions, reducing costs. Clarksburg medical center officials reported an increase in the percentage of outpatient surgeries between fiscal year 1995 and mid-February of fiscal year 1997 from 62 to 83 percent. Furthermore, the number of both inpatient and outpatient procedures increased from about 2,130 to more than 2,276 between fiscal years 1995 and 1996.", "The medical centers we visited use a variety of practices to support outpatient surgery. At the Pittsburgh medical center, for example, patients requiring care following surgery, but not needing hospitalization, receive that care in an observation unit. The Clarksburg, Jackson, and Lebanon medical centers also use observation units. In addition, the medical centers in Jackson, Lebanon, and Pittsburgh reduce costs by providing local accommodations or \u201cHoptel\u201d beds for veterans who live far from the medical center on the night before scheduled outpatient surgery rather than admit them to the hospital. Following are other practices medical centers reported using to support outpatient surgery: Improved scheduling helps support outpatient surgery. One example of this is keeping time slots available in specialty clinics to ensure that patients with multiple conditions be scheduled for timely evaluations before surgery\u2014patients such as those with heart problems who are seen in a cardiology clinic before having noncardiac surgery. Another example involves scheduling patients with similar diagnoses for simultaneous treatment in a clinic, allowing VA to better manage workload and staff assignments and also reducing the time veterans spend waiting to get an appointment.

Integrations involve the combining of administrative units of multiple facilities as well as the elimination of unnecessarily duplicative services within and among facilities. Integrations produce efficiencies through staff reductions or economies of scale that enable facilities to serve more patients. Integrations can significantly benefit veterans mainly because VA can reinvest the money it saves to enhance veterans\u2019 access to care and improve service and quality.", "VISNs and medical centers we visited have completed several integrations and have others in progress. In fiscal year 1997, for example, the two VA hospitals in Pittsburgh\u2014the University Drive hospital (a tertiary care referral center) and the Highland Drive hospital (a psychiatric facility)\u2014 integrated to form the Pittsburgh Health Care System under a single medical director. This integration also eliminated duplicate service units, resulting in the closing of one acute and two intermediate care units at Highland Drive. As part of this integration, the medical center identified excess staff positions and reduced the number of FTEEs by 232 during fiscal year 1997. In another case, VISN 1 (Boston) is proposing a large-scale integration of two tertiary care centers located within 7 miles of each other in the Boston metropolitan area. The resulting integration, if approved, could change the mission of the Brockton/West Roxbury medical center to one focusing on outpatient care, while the other center, the Boston medical center, could retain its tertiary care status. Not all networks are planning facility integrations, however.

For example, VISN 1 (Boston) has integrated the laboratory and laundry services of eight medical centers. The Brockton/West Roxbury medical center now processes all mail-out laboratory tests for the network. Furthermore, the Northampton medical center integrated its medical service and ambulatory care into primary care and integrated engineering and environmental management services into one facilities management service unit. In VISN 4 (Pittsburgh), the Lebanon medical center merged five support and resources management units into two new departments in fiscal year 1997.

Medical centers assign patients to primary care teams, which are responsible for managing patient care. The composition of a primary care team varies depending upon a medical center\u2019s mission and patient population, but these teams generally include physicians, one or more health care professionals (for example, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, registered and licensed practical nurses, and medical residents), and clerks for administrative support. Some teams may include a psychiatrist, social worker, dietician, or physical therapist. For example, the Northampton medical center, which has more psychiatric than acute care beds, has established a primary care team to treat psychiatric patients. Members of this team include a psychiatrist, psychiatric social worker, psychologist, and clinical pharmacist as well as a clinical nurse specialist or physician assistant, dietician, and administrative staff.", "As the first point of contact, primary care teams provide accessible, routine care for veterans, establish an ongoing relationship with them, and coordinate treatment for patients requiring specialized care. They generally provide a comprehensive range of medical services, except for emergency or specialty care. As managers of patient care, teams help ensure that appropriate services are provided and duplicate services are avoided. For example, by calling veterans on the telephone primary care teams can answer veterans\u2019 questions about their health and ask whether veterans are following their post-discharge instructions. This practice may eliminate the need for veterans to visit medical centers.", "In addition, primary care team staff encourage veterans to schedule appointments rather than just walk in to medical centers for treatment as many veterans have done in the past. Appointments enable VA to improve scheduling of its workload and resources, reducing the time patients spend waiting for an appointment as well as that spent waiting upon arrival to be seen. For example, officials at the Causeway Street outpatient clinic in Boston and the Jackson medical center told us that scheduling nonurgent patients for appointments reduced the number of walk-ins and allowed for more efficient staff assignment. This helps reduce the number of patients receiving care inappropriately at specialty clinics, improving access for those who need such care.", "Each of the medical centers we visited had established primary care teams, and most of them had increased the number of these teams between fiscal years 1995 and 1997. For example, the Brockton/West Roxbury and the Lebanon medical centers had no primary care teams in fiscal year 1995; by fiscal year 1997, they had seven and four, respectively. The medical centers we reviewed showed sizable growth in the numbers of veterans assigned to primary care teams. (See table 3.) In fiscal year 1997, VA had over 1,000 primary care teams in operation.", "Medical centers we visited have taken many actions to accommodate increased numbers of primary care patients. For example, they have expanded and converted hospital space to create additional primary care clinics, added more examination and treatment rooms and support space, and used off-site clinics to deliver primary care. Previously, physicians in the medical centers we visited had only the use of their offices or one exam room to see patients. Multiple examination rooms enable primary care teams to treat more patients because a physician can treat one patient while other patients prepare for or are attended by other team members. More examination and treatment rooms for each physician or team allow primary care doctors to see more patients, more efficiently using their time and reducing patients\u2019 waiting time. For example, at the Lebanon medical center, we observed renovations under way to increase primary care space from 978 to 4,786 square feet in fiscal year 1997. Furthermore, by converting additional hospital space, Lebanon will add 2,400 square feet in fall 1998. In fiscal year 1998, the Fayetteville medical center is expanding its primary care space from 3,400 to 11,233 square feet, including 16 examination rooms, 2 treatment rooms, and support space. By renovating existing space for use by primary care teams, the Jackson medical center increased space from 2,021 to 13,835 square feet from fiscal years 1995 to 1996. Renovation under way at the time of our visit will more than double the number of examination rooms for each primary care physician. This medical center is also more than doubling the number of physicians assigned to primary care.

At the Lebanon medical center, as the number of VA primary care patients increased by 2,324 in fiscal year 1997, waiting times for appointments at some specialty clinics decreased. For example, the appointment waiting time at this center\u2019s urology clinic declined from 100 days to 40 days. Fayetteville medical center officials report that before their medical center introduced primary care, the average appointment waiting time for specialty care was more than 90 days; it is now less than 30 days.

Responding to VERA\u2019s incentives, officials at the medical centers in Pittsburgh, Lebanon, and Newington/ West Haven (the Connecticut Health Care System) told us that they have made nursing home services available to more veterans at less cost to VA by establishing alternatives to long-term, inpatient nursing home care. The Pittsburgh and Lebanon medical centers now use their inpatient nursing home services to evaluate, medically stabilize, and then, if appropriate, prepare patients for placement in the least restrictive community environment, including their own homes. According to Lebanon officials, for example, this \u201ctransitional care\u201d approach has reduced the average length of stay in the nursing home unit. This has enabled them to increase the number of patients served annually from 264 in fiscal year 1995 to 448 in fiscal year 1997 without increasing the number of staff in the unit.

The objective of sub-acute care is the same as that of the nursing home programs in the Pittsburgh and Lebanon medical centers. Following evaluation and medical stabilization in the sub-acute care unit, patients are discharged to their home or a community facility. To enable veterans to return home, the Connecticut Health Care System established a day hospital program to provide medical services, such as physical therapy and intravenous medications, to patients who then return home at night; upgraded support services in patients\u2019 homes, such as providing visiting nurses; and improved transportation services.", "These changes reduced the Connecticut Health Care System\u2019s nursing home beds from 150 in fiscal year 1995 to 40 by the end of fiscal year 1997.

For example, officials in several of the VISNs we contacted have reinvested savings from changes in inpatient care and specialty services\u2014such as nursing home care\u2014to improve veterans\u2019 access to primary care. Previously, however, we reported that VA headquarters lacked timely and detailed indicators of certain changes in its health care delivery\u2014particularly to veterans receiving special care services such as nursing home care or treatment for spinal cord injuries.

As noted, monitoring the impact of such changes is critical because networks are responding to VA\u2019s incentives to reduce the cost of care. Special care services, which include the most expensive services VA delivers (for example, nursing home care or care for veterans with spinal cord injuries), are especially important to monitor because the population receiving these services is particularly vulnerable.
