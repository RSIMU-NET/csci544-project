Between 2001 and 2005, GAO reported that the modernization program had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an enterprise architecture and investment management structures that had limited value. Accordingly, GAO made explicit architecture and investment management-related recommendations. Congress included provisions in the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 that were consistent with GAO's recommendations and required GAO to assess DOD's actions to comply with these provisions.

Collectively, these steps address several statutory provisions and best practices concerning the business enterprise architecture, budgetary disclosure, and review of systems costing in excess of $1 million. However, long-standing challenges that GAO previously identified remain to be addressed in order for DOD to be in compliance with guidance and the act. In particular, (1) While DOD continues to release updates to its enterprise architecture, the architecture has yet to be augmented by a coherent family of component architectures. In this regard, each of the military departments has made progress in managing its respective enterprise architecture program since GAO last reported in 2008. However, each has yet to address key elements, including developing the architecture content, to advance to a level that could be considered mature. For example, while each department has established or is in the process of establishing an executive committee with responsibility and accountability for the enterprise architecture, none has fully developed an enterprise architecture methodology or a well-defined business enterprise architecture and transition plan to guide and constrain business transformation initiatives. (2) DOD continues to establish investment management processes, but neither DOD-level organizations nor the military departments have defined the full range of project-level and portfolio-based IT investment management policies and procedures that are necessary to meet the investment selection and control provisions of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Specifically, with regard to project-level practices, DOD enterprise, Air Force, and Navy have yet to fully define 56 percent of the practices, and Army has yet to do so for 78 percent of the practices. With regard to the portfolio-level practices, DOD enterprise, Air Force, and Navy have yet to fully define 80 percent and Army has yet to do so for any of the practices. In addition, while DOD largely followed its certification and oversight processes, key steps were not performed. For example, as part of the certification process, DOD performed three process assessments specified in DOD guidance, such as assessing investment alignment with the architecture, but did not validate the results of the assessment, thus increasing the risk that certification decisionmaking was based on inaccurate and unreliable information. It is essential that DOD address GAO's existing recommendations aimed at addressing these long-standing challenges, as doing so is critical to the department's ability to establish the full range of institutional management controls needed to address its business systems modernization high-risk program. Department officials attributed the state of progress in part to the uncertainty and pending decisions surrounding the roles and responsibilities of key organizations and senior leadership positions as well as the lack of resources (i.e., people and funding). Because GAO has existing recommendations that address the long-standing challenges discussed in this report, it is making no further recommendations in these areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DOD complete the implementation of the reorganization of key organizations.

In 1995, we designated the  department\u2019s business systems modernization program as high risk, and  we continue to designate it as such today. As our research on public and  private sector organizations has shown, two essential ingredients to a  successful systems modernization program are an effective institutional  approach to managing information technology (IT) investments and a well- defined enterprise architecture. For its business systems modernization,  DOD is developing and using a federated business enterprise architecture,  which is a coherent family of parent and subsidiary architectures, to help  modernize its nonintegrated and duplicative business operations and the  systems that support them.", "In May 2001, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense establish the  means for effectively developing an enterprise architecture and a  corporate, architecture-centric approach to investment control and  decision making.

Reagan  National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2005 that  were consistent with our recommendations. More specifically, section 332  of the act required the department to, among other things, (1) develop a  business enterprise architecture and a transition plan for implementing the  architecture, (2) identify systems information in its annual budget  submission, (3) establish a system investment approval and accountability  structure along with an investment review process, and (4) certify and  approve any system modernizations costing in excess of $1 million. The  act further required that the Secretary of Defense submit an annual report  to congressional defense committees on DOD\u2019s compliance with certain  requirements of the act not later than March 15 of each year, from 2005  through 2013.

To address  the budgetary disclosure and certification provisions of the act, we  reviewed the department\u2019s report to Congress, which was submitted on  May 4, 2011, and evaluated the information used to satisfy the budget  submission and investment review, certification, and approval aspects of  the act.", "We conducted this performance audit at DOD and military department  offices in Arlington, Virginia, from January to June 2011, in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

As we have previously reported, the DOD systems  environment that supports these business functions is overly complex and  error prone, and is characterized by (1) little standardization across the  department, (2) multiple systems performing the same tasks, (3) the same  data stored in multiple systems, and (4) the need for data to be entered  manually into multiple systems. The department recently requested about  $17.3 billion for its business systems environment and IT infrastructure  investments for fiscal year 2012.

Seven of these areas are specific to the department,  and seven other high-risk areas are shared with other federal agencies.  Collectively, these high-risk areas relate to DOD\u2019s major business  operations that are inextricably linked to the department\u2019s ability to  perform its overall mission and directly affect the readiness and  capabilities of U.S. military forces and can affect the success of a mission.  In particular, the department\u2019s nonintegrated and duplicative systems  impair its ability to combat fraud, waste, and abuse. As such, DOD\u2019s  business systems modernization is one of the high-risk areas and is an  essential enabler in addressing many of the department\u2019s other high-risk  areas.

Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  and the federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council have also  recognized the importance of an architecture-centric approach to  modernization.

In addition,  it also provides a basis for developing architecture management  improvement plans, as well as for measuring, reporting, and overseeing  progress in implementing these plans.", "Several approaches to structuring enterprise architecture exist and can be  applied to the extent that they are relevant and appropriate for a given  enterprise. In general, these approaches provide for decomposing an  enterprise into its logical parts and architecting each of the parts in  relation to enterprisewide needs and the inherent relationships and  dependencies that exist among the parts. As such, the approaches are  fundamentally aligned and consistent with a number of basic enterprise  architecture principles, such as incremental rather than monolithic  architecture development and implementation, optimization of the whole  rather than optimization of the component parts, and maximization of  shared data and services across the component parts rather than  duplication.

Further, we concluded that  certification and approval decisions may not be sufficiently justified  because investments were certified and approved without conditions even  though our prior reports had identified program weaknesses that were  unresolved at the time of certification and approval.

This means that version 8.0 appropriately focuses on  addressing a limited set of enterprise-level (DOD-wide) priorities and  provides the overarching and common architectural context that the  distinct and autonomous member (i.e., component) architectures inherit.  Nevertheless, this also means that version 8.0 does not provide the total  federated family of DOD parent and subsidiary architectures for the  business mission area. Having such an architecture is dependent on each  military department (Air Force, Army, and Navy) having the capability to  manage its enterprise architecture and develop the necessary content.", "To assist DOD in its architecture federation efforts, we have previously  made a number of recommendations.

While DOD agreed with the  recommendation, none of its annual reports since 2007, including its latest  annual report (issued in May 2011), have included this information.  According to Business Transformation Agency officials, IV&V activities  have focused on the corporate business enterprise architecture and not on  the entire federated family of architectures.

Overall, the summary confirms our  findings by stating that, while there has been previous work to develop a  business enterprise architecture federation plan, the execution of the  federation has yet to be completed. According to Business Transformation  Agency officials, the current requirement under the IV&V contract is to  provide analysis of the business enterprise architecture. There are no  plans for reviewing the military departments\u2019 enterprise architectures.", "The challenges that the department faces in federating its architecture and  the importance of disclosing to congressional defense committees the  state of its federation efforts are amplified by our prior report on the state  of the military departments\u2019 enterprise architecture programs. Specifically,  we reported in May 2008 that none of the three military departments could  demonstrate through verifiable documentation that it had established all  of the core foundational commitments and capabilities needed to  effectively manage the development, maintenance, and implementation of  an architecture, as outlined in our Enterprise Architecture Management  Maturity Framework version 1.1.", "Since then, each of the military departments has adopted a federated  approach to developing its respective architecture program. However, the  extent to which each of their architecture programs has improved since  2008 varies. For example, while all three have or are in the process of  establishing an executive committee with responsibility and accountability  for the department\u2019s enterprise architecture, none have fully developed an  enterprise architecture methodology or have a well-defined business  enterprise architecture and transition plan to guide and constrain business  transformation initiatives.

However, each has yet to address key elements,  including developing the architecture content, in order to advance to a  level that can be considered fully mature. According to DOD officials, the  lack of progress in addressing key management elements has been due to  the uncertainty and pending decisions surrounding the roles and  responsibilities of key organizations and senior leadership positions. Air  Force officials attributed the state of its enterprise architecture program in  part to the lack of resources. Army officials also stated that a major  challenge has been the lack of resources (i.e., people and funding) due to  the shift of resources to higher priority initiatives. Navy officials stated  that there is not one overarching reason for the state of the Navy  enterprise architecture program but rather a number of reasons, such as  limited resources. Navy officials agreed that work remains to be done and  stated that they will continue to address the missing elements as they  move forward. Although all the military departments reported resources to  be a challenge, as noted earlier, DOD requested about $17.3 billion for its  business systems environment. Given the department\u2019s prioritization of  about $17 billion, the military department architecture programs have not  received resources that they deemed sufficient to meet their needs. What  this means is that DOD, as a whole, is not as well positioned as it should  be to realize the significant benefits that a well-managed federation of  architectures could afford its business systems modernization efforts.

Specifically, we reported that the Air Force had not defined  the architecture products that described its logistics enterprise  architecture for its current environment and its acquisition enterprise  architecture and health services enterprise architectures for its target  environments. We also reported that, while it had developed a sequencing  plan of systems, it had not defined a gap analysis describing how the  department would transition from the current to the target environment.  Since then, the department has developed architectural artifacts that  capture some of the missing business-related elements. For example, the  Air Force has identified acquisition transformation goals, health services  operational activities, and logistics systems and services, such as the  Commodity Management Service. In addition, the department has  identified and described business transformation initiatives (e.g.,  streamline civilian hiring process to meet DOD\u2019s goal of 80 days by 2012).

According to the Air Force, it is focused instead on capturing and  using existing architecture artifacts that describe current and target  architectures associated with priority areas for improvement.

Instead, the department\u2019s approach consists of developing three  separate and distinct segment architectures (i.e., battle command,  networks, and generating force), each of which is being developed by  separate department organizational units and is supported by individual  segment and solution architectures. According to department officials, the  department\u2019s current approach to developing its business enterprise  architecture calls for this content to be developed as part of the generating  force enterprise architecture effort.", "In 2008, we reported that Army had not defined its current and target  business environments and developed a transition plan. To its credit, the  department has since made progress in developing its first version of the  Army\u2019s business enterprise architecture. Specifically, it has defined the  scope of this architecture, which comprises traditional business functions  such as acquisition, logistics, financial management, human capital  management, and installation and environment. The scope of the Army\u2019s  business enterprise architecture is also extended to include training and  sub-segments of the LandWarNet/Battle Command functions. This  provides logical groupings of the key business activities the department  performs, and can be used to identify subbordinate architectures that  support the department\u2019s generating force mission area. In addition, the  architecture includes the 15 end-to-end business processes listed in the  DOD business enterprise architecture and Army plans to use these  processes to guide and constrain business process modeling efforts and  identify business systems that are to be integrated. This is consistent with  DOD\u2019s approach of using end-to-end business processes to optimize  business processes and the systems that support them. Further, the  department has outlined its business transformation initiatives (e.g.,  civilian hiring reform) to accelerate business process improvement and  cost savings.", "However, Army does not have a well-defined business enterprise  architecture and a transition plan to guide and constrain business  transformation initiatives. In particular, although the first version provides  systems mappings to several end-to-end business processes (e.g., Procure- to-Pay), it has yet to provide evidence of mappings of system functions to  all the end-to-end business processes, such as Service Request-to- Resolution. According to officials, the mapping of system functions to  process steps will take place when the department performs detailed  business process mapping. Further, the first version does not describe  how end-to-end business processes will be implemented, including  principles and guidance for implementing technologies that would support  planned business systems investments. Without this, there is an increased  risk of incompatible implementation and/or not being able to leverage the  most benefits from the technologies.", "The Army has also made progress in developing aspects of a business  transition plan. For example, it identifies business transformation  initiatives, such as civilian hiring reform, and describes results or changes  to business operations to be achieved by the business transformation  initiatives. It also includes diagrams that depict the migration from legacy  business systems to commercial off-the-shelf enterprise resource planning  solutions. Such diagrams provide a life cycle view of enterprise systems  resources, including describing how each system evolves over time.  However, the plan still does not include important content such as gap  analyses at the enterprise level and for each business function (e.g.  acquisition, financial management) and timelines for addressing the gaps.  A gap analysis is an assessment of the differences between the current and  target architectures. For example, a performance gap analysis identifies  performance measures (e.g., effectiveness) of a business process,  highlights which performance measures are not being met in the current  environment, and describes performance expectations for these measures  in the target environment, thereby describing expected performance  improvements of the business process. This performance gap analysis  should also identify the business process activities or steps that need to be  changed to achieve the future performance expectations. As such, these  gap analyses are important to help identify changes or adjustments that  are necessary at the enterprise level and within each business function to  achieve desired business performance results and mission outcomes.", "The Department of the Navy\u2019s enterprise architecture is comprised of  corporate architecture products, which include applicable laws,  regulations, and policies as well as enterprisewide reference models and  architecture content and subordinate architectures, which comprise nine  segment architectures, with each addressing a distinct functional area  such as logistics and command and control. These subordinate  architectures are to be developed by communities of practice groups that  have yet to be formally established.

Specifically, we found that the Navy had not defined its  current core business processes or provided a comprehensive picture of  its current business problems that the department needs to address. We  also found that it had yet to develop a well-defined target architecture,  including the purpose and scope of all the functional areas (e.g., joint  logistics and planning). In addition, we also found that, while the  department had developed a transition plan as part of its architecture, the  plan was not based on a gap analysis between the current and target  environments. This is important to lay out a road map for optimizing  mission performance and transforming business operations by  systematically implementing changes to technologies and processes.", "Since 2008, Navy has identified its business segments such as logistics and  force support, representing some of its core business processes. In  addition, according to Navy officials, it plans to establish communities of  practice to oversee the development of segment reference architectures  and a road map for developing these architectures. It has also added  additional business-related architecture content. For example, the  architecture includes the Navy\u2019s Common Operational Activity List that  specifies some business activities related to identifying and resolving  accounting records discrepancies. Such operational activities provide a  basis from which the department identifies the business activities or  functions to be reused (and optimized) across the department and those  activities or functions that remain unique to each business segment or  domain.", "Nonetheless, Navy does not have a well-defined enterprisewide business  architecture and transition plan to guide and constrain business  transformation initiatives. In particular, the department has not developed  a business enterprise architecture that provides a clear and  comprehensive picture of its current and target business environments.  For example, the enterprise architecture does not describe current and  target business capabilities, systems that are to be integrated to support  DOD end-to-end business processes, and information exchange  requirements among business activities. According to Navy officials, rather  than capturing the department\u2019s current and target business environments,  the focus of Navy\u2019s enterprise architecture is to develop artifacts that are  \u201cactionable\u201d such as enterprise rules for assessing compliance of business  systems. While such actionable artifacts provide value, they do not provide  a comprehensive and systematic approach for transforming business  operations. Further, there is no evidence that the department has  documented current problems or defined the scope and purpose for all of  the business-related segment reference architectures. Documenting  current problems will enable the Navy to identify opportunities (e.g., new  applications, new processes, or new management approaches) for  improvement and to assess whether transformation efforts address these  problems.", "Moreover, although Navy has developed an enterprise transition plan, the  plan is not well-defined and does not include an enterprise gap analysis  that identifies the differences between the current and target business  architectures, particularly the critical differences or shortfalls that affect  the successful accomplishment of the department\u2019s mission. According to  officials, gaps and shortfalls in the current department programs can be  identified through enterprise architecture compliance assessments, and  enterprise architecture waivers are granted with specific expiration dates  and conditions that are to be met to address the gaps and shortfalls.  Nevertheless, the focus of these compliance assessments is on gaps and  shortfalls of individual programs (e.g., limited system availability) and not  on gaps and shortfalls from the perspective of end-to-end business  processes (e.g., process gaps) that are needed to achieve the target  environment.

For example, for  selection, DOD established a process that calls for investments involving  more than $1 million in obligations to be certified and approved before  funds are to be expended. Specifically, the process calls for investments to  be, among other things, compliant with DOD\u2019s BEA and be economically  justified. However, the process does not fully address all aspects of the  selection key practice. For example, the process does not specify how the  IRBs are to use the full range of cost, schedule, and benefit data in making  selection (i.e., certification) decisions, as called for in our ITIM  framework.", "In addition, for oversight, DOD has established an oversight process that  calls for, among other things, investments to be reviewed annually to  assess how each is performing. As part of the process, the IRBs assess  program performance relative to cost, schedule, and capability  commitments. However, DOD\u2019s oversight process does not provide  sufficient visibility into the military department\u2019s investment management  activities, including its reviews of systems in operations and maintenance  and smaller investments, commonly referred to as Tier 4 investments.", "Nonetheless, DOD enterprise and the military departments have still not  fully defined these Stage 2 and 3 key practices. Specifically, with regard to  the nine Stage 2 practices, DOD enterprise, Air Force, and Navy, as shown  in table 6, have yet to fully define five key practices (or 56 percent of the  practices), and Army has yet to do so for seven (or 78 percent) of the  practices.", "With regard to the five Stage 3 practices, DOD enterprise, Air Force, and  Navy, as shown in table 7, have yet to fully define four key practices (or 80  percent of the practices), and Army has yet to do so for any (100 percent)  of the practices.", "Officials from DOD enterprise and the military departments attributed the  incomplete state of their IT investment management processes to the  following:    DOD enterprise officials said the condition of its processes, including the  lack of progress since 2009, was due in part to current ongoing DOD  efforts to reorganize the business systems governance organizations (e.g.,  the Business Transformation Agency) that are responsible for  implementing IT investment management at the DOD enterprise level. As  noted earlier, in August 2010, the Secretary of Defense announced the  plans to disestablish the Business Transformation Agency and that the  functions of the Business Transformation Agency, such as its IT  investment management function, be reviewed and transferred to other  organizations in DOD, as appropriate. The DOD officials stated that these  implementation plans have yet to be finalized and have resulted in their  investment management implementation efforts being delayed. These  officials added that they are aware of the absence of documented project- level and portfolio-level management practices; they also said they are  currently working on developing policies and procedures to address the  missing processes and practices but were not able to provide us with  milestones and a plan with defined steps for when the policies and  procedures were to be completed.", "Air Force and Navy officials said their investment management  implementation efforts were taking longer than originally planned given  their workload and other priorities assigned to them since initiating  investment management efforts. They also acknowledged that their  processes were missing certain documented project-level and portfolio- level management policies and procedures and said they were in the  process of developing policies and procedures to address these missing  processes and practices. In particular, Air Force officials stated that they  planned to have their policies and procedures approved and finalized by  October 2011.", "Army officials said the state of their IT investment management process is  due to the fact that the department focused on first establishing selected  institutional capabilities\u2014such as defining roles and responsibilities and  establishing a department-level IRB\u2014rather than attempting to do  everything at once. The officials added that once its initial steps are  completed, Army intends to then focus on implementing remaining Stage 2  and three key processes and practices. Specifically, these officials said  that they are aware that Army lacks a military department-level IRB and  added that until now they have been relying on functional area experts to  review investments before they are sent to the DOD IRBs. They also  acknowledged that Army is missing certain documented project-level and  portfolio-level management policies and procedures. They further stated  that the department is currently working on guidance to address these  missing items with the goal of having it approved and finalized by August  2011.", "As discussed in our ITIM framework and previous reports on DOD\u2019s  investment management of its business systems, adequately documenting  both policies and associated procedures that govern how an organization  manages its IT projects and investment portfolios is important because  doing so provides the basis for rigor, discipline, and repeatability in how  investments are selected and controlled across the entire organization.  Until DOD fully defines missing policies and procedures, it is unlikely that  the department\u2019s reported 2,258 business systems will be managed in a  consistent, repeatable, and effective manner that, among other things,  maximizes mission performance while minimizing or eliminating system  overlap and duplication. To this point, there is evidence showing that DOD  is not managing its systems in this manner. For example, DOD reported  that of its 79 major business and other IT investments, roughly a third are  encountering cost, schedule, and performance shortfalls requiring  immediate and sustained management attention. In addition, we have  consistently reported for some time that DOD\u2019s business system  environment has been characterized by (1) little standardization, (2)  multiple systems performing the same tasks, (3) the same data stored in  multiple systems, and (4) manual data entry into multiple systems.  Because DOD spends over $10 billion each year on its business systems  and related IT infrastructure, the potential for identifying and avoiding the  costs associated with duplicative functionality across its business system  investments is significant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Largely Followed Its Certification and Oversight Processes for the Investments Under Review, but Validation and Other Key Steps Were Not Performed", "paragraphs": ["As discussed, certification and oversight are key DOD processes for  selecting, and overseeing IT investments. DOD guidance calls for  investments to be certified and approved before funds are to be expended  on modernization activities. More specifically, the guidance states that  investments involving more than $1 million in obligations are to be  certified by designated approval authorities and as part of that  certification, authority officials are to attest that each investment  is compliant with DOD\u2019s BEA, including all relevant architecture products,  such as products that specify the technical standards needed to promote  interoperability among related systems or examine overlaps with other  business systems; is economically justified, based on an economic viability analysis  developed using disciplined and rigorous cost estimating practices; and   has undergone sufficient business process reengineering analysis,  including identifying and developing approaches to streamlining and  improving involved processes.", "As part of each of these three requirements, we have said it is important  for designated approval authorities to validate the results of BEA and  other assessments to ensure investment decision making is based on  accurate and reliable information. More specifically, we previously  reported that DOD had not been performing this step and made  recommendations that they do so. DOD agreed with our findings and  recommendations, and stated that it planned to assign validation  responsibilities and issue guidance that describes the methodology for  performing validation activities but were not able to provide a date for  when this would be completed.", "Once investments have been certified, DOD guidance calls for investments  to be effectively overseen. This includes reviewing annually the progress  of investments using predefined criteria and checkpoints, in meeting cost,  schedule, risk, and benefit expectations.", "Consistent with this, DOD guidance calls for IRBs to annually review  certified investments and in doing so, to focus on program performance  against cost, schedule, and performance baselines, and progress in  meeting the certification conditions discussed. Our ITIM research and  experience with federal agencies also shows that it is important for  oversight and other decisionmaking authorities to validate performance  information used to make decisions so that investment decision making is  based on accurate and reliable information.", "DOD largely followed the certification process for each of the four  investments we reviewed, but did not perform validation and other key  aspects of the process. Specifically:  BEA compliance. DOD enterprise and the military departments took  steps to assess BEA compliance of their respective systems. This included  following DOD guidance (the appropriate version of DOD\u2019s BEA  Compliance Guidance) and using an automated tool (called Architecture  Compliance and Requirements Traceability) to determine and report on  the extent of each system\u2019s architectural compliance. In addition, in each  case, once the BEA assessment had been completed, the appropriate DOD  enterprise and military department precertification authorities asserted  (via memorandum of certification) that each system was compliant with  DOD\u2019s BEA.", "For example, on the Project Management Resource Tool (PMRT) project,  Air Force followed the BEA compliance guidance and used the  Architecture Compliance and Requirements Traceability tool to develop a  compliance report that mapped BEA activities to PMRT\u2019s capabilities. In  August 2010, Air Force\u2019s Director of Business Transformation and Deputy  Chief Management Officer stated in a supporting precertification  memorandum that this information was used to assert that PMRT was  compliant with DOD\u2019s BEA.", "In another example, on the Defense Travel System, DOD also assessed  BEA compliance by using the BEA Compliance Guidance and the  Architecture Compliance and Requirements Traceability tool to develop a  report showing extent of compliance. In an October 2010, precertification  memo, DOD\u2019s CIO said this information was used to assert that the system  was compliant with DOD\u2019s BEA.", "Although DOD took these steps to certify BEA compliance, it did not take  other key steps. For example, DOD and component designated approval  authorities did not validate the assessments and assertions. Specifically,  the BEA compliance assessments performed on the investments under  review were not validated by DOD certification and approval entities.  Although this was not done, the systems were nevertheless certified as  compliant. We reported on this weakness in 2008 and made  recommendations to DOD to, among other things, explicitly assign  responsibility for validating program BEA compliance assessments and  issue guidance that describes the methodology for performing such  validation activities. To date, DOD has yet to implement these  recommendations. However, DOD officials told us the department has  actions planned or underway to address these recommendations, although  they were not able to provide milestones for when this would be  accomplished.", "In addition, our 2008 report showed that DOD BEA assessments did not  include all relevant architecture products, such as products that specify  the technical standards needed to promote interoperability among related  systems or examine overlaps with other business systems. Despite the  limited assessments, DOD nonetheless certified the investments as BEA  compliant even though they did not adequately demonstrate such  compliance. Accordingly, we have made recommendations to DOD to  revise its BEA compliance guidance, among other things, to address these  shortfalls. To date, DOD has yet to implement the recommendations.  However, DOD officials said the department has actions planned or  underway to address the recommendations but they were not able to  provide a date for when this would be completed.", "Economic viability analysis. For the investments under review, DOD  enterprise and the military departments used DOD\u2019s IT Investment Review  Process Guidance (dated January 2009) that specifies how investment  economic viability is to be analyzed and assessed. They also used a related  automated tool designed to support the development of such analyses.  Once the analyses had been performed, the precertification authorities for  each of the systems asserted that the efforts had been reviewed, and  showed the investments were economically justified to proceed with  obligating funds.", "For example, on the Logistics Modernization Program, Army used DOD\u2019s  guidance to conduct its economic viability analysis. The Army also used  the economic viability tool to complete the analysis. In addition, in  December 2010 memorandum, the Army\u2019s Chief Management Officer  asserted that the economic viability analysis had been completed, and  showed the investment was justified to proceed with obligating funds.", "In another example, on the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning system,  Navy used the January 2009 DOD guidance to comply with the economic  viability analysis requirement and used the economic viability tool to  complete the analysis. Further, in a July 2010 memo, the Navy\u2019s Chief  Management Officer asserted that the investment\u2019s economic viability  analysis had been completed, and showed the investment was justified to  obligate funds.", "Although DOD enterprise and the military departments took these steps to  justify the investments, they did not perform other key steps. Specifically,  DOD enterprise and the military departments did not use important cost  estimating practices critical to developing such analyses. For example, in  developing its economic justification for its ERP system, Navy did not  implement key aspects of earned value management or develop risk  mitigation strategies to address this risk. We have previously reported on  these weaknesses and made recommendations to address them. Although  the recommendations are still open, DOD enterprise and military  department officials have said they have actions planned and under way to  address the recommendations.

For the investments  under review, DOD enterprise and the military departments used DOD\u2019s  Business Process Reengineering Guidance (dated April 2011) to assess  whether the investments complied with the business process  reengineering requirement. Consistent with the guidance, DOD enterprise  and the military departments completed questionnaires (contained in the  guidance) that aim to help DOD enterprise and the military departments  identify and develop approaches to streamlining and improving existing  business processes. Once these assessments had been completed, the  DOD enterprise and military department precertification authorities  asserted that business process reengineering assessments had been  performed.", "For example, on the PMRT project, Air Force used the DOD reengineering  guidance to assess whether there were ways to streamline and improve  existing business processes to be supported by the system investment. Air  Force completed the assessment in July 2010. Air Force reported that as  part of this assessment, it had representatives from the offices of the CIO  and the Deputy Chief Management Officer review the completed  assessment questionnaire and supporting documentation to determine  whether the project team had followed the reengineering requirement.  Subsequently, in August 2010, the Air Force\u2019s Director of Business  Transformation and the Deputy Chief Management Officer used this  information to assert that sufficient business process reengineering had  been conducted in order for the program to obligate investment funding.", "While DOD enterprise and military department precertification authorities  largely followed DOD\u2019s guidance, they did not perform the key step of  validating the results of these reengineering assessments to ensure they,  among other things, accurately assessed process weaknesses and  identified opportunities to streamline and improve affected processes. We  have ongoing work on actions the Air Force and Army have taken to  comply with statutory requirements regarding business process  reengineering.", "The reason DOD did not follow key aspects of the certification process\u2014 primarily not validating assessment results\u2014is attributed in part to  unclear roles and responsibilities. According to military department  officials responsible for the investments we reviewed, validation activities  did not occur because DOD policy and guidance does not explicitly require  them to be performed and there is no guidance that specifies how  assessments should be validated. According to DOD officials, the oversight  and designated approval authorities did not validate the DOD enterprise- level assessments and assertions because DOD policy and guidance has  not yet been revised to require these authorities to do so. Consequently,  until the policy and guidance is updated and roles and responsibilities with  regard to who is to perform validation functions are clearly defined, there  is an increased risk that DOD will be making business system investment  decisions based on information that is inaccurate and unreliable.", "For the investments under review, DOD largely followed its oversight  process but did not perform an important validation activity. Specifically,  DOD\u2019s oversight process (as specified in the January 2009 Investment  Review Guide) calls for investments to be reviewed annually to assess  how each is performing. As part of this process, the IRBs assess program  performance relative to, among other things, cost, schedule, and capability  commitments. The IRBs do this using updated information provided by the  programs and screened by DOD enterprise and military department  precertification authorities for completeness. These oversight reviews are  important because an investment board should have visibility into each  project\u2019s performance and progress toward predefined cost, schedule, and  benefit expectations as well as each project\u2019s exposure to risk. Without  such visibility and validated information, organizations risk making  investment decisions that are inconsistent and are not fully grounded in  reliable and accurate data.", "Consistent with this direction, DOD conducted (or is planning to conduct)  annual reviews for the investments we reviewed. For example, DOD  conducted annual reviews for the Defense Travel System in December  2010 and the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning system in July 2010. In  doing these reviews, DOD assessed investment performance using the  cost, schedule, and performance information provided by the programs  and screened by precertification authorities.", "Although DOD largely followed its oversight process, it did not validate  the cost, schedule, and performance information used for decision  making.

Such visibility is  important because DOD reports that only 100 of approximately 2,258 total  business systems are annually reviewed by the IRBs. This means that the  vast majority of business systems are overseen only within the military  departments. Accordingly, we have made recommendations to address  this area. DOD officials said they plan to address the recommendations but  were unable to provide a schedule for when this work is to be completed.", "In explaining why the information used by the IRBs is not validated, DOD  officials cited the same reasons\u2014outdated policy and guidance and  unclear roles and responsibilities\u2014as those provided for the lack of  validation in the investment certification process.

In this  regard, each of the military departments has made progress in managing  its respective architecture program, but there are still limitations in the  scope and completeness, as well as the immaturity of the military  department architecture programs, including the completeness of their  own transition plans.

(See the background section of this report for additional  information on the act\u2019s requirements.) Our methodology relative to each  of these four provisions is as follows:    To address the architecture and transition plan provision, we focused on  the progress the departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy have made  in developing their respective parts of the federated DOD business  enterprise architecture. In doing so, we compared the baseline enterprise  architecture program status information as presented in our 2008 report,  with information on the current status of each military department\u2019s  enterprise architecture program. In doing so, we focused on those select  elements that were either similar or slightly modified across versions 1.1  and 2.0 of our Enterprise Architecture Management Maturity  Framework  and that were either partially or not satisfied by one or more  of the military departments. Specifically, we reviewed written responses  and supporting documentation on steps completed, under way, or planned  from each military department to identify examples of progress made in  addressing those elements that we had previously identified as being not  satisfied or partially satisfied. We also reviewed business architectural  artifacts to determine the progress each department had made in  developing their respective business architectural content since we last  reported in 2008. We interviewed cognizant DOD officials to validate the  responses and identify any discrepancies.

We also compared  information contained in the department\u2019s system that is used to prepare  its budget submission (SNAP-IT) with information in DOD\u2019s Defense  Information Technology Portfolio Repository (DITPR) system to  determine if DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget request included all business  systems. We interviewed Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and  Information Integration/Department of Defense Chief Information Officer  officials to discuss the accuracy and comprehensiveness of information  contained in the SNAP-IT system, the discrepancies in the information  contained in the DITPR and SNAP-IT systems, and efforts under way or  planned to address these discrepancies. We did not independently validate  the reliability of the cost and budget figures provided by DOD because the  specific amounts were not relevant to our findings.", "To assess the establishment of DOD enterprise and component investment  management structures and processes, we analyzed whether DOD and its  military departments\u2019 information technology investment management  processes were compliant with federal guidance and the extent to which  DOD and the military departments were following their investment  management processes, including those at the DOD enterprise-level for  approving and certifying investments. To perform the first task, we  compared the status of DOD enterprise and military department (Air  Force, Army, and Navy) investment management processes\u2014as noted in  our May 2009 report and other sources\u2014with the current status of these  organization\u2019s processes.

In  reviewing these investments, we focused on DOD enterprise and military  department activities related to certification and oversight, which are a  key part of selecting, managing, and overseeing IT investments as called  for in our ITIM framework and DOD guidance. For certification, we  reviewed DOD Investment Review Board guidance to understand the types  of actions related to the certification of business system modernizations  and, in doing so, focused on three certification requirements (e.g.,  ensuring that designated approval authorities assert that each investment  is compliant with the business enterprise architecture). For each  requirement, we reviewed supporting documentation from DOD enterprise  and the military departments to determine whether there was a  documented process for how the requirement was to be certified and to  ascertain whether artifacts prepared as part of the process demonstrated  that the certification process was being followed. We did the same for the  oversight process. When there were variances between the criteria and  what DOD enterprise and the military departments had done, we  interviewed cognizant DOD enterprise-level and military department-level  officials on the causes and impacts.", "To determine whether the department was certifying and approving  business system investments with annual obligations exceeding $1 million,  we reviewed and analyzed all Defense Business Systems Management  Committee certification approval memoranda as well as IRB certification  memoranda issued prior to the Defense Business Systems Management  Committee\u2019s final approval decisions for fiscal year 2010 and compared  the results to those certification actions described in the annual report to  identify differences.
