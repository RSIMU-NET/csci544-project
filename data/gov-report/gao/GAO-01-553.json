In previous work we performed for the Subcommittee on Water and Power, House Committee on Resources, pertaining to the Bureau\u2019s operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, we identified concerns among some CVP water customers that the amounts they were charged for water marketing were excessive, and that the reasons for the increased costs were unclear to them.", "To follow-up on that work, you asked us to review the CVP water marketing activities and costs in more detail. Specifically, you asked us to provide information concerning (1) the activities and costs that comprise water marketing, (2) the trend in associated costs, (3) the legal basis for charging the costs of water marketing activities to water customers, and (4) the type of information about water marketing activities provided to water customers and ways to improve the information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation constructs and operates water resource projects to provide water to arid lands in 17 western states. Construction, operation, and maintenance of these projects are financed primarily with federal funds. The Bureau provides water for irrigation purposes to state-established water and irrigation districts that obtain the water under contracts and distribute it to farmers. The Bureau also provides water for M&I, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and power generation purposes. Through water service or repayment contracts, the Bureau, over time, recoups a portion of the federal government\u2019s costs of providing the water. These contracts provide for both the repayment of construction costs and O&M costs allocated to water supply.", "The Bureau\u2019s costs of constructing, operating, and maintaining its projects are classified as either reimbursable or nonreimbursable. Reimbursable costs are recovered from customers; nonreimbursable costs are borne by the federal government. Generally, costs associated with supplying water for agriculture, M&I, and hydroelectric generation purposes are reimbursable. Costs related to flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife enhancement generally are nonreimbursable. While the Bureau recovers costs from water customers through rates, cost recovery for power generation is done by the Department of Energy\u2019s Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs).", "Water marketing costs are charged to customers as part of the Bureau\u2019s total O&M costs. The Bureau defined the O&M activities associated with its projects in a 1998 report to Congress by describing its complex mission and by providing examples of the widely varied activities it conducts. The report stated that the Bureau is \u201cresponsible for the O&M of an extensive infrastructure of constructed facilities, including diversion and storage dams, pumping plants, powerplants, canals and laterals, pipelines, and drains.\u201d Further, it said that the Bureau is \u201calso responsible for management of the federally owned lands on which these facilities are located and for the natural and cultural resources of those lands.\u201d The water marketing component of the Bureau\u2019s O&M reflects this diversity. Water marketing costs are the result of many different distinct activities.", "The CVP, located in California\u2019s Central Valley Basin, is the one of the Bureau\u2019s largest multiple purpose water projects. The CVP is technologically complex, consisting of numerous dams, reservoirs, canals, and pumping and power-generating facilities. Historically the CVP has provided about 6 million acre-feet of irrigation water each year to approximately 3.8 million acres of cropland. Water used for irrigation purposes represents about 85 percent of the total water available through CVP; the remainder is used for M&I, fish and wildlife, and recreation. CVP water is also used to generate power.", "The Bureau enters into contracts to provide water to irrigation and M&I customers. These contracts establish a rate for each acre-foot of water with the intent to recover the CVP construction costs allocated to water supply as well as the annual O&M costs. The Bureau annually sets rates for both M&I and irrigation water customers. The rate depends upon the extent and type of services provided to the customer by the Bureau, and consists of a number of rate components (or cost pools) which correspond to the water services provided. The rate components generally are   water storage: the cost of facilities (primarily dams and reservoirs) associated with the collection and storage of water; and   water marketing: the costs incurred for monitoring, administering, and negotiating water service contracts; record-keeping and accounting; developing annual water rates; conducting environmental studies; and performing other related activities.", "Other costs involved in delivering water to customers include conveyance (associated with facilities such as canals used for transporting water), conveyance pumping (associated with facilities such as pumping plants used to pump water through the project to more than one customer), and direct pumping (associated with plants that pump water exclusively for specific customers). \u201cProject Use Energy\u201d costs are primarily associated with conveyance pumping and direct pumping. Direct pumping costs are paid by customers through the direct pumping rate component charged by the Bureau. Since fiscal year 1998, conveyance and conveyance pumping costs are typically not charged to customers through O&M rates, but instead are direct billed to those customers using these services. As a result, these costs are not included in our analyses of water marketing costs and their impact on O&M costs.", "The Bureau sets rates based on projected water deliveries and estimated costs. Typically, the Bureau uses its budget request data in determining its estimated costs. After allocating the total estimated costs to irrigation, M&I, and the other uses, the O&M rate for each component is then calculated by dividing the component\u2019s estimated total annual cost by the applicable estimated water deliveries. After the actual water deliveries and the Bureau\u2019s actual costs have been determined, the customers\u2019 payments are applied against the Bureau\u2019s costs as specified by the CVP ratesetting policies. The Bureau\u2019s budget, ratesetting process, and application of payments are graphically depicted in appendix II.", "In recent years, some Bureau irrigation and M&I water customers have raised concerns about O&M rates charged for CVP water. The rates have been increasing faster than inflation, and the customers have expressed concern about the impact of these costs on their businesses. The rate component causing much of their concern relates to activities categorized by the Bureau as \u201cwater marketing.\u201d The water marketing component of rates has increased significantly over the past decade and CVP customers have voiced concern, saying that they do not understand the underlying reasons for the increases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, And Methodology", "paragraphs": ["For each of the four objectives of this report, we were asked to address specific issues.", "Regarding the activities and costs that comprise water marketing, we were asked to (1) determine the general types of activities that were historically categorized as water marketing, compared to the types of activities categorized as water marketing today; and (2) provide detailed information on water marketing activities and costs for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 and obtain the projections for future years, if available.", "Regarding the trend in water marketing costs, we were asked to determine annual increases or decreases in the water marketing component of rates charged under water service contracts for fiscal years 1990 through 2000, and identify reasons for any significant trends.", "Regarding the legal basis for these costs, we were asked to determine the Bureau\u2019s legal basis for charging the costs of water marketing activities to water customers.", "Regarding the information provided to water customers, we were asked to determine generally what information is provided to customers about water marketing activities and costs, including information pertaining to fiscal year 2000 and any projections for future years. We were also asked to identify options that would enable the Bureau to provide customers with better information.", "To determine the activities and costs that comprise water marketing and determine the trend in water marketing costs (objectives 1 and 2), we reviewed and analyzed various Bureau documents. We analyzed historical water ratesetting books showing budgeted amounts for fiscal years 1990- 2001, actual water marketing amounts for fiscal years 1992-1999, ratesetting policy manuals, and Mid-Pacific Region files pertaining to water marketing activities at CVP. We also interviewed Mid-Pacific Region officials.", "To determine the legal basis for charging the costs of water marketing activities to water customers (objective 3), we analyzed Reclamation law, project-specific legislation, and authorizing legislation applicable to selected activities. We also reviewed Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-25 and federal accounting standards for federal guidance as to what constitutes the full cost of an agency\u2019s provision of goods and services.", "To determine the information provided to water customers, and identify options for improving it (objective 4), we analyzed examples of documents provided to customers and reports prepared by customer groups. We also interviewed Bureau officials and representatives of CVP water customers.", "We conducted our review from June 2000 to March 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We performed audit work at the Bureau\u2019s Mid-Pacific region, which manages and operates CVP. We also interviewed officials from the CVP Water Association, which represents customers of CVP. We did not verify the accuracy of all the data we obtained and used in our analyses. Most of the data presented in this report relate to budget projections; it was beyond the scope of the assignment to verify linkage of budget data to the audited financial statements. We have considered written comments from the Department of the Interior and revised our report, as appropriate. The department\u2019s comments are reproduced as appendix III. The department also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate but did not reproduce. Appendix I describes our objectives, scope, and methodology in detail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Marketing Includes Two General Categories Of Activities", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis concluded that CVP water marketing costs stem from two general categories of activities: system-wide activities and contract administration activities. Water marketing traditionally consisted of contract administration activities but the category has grown to include a variety of others, as represented by the system-wide category.", "System-wide activities are categorized as \u201cwater marketing\u201d in order to be \u201cspread\u201d to all customers for repayment. Some system-wide costs arise as new mandates are passed that the Bureau must implement, such as costs stemming from the CVP Improvement Act (CVPIA), which was passed in 1992. Other system-wide costs, such as those classified as general expense, have been reclassified as water marketing to assure that each CVP customer pays a proportionate share of the cost involved. In addition, some water conservation costs, which the Bureau had previously treated as nonreimbursable, have been reclassified as water marketing and charged to water customers. As shown later, when comparing the amount paid for water marketing in fiscal year 1996 to the amount paid in fiscal year 2001, the general expense reclassification accounted for about 12 percent of the total increase for irrigation customers and about 15 percent of the increase for M&I customers. Similarly, the reclassification of water conservation costs accounted for about 11 percent of the total increase in the water marketing rate component for irrigation customers and about 12 percent of the increase for M&I customers.", "Contract administration activities, according to Bureau officials, can be considered to be \u201ctraditional\u201d water marketing activities. These include the recurring activities involved in managing the terms of the Bureau\u2019s contracts with its customers, such as costs incurred for monitoring, administering, and negotiating water service contracts, maintaining water delivery and payment records, accounting for the annual financial results of CVP water operations, and developing annual water rates. Since 1995, the Bureau has also been incurring significant contract renewal costs as the long-term contracts held with customers expire.", "The Bureau allocates the costs of system-wide and contract administration water marketing activities into several sub-categories. The sub-categories relate to:   programs, such as water quality monitoring, water conservation, and hazardous materials management; legislation, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Endangered Species Act (ESA), and CVPIA;   CVP divisions or offices, such as water and power operations, water and land resources management, and general contract administration and contract renewal; and   project-wide activities, such as those included in the miscellaneous project, CVP-wide, and general expense sub-categories.", "Table 1 shows examples of specific activities associated with each category and sub-category."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Marketing O&M Rate Component Has Increased Significantly", "paragraphs": ["The water marketing component of O&M rates has been increasing steadily since 1989 for both irrigation and M&I customers, with significant increases since 1995. The increases are due to rising costs in both the system-wide and contract administration categories. As a result, water marketing costs currently make up the largest share of CVP\u2019s O&M rates.", "Figure 1 shows that the water marketing component of rates has been increasing for both irrigation and M&I customers. As the figure shows, the rate for irrigation customers increased from $.20 per acre-foot in 1989 to $6.91 per acre-foot in 2001. M&I customers experienced a similar increase\u2014from $.21 per acre-foot in 1989 to $7.00 per acre-foot in 2001.", "Since fiscal year 1998, the total O&M rate has typically been comprised of the water marketing and storage rate components. Figure 2 compares the water marketing and storage rate components for irrigation. As figure 2 shows, while both water marketing and storage rate components have increased for irrigation customers since 1989, water marketing has overtaken storage to become the largest rate component. Water marketing comprised about 11 percent of the combined total of the water marketing and storage rate components in 1989 and about 62 percent in 2001. For M&I customers, water marketing comprised about 12 percent of the combined total of the water marketing and storage rate components in 1989 and 61 percent in 2001.", "The trend in inflation-adjusted dollars is similar to that in nominal dollars. As shown in figure 3, water marketing and storage costs have increased and water marketing has become the largest rate component. Converting the nominal dollars into constant year 2000 dollars shows that the irrigation water marketing rate ranged from $.26 in 1989 to $6.17 in 2000, and the storage rate from $2.17 per acre-foot in 1989 to $4.27 per acre-foot in 2000. The total inflation-adjusted irrigation O&M rate (water marketing plus storage) would have ranged from $2.43 per acre-foot in 1989 to $10.44 in 2000.", "To demonstrate more specifically which categories and sub-categories of water marketing contributed most to cost increases, we reviewed in detail the costs for irrigation and M&I users for fiscal years 1996 and 2001.Tables 2 and 3 show the costs of irrigation and M&I-related water marketing activities for fiscal years 1996 and 2001 and the amount of change over that period of time.", "As shown in tables 2 and 3, both categories of costs\u2014system-wide and contract administration\u2014have contributed to the increase in irrigation and M&I water marketing costs since 1996. The costs related to system-wide activities have been the primary driver of the water marketing cost increases, rising from $5.3 million in 1996 to $16.6 million in 2001 for irrigation, and from $.9 million in 1996 to $2.3 million in 2001 for M&I.", "A wide range of activities have contributed to the overall increase in water marketing costs over time, and the mix of activities responsible for the increase differs from year to year. However, certain activities resulted in significant costs over the 1996-2001 time period. These include the costs within both the system-wide and contract administration categories, such as the costs of new technology; costs associated with contract renewals; costs of environmental assessments; and new or increased emphasis on initiatives such as water conservation and water quality monitoring.", "Costs classified as general expenses have also contributed to the water marketing increase. As discussed previously, general expenses involve a variety of project-wide costs that, until fiscal year 2000, had been allocated to other rate components such as water storage. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, general expenses have been included in the water marketing rate calculation and recovered from all customers. The effect of this reclassification of general expenses to water marketing is shown in tables 2 and 3. When comparing the amount paid for water marketing in fiscal year 1996 to the amount paid in fiscal year 2001, the general expense reclassification accounted for $1.65 million of the $13.66 million (about 12 percent) of the total increase in water marketing costs for irrigation customers. Similarly, the general expense reclassification accounted for $234,000 of the $1.52 million (about 15 percent) of the total increase in water marketing costs for M&I customers.", "In addition, in fiscal year 1999 the Bureau reclassified water conservation costs to water marketing and began to recover them through rates charged to water customers. These costs had previously been classified as nonreimbursable and therefore had not been recovered. The effect of this reclassification of water conservation to water marketing is shown in tables 2 and 3. When comparing the amount paid for water marketing in fiscal year 1996 to the amount paid in fiscal year 2001, the water conservation reclassification accounted for $1.50 million of the $13.66 million (about 11 percent) increase in water marketing costs for irrigation customers. Similarly, the water conservation reclassification accounted for $181,000 of the $1.52 million (about 12 percent) increase in water marketing costs for M&I customers.", "Combined, the reclassification of general expense and water conservation accounted for $3.15 million of the $13.66 million (about 23 percent) increase in water marketing costs for irrigation customers when comparing fiscal year 1996 to fiscal year 2001.
